                <p><label type="entry">PICTS</label>, the name of one of those nations who anciently
                    possessed the north of Britain. It is believed by some writers that they were so
                    called from their custom of painting their bodies; an opinion which Camden
                    supports with considerable erudition. It is certainly liable, however, to many
                    objections; for as this custom prevailed amongst the other ancient inhabitants
                    of Britain, who used the <hi rend="italic">glastum</hi> of Pliny and the <hi
                    rend="italic">vitrum</hi> of Mela for the same purpose, it may be asked why the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Pieti</hi> was confined by the Romans to only one
                    tribe, when it was equally applicable to many others? Why should they designate
                    them only by an epithet, without ever annexing their proper name; or why should
                    they impose a new name upon this people alone, when they gave their proper names
                    to all the other tribes which they had occasion to speak of? As these questions
                    cannot be answered in any satisfactory manner, it is plain that we must look for
                    some other derivation of the name.</p>

                <p>The Highlanders of Scotland express the name of this once famous nation by the
                    term <hi rend="italic">Pictich</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a word familiar to
                    the ears of the most illiterate, who could never have derived it from the Roman
                    authors. But the word <hi rend="italic">Pictich</hi> signifies <hi rend="italic"
                    >pilferers</hi> or <hi rend="italic">plunderers</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    the appellation was probably imposed upon this people by their neighbours, or
                    assumed by themselves, some time after the reign of Caracalla, when the
                    unguarded state of the Roman province, on which they bordered, afforded them
                    frequent opportunities of making incursions, and committing depredations
                    therein. Accordingly the name appears to have been unknown until the end of the
                    third century. Eumenius the Panegyrist is the first Roman author who mentions
                    this people under their new name of <hi rend="italic">Pictich,</hi> or, with a
                    Latin termination, <hi rend="italic">Picti.</hi> But when we say that this name
                    may have probably been assumed for the reason just now mentioned, we must
                    observe, that, in those days of violence, the character of robber was not
                    attended with any disgrace. If a person of this description had the address to
                    lay his schemes well, and to execute them successfully, he was rather praised
                    than blamed for his conduct, providing he made no encroachments upon the
                    property of his own tribe, or that of any of its allies. Nor is this any
                    peculiar stigma upon the Picts; for other nations of antiquity, in the same rude
                    state, thought and acted as they did in such circumstances.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Thucydides, lib. iii. p. 3; and Virgil,
                    Aeu. vii. 745 and 749.</p></note></p>
                <p>Concerning the origin of the Picts, authors are very much divided in opinion.
                    Boethius derives them from the Aga-thyrsians, Pomponius Laetus from the Germans,
                    Bede from the Scythians, Camden and Father Innes from the ancient Britons,
                    Stillingfleet from a people inhabiting the Cimbrica Chersonesus, and . Keating
                    and O’Flaherty, on the authority of the Cashel Psalter, from the Thracians. But
                    the most probable opinion is, that they were the descendants of the ancient
                    Caledonians. Several very cogent reasons have been urged in support of this
                    opinion by Pinkerton and others; and the words of Eumenius, “Caledonum, <hi
                    rend="italic">aliorumque</hi> Pictorum, silvas,” plainly imply that the Picts
                    and Caledonians were one and the same people. But the question arises here, Of
                    what race were the ancient Caledonians? Were they of Celtic origin, or were they
                    of northern or Scythian descent, a branch of that great family which everywhere
                    overran and occupied the territories possessed by the Celts? Each of these
                    opinions has found its advocates, and has been supported by much erudition and
                    ingenuity; but, without entering into the discussion of a subject so little
                    interesting to the generality of readers, it may be sufficient to state, that
                    the preponderance of evidence and authority is clearly in favour of •the latter
                    hypothesis, which Pinkerton has rendered as clear as any matter of this kind can
                    be expected to be made. ∙</p>
                <p>As there has been great difference of opinion about the origin of the Picts, so
                    there has likewise been much dispute about their language. There are several
                    reasons which, according to some, make it plain that their tongue was the Gaelic
                    or Celtic; and these reasons are considered as a further confirmation of their
                    having been of Caledonian origin. Through the eastern and north-eastern coasts
                    of Scotland, which were possessed by the Picts, we meet with an innumerable list
                    of names of places, rivers, mountains, and other natural objects, which, it is
                    said, are manifestly Gaelic. From a very old register of the priory of St
                    Andrews,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dalrymple’s
                    Collections, p. 122.</p></note> it appears, that in the days of Hungus, the last
                    Pictish king of that name, St Andrews was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muk-ross</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that the town now called <hi
                    rend="italic">Queensferry</hi> had then the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ardcliinneachan.</hi> But both these words are claimed as Gaelic. The former,
                    we are told, signifies the heath or promontory of boars; and the latter, the
                    height or peninsula of Kenneth. In the list of Pictish kings published by Father
                    Innes, most of the names are apparently Gaelic, and in many instances the same
                    with the names in the list of Scottish or Caledonian kings published by the same
                    author. But Innes understood nothing of that language, and certainly his
                    nomenclature is as little to be relied on as some of his etymologies. Besides,
                    he forgets that the predominance of the Celts at a period long anterior to the
                    settlement of the Picts, and the traces of their language still to be found in
                    the names of places and natural objects, are points which, as far as we know,
                    have never been seriously disputed. This, however, does not prove that the Picts
                    were a branch of the great Celtic family, and there is no good evidence to show
                    that they ever spoke the language of that people. On the contrary, it seems
                    highly probable that they were of German or Scandinavian origin; and although
                    almost no remains of their language now exist, it may be proved negatively, as
                    indeed Pinkerton has done, that it could not have been Celtic.</p>
                <p>The Picts of the earliest ages, as appears from the joint testimony of all
                    writers who have examined the subject, possessed only the eastern and
                    north-eastern coast of Scotland. On one side, the ancient Drumalbin, or that
                    ridge of mountains reaching from Lochlomond, near Dumbarton, to the Moray Frith,
                    was the boundary of the Pictish dominions. Accordingly we find in the life of St
                    Columba, that, in journeying to the palace of Brudius, king of the Picts, he
                    travelled over Drumalbin, the <hi rend="italic">Dorsum Britan-ìiiae</hi> of
                    Adomnan. On the other side, the territory of the Picts was bounded by the Roman
                    province. After Britain was abandoned by the Emperor Honorius, the Picts and the
                    Saxons were by turns masters of those countries which lie between the Frith of
                    Forth and the river Tweed. We learn from Bede, that when he finished his
                    Ecclesiastical History, the Saxons were masters of Galloway. The Picts, however,
                    soon afterwards made a conquest of that country; so that, before the extinction
                    of their monarchy, all the territories bounded on the one side by the Forth and
                    the Clyde, and on the other by the Tweed and the Solway Frith, fell into their
                    hands.</p>
                <p>The history of the Picts, as well as that of all the other ancient inhabitants of
                    Britain, is involved in great obscurity. The Irish historians give us a long
                    list of Pictish kings, who reigned over Pictavia for the space of twelve or
                    thirteen centuries before the Christian era. After them, Innes, in his Critical
                    Essay, gives us a list of above fifty, of whom no less than five are said to
                    have swayed the sceptre, each for a whole century. It is probable that these
                    writers confounded the history of the Picts with that of their ancestors the
                    ancient Caledonians. In any other view, their accounts of this people are highly
                    fabulous, and undeserving of serious attention. The Picts, as has already been
                    observed, were probably not known by that name before the third century; at
                    least the first mention of them is made by Eumcnius the Panegyrist, in the
                    passage already referred to. Further, Adomnan, abbot of Iona, is the first
                    author who expressly mentions any Pictish king; and the next after him is the
                    Venerable Bedc. We are informed by these two writers that St Columba converted
                    Brudius, king of the Picts, to the Christian faith. But St Columba landed in
                    Britain in the year of our era 565. Before that period we have no general record
                    from which to ascertain so much as the name of any Pictish king. The history of
                    <hi rend="italic">Drust</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Drost,</hi> who is said to
                    have reigned over the Picts in the beginning of the fifth century, when St
                    Ninian first preached the gospel to that nation, has all the appearance <pb

                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to Camden, this
                    conversion happened about the year G30, in the southern Pictish provinces;

                    Columba.</p></note> His having reigned a hundred years, and his putting an end
                    to a hundred wars, are stories which exceed all the bounds of probability.</p>
                <p>Brudius, the contemporary of St Columba, is therefore the first Pictish king
                    mentioned by any writer of authority. But what figure his ancestors made, or who
                    Were his successors on the throne of Pictavia, cannot be ascertained. Bede
                    informs us, that, during the reign of one of them, the Picts killed in battle
                    Egfred, king of Northumberland, and destroyed, the greater part of his army. The
                    same author mentions another of their kings called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naitan,</hi> for whom he had a particular regard. It was to this Naitan that
                    Ceolfrid, abbot of Wiremouth, wrote his famous letter concerning Easter and the
                    Tonsure;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We are told by
                    some authors that St Columba taught the Piets to celebrate Easter always on a
                    Sunday between the 14,tħ and 20th of March, and to observe a different method of
                    tonsure from the Romans, leaving an imperfect appearance of a crown. This
                    occasioned much dispute, till Naitan at length brought his subjects to the
                    Catholic rule. In that age many of the Picts went on a pilgrimage to Rome,
                    according to the custom of the times; and amongst the rest we find two persons
                    mentioned in the Antiquities of St Peter’s Church. Αι∙ ierius&gt; count of the
                    Picts, and Syra, with Some of his countrymen, performed their vōw.</p></note> a
                    letter in which Bede himself is supposed to have had a principal hand. Roger
                    Hoveden and Simon of Durham mention two other Pictish kings, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Onnust</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kinoth</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                    former of whom died in 761, whilst the latter flourished about the year 744, and
                    gave an asylum to Alfred of Northumberland, who about that time was expelled
                    from his kingdom. The accounts given by the Scottish historians, of several
                    other Pictish kings, cannot be depended on; nor are the stories told by the
                    British historians, Geoffroy of Monmouth and the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eulogium Britanniae,</hi> worthy of much greater credit.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of the ninth century, the Pictish nation was totally subdued
                    by, or rather amalgamated with, the Scots, in the reign of Kenneth' Macalpin.
                    Since that time their name has been lost in that of the conquerors, with whom
                    they were incorporated; but they seem to have been treated by the Scottish kings
                    with great lenity, so that for some ages afterwards they commanded great
                    respect. The prior of Hogulstead, an old English historian, relates, that they
                    made a considerable figure in the army of David the Saint, in his disputes with
                    Stephen the king of England. In a battle fought in the year 1136, by the English
                    on one side, and the Scots and Picts on the other, the latter insisted on their
                    hereditary right of leading the van of the Scottish army, and were indulged in
                    that demand by the king.</p>
                <p>The principal seat of the Pictish kings was at Abernethy. Brudius, however, as
                    appears from the accounts given by Adomnan, in his life of St Columba, had a
                    palace at Inverness, which was probably near the extremity of his territory in
                    that quarter; for there is no good reason to believe, with Camden, that this
                    king had any property in the Western Isles, or that he made a gift of Iona to St
                    Columba when he visited the saint in that island.</p>
                <p>With respect to the manners and customs of the Picts, there is no reason to
                    suppose that they were any other than those of the ancient Caledonians, of which
                    many particulars are related by the Greek and Roman writers who have occasion to
                    speak of those nations. Upon the decline of the Roman empire, cohorts of
                    barbarians were raised, and Picts were invited to enter the service by Honorius;
                    and when peace was everywhere restored, they were named <hi rend="italic"
                    >Honoriaci.</hi> Those of them who served under Constantine opened the passes of
                    the Pyrenean mountains, and let the barbarous nations into Spain. From this
                    period may be dated the civilization of their manners, which happened after they
                    had, first by themselves, and afterwards with the assistance of the Scots,
                    ravaged the Roman province. This brought them in contact with civilization, and
                    they profited by the collision.</p>

                    in person into Britain, built it of solid stone. This wall, part of which still
                    remains, began at the entrance of the Solway Frith, in Cumberland, and running
