                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PELLETIER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Bertrand</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated chemical philosopher, was born at Bayonne in the year 1761. He very
                    soon discovered a strong predilection for the sciences, to cherish which he had
                    every thing in his father’s house that could reasonably be desired, and there
                    acquired the elements of that art for which he was afterwards so famous. His
                    subsequent progress took place under Darcet, who admitted him amongst the pupils
                    attached to the chemical laboratory of France. Five years of intense application
                    under such a master gave him a stock of knowledge very uncommon at his years. As
                    a convincing proof of this, when only twenty-one years of age, he published a
                    number of valuable observations on arsenic acid; proving, contrary to the
                    opinion of Macquer, that sulphuric acid distilled from the arseniate of potash
                    disengages the acid of arsenic.</p>
                <p>Encouraged by the success which had attended his first chemical labours, he
                    communicated his remarks on the crystallization of sulphur, cinnabar, and the
                    deliquescent salts; as also the examination of zeolites, particularly the false
                    zeolite of Freyburg, which he discovered to be merely an ore of zinc. He
                    likewise made observations on the oxygenated muriatic acid, in reference to the
                    absorption of oxygen; on the formation of other acids, chiefly the muriatic and
                    the acetous; and a number of memoirs on the operation of phosphorus made in the
                    large way, its conversion into phosphoric acid, and its combination with sulphur
                    and most metallic substances.</p>
                <p>It was by his operations on phosphorus that he burned himself so severely as
                    nearly to endanger his life. Immediately on his recovery he began the analysis
                    of different varieties of plumbago from France, England, Germany, Spain, and
                    America, and gave both novelty and interest <pb break="no" facs="nls:193493453"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-3453-0182"/>to his work, even after the labours of Scheele on
                    the same subject had made their appearance. The analysis of carbonate of barytes
                    led him to make experiments upon animals, from which he discovered that this
                    earth is a real poison, in whatever way it be administered. Strontites was also
                    analysed by this celebrated chemist, and found to contain a new earth.</p>
                <p>Pelletier discovered a process for preparing verditer in the large way, equal, it
                    is said, in beauty to that which is manufactured in England. He was likewise
                    amongst the first who showed the possibility of refining bell-metal, and
                    separating the tin. His first experiments were performed at Paris, after which
                    he went to the foundery at Romilly to prove their accuracy in the large way. He
                    was soon after this admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, and
                    subsequently accompanied Borda and General Daboville to La Fère, to assist in
                    experiments upon a new species of gunpowder. Being obliged to pass great part of
                    the day in the open air during a cold and moist season, in order to render his
                    experiments more decisive, his health, which was naturally delicate, became very
                    much impaired. He partly recovered it, but again fell a victim to his thirst of
                    knowledge; for he was at one time nearly destroyed by inspiring the oxygenated
                    muriatic acid gas, which occasioned a convulsive asthma, that at times appeared
                    to abate, but was found to be incurable. The assistance of art was insufficient
                    to save him, and he died at Paris on the 21st of July 1797, of a pulmonary
                    consumption, in the flower of his age, being only thirty-six.</p>
