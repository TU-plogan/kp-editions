                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PARANA</label>, a vast river of South America, originating in
                    those mountainous ranges which traverse the Brazilian provinces of Minas Geraes
                    and Goyas. Like the Paraguay, it is formed of a great number of small streams,
                    the sources of which extend over several degrees, probably from the sixteenth to
                    the twentieth of south latitude. Before the Parana reaches the parallel of south
                    latitude under which the Paraguay commences, it has drained an immense tract of
                    country, and become swelled to a mighty stream. About this point, which is the
                    verge of the great table-land which forms the inner part of Brazil, it tumbles
                    over a precipitous rocky channel, at a place called Setequedas, or Seven Falls.
                    Some have spoken of a continued rapid and broken advance of the river for
                    several leagues; but Cazal, a high authority, represents it as here narrowed
                    from a league in breadth to a hundred yards, by six small rocky islands, between
                    which the water rushes, foams, and falls. But the hundred yards mentioned must
                    refer only to the breadth of that part of the river which is wholly
                    uninterrupted by the islands; between all of them various minor currents must of
                    course flow, and these are certainly not included in the statement of the width
                    of the Parana at this part. Azara describes these stupendous cataracts under
                    another name. The first, called Sant de Canendigu, which was the name of a
                    cacique who inhabited this part of the country at the time of the coñquest, and
                    Sant de Guayra, from the vicinity of the province of that name, is situated not
                    far from the tropic of Capricon, in 24. 4. 27. of south latitude. It is a
                    frightful cascade, and worthy of being described by the poets. Immediately
                    before this immense river falls over the precipice, or rather inclined plane, it
                    is suddenly contracted from above two hundred toises to about thirty toises in
                    breadth, and descends into the frowning abyss with frightful fury, causing the
                    solid earth to tremble around. The fall is not vertical, but at an angle of
                    fifty degrees, the perpendicular descent being fifty-two French feet. The
                    vapours which rise from the shock of the waters, and the pointed rocks situated
                    in the channel of the precipice, are seen at the distance of many leagues, in
                    the form of columns. Rainbows of the most lively colours, formed by the rays of
                    the sun, appear suspended over the cataract; and in these a quivering movement
                    may be perceived. The sound is heard at the distance of six leagues; and the
                    clouds which are formed by the ascending vapours form an eternal rain in the
                    vicinity. There are other cataracts either belonging to the Parana or its
                    tributaries, but they are not of such magnitude as the Setequedas. The general
                    bearing of the Parana, in by far the greater part of its course, is southerly.
                    About the twenty-seventh parallel it takes a westerly direction, in which it
                    continues to flow until its junction with the Paraguay. Not far from the point
                    where it takes a great bend from southwest to nearly due west, it meets with a
                    rocky edge, over which it is precipitated at the island of Apipé, and here
                    navigation for large vessels terminates. But when the waters are large, the
                    passage is free for galliotes and small craft. Near this is the lake. Ibera or
                    Ybyera, one of the most considerable in the country, and which, like the Xarayes
                    of Paraguay, is said to be formed by the water of the upper part of the Parana.
                    Azara, however, asserts that it has no connection with that river. It is thirty
                    leagues in breadth at its northern extremity, where it is parallel with the
                    Parana, and to which it is very near, though without having any visible
                    communication with that river. Thirty leagues to the south, there is formed what
                    has been called the Gorge of Yuquicua; after which it again enlarges in
                    proportion as it advances southward, until it terminates by forming the river
                    Miriñay, which is considerable, and flows into the Uruguay. From Yuquicua the
                    lake Ybyera also stretches thirty leagues to the west, and there three rivers
                    issue from it, called the Saint Lucie, the Corrientes, and the Bateles. It has
                    no apparent source, receiving neither river nor rivulet, and continues during
                    the year almost without any variation, being filled with aquatic plants, and
                    even with some trees. A great part of it must therefore partake more of the
                    character of a marsh than a lake; and it is to be observed that several recent
                    authorities maintain that it is connected with the river Parana, and follows the
                    rise and fall of its waters. “In the dry season,” says Luccock, “it covers an
                    extent of about a hundred and fifty square leagues, and all around the land
                    supplies an abundance of food for cattle; but about a month after the rains have
                    commenced in the upper country, that is, in December, the Ybyera swells to a
                    vast extent, covering hardly less than two thousand square leagues. At this
                    period it is said to communicate both with the Parana and the Uruguay; a
                    circumstance which, if correctly stated, indicates that these streams once
                    united there, and that the lower grounds have been formed by their concurrent
                    operation continued for ages.” Higher up on the same river, and in the midst of
                    the woods, is another lake called the Jagape, but little more is known of it
                    than its name, and that chiefly from the report of people dwelling in its
                    neighbourhood, who occasionally find their way to Rio de Janeiro.</p>
                <p>After the confluence of the Parana and Paraguay, in latitude 27. 27., the river
                    under the former name assumes a grand and majestic appearance. It is studded
                    with innumerable islands, some of which are of considerable size, thickly
                    clothed with trees and shrubs, and forming a refuge for foxes, tigers, and other
                    wild animals. The volume of its waters is of course very great. It is above two
                    miles in breadth, of considerable depth, and has a current more rapid than that
                    of the Paraguay before its junction. “The Parana and Paraguay,” says Air
                    Luccock, “rolling impetuously through a very extended course, bring down a great
                    quantity of wreck, and soil of a reddish colour. When they have arrived at the
                    more level grounds, and their currents are become comparatively slow, much of it
                    is deposited; there it remains until the next wet season, when it is again urged
                    onward by a resistless torrent, which not only sweeps the bottom, but frets and
                    tears the banks, which had before been raised.” The main current is never less
                    than two fathoms and a half in depth; and it is near the sides of the river, not
                    in the centre, that the channel is deepest. Its periodical rise commences in
                    December, which is some time after the commencement of the rainy season in the
                    countries situated between the tropic of Capricon and the equator; and it
                    continues rising without interruption till the month of April, when decreasing
                    till July, with somewhat more rapidity than it rose, it again shrinks within its
                    legitimate bounds. In the latter month it is usual to perceive a slight rising,
                    which the inhabitants of the country call “Èl repunte ;” and which is attributed
                    to the waters which the river receives from the streams pouring down from the
                    temperate zone, where the season of winter is almost always rainy. But the
                    “repunte” is of such trivial moment that it never overflows the lands even in
                    the lowest situations. The rains, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193491958"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1958-0067"/>although invariable as to their recurrence, are
                    greater in some years than in others; and the height to which the river rises,
                    of course, corresponds with the quantity of rain which falls. The navigation of
                    this river is of considerable importance. “There are three causes which
                    regularly impede the navigation of rivers,” says Don Ignacio Nuñez, in his work
                    on the united provinces of the Rio de la Plata, “the great rapidity of their
                    currents, the shallowness of their waters, and the shoals, rocks, or banks which
                    obstruct their passage. None of these inconveniences are met with in the Parana,
                    till reaching the island of Apipé. The rapidity of its course varies with the
                    state of the river, and the conformation of its channel. When the rising is at
                    its greatest height, the velocity of its current is greater than when it is on
                    the decrease; and, in both seasons, it is always greatest in those parts where
                    its channel is the narrowest. In the Rosario, in Punta Gorda, and in Hernan de
                    Arias, which are the places where it is the most straitened in width, six
                    observations made during the time of its rising gave for its average velocity a
                    foot and a half per second. When the river is in its natural bed its stream has
                    much less velocity, and that is not alike in all places in its breadth. In the
                    centre of the channel it is greater than on the shore towards the bogs; and
                    there, on account of its being very accessible, it is greater than in the places
                    near the islands, where the velocity is almost null; which is not the case in
                    the Rio de la Plata, in which the currents are invariably in proportion to, and
                    in direction with, the winds which blow. It is therefore evident that the
                    rapidity of the current of the Parana is no impediment to its navigation; which,
                    indeed, experience has long since proved. As regards the depth, no person is
                    ignorant of its capability for the navigation of vessels of all burdens as far
                    as the island of Apipé; and it would continue with depth enough for that object
                    for a great distance farther, did not a cataract situated in that place impede
                    its progress.” He then goes on to state, that its depth at the shallowest is
                    quite sufficient for very large vessels; and that the greater part of its
                    sinuosities and arms are not only navigable in the rainy season, but even when
                    the river is at the lowest. “From Cape Saint Maria to the island of Apipé,” he
                    continues, “is a distance by water of five hundred leagues, navigable without
                    any other reef than the English Bank (Banco Ingles), which will cease to be
                    dangerous as soon as a vigilant and protecting government shall watch over the
                    commerce and prosperity of the country. In the whole course of the Parana there
                    is not a single stone; its bottom is clay and very fine sand; and although some
                    banks and shallows are here and there met with, a sufficient channel is left at
                    all times for the passage of vessels.” In reference to, the extent of country
                    inundated, he says, “The average rising is about twelve feet; but the islands
                    and lands subject to be overflowed never have that depth of water over them,
                    owing to their greater height. When the river is at the highest, the lowest of
                    the islands scarcely have more than three feet over them, and some, for the
                    distance of many leagues, are covered by only eight or nine inches. There are
                    also places which are not inundated except during extraordinary risings, which
                    may not occur for a considerable length of time. There are likewise inundations
                    so low that they form lakes, which disappear solely through evaporation and
                    filtration, leaving a great quantity of fish out of their element. Calculating
                    the immense extent of territory inundated by the Parana, only from its mouth to
                    Cayasta, of which we can speak with accuracy from our own observations, its
                    waters during the inundation cover about one thousand one hundred square
                    leagues; and, making an approximate calculation of the whole extent of country
                    which enjoys this beneficial circumstance, from near the tropic of Capricon,
                    where the river begins to assume this quality, to its mouth, the space
                    participating in so vast an advantage, without any aid from art, may be reckoned
                    at about four thousand leagues.” A river so extensive as the Parana is of course
                    supplied by many tributary rivers. Amongst the most considerable of these is the
                    Salada or Salado, which rises in the province of Salta, and flows into the
                    Parana at Santa Fé. It is navigable for many leagues, and as it traverses a very
                    fertile country, it will one day become of far more importance than it is at
                    present. It is to be distinguished from another river of the same name, which
                    unites with the Rio de la Plata in latitude 36°, four or five degrees farther
                    down. The Parana flows into the river last named by several mouths, comprehended
                    between latitude 34. and 34. 20. south. Here also the Rio de la Plata receives
                    the Uruguay, and these united streams flow majestically to the Atlantic Ocean.
