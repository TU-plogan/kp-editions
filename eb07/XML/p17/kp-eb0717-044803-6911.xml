                    principle which was supposed to enter into the composition of various bodies.
                    The bodies which were thought to con-, tain it in the largest quantity are such
                    as are inflammable; and the property which these substances possess of being
                    susceptible of inflammation was thought to depend upon this principle, so that
                    it was sometimes called the Principle of Inflammability. Inflammation, according
                    to this doctrine, was the separation of this principle, or phlogiston, from the
                    other matter which composed the combustible body. As its separation was always
                    attended with the emission of light and heat, some chemists thence concluded
                    that it was light and heat combined with other matter in a peculiar manner, or
                    that it was some highly elastic and very subtile matter, upon certain
                    modifications of which heat and light depended. Another class of bodies which
                    were supposed to contain phlogiston were the metals; and the chemists supposed
                    that the peculiar lustre of the metals depended on this principle. Of this they
                    thought themselves convinced by the evidence of' their senses in two ways;
                    first, because by exposing a metal to the action of a long-continued heat, it
                    lost its metallic lustre, and was converted into an earthy-like substance called
                    <hi rend="italic">calx</hi><hi rend="italic">metallicus,</hi> or oxide; and,
                    secondly, because by mixing this oxide with any inflammable substance whatever,
                    and subjecting the mixture to certain operations, the inflammable matter
                    disappeared, and the metal was restored to its former condition and lustre,
                    without suffering much diminution in quantity, especially if the processes had
                    been conducted with care and attention.</p>
                <p>This fact relative to the metals was thought to be a full demonstration of
                    itself, independently of other proofs which were brought to support the
                    doctrine. These were, that a combustible body, by the act of inflammation, that
                    is, by the dissipation of its phlogiston in the form of heat and light, was
                    converted into a body which was no longer combustible, but which might have its
                    property of combustibility restored to it again by mixing the incombustible
                    remains with any kind of inflammable matter, and submitting the mixture to
                    certain processes. In this way the body was restored to its former state of
                    inflammability.</p>
                <p>They were also at some pains to prove that the phlogiston, or the principle of
                    inflammability, was the same in all inflammable bodies, and also in the metals.
                    This identity of phlogiston they thought to be evident from the fact, that the
                    calx of a metal might be restored to its metallic state, or that the remains
                    after the combustion of a combustible body might be restored to its original
                    state of combustibility by the addition of any inflammable body whatever, taken
                    either from the animal, the vegetable, or the mineral kingdoms.</p>
                <p>These and several other facts were brought to prove, not only the existence of
                    phlogiston, but its effects in mixture with other substances; and the objections
                    which were made against the doctrine were removed with wonderful ingenuity. The
                    chief objection against it was, that if the inflammation of a combustible body,
                    or the conversion of a metal into calx, depends upon the dissipation or
                    extrication of phlogiston, then it must follow, that the remains of a
                    combustible body after inflammation, and the calx of the metal, must be less
                    than the matter from which they were produced. But this is contrary to fact, for
                    when we collect with care all the vapour into which the purest inflammable
                    bodies are converted by combustion, these incombustible remains are much heavier
                    than the inflammable body from which they were produced, and the calx into which
                    a metal is converted by long exposure to the action of heat is heavier than the
                    metal from which it was produced. This consideration made several people doubt
                    of the truth of the doctrine; but the objection was removed by saying, that
                    phlogiston was so subtile, as not only to have no weight, but to possess an
                    absolute levity; and that when it was taken from an absolutely heavy body, that
                    body must, by losing so much absolute levity, become heavier, in the same manner
                    as the algebraists say that a positive quantity is augmented by the subtraction
                    of a negative quantity. This sophism satisfied the minds of most of the
                    chemists, especially those who were algebraists.</p>
                <p>The opinion that phlogiston was heat and light somehow combined with other
                    matter, was proved, not only by the fact that heat and light were emitted from a
                    combustible body during its combustion, but from the reduction of certain
                    metallic calces to the original metallic state again, at least in some degree,
                    by simple exposure to heat and light. The white calx of silver, for instance,
                    when exposed in closely-sealed glass vessels to the light and heat of the sun,
                    resumes a black tinge, and is in part restored to its metallic lustre, without
                    any addition whatever; but then this re <pb break="no" facs="nls:193496924"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-6924-0449"/>storation, like the others above mentioned, is
                    attended with a loss of weight.</p>
                <p>Besides constituting the principal portion of inflammable bodies and metals,
                    phlogiston was thought to be the cause of colour in all vegetable and animal
                    substances. This was concluded from the fact of plants growing white when
                    defended from the action of the sun’s rays, and having their green colour
                    restored by fresh exposure to the light; and so far did the chemists suffer
                    themselves to be deceived, that they actually thought the green colouring
                    matter, which they extracted from fresh plants by certain chemical processes, to
                    be an inflammable substance. But a very material objection was made to this
                    argument. If plants owe their colour to phlogiston imparted by the sun’s rays,
                    why do the sun’s rays destroy vegetable colours which are exposed to them? We
                    know that the sun’s rays are very effectual in diminishing the lustre of cloth
                    dyed with vegetable colours, and in bleaching or taking out various stains from
                    linen and other substances. All this, however, was removed by saying, that the
                    sun’s rays possessed different powers on living and on dead vegetable matter,
                    and that the living vegetables had the power of absorbing phlogiston from the
                    sun’s rays, which dead vegetable matter had not.</p>
                <p>Since the existence of phlogiston, as a chemical principle in the composition of
                    certain bodies, has now been fully proved to be false, we shall not trouble our
                    readers with any further observations on it, except to add, that although the
                    chemists were satisfied with the proofs they gave of its reality, they were
                    never able to exhibit it in a separate state, or show it in a pure form, unmixed
                    with other matter.</p>
                <p>From the time of Sir Isaac Newton till the middle of the eighteenth century, no
                    real improvement was made in scientific chemistry; and the progress this science
                    has made since that period is owing to the important discovery of the existence
                    of heat in a state of composition with other matter. Heat thus combined loses
                    its activity, or becomes insensible, just in the same way as any other active
                    substance loses its apparent qualities in composition. Acids, for example, when
                    combined in a certain proportion with substances for which they have strong
                    attraction, as alkalies or absorbent earths, lose all their obvious acid
                    qualities, and the compound turns out mild, and totally conceals the acid which
                    it contains. In a similar manner, heat, when combined in certain proportions
                    with other matter, loses its sensible qualities, and the compound conceals the
                    heat which it contains. Heat, in this combined state, was denominated by its
                    ingenious discoverer, Dr Black, <hi rend="italic">latent</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and it was found to be very abundant in the atmosphere, which owes its
                    existence as an elastic fluid to the quantity of latent heat that it contains.
                    Arter this discovery was made, Dr Crawford, considering that air was absorbed by
                    a burning body, concluded that the heat which appears in the combustion of a
                    combustible body, is the heat that had before existed in the air which was
                    consumed by the burning body. Μ. Lavoisier and others, prosecuting this inquiry,
                    found that the combustible body, whilst it is burning, unites with the basis of
                    the air, and that the heat which the air contained, and which was the cause of
                    the air existing in the state of air, is expelled. This absorption of the basis
                    of the air by the burning body, and the reduction of this basis to a solid form,
                    accounts for the increase of weight which a body acquires by burning; or, in
                    other words, gives a reason why the matter into which a combustible body is
                    converted by combustion, is heavier than the body from which it was produced.
                    The same absorption of air is observable when a metal is converted into a calx,
                    and the additional weight of the calx is found to be precisely equal to the
                    weight of the air absorbed during the calcination. On these principles,
                    therefore, we now explain the phenomena in a much more satisfactory manner than
                    by the supposition of phlogiston, or a principle of inflammability.</p>
