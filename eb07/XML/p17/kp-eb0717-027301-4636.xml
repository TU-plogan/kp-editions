                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Perspective</hi> is the art of drawing upon a plane surface
                    true resemblances or pictures of objects, as the objects themselves appear to
                    the eye from any distance and situation, real or imaginary.</p>
                <p>It was in the sixteenth century that perspective was revived, or rather
                    re-invented. It owes its birth to painting, and particularly to that branch of
                    it which was employed in the decorations of the theatre, where landscapes were
                    properly introduced, and which would have looked unnatural and horrid if the
                    size of the objects had not been pretty nearly proportioned to their distance
                    from the eye. We learn from Vitruvius, that Agatharchus, instructed by
                    Aeschylus, was the first who wrote upon this subject; and that afterwards the
                    principles of the art were more distinctly taught by Democritus and Anaxagoras,
                    the disciples of Agatharchus. Of the théórý of this art, as described by thém,
                    we know nothing, since none of their writings have escaped the general wreck
                    that was made of ancient literature in the dark ages of Europe. However, the
                    revival of painting in Italy was accompanied with a revival of this art.</p>
                <p>The first person who attempted to lay down the rules of perspective was Pietro
                    del Borgo, an Italian. He supposed objects to be placed beyond a transparent
                    tablet, and endeavoured to trace the images which rays of light emitted from
                    them would make upon it. But we do not know what success he had in this attempt,
                    because the book which he wrote upon the subject is not now extant. It was,
                    however, very much commended by the famous Egnazio Dante; and, upon the
                    principles of Borgo, Albert Durer constructed a machine, by which he could trace
                    the perspective appearance of objects.</p>
                <p>Balthazar Perussi studied the writings of Borgo, and endeavoured to render them
                    more intelligible. To him we owe the discovery of points of distance, to which
                    all lines that make an angle of forty-five degrees with the ground line are
                    drawn. A little time after, Guido Ubaldi, another Italian, found that all the
                    lines that are parallel to one another, if they be inclined to the ground line,
                    converge to some point in the horizontal line; and that through this point also,
                    a line drawn from the eye, parallel to them, will pass. These principles, put
                    together, enabled him to make out a pretty complete theory of perspective.</p>
                <p>Great improvements were made in the ndes of perspective by subsequent
                    geometricians; particularly by Professor Gravesande, and still more by Dr Brooke
                    Taylor, whose principles are in a great measure new, and far more general than
                    any that had been made before his time.</p>
                <p>In order to understand the principles of perspective, it will be proper to
                    consider the plane on which the representation is to be made as transparent, and
                    interposed between the eye of the spectator and the object to be represented.
                    Thus, suppose a person at a window looks through an upright pane of glass at any
                    object beyond it, and, keeping his head steady, draws the figure of the object
                    upon the glass with a black-lead pencil, as if the point of the pencil touched
                    the object itself; he would then have a true representation of the object in
                    perspective, as it appears to his eye.</p>
                <p>In order to this, two things are necessary; first, that the glass be laid over
                    with strong gum-water, which, when dry, will be fit for drawing upon, and will
                    retain the traces of the pencil; and, secondly, that he look through a small
                    hole in a thin plate of metal, fixed about a foot from the glass, between it and
                    his eye, and that he keep his eye close to the hole, otherwise he might shift
                    the position of his head, and consequently make a false delineation of the
                    object</p>
                <p>Having traced the figure or outline of the object, he may go over it again with
                    pen and ink, and when the ink is dry, put a sheet of paper upon it, and trace it
                    thereon with a pencil; then taking away the paper and laying it upon a table, he
                    may finish the picture by giving it the colours, lights, and shades, as he sees
                    them in the object itself. By these means he will have a true resemblance of the
                    object.</p>
                <p>To every person who has a general knowledge of the principles of optics, this
                    must be self-evident. For, as vision is occasioned by pencils of rays coming in
                    straight lines to the eye from every point of the visible object, it is plain
                    that, by joining the points in the transparent plane, through which all those
                    pencils respectively pass, an exact representation must be formed of the object,
                    as it appears to the eye in that particular position, and at that determined
                    distance; and were pictures of things to be always first drawn on transparent
                    planes, this simple operation, with the principle upon which it is founded,
                    would comprehend the whole theory and practice of perspective. As this, however,
                    is far from being the case, rules must be deduced from the sciences of optics
                    and geometry, for drawing representations of visible objects upon opaque planes;
                    and the application of these rules constitutes what is properly called the <hi
                    rend="italic">art of per* spedive.</hi></p>
                <p>Previously to our laying down the fundamental principles of this art, it may not
                    be improper to observe, that when a person stands right against the middle of
                    one end of a long avenue or walk, which is straight and equally broad
                    throughout, the sides thereof appear to approach nearer and nearer to each other
                    as they are further and further from his eye; or the angles under which their
                    different parts are seen become less and less according as the distance from his
                    eye increases; and if the avenue be very long, the sides of it at the farthest
                    end will seem to meet, and there an object that would cover the whole breadth of
                    the avenue, and be of a height equal to that breadth, would appear to be only a
                    mere point.</p>
                <p>Having made these preliminary observations, we shall now proceed to the practice
                    of perspective, which is built upon the following</p>
                <p>THEOREM I.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> (fig. 1) represent the ground plan of the figure
                    to be thrown into perspective, and <hi rend="italic">efgh</hi> the transparent
                    plane through which it is viewed by the eye at E. Let these planes intersect in
                    the straight line KL. Let B be any <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494649"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-4649-0274"/>point in the ground-plan, and BE a straight line,
                    the path of a ray of light from that point to the eye. This will pass through
                    the plane <hi rend="italic">efgh</hi> in some point Z&gt;,∙ ∙or B will be seen
                    through that point, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> will be the picture, image,' or
                    representation of B.</p>
                <p>If BA be drawn in the ground-plan, making any angle BAK with the common
                    intersection, and EV be drawn parallel to it, meeting the picture-plane or
                    perspective plane in V, and VA be drawn, the point <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is
                    in the line VA so situated that BA is to EV as <hi rend="italic">b</hi> A to
                    Z&gt;V.</p>
                <p>For since EV and BA are parallel, the figure BAZ&gt;VE⅛B i⅛ in one plane, cutting
                    the perspective plane in the straight line VA; the triangles ΒΛΖ», EVò, are
                    similar, and BA: EV = ÃA: <hi rend="italic">bV.</hi><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi>
                    1. If B be beyond the picture, its picture <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is above the
                    intersection KL; but if B be between the eye and the picture, as at B', its
                    picture <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ’ is below KL.</p>
                <p>2. If two other parallel lines B A', ES, be drawn, and A', S, be joined, the
                    picture of B is in the intersection of the lines AV and A'S.</p>
                <p>3. The line BA is represented by 6A, or <hi rend="italic">bA</hi> is the picture
                    of BA; and if AB be infinitely extended, it will be represented by AV. V is
                    therefore called the <hi rend="italic">vanishing point</hi> of the line AB.</p>
                <p>4. All lines parallel to AB are represented by lines converging to V from the
                    points where these lines intersect the perspective-plane; and therefore V is the
                    vanishing point of all such parallel lines.</p>
                <p>5. The pictures of all lines parallel to the perspectiveplane are parallel to the
                    lines themselves (fig. 8).</p>
                <p>6. If through V (fig. 1) be drawn HVO parallel to KL, the angle EVH is equal to
                    BAK.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Remark.</hi> The proposition now demonstrated is not limited to
                    any inclination of the picture-plåne to the ground-plane; but it is usual to
                    consider them as perpendicular to each other, and the grourtd-plane as
                    horizontal. Hence the line KL is called the <hi rend="italic">ground-line,</hi>
                    and OH the <hi rend="italic">horizon-line</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and OK,
                    perpendicular to both, is called the <hi rend="italic">height of the
                    eye.</hi></p>
                <p>If ES be drawn perpendicular to the picture-plane, it will cut it in a point S of
                    the horizon-line directly opposite to the eye. This is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">point of sight,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">principal point.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">7.</hi> The pictures of all vertical lines are vertical, and the
                    pictures of horizontal lines are horizontal, because these lines are parallel to
                    the perspective plane.</p>
                <p>8. The point of sight S is the vanishing point of all lines perpendicular to the
                    perspective plane.</p>
                <p>The above proposition is a sufficient foundation for the whole practice of
                    perspective, whether on direct or inclined pictures, and serves to suggest all
                    the various practical constructions, each of which has advantages which suit
                    particular purposes. Writers on the subject have either confined themselves to
                    one construction, from an affectation of simplicity or fondness for system; or
                    have multiplied precepts, by giving every construction for every example, in
                    order to make a great book, and give the subject an appearance of importance and
                    difficulty. An ingenious practitioner will avoid both extremes, and avail
                    himself of the advantage of each construction as it happens to suit his purpose.
                    We shall now proceed to the practical rules, which require no consideration of
                    intersecting planes, and are all performed on the perspective plane by means of
                    certain substitutions for the place of the eye and the original figure. The
                    general substitution is as follows:</p>
                <p>Let the plane of the paper be first supposed to be the ground-plan, and the
                    spectator to stand at F (fig. 2). Let it be supposed that the ground-plan is to
                    be represented on a plane surface, standing perpendicularly on the line GKL of
                    the plan, and that the point K is immediately opposite to the spectator, or that
                    FK is perpendicular to GL: then</p>
                <p>FK is equal to the distance of the spectator’s eye from the picture.</p>
                <p>Now suppose a piece of paper laid on the plan with its straight edge lying on the
                    line GL; draw on this paper KS perpendicular to GL, and make it equal to the
                    height of the eye above the ground-plan. This may be much greater than the
                    height of a man, because the spectator may be standing on a place much raised
                    abôve the ground-plan. Observe also that KS must be measured on the same scale
                    on which the ground-plan and the distance FK were measured. Then draw HSO
                    parallel to GL. This will be a horizontal line, and (when the picture is set
                    upright on GL) will be on a level with the spectator’s eye, and the point S will
                    be directly opposite to his eye. It is therefore called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >principal point, or point of sight.</hi> The distance of his eye from this
                    point will be equal to FK. Therefore make SP (in the line SK) equal to FK, and P
                    is the projecting point or substitute for the place of the eye. It is sometimes
                    convenient to place P above S, sometimes to one side of it on the horizontal
                    line, and in various other situations; and writers ignorant of, or inattentive
                    to, the principles of the theory, have given it different denominations, such as
                    <hi rend="italic">point of distance, point of view,</hi> &amp;c. It is merely a
                    substitute for the point F in fig. 1, and its most natural situation is below,
                    as in this figure.</p>
                <p>The art of perspective is conveniently divided into Ichnography, which teaches
                    how to make a perspective draught of figures on a plane, commonly called the
                    ground-plan; and Scenography, which teaches how to draw solid figures, or such
                    figures as are raised above this plan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prob.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ι. To put into perspective any
                    given point of the ground-plan.</hi></p>
                <p>First general construction.</p>
                <p>From B and P (fig. 2) draw any two parallel lines BA, PV, cutting the ground-line
                    and horizon-line in AandV, and draw BP, AV, cutting each other in <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi> is the
                    picture of B.</p>
                <p>For it is evident that BA, PV of this figure are analogous to BA and EV of fig.
                    1, and that BA: PV = δA: <hi rend="italic">DN.</hi></p>
                <p>If BA' be drawn perpendicular to GL, PV will fall on PS, and need not be drawn.
                    A'V will be A'S. This is the most easy construction, and nearly the same with
                    Ferguson’s.</p>
                <p>Second general construction.</p>
                <p>Draw two lines BA, BA", and two lines PV, PD, parallel to them, and draw AV, A"D,
                    cutting each other in <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> is the picture of B by Cor. 2. This construction is the
                    foundation of all the rules of perspective that are to be found in the books on
                    this subject. They appear in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> variety of forms, owing to
                    the ignorance or inattention of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494662"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-4662-0275"/>authors to the principles. The rule most generally
                    adhered to is as follows:</p>
                <p>Draw BA perpendicular to the ground-line, and AS to the ppint of sight, and set
                    off <hi rend="italic">Aβ</hi> equal to BA. Set off’ SD equal to the distance of
                    the eye in the opposite direction from S that <hi rend="italic">β</hi> is from
                    A, where B and E of fig. 1 are on opposite sides of the picture; otherwise set
                    them the same way. D is called the point of distance. Draw ∕3D, cutting AS in
                    <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> This is evidently equivalent to drawing BA ʹ and PS
                    perpendicular to the ground-line and horizon-line, and BA* and PD (fig. 2)
                    making an angle of 45° with these lines, with the additional puzzle about the
                    way of setting off A'A" and SD, which is avoided in the construction here
                    given.</p>
                <p>This usual construction, however, by a perpendicular and the point of distance,
                    is extremely simple and convenient; and two points of distance, one on each side
                    of S, serve for all points of the ground-plan. But the first general
                    construction requires still fewer lines, if BA be drawn perpendicular to GL,
                    because PV will then coincide with PS.</p>
                <p>Third general construction.</p>
                <p>Draw BA (fig. 3) from the given point B perpendicular to the ground-line, and AS
                    to the point of sight. From the point of distance D set off <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dd</hi> equal to BA, on the same or the contrary sides as 8, according as B is
                    on the same or the contrary side of the picture as the eye. Join <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> A, and draw DA parallel to <hi rend="italic">dA. b</hi> is
                    the picture of B. For SD, Dd are equal Jo the distances of the eye and given

                <p>Draw from the projecting point PV, PW, parallel to AB, BC, and let AB, BC, CD,

                    direct us to transpose the figure; that is, to transfer it to the other side of
                    the ground-line, by producing the perpendiculars Aα, B∕3, Cx, D3, till aA' ∣3B',

                <p>It is well known that the conic sections and some other curves, when viewed

                    with different positions and proportions of their principal lines ∙, and rules
                    may be given for describing their pictures founded on this property. But these
                    rules are very various, unconnected with the general theory of perspective, and
                    more tedious in the execution, without being more accurate, than the general
                    rule now given. It would be a useless affectation to insert them in this
                    elementary treatise.</p>
                <p>We come, in the next place, to the delineation of figures not in a horizontal
                    plane, and of solid figures. For this purpose it is necessary to demonstrate the
                    following</p>
                <p>THEOREM II.</p>
                <p>The length of any vertical line standing on the ground plane is to that of its
                    picture as the height of the eye to the distance of the horizon-line from the
                    picture of its foot.</p>
                <p>Let BC (fig. 8) be the vertical line standing on B, and let EF be a vertical line
                    through the eye. Make BD equal to EF, and draw DE, CE, BE. It is evident that DE
                    will cut the horizon-line in some point <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> CE will cut
                    the picture-plane in c, and BE will cut it in Z&gt;, and that <hi rend="italic"

                    from the point of sight, and draw the vertical line AD, and make AE equal to the
                    length or height of the given line. Join ES, and draw <hi rend="italic">bc</hi>
                    parallel to AD, producing <hi rend="italic">bc,</hi> when necessary, till it cut
                    the horizontal line in <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and we have <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">bc</hi> is the required picture of the vertical line.</p>
                <p>This problem occurs frequently in views of architecture; and a compendious method
                    of solving it would be peculiarly convenient. For this purpose, draw a vertical
                    line XZ at the margin of the picture, or on a separate paper, and through any
                    point V of the horizon-line draw VX. Set off XY, the height of the vertical
                    line, and draw VY. Then from any points <hi rend="italic">b, r,</hi> on which it
                    is required to have the pictures of lines equal to XY, draw <hi rend="italic"
                    >bs, rt,</hi> parallel to the horizon-line, and draw the verticals <hi

                    Simon Stevinus, who was the first that wrote upon it, does not inform us from
                    whom he learned it. The principles of it are laid down by S. Vauzelard, in his

                    and Gaspar Schott professes to copy Marius Bettinus in his description of this

                <p>It will be sufficient for our purpose to copy one of the simplest figures of this
                    writer, as by this means the mystery of this art will be sufficiently unfolded.
                    Upon the cylinder of paper, or pasteboard, ABCD, fig. 16, Plate CCCCVIIL, draw
                    whatever is intended to be exhibited, as the letters IHS. Then with a needle
                    make perforations along the whole outline; and placing a candle G behind this
                    cylinder, mark upon the ground-plane the shadow of them, which will be distorted
                    more or less, according to the position of the candle or the plane, &amp;c. This
                    being done, let the picture be an exact copy of this distorted image, let a
                    metallic speculum be substituted in the place of the cylinder, and let the eye
                    of the spectator have the same position before the cylinder that the candle had
                    behind it. Then looking upon the speculum, he will see the distorted image
                    restored to its proper shape. The reformation of the image, he says, will not
                    easily be made exact in this method, but it will be sufficiently so to answer
                    the purpose.</p>
                <p>Other methods, more exact and geometrical than this, were found out afterwards:
                    so that these pictures could be drawn by certain rules, without the use of a
                    candle. Schott quotes one of these methods from Bettinus, another from
                    Herigonius, and another from Kircher, which may be seen in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Magia,</hi> vol. i. p. 162, &amp;c. He also gives an account of the methods of
                    reforming pictures by speculums of conical and other figures.</p>
                <p>Instead of copying any of these methods from Schott or Bettinus, we shall present
                    our readers with that which Dr Smith hath given us in his Optics, vol. i. p.

                <p>The practical methods of drawing these images seem to have been carried to the
                    greatest perfection by J. Leopold, who, in the <hi rend="italic">Acta
                    Lipsiensia</hi> for the year 1712, has described two machines, one for the
                    images to be viewed with a cylindrical and the other with a conical mirror. The
                    person possessed of this instrument has nothing to do but to take any print he
                    pleases, and while he goes over the outlines of it with one pen, another traces
                    the anamorphosis.</p>
                <p>By methods of this kind, groves of trees may be cut, so as to represent the
                    appearance of men, horses, and other objects, from some one point of view, which
                    are not at all discernible in any other. This might easily be effected by one
                    person placing himself in any particular situation, and giving directions to
                    other persons what trees to lop, and in what manner. In the same method it has
                    been contrived, that buildings of circular and other forms, and also whole
                    groups of buildings consisting of walls at different distances, and with
                    different positions to one another, should be painted so as to exhibit the exact
                    representation of particular objects, which could only be perceived in one
                    situation. Bettinus has illustrated this method by drawings in his <hi

                <p>It may appear a bold assertion to say, that the very short sketch now given of
                    the art of perspective is a sufficient foundation for the whole practice, and
                    includes <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the expeditious rules peculiar to the
                    problems which most generally occur. It is, however, true; and the intelligent
                    reader will perceive, that the two theorems on which the whole rests include
                    every possible case, and apply with equal facility to pictures and originals in
                    any position, although the examples are selected of perpendicular pictures, and
                    of originals referred to horizontal planes, as being the most frequent. The
                    scientific foundation being so simple, the structure need not be complex, nor
                    swell into such volumes as have been published on the subject; which by their
                    size deter from the perusal, and give the simple art the appearance of intricate
                    mystery, whilst, by their prices, they defeat the design of their authors to
                    promote the dissemination of knowledge amongst practitioners. The treatises on
                    perspective acquire their bulk by long and tedious discourses, minute
                    explanations of common things, or by great numbers of examples; which indeed
                    render some of these books valuable from the variety of curious cuts, but do not
                    at all instruct the reader by any improvements made in the art itself. For it is
                    evident that most of those who have treated this subject have been more
                    conversant in the practice of designing than in the principles of geometry; and
                    therefore when, in their practice, the cases which have occurred put them upon
                    trying particular expedients, they have thought them worth communicating to the
                    public as improvements in the art; and each author, fond of his own little
                    expedient, which by a scientific person would have been known as an easy
                    corollary from the general theorem, has made it the principle of a practical
                    system, thus narrowing instead of enlarging the knowledge of the art; and the
                    practitioner, tired of the bulk of the volume, in which a single maxim is
                    tediously spread out, and the principle on which it is founded kept out of his
                    sight, contents himself with a remembrance of a maxim perhaps not understood,
                    and keeps it slightly in his eye to avoid gross errors. We can appeal to the
                    whole body of painters and draughtsmen for the truth of this assertion; and it
                    must not be considered as an imputation of remissness or negligence on their
                    part, but as a necessary consequence of the ignorance of the authors from whom
                    they have taken their information. This is a strong statement, but it is not the
                    less just. Several mathematicians of eminence have written on perspective,
                    treating it as the subject of pure geometry, as it really is; and the
                    performances of Dr Brooke Taylor, Gravesande, Wolf, De la Caille, and Emerson,
                    are truly valuable, by presenting the art in all its perspicuous simplicity and
                    universality. The works of Taylor and Emerson are more valuable, on account of
                    the very ingenious and expeditious constructions which they have given, suited
                    to every possible case. The merit of the former has been universally
                    acknowledged by all the British writers on the subject, who never fail to
                    declare that their own works are composed on the principle of Dr Brooke Taylor;
                    but any man of science will see that these authors have either not understood
                    them, or aimed at pleasing the public by fine cuts and uncommon cases; for,
                    without exception, they have omitted his favourite constructions, which had
                    gained his predilection by their universality, and attached themselves to
                    inferior methods, or perhaps to inventions which they were pleased to regard as
                    their own. What has been laid down in this article is not <hi rend="italic"
                    >professed</hi> to be according to the principles of Dr Brooke Taylor, because
                    the principles are not peculiar to him, but the necessary results of the theory
                    itself, and inculcated by every mathematician who has taken the trouble to
                    consider the subject. They are sufficient not only for directing the ordinary
                    practice, but likewise for suggesting modes of construction in every case out of
                    the common track. A person of ingenuity will have a laudable enjoyment in
                    inventing rules for himself, and will be better pleased with such fruits of his
                    own ingenuity, than in reading the tedious explanation of examples devised by
                    another; and with this view we would, with Dr Taylor, “advise all our readers
                    not to be contented with the scheme they find here; but, on every occasion, to
                    draw new ones of their own, in all the variety of circumstances they can think
                    of. This will take up more time at first, but they will find the vast benefit
                    and pleasure of it by the extensive notions it will give them of the nature of
                    the principles.”</p>
                <p>The art of perspective is necessary to those arts where there is any occasion for
                    designing, as architecture, fortification, carving, and generally to all the
                    mechanical arts; but it is more particularly necessary to the art of painting,
                    in which nothing can be done without it. A figure in a picture, which is not
                    drawn according to the rules of perspective, does not represent what is
                    intended, but something else. Indeed, we hesitate not to say, that a picture
                    which is faulty in this particular is as blameable as any composition in writing
                    which is defective in point of orthography or grammar. It is generally thought
                    very ridiculous to pretend to write a heroic poem, or a fine discourse, upon any
                    subject, without understanding the propriety of the language in which we write;
                    and to us it seems no less ridiculous for one to pretend to paint a good picture
                    without understanding per <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494805"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-4805-0286"/>spective. Yet how many pictures are there to be
                    seen, which are highly valuable in other respects, and yet are entirely faulty
                    in this point? Indeed, this fault is so very general, that we cannot remember
                    ever having seen a picture which is entirely free from it; and, what is more to
                    be regretted, the greatest masters have been the most guilty of it. Such
                    examples cause it to be overlooked; but the fault is not the less, but the more
                    to be lamented, and deserves the greater care in avoiding it for the future. The
                    great occasion of this fault is certainly the bad method which is generally used
                    in educating persons in this art; for the young people are generally put
                    immediately to drawing, and when they have acquired a facility in that, they are
                    put to colouring. And these things they learn by rote, or by practice only, and
                    are not at all instructed in any rules of art; by which means, when they come to
                    make any designs of their own, though they are very expert at drawing and
                    colouring every thing which offers itself to their fancy, yet for want of being
                    instructed in the strict rules of art, they do not know how to govern their
                    inventions with judgment, and become guilty of many gross mistakes, which
                    prevent themselves, as well as others, from finding the satisfaction which they
                    otherwise would do in their performances. To correct this defect, we would
                    recommend it to masters of the art of painting to consider whether it would not
                    be necessary to establish a better method for the education of their scholars,
                    and to begin their instructions with the technical parts of painting, before
                    they let them loose to follow the inventions of their own uncultivated
                    imaginations.</p>
                <p>The art of painting, taken in its full extent, consists of two parts; the
                    inventive and the executive. The inventive part is common to poetry, and belongs
                    more properly and immediately to the original design (which it conceives and
                    disposes in the most proper and agreeable manner) than to the picture, which is
                    only a copy of that design already formed in the imagination of the artist. The
                    perfection of this art depends upon the thorough knowledge the artist has of all
                    the parts of his subject; and the beauty of it consists in the happy choice and
                    disposition which he makes of it. It is in this that the genius of the artist
                    discovers and shows itself, whilst he indulges and humours his fancy, which here
                    is not confined. But the executive part of painting is wholly confined and
                    restricted to the rules of art, which cannot upon any account be dispensed with;
                    and therefore in this the artist ought to govern himself entirely by these
                    rules, and not to take any liberties whatsoever. For any thing that is not truly
                    drawn according to the rules of perspective, or not truly coloured or truly
                    shaded, does not appear to be what the artist intended, but something else.
                    Wherefore, if at any time the artist happen to imagine that his picture would
                    look better if he swerved a little from these rules, he may assure himself, that
                    the fault belongs to his original design, and not to the strictness of the
                    rules; for what is perfectly agreeable and just in the real original objects
                    themselves, can never appear defective in a picture where these objects are
                    accurately copied.</p>
                <p>Therefore, to offer a short hint of the thoughts we have some time had as to the
                    method which ought to be followed in instructing a scholar in the executive part
                    of painting, we would first have him to learn the most common principles of
                    practical geometry, and the elements of plain geometry and of common arithmetic.
                    When he is sufficiently perfect in these, we would next have him to learn
                    perspective; and when he has made considerable progress in the latter, so as to
                    prepare his judgment with right notions of the alterations which figures must
                    undergo, when they come to be drawn upon a flat surface, he may then be put to
                    drawing by view, and be exercised in this alone with perspective, till he comes
                    to be sufficiently perfect in both. Nothing should be more familiar to a painter
                    than perspective; for it is the only thing which can make the judgment correct,
                    and help the fancy to invent with ten times the ease that it could do without
                    it.</p>
