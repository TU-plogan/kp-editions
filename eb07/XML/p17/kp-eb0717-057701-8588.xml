                <p>CHAPTER I GENERAL VIEWS OF PHYSIOLOGY.</p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Physiology,</hi> or the science of animal life, has
                    been variously defined by different writers. If the term were interpreted
                    strictly according to its etymology, it would carry a meaning much more
                    extensive than is warranted by common usage; for, being derived from <hi
                    rend="italic">φυσιs, nature,</hi> and λoγos∙, <hi rend="italic">discourse,</hi>
                    its proper signification should be, the <hi rend="italic">science of
                    nature.</hi> It might accordingly be understood to comprehend inquiries in every
                    department of nature, both animate and inanimate; and might indeed be regarded
                    as synonymous with <hi rend="italic">physics,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">natural
                    philosophy,</hi> which are other expressions of corresponding import, but which
                    at present are themselves restricted in their meaning to a special department of
                    nature. There can be do doubt, indeed, that such must originally have been the
                    real signification of these terms; but it is needless now to inquire by what
                    gradual transitions they have at length come to bear such different, and even in
                    some respects, opposite significations. If we were desirous of substituting a
                    term which would accurately express the idea now associated with the word
                    physiology, we should adopt that of <hi rend="italic">biology,</hi> from ∕3ιor,
                    life, first introduced by Treviranus, who has written a German work on this
                    subject, which bears that title.</p>
                <p>(2,) Natural philosophy, or physics, is now understood as designating that class
                    of sciences, which have for their object the examination of the properties of
                    lifeless matter; whilst physiology, in its modern acceptation, is in like manner
                    limited to the consideration of the properties which are peculiar to organized
                    and living bodies. The former is conversant only with nature in her dead or
                    inanimate condition; the latter with nature endowed with life, and in all its
                    various forms and modifications.</p>
                <p>Thus mechanics, hydrostatics, and pneumatics, wholly relate to the general
                    phenomena exhibited by matter in its solid, liquid, and gaseous forms; optics,
                    which relates to the phenomena of light, together with electricity, magnetism,
                    and the science of heat, which regard other classes of phenomena produced by
                    peculiar agents, are all considered as branches of natural philosophy.
                    Chemistry, which is concerned with the changes of composition in bodies,
                    resulting from the mutual action of their particles at insensible distances,
                    ranks also with the sciences relating to the properties of inorganic matter, and
                    of which the assemblage constitutes what are more correctly termed in the
                    present day, <hi rend="italic">the physical sciences.</hi></p>
                <p>(3.) On the other hand, the study of animated nature does not admit of the same
                    extent of subdivision. Nature has indeed traced a broad and obvious line of
                    demarcation between the <hi rend="italic">vegetable</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">animal</hi> kingdoms; the first being the province of <hi
                    rend="italic">botany,</hi> the second of <hi rend="italic">zoology</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> both of which departments offer as a wide field of inquiry,
                    and inexhaustible subjects of speculation. But it is in the animal world, more
                    especially, that the busy and ever-changing scene is calculated to awaken the
                    most lively curiosity, and inspire the deepest interest. The multiplied
                    relations which connect ns with the lower animals, the obvious analogies which
                    subsist between them and our own species, and the striking evidences of power,
                    intelligence, and benevolent design displayed in all the phenomena they present
                    to our observation, confer on the study of animal life a degree of importance
                    which belongs to scarcely any other study.</p>
                <p>(4.) But the foundations of all science must be laid by drawing accurate
                    distinctions among the objects which come within its cognizance; by making a
                    strict analysis of the ideas it comprehends, and by establishing precise
                    definitions of the terms it employs. As in all the other departments of human
                    knowledge, we can arrive at general facts, or comprehensive laws, only by
                    submitting to the previous task of ascertaining and collecting individual facts;
                    so in natural history we find it necessary to subdivide our labours into that
                    which takes cognizance of individual objects only, and that which inquires into
                    their more general relations with one another. The first is properly the <hi
                    rend="italic">history,</hi> the second the <hi rend="italic">philosophy</hi> of
                    nature; and this distinction we may observe to run through all the branches into
                    which the subject is divisible. It applies even to astronomy, in which the mere
                    physical history of the phenomena forms a preliminary body of knowledge, yet
                    subordinate to that higher range of inquiry which establishes connections
                    between these phenomena, and unites them into comprehensive laws or theories.
                    Mineralogy, again, must be studied as the foundation of geology; the former
                    being the history of the actual appearances; the latter, the theory of the
                    series of changes which have led to these observed phenomena. Thus, also, the
                    external forms, and more obvious habitudes of plants, and their classifications
                    in conformity with these forms and properties, constitute the subjects of <hi
                    rend="italic">botany,</hi> properlyso called; whilst the study of their internal
                    structure and economy, with relation to the more general phenomena of
                    vegetation, is comprised under the ∖∖ <hi rend="italic">∞Acfiphytology,</hi> or
                    the physiology of vegetables.</p>
                <p>(5∙) In like manner, the proper objects of <hi rend="italic">Zoology</hi> are to
                    trace the external forms of animals, to distribute and arrange them in
                    systematic order, and to record the particular facts relating to their history;
                    that is, to the more obvious phenomena which they present to our observation.
                    <hi rend="italic">Physiology</hi> embraces a wider field of research, inquires
                    into the connexions between the phenomena, and investigates the causes from
                    which they spring, and the laws by which they are governed. The zoologist is
                    content with collecting observations on the visible actions of animals, on their
                    peculiar habits, modes of life, and the manifestation of those faculties with
                    which they are respectively endowed by the Author of nature; a pursuit which
                    affords inexhaustible sources of amusement, and furnishes abundant matter of
                    admiration and of wonder. But the physiologist aims at far higher objects; and
                    considering the external phenomena presented by animals as lying merely at the
                    surface, seeks for information relative to the causes of all the facts which are
                    furnished to him by zoology, by examining the interior structure of their
                    bodies, by inquiring into the movements of that interior mechanism, and the
                    sources of those various actions which give rise to all the complicated
                    phenomena of life. An extensive and even boundless region of knowledge opens to
                    his view in these highly curious and interesting subjects of research,
                    constituting one vast science, which, although considerable progress has been
                    made in it by the labours of our predecessors, is yet destined to occupy, for an
                    incalculable period of time, the unremitting efforts of succeeding
                    generations.</p>
                <p>(6.) The phenomena of living beings have a totally different character from the
                    changes which take place in inanimate matter; and are with more difficulty
                    subjected to the severe analysis required by inductive philosophy. The
                    properties of inorganic bodies are of a simpler and more definite<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193498601" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8601-0578"/> nature, and however
                    variously they may be combined in their effects, admit, in general, of a
                    reduction to general laws. This is most effectually accomplished by means of
                    experiments, varied in such a manner as to reduce each class of phenomena to its
                    simplest conditions, arid afterwards combined in such a way as to allow of a
                    comparison of their results with the appearances presented by nature, and of
                    thus verifying their identity.</p>
                <p>But it is hardly possible to pursue the same process of investigation to any
                    extent in the diversified phenomena of organization. So complicated is the
                    mechanism, and so fine the minuter structure of animal and vegetable bodies',
                    that they elude the cognizance of our senses, even when assisted by the utmost
                    refinement of optical and mechanical art. All that chemistry has yet achieved in
                    disclosing to us the properties of different species of matter, and of their
                    various combinations, falls infinitely short of that knowledge which could
                    enable us to follow and to understand the curious and elaborate series of
                    chemical changes which take place in the interior of the living body. Far less
                    are we competent to trace the operation of those more subtle and mysterious
                    principles, which are the springs of motion, and which regulate the actions of
                    the machine, and connect the whole of its movements into one harmonious system.
                    Judging from their more obvious effects, indeed, these principles appear to be
                    quite of a different nature from those whιeh produce the phenomena of the
                    inorganic world. The series of changes which are exhibited by an animal or a
                    vegetable, from the first moment of its separate existence, through all the
                    stages of its growth, maturity, and decline, to the period of its death, are far
                    too complicated and multifarious to admit of being reduced to one single
                    principle, in the same way as the movements of the heavenly bodies, for
                    instance, are reducible to the simple law of gravitation.</p>
                <p>(7.) Physiologists, indeed, not deterred by these difficulties, which are
                    inherent in the subject of their researches, have in all ages attempted
                    generalizations of this kind. They have considered all the actions and phenomena
                    which are peculiar to living beings, and which differ from those exhibited by
                    the same bodies after death, as resulting from the operation of a single
                    principle of life. Different designations have been given to this power by
                    different theorists; thus, some have called it the <hi rend="italic">vital
                    principle,</hi> others the <hi rend="italic">spirit of animation,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">archaeus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">organic force</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and many other appellations have been given to it,
                    according to the particular taste or fancy of the writer. Nothing, indeed, can
                    be more specious than this reference to unknown facts, which have a manifest
                    connexion with one another, to a common principle of action, or in other words,
                    to a vital power. The only idea we can form oflife appears to imply the unity of
                    such a principle. This idea, as is well remarked, by Cuvier, is suggested by the
                    observation of a certain class of phenomena, succeeding each other in an
                    invariable order, and having certain mutual relations with one another; yet it
                    is but a vague and indistinct idea. We are ignorant of the nature of that link
                    which unites the whole of these phenomena; but the existence of some such link
                    forces itself upon our belief, and we are compelled to give it a particular
                    designation, and speak of it as if it were something more than a mere fiction of
                    the intellect.</p>
                <p>(8.) Those who are unaccustomed to philosophical reasonings, may be, indeed, and
                    often are, deceived by the employment of these abstract terms, and regard them
                    as the expressions of a simple law of nature, of the same comprehensive, yet
                    definite character, as those of gravitation, cohesion, heat, and electricity. A
                    more careful and profound analysis, however, will convince us that the power
                    inherent in organization, upon which its infinitely diversified actions depend,
                    is not a simple agency, but a combination of seve ral powers, not only different
                    from the physical agents which actuate the inorganic world, but differing also
                    very widely amongst each other. In order to arrive at this conclusion, however,
                    it will be necessary to take a review of the phenomena themselves, and we shall
                    therefore defer the consideration of this subject to a future chapter.</p>
                <p>(9∙) Although the peculiar nature of the phenomena which physiology embraces has
                    hitherto baffled all our endeavours to obtain results of the same general and
                    comprehensive nature as those which have rewarded our efforts in the purely
                    physical sciences, yet other resources are open to us, capable of conducting us
                    to a still more ample and inviting field of inquiry. Living nature is impressed
                    with a character, which at once raises it to a higher order among the objects of
                    human intellect, and invests the science which regards it with a more lofty and
                    ennobling sentiment. Life is peculiarly characterised by the manifestation of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">intention.</hi> Adaptation of means to an end is visible
                    throughout the whole of this animated scene. Express design is palpably
                    discernible in every formation, in every arrangement, in every series of changes
                    which this vast theatre of nature displays. Utility is the governing principle
                    of all; intelligence and power far exceeding the utmost stretch of our
                    imagination, are revealed to us in language not to be mistaken, and carrying
                    with it irresistible conviction. Thus, while the sciences of inorganic matter
                    are founded on the relations of cause and effect, physiology takes cognizance
                    more especially of the relations of means to ends, which the phenomena present
                    to our view. Hence we obtain a new principle of arrangement among these
                    phenomena; hence also arises a new source of interest, of a kind very superior
                    to that which mere physical relations can ever inspire.</p>
                <p>(10.) The purposes to which, pursuing this new principle of arrangement, we can
                    perceive the different structures which compose an animal body, are subservient,
                    are termed, in the language of physiology, the <hi rend="italic">functions</hi>
                    of those parts. Life results from the exercise of these functions, and consists
                    in the continued accomplishment of their respective objects. The principal
                    object of physiology, then, is the study of the functions of life; that is, the
                    investigation of the changes occurring in the living system with reference to
                    their respective objects, and in their subservience to the maintenance of life,
                    and the various purposes for which life was bestowed. We shall now proceed to
                    take a general review of thesè functions, in order to establish a foundation for
                    the divisions of the science we are now treating.</p>
                <p>(11.) The most cursory view that we can take of the phenomena of life will be
                    sufficient to shew that the functions to which they are referable are of
                    different degrees of importance with relation to the objects of life. Some are
                    so closely connected with these objects, that their continued exercise is
                    indispensable to the very existence of life, which would cease if they were for
                    a moment interrupted. Others which are less immediately concerned in the actual
                    maintenance of the vital actions, are yet essential to its preservation, and
                    cannot, with safety, be suspended but for a very short interval. Some are only
                    occasionally called into play, and others are so remotely useful, as to admit of
                    lying dormant for a considerable period, or even of being dispensed with
                    altogether. Some functions require for their performance the concurrence of
                    others, and these, again, imply the exercise of many more. Some are of a more
                    isolated nature, and have less connexion with the general system of functions.
                    By studying these relations, we are enabled to trace a certain plan in the
                    designs of nature, and a certain subordination of functions sufficient to guide
                    us in our studies, and to enable us to trace out a tolerably connected order of
                    subjects.</p>
                <p>(12.) It will be useful, before proceeding to the details of the subject, to
                    present our readers with a general sketch of the system of the animal economy,
                    which may serve, indeed, the same purpose, as a map does to a traveller,
                    imparting<pb break="no" facs="nls:193498614" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8614-0579"/> a
                    general notion of the bearings and relations of the several objects of interest
                    in the country he is about to traverse. We shall, for this purpose, embrace in
                    one view that assemblage of functions which constitutes animal life in its most
                    complete and perfect form, and in the attainment of its full developement.</p>
                <p>(13.) All the functions of the animal economy, all the mechanical dispositions of
                    the system, and all the movements of its parts, are subordinate to two great
                    objects; first, the preservation and welfare of the individual being which they
                    compose; and, secondly, the continuance of the race to which it belongs. It is
                    evident that the first great purpose to be accomplished is the conferring of the
                    powers of <hi rend="italic">sensation And perception,</hi> these being the
                    essential attributes of animal nature, and the characteristics which distinguish
                    it from the mineral or vegetable world. Next to these is the power of <hi
                    rend="italic">voluntary motion,</hi> by which the animal is enabled to change
                    its place, to procure for itself those objects which are necessary for its
                    subsistence or gratification, and to repel those which are noxious or
                    painful.</p>
                <p>(14.) The power of being affected by external objects, or of receiving
                    impressions of which we are conscious, is connected, in the more perfect
                    animals, with a part of the body having a more peculiar organization, and very
                    remarkable properties. It is a soft and pulpy substance, of a whitish colour,
                    with different shades of gray, opaque, and exhibiting slight traces of a fibrous
                    structure. It is termed <hi rend="italic">medullary</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >nervous substances</hi> Of this substance are composed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >brain,</hi> which is a large mass of medullary matter; and also the <hi
                    rend="italic">nerves,</hi> which have the appearance of white cords, extending
                    from the brain to almost every other part of the body. The nerves establish a
                    communication between these parts and the brain, so that impressions made upon
                    the former, are communicated, along the nerves, and by their intermedium, to the
                    brain, where they excite their appropriate sensations, corresponding to the
                    nature of the impression, and to the structure of the organ that originally
                    received it. By what agency, or in what way affections of the brain, thus
                    induced, are instrumental in producing sensation, or how the sentient principle
                    is connected with the physical constitution of the brain, are subjects of which
                    we have no knowledge; nor have we, in our present state, the smallest ground of
                    hope that the mystery in which it is involved, will ever be dispelled.
                    Sufficient let it be for us that such is the fact; and resting on this as an
                    ultimate fact, let us proceed in our inquiries, as to the occasions on which
                    this power, assuming it to exist, is called into action.</p>
                <p>(15.) Experience shews that the impressions conveyed by each nerve, or class of
                    nerves, are of different kinds, for they are capable of being readily
                    distinguished from one another by the percipient being whose brain receives
                    them. Hence he acquires a knowledge of the presence, of the situation, and of
                    the different properties of external bodies, which are the source of those
                    impressions. The nature of that power with which the nerves are endowed is such
                    as to convey the impressions from which this knowledge is derived, from the
                    external organ to the brain, with a velocity that exceeds all imagination. This
                    instantaneous transmission is evidently a provision of the highest importance
                    both for the welfare and preservation of the individual.</p>
                <p>(16.) The different powers of perception, corresponding to different qualities of
                    external objects, constitute the <hi rend="italic">external senses</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and each has its appropriate organ, furnished with its
                    separate system of nerves. The skin, which is the organ of <hi rend="italic"
                    >touch,</hi> receives the largest share of nerves, as it is evidently of the
                    greatest consequence that the surface of the body should receive impressions
                    from every substance with which it may happen to come in contact The nerves of
                    the skin are also susceptible of various impressions, besides those of mere
                    impulse or resistance from solid bodies. They are affected, for instance, by
                    variations of temperature; and when acted upon in any way that may be injurious
                    to the part impressed, or to the system generally, they give suitable warning to
                    the individual, by exciting a sense of pain. Hence he is admonished of impending
                    evil, and is incited to the prompt adoption of the means of averting it.</p>
                <p>(17.) Next in importance to the sense of touch are those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >sight</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">hearing</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                    for the communication of distinct impressions relating to these senses, a much
                    more refined apparatus is requisite than for that of touch. The structure of the
                    eye is calculated to combine, upon a thin expansion of nervous substance, the
                    <hi rend="italic">retina,</hi> the rays of light proceeding from distant
                    objects, so as to form a picture of these objects, and thus convey to the mind
                    an exact knowledge of the relative situation of all their parts that are within
                    the sphere of vision. Hence are derived the perceptions of their distance and
                    position with respect to the observer.</p>
                <p>(18.) In like manner are the sonorous undulations of the air collected into a
                    kind of focus by the structure of the ear, and impressed upon the sensitive
                    expansions of nervous matter in the inner regions of the organ. Thus an
                    important avenue of communication is opened with the external world, highly
                    useful in an infinite variety of ways.</p>
                <p>(19·) The existence and properties of various objects at a distance are also
                    recognized by the sense of <hi rend="italic">Smell,</hi> which enables us to
                    appreciate the presence of the subtle effluvia which they emit, and which affect
                    the atmosphere often to a considerable distance around. The olfactory nerves are
                    adapted to the impressions of this kind, and are situated on the surface of
                    those passages destined for the transmission of the air in subservience to
                    another function hereafter to be noticed, namely, that of respiration.</p>
                <p>(20.) The sense of <hi rend="italic">Taste</hi> is exercised on the substances
                    employed as aliment, and has its seat at the entrance of the passages
                    appropriated to the reception of food, and which are subservient to another
                    class of functions presently to be described.</p>
                <p>(21.) The faculty of Sensation consists merely in the excitation of a simple
                    mental change, known to every one, although incapable, in consequence of this
                    very character of simplicity, of either analysis or definition. With reference
                    to its physiology, we know that it is effected through the intermedium of
                    certain nerves, connected, on the one hand, with the organs on which impressions
                    of various kinds are made by the physical action of external objects, and on the
                    other, with those parts of the brain, of which the physical affections are, by
                    some inscrutable link, connected with the affections of the soul, or sentient
                    principle. These simple and preliminary phenomena, composed of both physical and
                    mental changes, are to be carefully distinguished from those subsequent
                    operations that constitute perception, thought, volition, and the whole series
                    of psychical phenomena, which we are in the habit of referring to a distinct
                    branch of human knowledge, and which is generally denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metaphysics, Psychology,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of
                    Mind</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in contradistinction to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physics, Somatology,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Matter.
                    .</hi></p>
                <p>(22.) There can be little doubt that these operations, which we are naturally
                    accustomed to consider as being purely of a mental character, are, in some
                    unknown degree, connected with physical changes taking place in the cerebral
                    substance; but as we are utterly unconscious of these changes, and as we are
                    totally precluded from arriving at any knowledge of their nature, or even of
                    conceiving the manner in which a connexion between mind and matter has been
                    established, we are compelled, in this branch of the inquiry, to direct our
                    attention exclusively to the mental phenomena, to study their laws by the
                    evidence of our own consciousness, and to resort to processes of analysis and
                    methods of inductive investigation, in many respects different from <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193498627" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8627-0580"/> those which are
                    successfully employed in the more arable fields of physical science.</p>
                <p>Whenever we are fortunate enough to trace some portions of the mysterious but
                    broken thread which unites the material changes occurring in our bodily organs,
                    with the operations of the intellect, or the affections of the soul, we may then
                    occasionally re-enter the territory of Physiology; and while the two sciences
                    arc thus capable of being studied in conjunction, they will derive mutual
                    advantage and illumination.</p>
                <p>(23.) Yet, with regard to the mere physiological study of the animal functions,
                    it cannot escape our observation, that a vast variety of phenomena in the
                    economy have a direct reference to the mental constitution of our nature, and
                    are to be studied, with relation to final causes, in immediate connexion with
                    these objects. Thus, although the special purposes served by the multiplicity,
                    the curious arrangement, and intricate structure of the parts of the brain, are
                    as yet wholly unknown, and as we still are, and shall probably ever remain, in
                    utter darkness as to the mode in which they perform their respective offices as
                    instruments of perception, thought, and volition, yet when we return to the
                    observation of the bodily actions consequent on these mental processes, as well
                    as contributing to their performance, we are enabled to resume our physiological
                    inquiries, and trace the continuity of design in the exercise of the faculties
                    of voluntary motion, by which the mind exerts a power of reacting on matter,
                    employs its properties for beneficial ends, and exercises that partial dominion
                    over nature, which has been granted to it by the Divine Author of its being. The
                    possession of voluntary motion is directed, first, to enlarge the sphere of our
                    perceptions, by directing our organs of sense to their respective objects;
                    secondly, to bring the objects themselves within the reach of those organs by
                    which they are to be examined; thirdly, to alter their forms and combinations,
                    and modify them in various ways, so that the mind may, from these different
                    modes of examination, derive accurate and extensive information of their
                    properties, and apply these properties to use; and lastly, to effect the
                    locomotion of the whole body, and thus extend widely the range of its
                    operations, and spread the dominion of man over every kingdom of nature, and
                    over every region of the globe.</p>
                <p>(24.) But the relations of man with the external world comprehend a much larger
                    and more important field, since they are not limited to the sphere of the
                    material world, but embrace the intellectual and moral existences of other
                    percipient and sentient beings. Through the intermedium of signs, the results of
                    movements of our bodily organs acting on the senses, communications are
                    established, not merely between mind and matter, but between mind and mind.
                    Mutual interchanges take place, of thoughts, of opinions, of feelings, and of
                    affections; and the value of existence is, to an incalculable degree, augmented
                    by the operations of sympathy, the impulses of benevolence, and all the potent
                    and benign influences of social union. Hence, physiologically considered, the
                    function of the voice, and its modulation into articulate sounds, ranks as an
                    important part of the animal economy.</p>
                <p>(25.) The faculty of <hi rend="italic">Voluntary Motion,</hi> like that of
                    Sensation, is derived from the peculiar properties of the nervous substance. In
                    the instance of sensation impressions are conveyed by means of the nerves from
                    the external organs of sense to the general centreof the sensitive faculty, the
                    brain. A similar power, we find, is exercised, though in a contrary direction,
                    in transmitting the actions arising from the determinations of Volition, and
                    which produce their first effects on the brain, towards those parts which are
                    capable of executing these determinations. Modern discoveries have shewn, that
                    for this latter purpose sets of nervous fibres are employed different from those
                    instrumental in conveying sensitive impressions from the organs of sense to the
                    brain. Hence a distinction is established between the <hi rend="italic">Nerves
                    of Sensation,</hi> and the nerves of motion, or the <hi rend="italic">Motor
                    Nerves.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We would
                    suggest the propriety of designating these two classes of nerves respectively,
                    by the terms <hi rend="italic">Sensiferous</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voluntiferous</hi> as more distinctly expressing their proper
                    functions.</p></note> While the nerves of sensation should properly be
                    considered as commencing at the organs of sense, and terminating in the brain,
                    the nerves subservient to volition have their proper origin in the brain, and
                    proceed thence to the organs of motion. Let us next examine in what these organs
                    of motion consist.</p>
                <p>(26.) The principal source of motion, in the animal body, resides in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Muscles,</hi> which taken altogether, usually compose by far the
                    largest part of the bulk of the animal. Muscles consist of a collection of
                    fleshy fibres, proceeding for the most part in parallel directions, and
                    extending from the two points in the limb, or parts of the body, which are
                    designed to be brought nearer to each other. The fibres of which the muscles are
                    composed are endowed with the remarkable property of contracting, under certain
                    circumstances, with prodigious power, so as to move the parts to which they are
                    attached with sudden and enormous force. The impulse given to them by the nerves
                    of volition, by which they are connected with the brain, in every effort of
                    volition, excites them to contraction, and produces those movements of the body
                    which are the objects of that volition.</p>
                <p>(27.) The movements required for the purposes of animal life, are of course
                    infinitely diversified in their kind, and scarcely admit of any distinct
                    classification. Amongst the objects of these movements, however, we may notice
                    two, which are of essential importance; the first is that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Locomotion,</hi> the second that of <hi rend="italic">Prehension.</hi></p>
                <p>(28.) Locomotion is one of the faculties more particularly distinctive of animal
                    life in opposition to that of vegetable. Plants are more or less rooted to the
                    soil where they originally sprung: animals, destined to a wider sphere of
                    action, arc endowed with the power of transporting their bodies from place to
                    place, on the one hand, of pursuing, and on the other, of flying from pursuit;
                    of choosing their habitations, or of changing regions and climes according to
                    their wants or necessities.</p>
                <p>(29∙) The power of detaining and laying hold of objects, is another mode in which
                    the faculty of voluntary motion may be highly advantageous to the animal
                    possessing it. With these may be associated the various actions requisite for
                    defence or attack, rendered necessary by the conflicts incident to their
                    condition.</p>
                <p>(30.) For the performance of all these actions, there is required in the first
                    place, a solid and unyielding structure, capable of sustaining the weight of the
                    body, and of furnishing to the muscles or agents of motion, fixed points of
                    attachment. The <hi rend="italic">bones,</hi> the union of which constitutes the
                    <hi rend="italic">skeleton,</hi> are provided for these objects. They are formed
                    into separate pieces, with a view to their being moveable upon one another.
                    Their extremities are connected together by smooth surfaces, which are bound
                    together by firm bands or <hi rend="italic">ligaments,</hi> bracing them on the
                    sides where they are exposed to the greatest strain. An apparatus of this kind
                    constitutes a <hi rend="italic">joint.</hi></p>
                <p>(31.) The due performance of these mechanical objects, implies a variety of
                    subsidiary contrivances and adjustments, too diversified in their nature and
                    objects to admit ofparticu-lar specification. It is evident that the particular
                    texture of each part must be adapted to the actions it has to perform.
                    Flexibility and compressibility are required in one organ; rigidity and hardness
                    in another. Some parts must readily yield to an extending force, others must
                    resist such a force with extraordinary tenacity. Some must exert elastic<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193498640" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8640-0581"/> power, others
                    must be devoid of this quality. Some textures must be permeable to fluids,
                    others must deny them all transmission. Hence, the variety of structures
                    composing the mechanical frame-work of the system.</p>
                <p>(32.) But in all the variations of conformation, it would appear that nature has
                    employed the same ultimate structure as the basis of her work All the solid
                    parts of the animal fabric are formed of fibres, variously united and
                    interwoven; in some cases only loosely connected, so as to constitute a spongy
                    or cellular mass, flexible in every direction, and forming a medium of connexion
                    between adjacent parts of various degrees of cohesion. This substance, which is
                    found universally to pervade the body, is termed the <hi rend="italic">cellular
                    substance</hi> or <hi rend="italic">texture.</hi> It is eminently endowed with
                    elasticity, and thus contributes essentially to preserve the natural figure of
                    every organ, and to restore it to its proper situation, after any displacement
                    by a foreign cause.</p>
                <p>(33.) When condensed into a firmer layer or sheet of animal matter, the same
                    substance assumes the form of <hi rend="italic">membrane,</hi> and is
                    extensively employed as such, to supply organs with external coverings, or to
                    afford them attachments to surrounding parts for the purpose of protection and
                    support. Membranes are also used as barriers, for intercepting the communication
                    of fluid from one cavity to another; and they are also employed to form
                    receptacles for the retention of fluids, and tubes for conveying them from one
                    part of the system to another.</p>
                <p>(34.) The fibrous structures, comprehending <hi rend="italic">ligaments,
                    tendons,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fasciae,</hi> are composed of still a denser
                    approximation of fibres, are endowed with a higher degree of toughness and
                    strength, and are capable of exerting great resistance to any stretching force.
                    Hence, they are extensively employed in the construction of parts where these
                    properties are required.</p>
                <p>(35.) The organs specially appropriated to touch, are generally also those of
                    prehension: and progressive motion is accomplished by means of limbs, which act
                    either upon the ground, the waters, or the air, according to the element in
                    which the animal resides. But, in order to give proper effect to these
                    movements, the agency of levers is required; and we accordingly find a provision
                    made for this purpose in the construction of the bones, which, as we have before
                    observed, are capable of supplying the fulcra or fixed centres of motion, and
                    allow of the application of the moving powers. It often happens that the actual
                    attachment of muscles to the points required to be moved, would be attended with
                    inconvenience. In this case, an intermediate structure is employed, analogous to
                    that of a ligament, but here denominated a <hi rend="italic">tendon,</hi>
                    serving as a strap to connect the muscle to a distant bone, or other part on
                    which the action of the muscle is to be exerted.</p>
                <p>(36.) All the functions, which have for their object some mechanical effort of
                    the kind we have now described, may be comprehended under the general head of
                    the <hi rend="italic">mechanical functions.</hi></p>
                <p>(37.) The consideration of the chemical condition of the animal system,
                    introduces us to a class of functions of a totally different nature from any of
                    the preceding, yet equally essential to the maintenance of life. The solids and
                    fluids of which organized structures are composed, differ materially in their
                    chemical constitution from the products of the mineral kingdom. Their elements
                    are combined by a much more complicated arrangement, and united by less powerful
                    affinities; or rather the balance of affinities, by which they are held
                    together, is more easily destroyed, and thus, proneness to decomposition is
                    constantly present. One of the most remarkable and important of the operations
                    of the vital functions, is to repress this tendency to decomposition; for no
                    sooner is life extinct, than we find both the solids and fluids of the body
                    hastening to assume new forms and combinations of their elements; and nothing
                    can now prevent the final disorganisation of that fabric which so lately
                    delighted the eye with its beauty, and in which dwelt the genial warmth of life,
                    and the elastic vigour of youth. If we watch the progress of those changes which
                    take place in the body, we shall find it characterised by a perpetual renovation
                    of materials, continual losses of substance on the one part, being compensated
                    by an equally constant supply on the other. From an atom of imperceptible
                    minuteness we trace its gradual increase of size, by the reception of nutritious
                    matter from without, by the incorporation of this matter with that which had
                    before existed, by the consolidation of the fluid, by the extension of the solid
                    parts. We see all the organs expanding by a slow, but uniform increase, and in
                    regular proportion, till they arrive at a certain limit. Having attained this
                    limit, the body remains stationary for a certain period; that is, the waste of
                    substance is exactly compensated by the supplies furnished by the food received
                    into the body. At length, however, the compensation is less perfectly
                    maintained; the powers which carry on the functions begin to decline, the solids
                    dry up and harden, and a general torpor gradually pervades the system. Life is
                    sooner or later brought to a close by the natural progress of these changes,
                    even if its course be not sooner arrested by causes of an accidental nature.</p>
                <p>(38.) The functions of nutrition embrace a class of operations, destined to
                    supply the materials wanted for the growth of the body, and for the supply of
                    those materials which either may have been expended in the natural exercise of
                    the other functions, or lost in various ways, or else employed in the reparation
                    of injuries, which the organs may have accidentally sustained. The nutritive, or
                    as they may also be termed the <hi rend="italic">chemical functions,</hi> since
                    they relate to the chemical condition of the body, comprehend a long series of
                    processes, which, in order to study them successfully, require many successive
                    subdivisions.</p>
                <p>The first division includes all those functions which contribute to the reduction
                    of the food to a substance of similar chemical composition with the materials of
                    which the body already consists; processes which are comprehended under the
                    general term of <hi rend="italic">Assimilation.</hi></p>
                <p>The second and third divisions relate to the collection of the nutriment thus
                    prepared, or assimilated, into a general reservoir; and its subsequent
                    distribution throughout the body, so as to admit of being applied to use
                    whenever it may be wanted. These objects are attained by the functions of <hi
                    rend="italic">Absorption</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">Circulation.</hi></p>
                <p>A fourth division refers to the purification of the general mass of nutritious
                    fluid existing in the great reservoir of the body, by the separation of its
                    superfluous combustible portion, and more especially of its carbon; a change
                    which is effected by the function of <hi rend="italic">Respiration.</hi></p>
                <p>The last division of this class of functions comprehends the several processes by
                    which certain materials are separated from the blood in a solid or fluid form;
                    some with a view to their final expulsion from the system, some to answer
                    purposes connected with other functions, and the remaining part being expended
                    in repairing the waste which the solids of the body undergo in the exercise of
                    their respective offices. To the former of these functions the term of <hi
                    rend="italic">Secretion</hi> is applied; whilst the last is more especially
                    regarded as the proper and final process of <hi rend="italic">Nutrition.</hi> We
                    shall examine each of these divisions more particularly.</p>
                <p>(39∙) Assimilation is effected by a long series of processes, which are partly of
                    a mechanical and partly of a chemical nature. The food taken into the mouth is
                    first masticated by the action of the teeth and jaws, so as to break down the
                    cohesion of its parts, and prepare it for the chemical action of the fluids to
                    which it is afterwards to be subjected. There is at the same time added to it a
                    quantity of liquid, termed the <hi rend="italic">saliva,</hi> prepared by a set
                    of glands, to be hereafter specified, and poured out into the mouth in <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193498653" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8653-0582"/> large quantities
                    during the act of mastication. By these means the food is softened in its
                    texture, and reduced to the form of a pulp, in which state it is swallowed, by
                    the organs of deglutition, and conveyed through a tube called the <hi
                    rend="italic">oesophagus</hi> into the <hi rend="italic">stomach.</hi> The
                    stomach is a capacious bag, or receptacle, capable of holding a considerable
                    quantity of food, and of retaining it for a certain period. The inner membrane
                    which lines the cavity of the stomach prepares a fluid termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">gastric juice,</hi> which acts chemically upon the food in that
                    cavity, while this food is at the same time subjected to a degree of pressure
                    from the action of a set of muscular fibres which are interposed hetween the
                    interior and exterior coats of the stomach. The food is also slowly moved by the
                    successive contractions of these muscles, so that every part of it comes in its
                    turn to be acted upon by the gastric juice, until the whole is converted into a
                    soft and smooth mass of uniform consistence which is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >chyme ς</hi> the operation itself by which this conversion is effected being
                    termed <hi rend="italic">digestiorι.</hi></p>
                <p>(40.) The aliment thus digested, or reduced to the state of chyme, passes onwards
                    from an orifice at the farther end of the stomach into a tube of great length,
                    several portions of which have received different names, but which are comprised
                    under the general term of the <hi rend="italic">intestines.</hi> In the first
                    portion, the <hi rend="italic">duodenum,</hi> the aliment undergoes still
                    further changes; it is mixed with two fluids, the one called the6z7e, which is
                    prepared by a large glandular organ, termed the <hi rend="italic">liver</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the other called the <hi rend="italic">pancreatic
                    juice,</hi> prepared by another gland, the <hi rend="italic">pancreas.</hi>
                    Secretions also take place from the inner membrane of the intestines themselves,
                    and the result of the united action of all these fluids, aided by the movements
                    imparted to the aliment by the contractions of the muscular fibres contained in
                    the coats of the intestines, is gradually to convert part of what was chyme into
                    a new substance called <hi rend="italic">chyle,</hi> which is the most
                    nutritious portion of the aliment, and has the appearance of a milky fluid. The
                    chyle is received into a set of very minute tubes called <hi rend="italic"
                    >lacteals,</hi> which are exceedingly numerous, and arise by open mouths from
                    the inner surface of the duodenum and its prolongations, <hi rend="italic">the
                    jejunum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ileum.</hi> They collect the chyle together,
                    and pour it into an intermediate receptacle, whence it is conveyed along a large
                    tube, called the <hi rend="italic">thoracic duct,</hi> into other cavities, of
                    which we shall presently speak. That portion of the chyme which is not converted
                    into chyle, descends into the lower portions of the intestinal canal, is
                    collected in the larger intestines, of which the <hi rend="italic">colon</hi> is
                    the principal one, and finally ejected from the body.</p>
                <p>(41.) The next step in the assimilatory process is the conversion of the chyle
                    into blood, a change which has been termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >sanguification.</hi> It is in the great system of vessels which contain the
                    blood already formed, and in the course of the passages through which the blood
                    is moved, that this gradual change is effected. The great reservoir of this
                    important fluid, on which the nutrition of every part of the body, and its
                    maintenance in a state of action, immediately depend, is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >heart.</hi> The thoracic duct opens into one of the veins or tubes leading
                    directly to the heart; the chyle is therefore immediately conducted into this
                    reservoir, and thoroughly mixed with the general mass of food.</p>
                <p>(42.) The heart is a powerful muscular organ; from its cavity arise the trunks of
                    large tubes, called <hi rend="italic">arteries,</hi> which subdivide and ramify
                    as they proceed in their course to every part of the body, being distributed in
                    abundance to every organ, with a very few exceptions. No sooner are the cavities
                    of the heart distended with blood, than the muscular structure which surrounds
                    their cavities contract with enormous force, and propel their fluid contents
                    through the system of arteries, sending it in one great wave, even to the
                    extremities of its minutest ramifications. From these extremities of the
                    arteries it passes into corresponding branches of another set of vessels, the
                    <hi rend="italic">veins,</hi> which proceed in the opposite direction, towards
                    the heart, uniting in their course into larger and larger trunks, till they
                    reach the heart, to which they deliver back the portion of blood that has thus
                    percolated through every part of the body. No sooner has it again filled the
                    cavities of the heart, than it is again sent with renewed force into the same
                    arterial channels, and again brought back by the veins. The functions by which
                    this circular course is given to the blood, is termed <hi rend="italic">the
                    circulation.</hi></p>
                <p>(43.) The blood, in the course of its circulation, furnishes to all the organs
                    the materials which are necessary for their growth, for the renovation of their
                    powers, and for the supply of those fluids and other animal products which are
                    wanted in various parts of the economy. The separation of these fluids, and’the
                    formation of these peculiar animal products, are the objects of another
                    function, that of <hi rend="italic">secretion.</hi> Particular organs are in
                    most eases provided for the purpose of effecting these processes. These are the
                    glands, which are variously constructed according to the particular offices they
                    have to perform; each is furnished with an elaborate apparatus of vessels; and
                    the fluid which is formed by them, is generally conducted to the place of its
                    destination by a pipe, or <hi rend="italic">excretory duct,</hi> as it is
                    termed.</p>
                <p>(44.) The fluids which are thus separated from thehlood are, for the most part,
                    applied· to useful purposes in different parts of the economy; some for the
                    repair of that loss of substance in the part of the body incident to the
                    exercise of their respective functions, others for different subsidiary purposes
                    related to those functions. The substance of the bones, for example, undergoes a
                    gradual change during the whole of life; each particle is removed in succession
                    and is replaced by others, so that in the course of time the whole substance of
                    the body undergoes renovation. Two important functions are called into action
                    for the completion of these processes; the first of these is concerned in the
                    removal of the old and decayed materials; the second, in the due application of
                    those which are to replace them.</p>
                <p>(45.) The removal of those particles which have become useless, and whose
                    presence might be injurious, is effected by a distinct set of vessels, called
                    <hi rend="italic">lymphatics.</hi> The lymphatics are met with in almost every
                    part of the body; and resemble, both in structure and mode of distribution, the
                    lacteal vessels already described. The mode of their origin is not well
                    ascertained, but, like the lacteals, the smaller branches successively unite
                    into trunks, which terminate either in the thoracic duct, or into the larger
                    veins leading directly to the heart. Through these channels, then, it is that
                    all the particles which require removal are conveyed away, and deposited into
                    the general mass of circulating fluids. The function thus performed by the
                    lymphatics in common with the lacteals, is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >absorption.</hi></p>
                <p>(46.) The function having for its object the reparation of the substance of the
                    different organs, is designated by the general name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nutrition.</hi> It includes the developement and growth of the parts, and their
                    maintenance in the healthy state, that is the state in which they are fitted for
                    the exercise of their several functions; as well as the restoration of what they
                    may have lost from accidental causes, such as mechanical injuries.</p>
                <p>When a bone is broken, for instance, a solid union is by degrees effected by the
                    deposit of new ossifie materials, consisting chiefly of phosphat of lime, which
                    is secreted or separated from the blood by the irritated vessels in the
                    neighbourhood of the injury. In all these cases the absorbents are also at work
                    in modelling the shape of the part to be restored, in removing all roughnesses
                    or angular projections, and making room for the new formations which are to take
                    place. The functions of absorption and nutrition are thus, in some respects,
                    opposed to each other, producing contrary effects, though both co-operating in
                    the accomplishment of one final purpose, and balanced and adjusted <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193498666" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8666-0583"/> to one another
                    with that manifest intention. The general bulk of the body, and of its parts,
                    varies according to the predominance of the one or the other of these actions of
                    absorption and nutrition; wasting when the former is in excess; thriving and
                    enlarging when the latter prevails.</p>
                <p>(47.) There is one peculiar mode in which superabundant nutrition manifests
                    itself. When the supply of nutriment is greater than what the wants of the
                    system require, the superfluous portion is converted into an oily fluid, which
                    is laid up in store for future use. This fluid is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fat</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it is accumulated in various parts of the
                    body, and especially between the skin and the muscles, and in other places,
                    where it may also serve a subsidiary purpose of mechanical protection against
                    inequalities of pressure. The fat is thus useful as a soft cushion on which
                    delicate organs, such as the eye, may move in security; and also as a convenient
                    material for filling up hollows in various unoccupied situations. The chief use,
                    however, of large accumulations of fat, is to serve as a magazine of nutriment,
                    out of which the body may be supported in those seasons when the supply of food
                    is deficient, and more particularly during those periods which are, by some
                    animals, passed in a state of complete inactivity. This is the case in those
                    animals which are said to <hi rend="italic">hybernate,</hi> or continue during
                    the whole of winter in a perfectly torpid state.</p>
                <p>(48.) Whilst some of the products of secretion are thus employed in nutrition,
                    others are subservient to the functions of particular organs. Thus, the tears
                    are useful in washing away from the surface of the eye, dust, and other
                    materials which might obstruct vision; the gastric juice is subservient to
                    digestion; and the mucilaginous secretion of the wind-pipe and nostrils defend
                    those passages from the acrimony of the air. But, in other cases, these secreted
                    matters have noxious qualities; and it is the object of their separation from
                    the blood, to get rid of them altogether. This is the case with the secretions
                    from the kidneys, and from the skin, and perhaps, also, partly with that from
                    the liver. These are termed the <hi rend="italic">excretions,</hi> in
                    contradistinction to the proper <hi rend="italic">secretions,</hi> and the
                    organs which separate them are termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >emunctories.</hi></p>
                <p>(49∙) The organs which, in this sense of the term, must be considered as the
                    principal emunctory of the body are the <hi rend="italic">lungs.</hi> It would
                    appear that the blood, from which the animal solids and fluids derive their
                    nourishment, contains a larger proportion of carbon than what is required for
                    the formation and reparation of these solids and fluids; the elements abstracted
                    from the blood by the processes of secretion and nutrition, being principally
                    oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen.</p>
                <p>The continuance of these processes must tend therefore, to produce an
                    accumulation of carbon in the blood; and accordingly we find that this fluid, in
                    the course of its circulation, gradually acquires a darker colour. From being of
                    a vivid scarlet hue in the trunks of the arteries, it has changed to a dark
                    purple by the time it has reached the veins. It is returned to the heart,
                    therefore, in a state unfit for the purposes of nutrition, and not proper to be
                    again circulated through the vessels of the body. In order to restore it to its
                    original state, it is necessary to deprive it of the ingredient it contains in
                    excess, that is, of carbon, which, when thus present in the blood, is found to
                    exert a positively deleterious power on the parts to which it is applied.</p>
                <p>For this purpose the blood is transmitted by an appropriate system of arteries,
                    to the lungs, where it is exposed to the influence of atmospheric air,
                    alternately received into, and expelled from that organ. By a process which
                    appears to be analogous to slow combustion, the superfluous carbon of the blood
                    combines with the oxygen of the atmospheric air, and is expelled, in the form of
                    carbonic acid gas, along with the air expired. The blood thus purified, and
                    restored to its salutary qualities, is conducted back again, by a corresponding
                    set of veins, to the heart, and is again sent, by the contractions of that
                    organ, into the arteries of the body, and performs the same round of circulation
                    as before. <hi rend="italic">Respiration,</hi> which is the title of the
                    function we have now been describing, completes this class, which we have termed
                    the chemical functions of the economy.</p>
                <p>(50.) The three classes of functions we have been reviewing, namely, the <hi
                    rend="italic">mechanical,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">chemical,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">sensitive,</hi> relate only to the preservation and welfare of the
                    individual alone. But as nature has assigned a limit to the duration of life, it
                    became necessary that a provision should be made for the multiplication of
                    individuals, and the conservation of the race. Such, then, is the object of a
                    fourth class of functions, namely the <hi rend="italic">reproductive
                    functions,</hi> including the processes of <hi rend="italic">fecundation,</hi>
                    of <hi rend="italic">evolution,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">gestation,</hi> and of
                    <hi rend="italic">parturition,</hi> and the auxiliary function of <hi
                    rend="italic">lactation,</hi> provided for the supply of the new-born infant
                    with nourishment adapted to the tender condition of its organs of
                    assimilation.</p>
                <p>(51.) Having studied the phenomena and the circumstances which lay the
                    foundations of individual existence, the physiologist has next to occupy himself
                    with the consideration of the long series of changes which intervene between the
                    cradle and the grave, and constitute the “strange eventful history” of the
                    physical life of man. He follows the rise and developement of the several
                    organs, and the occasions on which their functions are called forth: he notices
                    their entry on the stage of life, in which they are destined to play more or
                    less important parts; he watches their progress, maturity, and decay, till they
                    finally disappear from the scene, when their functions having successively
                    declined, and passed away, the vital spark becomes extinguished, and the curtain
                    drops on the fleeting drama of our probationary existence. A multitude of
                    interesting subjects press on his attention in this division of his subject, so
                    replete with wonder, and so calculated to impress 11s with exalted ideas of
                    divine prescience, and of the unbounded resources of creative power.</p>
                <p>To this department of physiology properly belong, first, the history of the
                    changes which take place in the organs, during their natural course of
                    developement, in what has been styled their <hi rend="italic">normal
                    condition,</hi> such as the formation of the vital organs, the process of
                    ossification, the general growth of the body, the changes occurring at the
                    period of puberty, the slow but sure progress of consolidation attending the
                    decline of life, and the successive decay and obliteration of the faculties
                    which precede death; and, secondly, the study of phenomena exhibiting the
                    operation of those powers of repair and renovation, which exist in the
                    constitution, and which are called forth only on certain occasions, when the
                    organization has been injured or destroyed, or when the functions have been
                    deranged or suspended, by various accidental causes.</p>
                <p>(52.) These topics introduce to our notice the varieties which are observable in
                    different classes of individuals in the general mode in which the functions are
                    performed with reference to their balance, or relative preponderance: conditions
                    which constitute the different <hi rend="italic">temperaments,</hi> as they are
                    called, and which are severally characterised by peculiar external
                    indications.</p>
                <p>(53.) Physiology, lastly, comprehends within the scope of its inquiries, those
                    more strongly marked diversities that are met with in the inhabitants of
                    different regions of the globe, and which appear to form separate races of
                    mankind. These constitutional peculiarities, as shown by differences both in
                    external conformation, and in the internal endowments of an intellectual and
                    moral nature, are of so distinct and permanent a character, as to have suggested
                    the hypo-pothesis of their indicating, in a zoological sense, not merely
                    varieties of a single species, but several different species of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Man.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498679" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8679-0584"/>
                <p>(54.) The present treatise is intended to exhibit a condensed view of the actual
                    state of our knowledge on all the subjects comprised in the above outline, and
                    to conclude with a review of the progressive history of the science from the
                    earliest periods to the present time.</p>
                <p>(55.) It is hardly necessary to remark, that the province of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physiology,</hi> is restricted to the consideration of the phenomena of the
                    living body in its perfectly <hi rend="italic">normal</hi> or healthy state:
                    while those which are presented when these limits of healthy action are passed,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">abnormal,</hi> or diseased state commences, are the
                    subjects of another branch of science, denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pathology,</hi> no less interesting and important than the former, as
                    furnishing the principles by which the art of medicine derives all its powers;
                    but which, it must be obvious, must have its foundations laid in an extensive
                    and correct knowledge of <hi rend="italic">physiology.</hi></p>
                <p>(56.) It is evident that the foundations of all physiological knowledge must be
                    laid in a thorough acquaintance with the structure or internal mechanism of
                    animals. The study of anatomy, indeed, derives its chief interest from its
                    connexion with physiology; for unless viewed with reference to their uses, or
                    subserviency to par ticular purposes, the examination of the forms and
                    properties of the parts of a machine would be a barren and an irksome task. Let
                    us imagine, for example, a person, who had never seen a ship, and had no idea of
                    the object for which it is intended, to visit it for the first time, and to be
                    at liberty to examine at his leisure every part of its rigging and internal
                    construction. A restless curiosity might indeed lead him to handle the ropes and
                    blocks, and climb upon every mast; to descend between the decks, and minutely
                    inspect every part of its fabric; to explore, in a word, the whole anatomy of
                    this most stupendous product of human ingenuity. But his labour would avail him
                    nothing. The most complete survey would afford him no instruction, or leave any
                    distinct impression as long as he had no principle to connect them in his mind.
                    But let him review the same objects with an experienced guide, instructing him,
                    as he proceeds, with the general purposes of the whole machine, and the
                    particular uses of every part, as well as the mode in which they operate and
                    concur in the production of the intended effect. ’Then it is that he will feel a
                    real interest in the examination: then it is that he will attach due importance
                    to each part of the inquiry. Perceiving the relations which connect the objects,
                    and understanding the functions of the several instruments he sees, he is no
                    longer perplexed and bewildered; individual facts arrange themselves in a
                    natural order, and the whole forms in his mind one connected system of
                    knowledge, readily retained and easily communicated.</p>
                <p>The case is perfectly similar with regard to the body of an animal, of which
                    anatomy lays open to us the structure. Dissection can only shew us that it
                    consists of various parts, some hard, some soft, and others fluid. The harder
                    parts, such as the bones, are of various forms, perforated by numerous
                    apertures, andjoined together in differentways. The softparts are found to be
                    composed of various kinds of textures, of which the elements appear to be
                    collections of fibres or plates, curiously disposed and interwoven, so as to
                    constitute a cellular or spongy tissue, and, occasionally, more extended layers
                    of membrane. In every part we find innumerable tubes and passages, branching out
                    and again uniting, in an infinite variety of ways. We arrive at cavities of
                    different formsand extent, enclosing organs of various descriptions, or
                    containing fluids which pass through appropriate channels of communication to
                    very distant parts; composing altogether a vast and complicated system of
                    mechanical and hydraulic apparatus. Thus whilst we confine our attention to the
                    mere anatomy, all is perplexity and confusion; we are overwhelmed by the
                    multiplicity of objects, and lost in the immense mass of unconnected detail. But
                    no sooner do we study the parts of the animal frame with reference to their
                    uses, and their subserviency to the several functions of the living body, than
                    the whole appears under a new aspect. Aided by the light of physiology, we trace
                    order and connexion in every part, and gather increasing delight and instruction
                    as we proceed. The requisite adaptation of the organs to their respective
                    offices, and the correspondence established between these offices, by which they
                    concur in the same ultimate object, must ever excite our most profound
                    admiration, and exalt our ideas of that infinite intelligence which planned, and
                    that transcendent power and beneficence which executed the vast and magnificent
                    system of creation.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II, APPLICATIONS OF PHYSIOLOGY.</p>
                <p>(57.) Physiology claims our attention, not merely as an ornamental branch of
                    speculative knowledge, butas a science of immediate and vast practical utility.
                    Numerous are the occasions on which a scientific knowledge of the structure of
                    our own bodies, and of the operations that are carried on within us, is highly
                    valuable to its possessor; and more especially if combined with the more
                    enlarged views derived from the study of comparative physiology. It may be
                    useful here to point out some of the most important applications of
                    physiological knowledge.</p>
                <p>(58.) It is scarcely necessary to dwell on the utility of a knowledge of anatomy,
                    enlightened by physiology, in its application to the art of medicine; for the
                    very foundations of that art must be laid by these sciences. It is, however,
                    proper to advert to the limited advantage which would accrue from such
                    application if those sciences were confined to the human structure and the human
                    functions, instead of comprehending within its range the whole of the animal
                    creation. All the important discoveries of modern times with regard to the
                    economy of the human body have been derived from observations made on the lower
                    animals. That of the circulation χjf the blood, for instance, which has
                    immortalised the name of Harvey, was obtained principally from this source. John
                    Hunter, one of the greatest benefactors to the healing art in modern times, was
                    so deeply impressed with the necessity of an extended study of comparative
                    physiology, that he devoted his whole life to its cultivation, with an ardour
                    and a perseverance that have been rarely equalled, and never surpassed; as is
                    attested by the unrivalled museum of preparations in every department of
                    comparative anatomy, which he formed by his own unaided exertions, and which
                    will ever remain an imperishable monument to his fame.</p>
                <p>(59 ) The various combinations of faculties, which are met with in the different
                    tribes of animals, exhibit in a most striking manner the mutual dependence and
                    relations of the animal and vital functions. As if with the express intention of
                    assisting us in our physiological researches on the attributes of that vitality
                    which eludes our experimental investigations, nature offers to our view, in the
                    diversified structures of each successive order of animals, a series, as it
                    were, of varied experiments; and exhibits the several organs under every degree
                    of simplicity and complication of structures, and every possible mode of
                    combination. The application of all this knowledge comes home to our own bosoms;
                    for the human race is then viewed as composing a member of the great family of
                    nature; and we ourselves, as well as all the individuals of that race, are
                    placed under the governance of those general laws which regulate all animated
                    beings. Our deepest interests, our future comforts and enjoyments, our powers of
                    action, our intellectual existence, our capacities of feeling and of reasoning,
                    all that renders life desirable, nay, that very life itself, are wholly
                    dependent on the operation of those laws, and on the minutest results produced
                    by their varied combinations. In a word, we ourselves are animals, and nothing
                    that relates ever so remotely to animal life can be to us a matter of
                    indifference.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498692" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8692-0585"/>
                <p>(60.) Although the researches into comparative physiology necessarily imply a
                    knowledge of the forms and history of the different races of animals, it tends
                    to reflect, in its turn, the most important light on the science of zoology; and
                    more especially on that department which relates to the classification of
                    animals. All scientific knowledge must be founded on correct classification; but
                    in zoology a methodical arrangement is indispensable; for scarcely any progress
                    could be made without it. The number of animals in the habitable globe is
                    immense, while our faculties and means of observation are extremely limited. Of
                    insects alone, the number of distinct species which have been already determined
                    considerably exceeds one hundred thousand. Of the other classes of animals,
                    though less numerous, the catalogue of known species is at least half as great.
                    Each of these races of beings has its distinct and characteristic form, its
                    peculiar organization, habits, and faculties. It is obvious that if, at the
                    outset of our inquiries, we were to attempt describing, or even of taking an
                    inventory of all the living objects that presented themselves to our notice
                    without regard to any principle of order, our attention would soon be
                    distracted, and our memory overwhelmed by the confused accumulation of details;
                    and it would not be possible to deduce from them any useful result.
                    Classification affords the only clue which can extricate us from this
                    intellectual labyrinth, which can resolve this state of chaos, and reduce this
                    crude and indigested mass of materials into the form of regular science. It is
                    only by a methodical arrangement of objects that we can arrive at the perception
                    of the more extended relations which subsist among them, or establish general
                    propositions, embracing a multitude of subordinate facts, and capable of an
                    indefinite number of useful applications.</p>
                <p>(61.) In framing a system of classification of the animal kingdom, there are two
                    objects which we may have in view; first, that of being able readily to
                    ascertain the name of any animal which may present itself to our notice, and of
                    recognising its identity with a species already known and described; or,
                    secondly, that of becoming acquainted with the general nature and character of
                    the animal in question; with the affinities which it has with others of the same
                    class, and with the rank which it holds in the scale of animation. The first of
                    these objects is attained by what are called <hi rend="italic">artificial
                    methods</hi> of classification; the second by what are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >natural methods.</hi> Much error and confusion have prevailed in the reasonings
                    of naturalists from their neglecting to discriminate the respective objects of
                    these two kinds of methods, which nevertheless are perfectly distinct from each
                    other.</p>
                <p>(62.) In endeavouring to accomplish the first of these objects, we take, as it
                    were, an inventory of nature, we record all her productions, and follow her in
                    all her variations; we collect the fullest and most faithful description of
                    every known species, and assign to each a particular name.</p>
                <p>The end we have in view being simply to devise a ready method of identifying
                    animals, we follow a process of this kind. We first unite those species which
                    are most nearly allied to each other into one cenus. We observe, for example,
                    several species which have much resemblance to the stag; such as the rein-deer,
                    the elk, the roebuck, the fallow-deer, the axis, the muntjac, and several
                    others: we assemble all these into one genus, which we call the <hi
                    rend="italic">deer</hi> kind. By a similar process we form another genus of
                    animals resembling the bull; such as the buffalo, &amp;c. The genus <hi
                    rend="italic">antelope</hi> will, in like manner, comprehend the gazelle, the
                    chamois, the nylghau, the oryx, the saiga, the gnu, and a multitude of others.
                    In the same way, the <hi rend="italic">camel-leορard,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >goat, sheep, camel,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">musk,</hi> may be regarded as so
                    many generic terms, each including a number of different animals, distinct in
                    race, but similar in appearance. Having thus constituted the genera, we may
                    apply to them the same principle of generalization that we did to the species;
                    uniting them, according to their similitudes, into more comprehensive
                    assemblages. Thus the genera above mentioned, having many features of
                    resemblance, are considered as composing a tribe or order, to which Linnaeus has
                    given the name <hi rend="italic">of</hi><hi rend="italic">pecora.</hi></p>
                <p>(63.) We may continue this process till we have gone through the whole animal
                    kingdom; but it will then be necessary to adopt in some respects a contrary
                    method; and instead of ascending as we have done from particulars to generals,
                    to descend from generals to particulars. Regarding the animal kingdom as one
                    entire subject, we must partition it into provinces, and again subdivide these
                    into smaller portions. All these divisions and subdivisions must be founded upon
                    distinct variations of external organs, and must be characterised by concise
                    definitions, enumerating the leading circumstances common to all the animals
                    they comprehend, and by which they may be contrasted with those included in the
                    collateral divisions. The great primary divisions of the animal kingdom are the
                    <hi rend="italic">classes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the subdivisions of these
                    form the <hi rend="italic">orders;</hi> these comprehend the <hi rend="italic"
                    >genera,</hi> which again include the separate races or <hi rend="italic"
                    >species</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while the ultimate ramifications of the
                    system, expressive merely of diversities arising in the same race, constitute
                    what are called <hi rend="italic">varieties.</hi> By thus confining our
                    attention to a small number of essential characters, we are enabled to
                    ascertain, by a sort of analytical process, the name of any animal that we may
                    wish to examine or identify. We have converted our rude inventory into a
                    convenient dictionary of nature, where every object may be found at its
                    appropriate place. The characters of the classes resemble in their office the
                    initial letter of a word; the characters of the subsequent divisions that of the
                    succeeding letters, conducting us with certainty and precision to the place we
                    seek. The full developement of this method, and of the logic which should
                    regulate it, and its successful application to natural history, we owe to the
                    genius and industry of Linnaeus, to whom the science will ever have to record a
                    lasting obligation.</p>
                <p>(64.) But however perfectly we may have accomplished the purpose we had in view
                    in these artificial arrangements, it is impossible not to perceive that we have
                    obtained them by the sacrifice of that order which nature herself points out. A
                    strict adherence to any arbitrarily assumed principle of classification, is, in
                    truth, incompatible with the preservation of the natural affinities of animals.
                    Thus, in the system of Linnaeus, the order <hi rend="italic">primates,</hi>
                    among the mammalia, presents the incongruous association of man with monkeys,
                    lemurs, and bats. In the order <hi rend="italic">belluae,</hi> the horse is
                    placed by the side of the hog. The <hi rend="italic">firae</hi> offer us the
                    unnatural association of the sea], the dog, the bear, the opossum, the hedgehog,
                    and the mole, merely because these animals, in most respects totally dissimilar,
                    happen to agree in having the incisor teeth of a conical shape. The continual
                    violation of natural analogies, which is yet necessarily incident to all
                    artificial systems, has exposed them to much censure and ridicule, from those
                    who forget that the purpose for which they are framed, is that of convenient
                    reference, and that it is essential to arrangements adapted to that end, that
                    they should be arbitrary. As well might it be made the subject of complaint,
                    that, in a dictionary, words having very different meanings, are found placed in
                    juxtaposition.</p>
                <p>(65.) Cuvier has justly remarked that a perfect natural method should be the
                    expression of the science itself, that is, of its most general propositions. By
                    assembling animals in groups, according to their general resemblances in the
                    more important circumstances of their organization and functions, we are enabled
                    to connect them under one description, and afterwards apply to each individual
                    species all the particulars comprised in this description, and thus we obtain
                    more <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498705" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8705-0586"/>or less
                    comprehensive statements, or, as it were, zoological laws, enabling us both to
                    acquire and to retain the facts with greater facility, and to apply them with
                    readiness in every case; in a word, it gives us the entire command of that
                    knowledge, by imparting to it the form of science. The tribe <hi rend="italic"
                    >ciï</hi><hi rend="italic">pecora,</hi> formerly mentioned, may be taken as an
                    excellent example of a natural family of animals; for they consist of species
                    which bear a striking resemblance with one another in form, organization, and
                    manners. If we meet with a new animal having one or two of the leading
                    characters of this tribe, we deduce at once all the most important features of
                    its history. We know, for instance, from its possessing a double hoof, that it
                    belongs to this tribe, and consequently that it feeds on herbage, that it has
                    four stomachs, and that it ruminates its food; that it belongs to a species
                    disposed to assemble in flocks or herds, and that it has a disposition to be
                    domesticated. We may pronounce that its upper jaw has no incisor teeth, and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>(66.) It is evident that from the discovery of these analogies, on which the
                    arrangement into natural families is founded, we must resort to the aid of
                    comparative physiology. It is this science alone that can teach us to
                    discriminate the circumstances which are of real importance in the animal
                    economy, and on which their very nature and character depend. The immense
                    progress which has been made in this branch of knowledge since the time of
                    Linnaeus, has enabled us to determine with much greater precision the relative
                    affinities of animals, and the rank which each tribe is entitled to hold in the
                    natural system of classification.</p>
                <p>(67.) Attempts have often been made to combine these two methods into one, by a
                    sort of mutual compromise between them, that is, by an arrangement partly
                    natural and partly artificial, to obtain the principal advantages of both. The
                    most perfect specimen of this union of the two methods is that of Duméril, which
                    he has published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Zoologie Analytique.</hi>
                    The characters on which his divisions are founded are distributed in a strictly
                    analytical order, and they conduct us to classes much more natural than those of
                    Linnaeus. Thus he divides the Linnaean class of insects into two, namely, <hi
                    rend="italic">Crustacea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">insects</hi> properly so
                    called. The very miscellaneous class of <hi rend="italic">vermes,</hi> in which
                    animals very dissimilar in their nature had been thrown together as it were in a
                    lumber closet, compose in this system the more natural assemblages of <hi
                    rend="italic">mollusea,</hi><hi rend="italic">vermes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >zoophytes.</hi> Duméril has pursued this plan throughout the whole of the
                    animal kingdom, reducing all the characters which lead to the determination of
                    classes, orders, families, and genera, to the form of synoptic tables.</p>
                <p>(68.) The arrangement which makes the nearest approach to a natural distribution
                    is that adopted by Cuvier, in his celebrated work entitled <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Régne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal</hi><hi rend="italic">Distribué</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">après</hi><hi rend="italic">son
                    Organization</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as it is founded chiefly on the
                    structure of the organs most essential to life, and having most influence in
                    determining the intelligence, sensibilities, activity, habits, and manners of
                    animals. Physiology is, in fact, the basis of Cuvier’s classification, for it
                    proceeds on the following principles.</p>
                <p>(69.) The powers of sensation and of voluntary motion being the chief attributes
                    of animal life, it follows that the organs of primary importance in the economy
                    are those which are immediately subservient to the performance of these
                    functions. They are, as we have seen, the organs composing the nervous system;
                    and the general form and distribution of the nervous system, therefore, should
                    lay the foundation of the primary divisions of the animal kingdom. There appear
                    to be four general types or models of structure of these organs presented in the
                    animal creation. The first consists of a brain, or large mass of nervous
                    substance, from which a cylindrical process, called the <hi rend="italic">spinal
                    marrow,</hi> is continued; and these are protected respectively by the bones of
                    the skull, and by a series of bones, called <hi rend="italic">vertebrae,</hi>
                    which form a jointed column along the whole length of the back. Animals formed
                    on this construction are called <hi rend="italic">vertebrated animals, a</hi>
                    division which comprehends all the higher classes of the animal kingdom, namely,
                    <hi rend="italic">mammalia, birds, reptiles,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>In the second form of the nervous system, there is properly but one central mass
                    of nervous substance, or brain, without any spinal marrow, and from this mass
                    filaments of nerves proceed, in various directions, to be distributed to all the
                    other parts. This division comprehends all the <hi rend="italic">mollusea,</hi>
                    including both the mollusea and testacea of Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>The third form is that of a longitudinal series of masses connected together by
                    lateral filaments, and sending out, as from so many centres, ramifications of
                    nerves. This structure is the distinctive mark of <hi rend="italic">articulated
                    animals,</hi> and may be recognised in insects, and worms properly so
                    called.</p>
                <p>The fourth and last division of Cuvier, he denominates <hi rend="italic">radiated
                    animals,</hi> in which, wherever nerves are found, they appear as a number of
                    equal masses disposed in a circle, and sending out fibres, which diverge like
                    rays from a common centre. Hence the whole body of the animal, or at least some
                    of its principal organs, has a radiated or star-like form. This is the case with
                    the <hi rend="italic">asterias, medusae, polypi,</hi> and all the other animals
                    comprehended under the name of zoophytes.</p>
                <p>As frequent reference will be made, in this treatise, to the zoological
                    classification of Cuvier, we shall here give a table of the principal divisions
                    which it comprises, together with examples of animals included in each
                    order.</p>

                <p>It has long been a favourite notion with speculative naturalists, that organized
                    beings might be arranged in a continued series, every part of which, like the
                    links of a chain, should be connected with that which preceded and that which
                    followed it. Linnaeus was even impressed with the idea that nature, in the
                    formation of animals, had never passed abruptly from one kind of structure to
                    another. But the idea of a chain, or continuous gradation of being, was
                    cherished with enthusiastic ardour by Bonnet, who, assuming man as the standard
                    of excellence, attempted to trace a regular series, descending from him to the
                    unorganized materials of the mineral world. Many other writers have adopted this
                    speculation; but none have carried it to a more extravagant length than Lamarck,
                    who blends it with the wildest and most absurd hypothesis that was ever devised,
                    to account for the diversities of animal structures. He conceives that there was
                    originally no distinction of species, but that each has, in the course of ages,
                    been derived from some other less perfect than itself, by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >spontaneous</hi> improvement in the race. He believes that the animalcula of
                    infusions gave birth, by successive transformations, to all other animals;
                    aquatic animals acquiring feet and legs, fitting them for walking on the ground,
                    and, after a time, being converted into wings, merely from the long continued
                    operation of a desire to walk or to fly.</p>
                <p>(70.) In support of the theory of continuous gradation many anomalous animals are
                    produced as instances of links of connexion between different classes of
                    animals. The bat has been regarded as one of these intermediate links between
                    mammalia and birds. The cetaceous tribe, including the <hi rend="italic">whale,
                    cachalot, dolphin,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">narwhal,</hi> though properly
                    belonging to the class mammalia, make an apparently near approach to the tribe
                    of fishes. The ornithorhyncus is allied both to quadrupeds and to birds. Many
                    similar examples might be produced among the inferior classes of the animal
                    kingdom. A little attention, however, will soon enable us to perceive that they
                    occupy but small portions of the wide spaces intervening between different
                    orders of animals. Even in the best arranged systems, such as that of Cuvier, we
                    discover innumerable chasms wholly unoccupied, between adjacent orders; and in
                    many instances animals, which are scarcely in any respect allied to each other,
                    are placed in immediate sequence. This defect, as I have already observed, is
                    unavoidable, because it is inherent in the very nature of the subject. Instead
                    of a single continuous line, nature presents us with a multitude of partial
                    series, with innumerable ramifications, and occasionally a few insulated
                    circles. If metaphor must be employed, it would be better to say, that instead
                    of being a chain, the natural distribution of animals offers the idea of a
                    complicated network, where several parallel series present themselves, and are
                    occasionally joined by transverse or oblique lines of connexion. The great
                    divisions of Cuvier represent these principal parallel series. The last,
                    however, or that of the <hi rend="italic">radiata,</hi> appears to be the least
                    pcrfect of these series, and might with advantage be farther divided. On the
                    subject of natural classification Mr. Macleay<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Macleay, <hi rend="italic">Horoe
                    Entomologicae,</hi> or Essays on Annulose Animals, 1821.</p></note> has advanced
                    a hypothesis, which he supports with some ingenuity, namely, that the real types
                    or models of structure may be represented by a circular or recurring
                    arrangement; and he gives a number of instances in which this principle appears
                    very happily to apply. But speculation on these subjects can lead to
                    satisfactory conclusions only on the supposition that an extensive comparison of
                    organs has been instituted throughout the whole of the animal kingdom.</p>
                <p>(71.) A scientific knowledge of the organization and functions of animals is
                    valuable, not only in its application to zoology, but also in reference to many
                    other sciences, such as geology, with which it might at first view appear to
                    have but little connexion. By attending to the arrangement of mineral bodies as
                    they occur in nature, we have sufficient proofs that the earth has undergone
                    frequent and considerable changes prior to the existence of any living beings.
                    But we find, besides, a great number of strata, which contain unequivocal
                    remains of vegetable and animal bodies. A large proportion of these are shells,
                    exuviae of zoophytes, and other marine animals. We also find, in other strata, a
                    multitude of fossil bones, and teeth of various quadrupeds and reptiles; and
                    occasionally, but more rarely, of birds and fishes. Whole mountains and
                    extensive districts appear to be composed entirely of these animal remains. It
                    is by the aid of comparative anatomy and physiology alone that we are enabled to
                    compare these relics of antiquity with similar facts of living or recent
                    animals, to discover their differences or identity, and to deduce certain
                    conclusions with regard to the nature, habits, and characters of the animals to
                    which they had belonged; and by studying their relation with the strata in which
                    they are found, to draw inferences with regard to the changes which must have
                    taken place in those parts of the earth, inferences which are of the highest
                    importance towards establishing a correct theory of those changes. The
                    difficulties attending researches of this nature were of course exceedingly
                    great; but they have been at length surmounted by the persevering zeal and
                    industry of modern naturalists. In these arduous investigations Cuvier stands
                    pre-eminent; and his labours have been rewarded with a number of highly
                    interesting results. The great principle which he has assumed as the foundation
                    of his researches, is that every organized individual constitutes <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193498731" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8731-0588"/>a system of itself, of which
                    all the parts are connected to each other by certain definite relations. In
                    passing from each of these structures to that of other animals in the natural
                    series, we find that all the changes of form which take place in any one organ
                    are accompanied by corresponding alterations in the form of every other organ;
                    so that by the careful application of certain rules, deduced from this observed
                    reciprocal dependence of its functions, we are enabled to ascertain with
                    considerable certainty the forms and habits of animals, of which only small
                    fragments have been preserved. We have already given an instance of this mode of
                    reasoning as applied to ruminant animals. By following this guide Cuvier
                    ascertained and classed the fossil remains of nearly 100 different quadrupeds in
                    the viviparous and oviparous classes. Of these above seventy were distinct
                    species, hitherto unknown to naturalists.</p>
                <p>It appears from these researches that the earth has sustained more numerous
                    convulsions than had before been suspected, and that these must have been
                    separated by considerable intervals of time; that the ocean has deposited
                    varions strata in regular succession; that the species of animals whose remains
                    are found in these strata change with every variation in the nature of the
                    deposit, and become more and more analogous with the living animals of the
                    present day, in proportion as the deposits have been of more recent date. It
                    appears from an examination of these fossil remains, that the sea must have
                    retired at intervals from the districts it had formerly covered, and left
                    dryland, affording habitation for large quadrupeds; and that after a certain
                    unknown space of time, the sea has suddenly returned to the same spot, has
                    destroyed all the terrestrial animals, and has formed subsequent deposits of
                    shells and other marine productions.</p>
                <p>These sudden irruptionsand recessionsof the ocean,which have occurred several
                    times in the same district, must have been attended with extensive destruction
                    of animal life. Whole races have perished irretrievably, and are known to us
                    only by the durable memorials they have left behind of their own existence, and
                    of the several epochs of antediluvian chronology.</p>
                <p>(72.) The study of the fossil remains of animals has also extended our views of
                    the animal kingdom; it has in many instances supplied chasms which had occurred
                    in the natural series, and has enlarged our ideas of the extent of creative
                    power. Another important conclusion which has resulted is, that the human race
                    has been the last created; for nowhere do we find any vestiges of human bones.
                    These researches tend also to throw light on the history of mankind, and to
                    refute the pretensions to high antiquity which have been arrogated by certain
                    nations, and particularly the Chinese, &amp;c. which Voltaire and other modern
                    philosophers had so zealously defended. All that science has brought to light,
                    indeed, is in conformity with the testimony of the sacred writings, when
                    rationally interpreted, and may even be adduced as illustration of their truth.
                    Geology and comparative physiology concur with these writings in teaching us
                    that man was the last act of creative power; that a great catastrophe took place
                    on the surface of the globe a few thousand years ago, during which the sea
                    covered for a time every part of the land; and that the subsequent diffusion of
                    the population of the earth is of comparatively recent date. It is pleasing to
                    see conclusions, derived from such different sources, converging to the same
                    points, and affording each other that reciprocal confirmation which is the
                    invariable concomitant and surest test of truth.</p>
                <p>(73.) The enlarged views to which we are conducted by the study of comparative
                    physiology afford us a glimpse of some of the plans or models of structure which
                    appear to have been followed in the formation of the animal world. The analogies
                    of form discernible in corresponding organs, throughout a very extensive series
                    of tribes, have been lately traced and developed with extraordinary care by the
                    modern naturalists of the French and German schools, and especially by Cuvier,
                    Blainville, Savigny, Geoffroi St. Hilaire, Oken, Carus, and Milne Edwards. The
                    conclusions they have drawn from their labours, though sometimes overstrained,
                    are always ingenious, and in general satisfactory; and they strongly tend to
                    prove, that several distinct types, or standards of figure, have been adhered to
                    in all the multiplicity of forms with which it has pleased the Author of nature
                    to diversify the animal creation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See the Bridgewater Treatise on Animal and Vegetable
                    Physiology, where this subject is enlarged upon, and especially the chapter on
                    <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> Unity of Design.” Vol. ii∙ p.
                    625.</p></note></p>
                <p>(74.) These inquiries, however, suggest still higher subjects of contemplation.
                    They illustrate the connexion and relationship of every part with the rest of
                    the system. They prove the unity of design with which the system has been
                    planned and executed. They demonstrate the perfection with which all its parts
                    are mutually adjusted, and the harmony which pervades the whole. The evidences
                    of express design and contrivance are so distinct and palpable, and they so
                    multiply and accumulate upon us as we advance, that they may almost be said to
                    obtrude themselves on our notice; and we cannot avoid being impressed with the
                    notion of its being intended that we should observe them. Whilst the purpose to
                    be answered continues the same, the means are varied in every possible manner,
                    as if designedly to display to us the exhaustless resources of inventive power,
                    and the supreme intelligence with which that power is wielded. Nor is it
                    possible to overlook the general object to which every thing so manifestly tends
                    in the system of animal existence. Every element in every part of the habitable
                    globe, teems with life, and that life is replete with enjoyment. Happiness is
                    unquestionably the great object of animal existence. The benevolence which
                    pervades the whole system of creation, is no less conspicuous than the power and
                    intelligence from which it emanated. Revealed religion is thus in unison with
                    the theology derived from the contemplation of nature, and the lights of modern
                    science.</p>
                <p>(75.) The facts derived from comparative physiology which more especially support
                    the arguments of natural theology have been collected by authors who have
                    written professedly on the subject. Derham’s work, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physico</hi><hi rend="italic">Theology,</hi> has been deservedly held in
                    estimation; but since the time it was published, which is now above a century,
                    the sciences have been prodigiously extended. Dr. Paley, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Natural Theology,</hi> has produced a great multitude of facts and
                    observations in support of the same arguments, has applied them with singular
                    felicity, and impressed them with the most fascinating perspicuity and
                    eloquence. But his object being purely theological, he has not professed to
                    adhere to any scientific order in stating them. 'The design of the Bridgewater
                    Treatise, already referred to, is to supply this desideratum, by presenting the
                    details of animal and vegetable physiology, arranged according to the functions
                    to which they relate, or in other words, in reference to final causes. As
                    theological arguments, the value of these facts cannot fail to be better
                    appreciated when they are studied in all their bearings, and as forming a part
                    of the science to which they belong. It is by the aid of genuine science alone,
                    that we can avoid the dangerous error of building arguments, on so momentous a
                    subject, upon equivocal or unstable foundations, and of injuring a cause already
                    established upon incontrovertible grounds, by weak and inconclusive
                    evidence.</p>
                <p>(76.) It has been too hastily inferred, from the abuse which has too often been
                    made of philosophical inquiries, that they are to be avoided as dangerous, and
                    even pernicious; and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498744"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-8744-0589"/>that of the fountain of philosophy, as of the
                    Pierian spring we should “drink deep,” or abstain from tasting. Superficial
                    knowledge has often been decried as mischievous, and extremely liable to abuse.
                    The hackneyed maxim of Pope, that “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing,” has
                    furnished a ready text for those who declaim against all attempts to render
                    science popular, and to include it as a branch, of general education.
                    Willingproselytestothisdoctrine will always be found among those whom indolence
                    or frivolity render averse to mental exertion, when bestowed on subjects not
                    immediately connected with the common concerns of life, as well as among those
                    who, already enjoying some of the advantages of knowledge, are desirous of
                    securing to themselves the monopoly of those advantages. But their sophistry is
                    soon detected when we examine into the real meaning of the expressions they
                    employ. What is commonly denominated superficial knowledge, may certainly be
                    useless, or even dangerous; but the mischief or danger arises, not because it is
                    superficial, but because it is incorrect. It is error, under the guise of
                    knowledge that alone deserves such reprobation. The value of information is to
                    be estimated much more by its accuracy, than by its extent. Although it may be
                    true that there is no royal road to science, it is equally true that many are
                    the roads that lead astray; and that 'much fruitless labour may be spared by
                    having that one pointed out which leads directly to the object we wish to
                    attain. Though the distance we have to travel cannot be abridged, yet the path
                    may be rendered smoother, and the velocity of our progress accelerated, by
                    availing ourselves of such guidance as may be afforded by concise treatises,
                    which, however superficial in appearance, or popular in their garb, are yet, as

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">cHAPTER</hi> III ARRANGEMENT OF FUNCTIONS.</p>
                <p>(77.) The general review we have taken, in our introductory chapter, of the
                    objects and mutual connexions of the functions of the animal economy will
                    furnish us with the principles on which the methodical arrangement and
                    classification of those functions should be established. Various attempts have
                    been made by different systematic writers on physiology towards the
                    accomplishment of that object; but they have generally been deficient in that
                    logical precision, which alone can ensure entire comprehensiveness of every
                    branch of the subject, and at the same time convey clear perceptions of the
                    bearings of every part to one another. Some physiologists have limited their
                    views to the human economy, or that of animals which most nearly resemble man;
                    others have framed their systems so as to embrace the whole animal kingdom, and
                    even all beings endowed with life. Some have been wholly governed by anatomical
                    considerations, regarding mere structure as the basis of physiological
                    distinctions; others, overlooking the unity of purpose in each function, and
                    pursuing their subdivisions to an excessive degree of minuteness, have
                    overloaded the subject by needless multiplication and superfluity of detail.
                    Many have introduced confusion by a loose and vitious nomenclature, derived from
                    partial or hypothetical views; which were often tinctured with mysticism, and
                    which, by biassing their judgments, have betrayed them into a wide field of
                    delusion and of error.</p>
                <p>(78.) Another source, to which the greater part of the mistakes, pervading all
                    the systems of physiological arrangement that have been hitherto framed, may be
                    traced, is inattention to the essential distinction which exists between
                    physical and final causes. The study of the phenomena of life differs from all
                    the other branches of philosophical inquiry, by its involving considerations
                    relating to both these kinds of causes; the latter of which introduces a totally
                    new principle ofarrangement, wholly inapplicable in those sciences which concern
                    the physical properties of inert and inorganic matter.
                    Therulesofastrictlyphilosophical induction, which alone can guide our steps in
                    the pursuit of these sciences, must be greatly modified, and in some measure
                    superseded by those derived from another department of human knowledge; namely,
                    psychology. The knowledge of those general facts, which, when once established,
                    and the conditions on which they depend ascertained, constitute what are called
                    the laws of nature, is obtained first, by comparing together phenomena and
                    uniting in one class such as are of the same kind, and carefully separating them
                    from others which are essentially different; and next, by endeavouring to remove
                    all extraneous influences, so as to reduce each class of phenomena to its
                    simplest conditions; an object to be attained by <hi rend="italic"
                    >experiments,</hi> that is, by varying the circumstances under which they occur,
                    and also by combining them in different ways, so as to enable us to verify our
                    theories, by comparing their results with the actual observation of nature. But
                    the attempt to apply the same process of induction to the physiology of
                    organised beings, is attended with peculiar difficulty; for while the changes
                    which occur in the inorganic world exhibit the operation of forces or agents
                    characterized by their simplicity, their constancy, and their uniformity, the
                    phenomena presented to our view by living beings, so prodigiously varied in
                    their form, so extensively spread throughout every element, every clime, and
                    every habitable region of the globe, and so infinitely diversified in their
                    nature, and complicated in their connexions, are calculated to baffle the
                    efforts of the most cautious reasoner, and elude the penetration of the most
                    sagacious inquirer after truth. The resources of experimental research are here
                    extremely narrowed, in consequence of the simultaneous and connected operation
                    of a great number of powers, which prevent us from studying the influence which
                    each would exert when isolated from the rest, and ascertaining the laws which
                    are peculiar respectively to each. Hence it is that we have hitherto made but
                    very imperfect approaches to the determination of those laws.</p>
                <p>(79.) Some compensation is, however, afforded us, while struggling with the
                    obstacles which impede our progress in the direct and thorny path of science, by
                    the abundant resources accessible to us in the psychological considerations,
                    which every where arise in this vast field of contemplation. All the phenomena
                    of organic beings reveal to us so palpably the indications of <hi rend="italic"
                    >design,</hi> that we cannot resist the impression thus created in our minds;
                    nor can we avoid recognising the connexions which are so established between the
                    objects and the changes they present, as being those of means employed for the
                    accomplishment of certain ends. Thus, then, the relation of means to ends
                    becomes a leading principle of association among the facts of physiology; giving
                    a new aspect to the science, and creating an interest of a different and much
                    higher kind, than could ever be inspired by the study of mere physical
                    relations. So deep has been this impression, and so completely has the principle
                    of final causes been interwoven with the pursuits of physiologists, that the
                    study of <hi rend="italic">the functions of life,</hi> that is, of the purposes
                    to which the actions constituting life are subservient, has been almost
                    universally regarded as the principal, if not the sole object of the science. It
                    has, accordingly, been assumed as the basis of arrangement, in all systematic
                    treatises of Physiology; and likewise in framing theories for explaining the
                    phenomena of life, physiologists have generally been satisfied with pointingout
                    their final, rather than their physical causes.</p>
                <p>(80.) This natural proneness to substitute final for physical causes has been a
                    i'requent source of delusion, by insensibly leading to the belief that we have
                    reached the physical law which regulates the phenomena we are viewing, when we
                    have, in fact, done nothing more than traced their relation to the intelligent
                    agency by which they have been each adjusted to their respective objects, and
                    given that law a name with reference to that agency; thus, in our eagerness <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193498757" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8757-0590"/> •to grasp at
                    hidden knowledge, mistaking the shadow for the substance.</p>
                <p>(81.) Frequent instances of this confusion of ideas occur in the writings of the
                    older physiologists; but at all times the predominant tendency has been to refer
                    the phenomena to their final causes; that is, to the purposes which they answer
                    in the animal economy. The functions were arranged by the ancients into three
                    classes, designated by the titles of <hi rend="italic">animal, vital,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">natural;</hi> the first comprising those powers of sensation
                    and of voluntary motion which are more especially characteristic of animal, as
                    contradistinguished from vegetable life; the second, those powers, the continued
                    exercise of which are immediately necessary for the maintenance of life, such as
                    respiration of the blood; and the third, those which are directly concerned in
                    the continuance of its vital actions, but which are yet indispensable in
                    preserving the organs in the conditions enabling them to perform their
                    respective offices, by supplying the materials requisite for their nutrition,
                    and for counteracting their tendency to decomposition; in this class were
                    included digestion, secretion, and absorption. To these were added by many, a
                    fourth class, the <hi rend="italic">generative,</hi> comprehending all the
                    functions which have for their object the continuance of the species by the
                    reproduction of individuals similar to the parent animal. The principal
                    objection to this arbitrary division of the functions is, that the line cannot
                    be drawn with sufficient distinctness between what are called the vital and the
                    natural functions, their connexion with the maintenance of life being one of
                    degree only, and not of kind; as is evident from their being united together in
                    the lowest tribes of the animal kingdom. This classification appears also to be
                    defective, inasmuch as it omits all notice of those functions which have
                    immediate reference to the mechanical condition of the frame; conditions which
                    are the foundation of their physical capabilities of executing the operations
                    assigned them in their respective places in the general system. It is also
                    liable to the imputation of employing terms to designate the classes which are
                    obviously incorrect, and bear not the meaning they are intended to convey. In
                    one sense, and that which would first present itself to the mind, the term <hi
                    rend="italic">animal</hi> functions would comprehend all the others, for there
                    are none in which powers peculiar to animal life are not called into play; and,
                    on the other hand, the strictly animal functions are equally entitled to the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">vital,</hi> as being directly essential to the
                    support of life; and no specific meaning can attach to the term <hi
                    rend="italic">natural,</hi> as applied to any description of functions.</p>
                <p>(82.) Vicq D’Azyr proposes to establish a preliminary division of the functions
                    into two great classes; the first, comprising those concerned in the
                    preservation of the individual; and the second, those concerned in the
                    preservation of the species. The former class he divides into two orders; the
                    first having for their object the assimilation of food into the substance of the
                    body, and designated as the interior assimilative and nutritive functions; and
                    the second, establishing the relations of the individual to surrounding objects,
                    and denominated the exterior or relative functions.</p>
                <p>The first of these orders comprises six genera; namely, 1st, <hi rend="italic"
                    >digestion,</hi> by which the nutritive particles are extracted from the food;
                    2d, <hi rend="italic">absorption,</hi> by which this nutritive matter is
                    conveyed into the blood; 3d, <hi rend="italic">circulation,</hi> by which it is
                    carried to all the organs; 4th, <hi rend="italic">respiration.</hi> by which it
                    is exposed to the influence of atmospheric air; 5th, <hi rend="italic"
                    >secretion,</hi> by which it is made to undergo various modifications; 6th, <hi
                    rend="italic">nutrition,</hi> by which it is applied to the organs for the
                    purposes of growth and nourishment.</p>
                <p>The second order of the first class comprehends three genera; namely, 1st, the
                    <hi rend="italic">sensations,</hi> which give to the individual notice of the
                    presence of surrounding objects; 2d, the <hi rend="italic">motions,</hi> which
                    bring him towards, or remove him from them; 3d, <hi rend="italic">voice</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">speech,</hi> which enable him to communicate with his fellows
                    without transporting his body to a different place.</p>
                <p>The second class, or the generative functions, likewise comprise two orders; the
                    first, including the functions of <hi rend="italic">conception</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">generation,</hi> requiring the concourse of both sexes; the
                    second, including <hi rend="italic">gestation, parturition,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">lactation,</hi> performed exclusively by the female. To these were
                    subjoined by Vicq d’Azyr, as a kind of supplement to his system, the several
                    facts relating to the progressive changes taking place during the advance of
                    life from infancy to decrepitude, through the ages of growth, of maturity, and
                    of decay, and to those which attend the absolute extinction of life, and the
                    subsequent decomposition of the organs.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of Vicq d’Azyr is entitled to much commendation, and has been
                    followed in all its essential features by Dumas,<note anchored="true"

                    classification of functions founded altogether on the anatomical relations of
                    the organs by which they are performed.</p>
                <p>(83.) Bichat,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Anatomie Générale.</hi></p></note> whose original genius led him
                    to disregard the opinions of his predecessors, and to strike out for himself new
                    paths of inquiry, aimed at giving greater simplicity to physiological
                    classification, by pursuing a more rigid analysis, and infusing a more
                    philosophical spirit into the methods of research. With this view he distributed
                    the functions into two classes, which he denominates respectively the <hi
                    rend="italic">animal</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">organic</hi>; the former
                    coinciding nearly with those already known by that title; and the latter
                    comprehending both the vital and the natural functions of preceding writers.
                    Impressed, however, with the necessity of drawing distinctions among the powers
                    of life, he has perplexed his system by intermixing with those final causes,
                    which he takes as the basis of his divisions, the results of a philosophical
                    analysis of those powers. He is thus led to make continual efforts to establish
                    a distinction between muscular contractibility, which is one of the simple and
                    elementary powers of life, when that power is employed in subservience to the
                    animal functions, and when it is subservient to the functions of organic life; a
                    distinction which regards only the final, and not the physical causes of the
                    phenomena. Dumas<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Principes de Physiologie.</hi></p></note> has been guilty of a
                    still more palpable error in deeming it necessary to add to his catalogue of
                    principles, consisting of the acknowledged powers of sensibility and
                    contractility, a third power, which he terms “<hi rend="italic">the force of
                    vital resistance</hi>;” thus associating a final cause in the same rank with
                    causes that are strictly physical.</p>
                <p>(84.) To the animal and vital functions of Bichat, Cuvier has added, in his
                    physiological arrangement, a third class, the <hi rend="italic">generative,</hi>
                    which cannot, indeed, be, with any propriety, included in any of the former. He
                    still, however, falls into a similar mistake as that of Dumas, which we have
                    just now pointed out; for he describes sensibility and muscular contractility

                    reproductivité,</hi> et <hi rend="italic">resistabilité;</hi> thus presenting a
                    strange jumble between physical principles of action, and actions referred to
                    definite purposes. The same confusion maybe remarked in the classification of
                    the functions by Béclard,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>who has arranged them into six classes, viz. <hi rend="italic">nutrition</hi> in
                    its most extended sense, <hi rend="italic">generation, muscular action,
                    sensation, nervous action,</hi> and the functions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >intellect.</hi> But it would be needless to multiply examples of this error,
                    since it will be found to pervade almost every physiological system that has yet
                    been framed, not excepting even that adopted by Dr. Bostock, in his valuable <hi
                    rend="italic">Elementary System of Physiology.</hi></p>
                <p>(85.) Dr. Bostock regards contractility and sensibility as the two primary
                    attributes of animal life, each equally characteristic of it, and peculiar to
                    it, and each performed by its appropriate organs. “The functions,” he remarks,
                    “depend on the exercise of these powers, and although probably, in all cases,
                    they are both of them exercised, yet generally one of them seems to be the
                    principal agent, or the prime cause of the ensuing operation; we may
                    consequently divide them into the contractile and sensitive functions, or those
                    which more directly belong to contractility and to sensibility, and which, of
                    course, serve respectively for motion and sensation, and to these two classes
                    must be added a third class of the intellectual functions.” Among the
                    contractile functions, the essence of which consists in motion, Dr. Bostock
                    considers the circulation as being the first in point of importance, and the one
                    which may be regarded as the most necessary to the direct support of life, and
                    to the indirect maintenance of all the rest. Next in importance is respiration,
                    which modifies the blood so as to adapt it to the maintenance of life. After
                    these two functions, by the former of which the blood is carried to all the
                    parts of the body, and by the latter of which it acquires its vital properties,
                    Dr. Bostock places those of calorification, secretion, digestion, including
                    assimilation and sanguification, and absorption, functions which contribute, he
                    observes, to the continuance of the motion of the animal machine, and which
                    preserve all its parts in their proper condition, without, however, being
                    essential to the immediate support of life. In this class he places the function
                    of generation, which, although one of the most inexplicable of all the
                    operations that are performed by the animal powers, and acting in a specific
                    manner of which we have no other example, may be considered as essentially
                    consisting in secretion.</p>
                <p>The sensitive functions are divided by Dr. Bostock into two classes; first, those
                    which originate in the action of the external agents on the nervous system; and,
                    secondly, those of a reverse kind, which depend on the reaction of the nervous
                    system on these agents. In the first of these divisions are included what are
                    called the external senses, the sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch; and in
                    the same division must be placed the sensation of hunger, that of temperature,
                    and some others, which have not been correctly discriminated from general
                    feeling, but which possess specific characters. In the second class, those
                    functions which depend on the reaction of the nervous system on external bodies,
                    he places volition; and to the same class he also refers instinct, association,
                    sympathy, habit, and some other faculties of a similar kind, which appear to
                    hold an intermediate rank between the corporeal actions and those of a purely
                    intellectual nature. As the functions which compose the first of these classes
                    may be all referred to a species of perception, so the latter may be considered
                    as more or less analogous to volition; in the former, the effect on the nervous
                    system, whatever it may be, is propagated from the extremities to the centre; in
                    the latter, it proceeds in the opposite direction, from the centre to the
                    extremities of the body.</p>
                <p>The intellectual functions compose, in this arrangement, the third class. These,
                    Dr. Bostock observes, are a less direct object of physiology than the two
                    former, yet many of them are so closely connected with the physical changes of
                    the body as to require being included in a complete view of the animal economy.
                    Among those intellectual operations which possess a decided action on the
                    corporeal frame, he places the <hi rend="italic">passions</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and also refers to this class tha compound of mental and physical
                    influence, from which results what are called <hi rend="italic">temperament</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">character.</hi> These lead to the consideration of
                    functions of a more purely intellectual kind, which, as they recede from the
                    corporeal, and advance towards the mental part of our frame, arc less within the
                    province of the physiologist, and belong more to the metaphysician or the
                    moralist.</p>
                <p>(86.) Dr. Alison<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Outlines of Physiology and Pathology,</hi> Edinburgh,
                    1833.</p></note> has adopted a principle of arrangement, which, though differing
                    in some of its applications, is essentially the same as that of Dr. Bostock, as
                    it is derived from the analysis of the phenomena of life into certain powers;
                    or, if these phenomena be considered as the results of a single principle, which
                    we may denominate <hi rend="italic">vitality,</hi> the study of physiology will
                    resolve itself into an inquiry into the conditions under which the various
                    phenomena of life take place, that is, into the <hi rend="italic">laws of
                    vitality.</hi> These laws are ranked by Dr. Alison under three heads: 1. Those
                    of <hi rend="italic">vital contractions,</hi> by which the visible movements of
                    living animals are chiefly effected: 2. Those of <hi rend="italic">vital
                    affinities,</hi> by which the chemical changes peculiar to living animals are
                    determined, and their physical structure maintained: 3. Those of <hi
                    rend="italic">nervous actions,</hi> by which the physical changes in living
                    animals are placed in connexion with mental phenomena, and subjected to the
                    control of mental acts. The first and third of these divisions correspond to
                    those of Dr. Bostock, which he has denominated the contractile and the sensitive
                    functions. The second division of Dr. Alison is founded on the principle pointed
                    out by the writer of the present article, in a treatise on Physiology which
                    appeared many years ago in the last Supplement to this work, and to which he
                    gave the designation of <hi rend="italic">the organic affinities.</hi></p>
                <p>Dr. Alison considers that the movement of the fluids, in all the higher classes
                    of animals, is in a great measure dependent on vital contractions in certain of
                    their solids, and may accordingly be regarded as the first and most important
                    consequence of the exercise of the vital power. This subject he divides into two
                    parts; first, the movement of the mass of blood in the heart, arteries, and
                    veins, or the function of circulation; and, secondly, the continual evolution of
                    matters from, and absorption of matters into, the mass of blood; or the
                    functions of nutrition, exhalation, secretion, and absorption, to which the
                    circulation is subservient, and on which all the other functions are dependent.
                    The study of these nutritive functions naturally introduce the consideration of
                    the properties of the different textures and secretions which are formed from
                    the blood, and which are the materials combined in the construction of the
                    organs themselves.</p>
                <p>The nervous system has been endowed with peculiar properties or powers, in order
                    that it may be the seat, and the instrument, of mental acts. These mental acts,
                    and all the functions in which they bear a necessary share, constitute,
                    according to Dr. Alison, the animal life, or animal functions. As in all animals
                    the reception of food into the digestive organs, and in all vertebrated animals,
                    and many of the inferior orders, in the adult, the reception of air into the
                    respiratory organs is accomplished by movements which are excited through the
                    intervention of sensations and of instincts and volitions; he considers the
                    commencement of the processes of respiration and digestion in them as belonging
                    to the province of animal life, and as dependent on the nervous system. Dr.
                    Alison, therefore, commences his account of the animal functions, with the
                    consideration of respiration, animal heat, and digestion, which he refers to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193498783" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8783-0592"/> that class:
                    proceeding afterwards to notice the physiology of the external senses, of the
                    mental faculties, voluntary and instinctive motion, the involuntary action of
                    the mind on the body, sleep and the analogous states of somnambulism, reverie,
                    and other irregular actions of the nervous functions. The subjects of
                    generation, and the peculiarities of age, sex, and temperament, occupy the
                    concluding chapters of his work.</p>
                <p>(87.) The order in which Mr. Mayo has treated of the functions,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Outlines of
                    Human Physiology,</hi> 3d edition, London, 1833.</p></note> differs but little
                    from that adopted by Dr. Alison.</p>
                <p>(88.) The author of this article has given, in his <hi rend="italic">Bridgewater
                    Treatise,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Roget,
                    <hi rend="italic">Animal and Vegetable Physiology, considered with reference to
                    Natural Theology,</hi> two vols. London, 1834.</p></note> an arrangement of the
                    functions founded altogether on the basis of final causes: and corresponding
                    therefore with the views, which have been explained in the preceding chapter, of
                    the relative subordination of purposes which the functions are designed to
                    answer in the economy; and not limited to human physiology, but embracing all
                    the different forms and modifications which those functions present in the
                    animal kingdom. Taking them in the order of their increasing complexity, he has
                    distributed them into the four following classes; namely, first, <hi
                    rend="italic">the mechanical functions,</hi> which include the consideration of
                    all the circumstances relating to the mechanism of the frame and of its
                    different organs; the arrangements provided for procuring the proper cohesion,
                    strength and mobility requisite for the different actions they have to perform;
                    and also for the preservation of their connexions, support, security and other
                    mechanical conditions adapted to the exercise of their respective functions. To
                    this head are also referred the operation of the moving powers, derived
                    principally from muscular contractility, by which the various parts of this
                    system of machinery arc set in motion.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the <hi rend="italic">nutritive,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chemical
                    functions,</hi> corresponding to what has been formerly denominated the vital
                    functions; and the object of which is the preservation of the organs in those
                    states of chemical composition which enable them to sustain life, and to perform
                    their destined offices in the economy. The functions by which, in the higher
                    orders of animals, this object is accomplished, may be arranged under the
                    following heads; each, however, admitting of further subdivision. 1. <hi
                    rend="italic">Assimilation,</hi> including the processes which prepare the food
                    for <hi rend="italic">digestion,</hi><hi rend="italic">chymification,</hi> which
                    is the office of the stomach, and <hi rend="italic">chylifi-cation,</hi> which
                    is performed in the intestines. 2. <hi rend="italic">Lacteal absorption,</hi> by
                    which the chyle so prepared, is collected into the heart and blood-vessels. 3.
                    <hi rend="italic">Circulation,</hi> by which the blood, or nutrient fluid, is
                    regularly diffused over the system. 4. <hi rend="italic">Respiration,</hi> or
                    the aeration of the blood. 5. <hi rend="italic">Secretion,</hi> by which the
                    properties of that fluid arc modified. 6. <hi rend="italic">Excretion,</hi> by
                    which various chemical principles are separated from the blood, and discharged
                    from the system. 7. <hi rend="italic">Absorption,</hi> by which substances are
                    conveyed from different parts back again into the general mass of circulating
                    fluids. 8. <hi rend="italic">Nutrition,</hi> by which the nutritive matter is
                    applied to the growth or restoration of the various organs of the body, so as to
                    maintain them in the state which enables them to discharge their proper
                    functions. 9∙ For effecting all these various processes, the agency of a
                    peculiar power, derived from the properties of the nervous system, is requisite.
                    This may be termed the <hi rend="italic">nervous power,</hi> in
                    contradistinction to those actions of the same system, which have reference to
                    mental phenomena, and which come under the next class of functions.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, the <hi rend="italic">sensorial functions</hi> comprehends all those
                    corporeal changes in which the mind is concerned; and consequently include those
                    of <hi rend="italic">sensation,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">perception,</hi> of
                    <hi rend="italic">volition,</hi> and all those intellectual functions which
                    employ for their agency the physical organization of the body.</p>
                <p>Fourthly, the <hi rend="italic">reproductive functions,</hi> which have for their
                    object the continuance of the species, and the multiplication of its numbers.
                    This subject is naturally connected with the progressive developement of the
                    organs, the growth of the body from infancy to manhood; and the stages of its
                    decline, till all the vital phenomena cease by the death of the individual.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">chapter</hi> IV THE VITAE POWERS.</p>
                <p>(89.) We have already remarked, that there are two ways in which the assemblage
                    of phenomena presented to us by living beings may be studied. We may, in the
                    first place, view these as mere physical phenomena, applying to them the same
                    methods of induction which have been employed with so much success in other
                    departments of natural science. The object of philosophical induction is the
                    reference of the events occurring in nature to their proper causes. This is
                    accomplished by comparing the phenomena together, observing in what they agree,
                    and in what they differ, classing them in the order of their agreement; and
                    distinguishing them according to their differences. The result of this process,
                    when it has been carried as far as the extent of our mass of facts will allow,
                    is the establishment of certain general relations between these facts, or
                    conditions, under which they occur, and which we may consider as so many <hi
                    rend="italic">laws of nature</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> and any appearance we
                    may afterwards meet with which corresponds in its character to any single law,
                    or combination of these laws, is at once referred to them, and considered as a
                    particular instance or exemplification of these laws. When we can succeed in
                    tracing these coincidences with a previously established law or general fact, we
                    are said to have discovered its cause. Philosophy, in this sense, then,
                    comprehends the collection and comparison of phenomena, their classification,
                    the establishment by careful induction of general laws; the verification of
                    these laws by experiment; and lastly, the subsequent reference of particular
                    phenomena to their appropriate laws.</p>
                <p>(90.) In the sciences which relate to the laws of matter in its inorganic state,
                    this inductive method of philosophising admits of being pursued to an indefinite
                    extent, and with comparative facility. The phenomenon themselves, which are the
                    subjects of induction, are of a simple and more definite character than those of
                    animal or vegetable life; they are generally more under cur control; and more
                    easily subjected to the test of experiment. The endless variety of the forms of
                    life, the extent and intricacy of' the connexions between the different parts of
                    the animal system, introduce a degree of complexity in the phenomena,
                    incomparably greater than is ever met with in the combinations of inorganic
                    matter. We shall accordingly find that the knowledge we have hitherto acquired
                    of the physical laws which govern the vital phenomena, is as yet exceedingly
                    imperfect.</p>
                <p>(91.) In entering upon the philosophical study of the phenomena presented to us
                    in the living body, and carefully arranging them according to the rules of
                    induction, and without reference to the final causes that connect them, (a
                    subject which forms a totally different branch of inquiry,) we easily recognize
                    the operation of many of those powers and principles to which inorganic matter
                    is also subjected. The living system, with all its complicated apparatus of
                    solids and fluids, is obedient to the universal laws of gravitation, of
                    cohesion, of elasticity, of capillary attraction, &amp;c., as well as to the
                    ordinary principles of mechanics, hydrostatics, hydraulics, and pneumatics,
                    which result from combinations of these laws; and we may pursue the application
                    of these laws to the mechanism of the body, as far as no other causes intervene,
                    without danger of error.</p>
                <p>(92.) The laws of chemistry apply also, to a certain ex <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193498796" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8796-0593"/>tent, to the changes which
                    are going on in the living system; but in tracing the operation of these laws,
                    we soon become sensible of the apparent interference of other principles which
                    seem to control the ordinary chemical affinities which the same kinds of matter
                    are found to exert when deprived of life. Here, then, we perceive a sensible
                    deviation from the course of phenomena exhibited by inorganic matter; and we are
                    forced to recognize the existence of new and unknown powers peculiar to, and
                    characterizing the living state. We discern the operation of such powers in the
                    processes of digestion, of sanguification, of nutrition, of secretion, of the
                    growth and organization of the various structures that compose the fibres of the
                    body. Powers of a similar kind arc exhibited in the phenomena of vegetation:
                    they seem, therefore, to attach to vitality in all its forms. In order to
                    distinguish them from the ordinary chemical affinities to which they are so
                    frequently opposed, we shall designate them by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Organic Affinities,</hi> although, as we shall afterwards attempt to shew, they
                    probably do not differ in their kind, but only in the circumstances and
                    conditions of action, from the ordinary inorganic affinities.</p>
                <p>(93.) Another power which more peculiarly appertains to animal life is <hi
                    rend="italic">Contractility,</hi> This is especially a property of those fibres
                    which· compose the muscles. It is often denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Irritability,</hi> a name originally given to it by Glisson, but which has
                    justly been objected to by Dr. Bostock as a term employed in many different
                    senses, according as it is applied in physiology, pathology, or ethics. Haller
                    speaks of it frequently under the designation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vis</hi><hi rend="italic">insita.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Contractility,</hi> adopted by Dr. Bostock,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Elementary System of Physiology,</hi>
                    third edition, pp. 91, 92.</p></note> and sanctioned by many other eminent
                    physiologists, is in itself unobjectionable, and has the advantage of being a
                    simple expression of the fact itself. It consists in the spontaneous shortening
                    of muscular fibres, in consequence of the impression of certain agents termed
                    <hi rend="italic">stimuli,</hi> by a power residing in the fibres themselves,
                    and which operates with a force greatly superior to any of the ordinary
                    mechanical sources of motion.</p>
                <p>(94.) The remarkable property which the nerves possess of conveying with electric
                    celerity impressions made on one of their extremities, or even on any part of
                    them, to the opposite extremity, and to other parts, ⅛ι the line of their
                    course, the influence of which impressions are rendered apparent by certain
                    effects, such as the contraction of the muscles, increased or modified action of
                    the blood-vessels, absorbents, and organs of secretion, and the evolution of
                    animal heat. All these effects may take place from impressions, or <hi
                    rend="italic">irritations,</hi> (by which term is meant impressions of a certain
                    degree of intensity,) which do not excite sensation, or volition, or any other
                    mental change; and they even occur after the destruction or removal of those
                    parts of the nervous system which are connected with affections of the mind. A
                    power of the same kind is also possessed by those nerves which are connected
                    with the sensorium, on the parts in immediate connexion with the sentient
                    principle.</p>
                <p>(95.) It is by the exertion of this power that impressions made on those nervous
                    filaments which are instrumental in sensation, and especially if made on their
                    extremities which are distributed to the organs of the external senses, are
                    instantly transmitted to the sensorium, in which they may be said to terminate,
                    and the changes produced in which are attended by the mental affection termed
                    <hi rend="italic">sensation.</hi> In like manner, certain other changes in the
                    sensorium, consequent on <hi rend="italic">volition,</hi> which is a mental
                    affection, are followed by the contraction of certain muscles, by means of some
                    unknown influence communicated through the medium of certain other nervous
                    filaments having their origin in the sensorium, and their termination in those
                    muscles. The nature of the power by which these transmissions are effected in
                    the course of each of these sets of nervous filaments, judging from the
                    similarity of the circumstances under which it takes place, especially in the
                    instantaneousness of the effect, is probably the same in every case; the only
                    perceptible difference in the mode in which it is exerted consisting in the
                    direction of the transmission. This remarkable power, which is totally distinct
                    from any mental effect that may accompany its exertion, we shall distinguish by
                    the name of the <hi rend="italic">nervous power.</hi></p>
                <p>(96.) A fourth power, perfectly distinct from any of the former, although it also
                    belongs to a portion of the nervous system, is that from which the corporeal
                    changes which take place in those parts immediately connected with sensation,
                    volition, and the intellectual operations, proceed. To this specific property,
                    which should be carefully distinguished from the mere faculty of transmission
                    possessed by the fibres of the nerves, the name of <hi rend="italic">sensorial
                    power</hi> has been given. We are indebted to Dr. Wilson Philip for the
                    establishment of this important distinction in the specific powers of the
                    nervous system, and for having bestowed upon it the above appropriate
                    designation. The same term had, indeed, been employed by physiologists in a
                    different and much more extended sense, as including muscular irritability,
                    which had been regarded as in some way or other analogous to nervous power. In
                    the sense in which we shall use the term, it is meant to apply exclusively to
                    those physiological changes occurring in certain parts of the nervous system,
                    which produce or accompany changes or affections of the mind.</p>
                <p>(97.) It is evident that the astonishing properties belonging to the refined
                    organization of the brain, which constitute sensorial power, and which arc, in a
                    manner utterly incomprehensible to us, connected with the affections of the
                    sentient and intelligent principle, present subjects of far higher interest than
                    even the organic, muscular, or nervous powers, and are infinitely more remote
                    from the ordinary attributes of matter.</p>
                <p>(98.) Thus we may perceive that the system of the living body exhibits not only a
                    multiplicity of new powers, which we no where meet with in unorganized matter,
                    but also presents us with a gradation of powers ascending from those of a
                    mechanical nature, but yet derived from highly artificial arrangement of
                    particles, to those of a refined and elaborate chemistry silently at work in the
                    secret laboratories of the body; rising again to principles of a still more
                    elevated order, acting through the medium of the nerves; till we lose ourselves
                    in the more lofty contemplation of those mysterious agencies, which confer on
                    the central portions of the nervous system the power of exciting sensation;
                    which render them instruments of thought and of volition, and which stamp on the
                    being they compose the distinctive character of individuality.</p>
                <p>(99∙) Viewed with reference to their subserviency to final causes, it is to the
                    sensorial powers, which confer the capacity of enjoyment, that the supreme rank
                    in point of importance must be assigned. The faculties of sensation, of
                    voluntary motion, and of enjoyment, are the only ultimate ends for which, as far
                    as we can judge, the animal has been created and endowed with life. Those
                    ultimate ends of its being are attained primarily by the sensorial powers; and
                    to the maintenance of these are the muscular and the nervous powers subservient.
                    Of these latter powers it is also evident that the muscular is placed in
                    obedience to the nervous, in the same manner as the nervous is obedient to the
                    sensorial power. Thus, the views now presented of the classification and
                    distribution of the physical powers which operate in producing the phenomena of
                    life, are in strict accordance and harmony with the results obtained from the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498809" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8809-0594"/>consideration
                    of final causes, which we have already presented in our preliminary chapter.</p>
                <p>(100.) If the analysis we have here offered of the vital powers, that is, of
                    powers peculiar to the phenomena of life, and the distinctions we have
                    endeavoured to establish between them be correct, we shall be enabled at once to
                    detect the fallacy of those views of life, and of those definitions of the vital
                    principle which are generally received; and which, we apprehend, have been laid
                    down in violation of the just rules of philosophical induction. The truth is,
                    disguise it how we may by a vain parade of words, that the real state of the
                    science is not sufficiently advanced to authorise that degree of generalization
                    which these definitions would imply. We are certainly not warranted, by the
                    phenomena already known, in regarding life as the effect of any <hi
                    rend="italic">single</hi> power. The attempt of <hi rend="italic">Brown,</hi> of
                    <hi rend="italic">Hunter,</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">Bichat</hi> to reduce
                    the science to this state of simplification, though highly ingenious, are yet
                    premature; and have, it is to be feared, had rather the effect of retarding than
                    of advancing the progress of real science.</p>
                <p>(101.) Many of the older physiologists entertained the notion of a principle,
                    endowed with qualities in some measure partaking of intelligence, and as if it
                    were a spirit presiding over and governing the vital actions. Such was the idea
                    attached by Van Halmont, and by Stahl, to the principle which they termed the
                    <hi rend="italic">archaeus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">anima,</hi> and which they
                    conceived regulated the operations of the different powers of the system; an
                    assumption which, however naturally suggesting itself to the mind, while
                    contemplating the harmonious adjustments that pervade every part of the animal
                    economy, is in no respect a philosophical explanation of the phenomena, and is
                    even utterly irreconcileable with some of these phenomena. In like manner, the
                    <hi rend="italic">vis medi~ catrix naturae,</hi> which Hoffman and Cullen have
                    so largely employed in their pathological theories, and which supplied them with
                    ready solutions of every obscure morbid change that embarrassed them, was, in
                    fact, nothing more than a branch of the same doctrine. Nor have the more sober
                    theorists of modern times been sufficiently on their guard against this
                    illusion. In the attributes which John Hunter ascribes to his <hi rend="italic"
                    >vital principle,</hi> we may continually trace the same want of discrimination
                    between that intelligence, by which the conditions of organization were
                    originally adjusted to a variety of contingent circumstances, and those physical
                    agents, by the instrumentality of which the intended objects are attained. When
                    it is said, for example, in the language of this school, that the coagulation of
                    the blood is occasioned by “the stimulus of necessity,” it is clearly the final
                    cause alone which is indicated, while the real physical cause is not assigned;
                    and it is also evident that no advance is thereby made towards its discovery.
                    This <hi rend="italic">principle of life,</hi> with which organized beings are
                    endowed, is represented as a new power, which modifies and controls the
                    operation of those simpler physical laws, to which the same matter, in its
                    unorganized state, is subjected; a power which imposes new cohesive and
                    repulsive forces on the solid materials of the animal or vegetable structures,
                    which imparts to the fluids a new property of coagulation, which alters the
                    order of chemical affinities between their elements or primary compounds,
                    retaining them, contrary to their natural tendencies, in a certain state of
                    equilibrium, and resisting the agency of causes usually tending to destroy that
                    state: and, lastly, which produces, in a degree corresponding with the wants of
                    the system, either an evolution or an absorption of calorie. All these, it must
                    be admitted, are purposes of manifest utility, being directly conducive to the
                    welfare of the individual, and indeed essential to its contin-</p>
                <p>uance in the living state. In as far as they are means conducive to specific
                    ends, the reference of all these phenomena to one class cannot be objected to.
                    The fallacy lies in regarding it as a philosophical generalization of effects of
                    a similar kind, resulting from the operation of a simple power in nature; for
                    between many of these effects, considered as mere physical phenomena, there
                    exists not the remotest similarity. But it is the fundamental principle of the
                    method of induction, that similar effects alone are to be ascribed to the agency
                    of the same physical cause. Judging, therefore, from the observed effects, which
                    differ widely in their nature from each other, we ought to infer the operation
                    of several distinct powers, the concurrence of which is requisite to produce the
                    complex phenomena in question. We are, no doubt, unavoidably led to view these
                    phenomena as conjoined, because we witness their existing combinations, and
                    perceive that they are tending to the accomplishment of a specific purpose;
                    namely, the preservation and welfare of the being to which they relate. But this
                    unity of design is an attribute, not of matter, but of intellect, and does not
                    necessarily imply the unity of the agent employed in their production.</p>
                <p>(102.) We may take as an example, the phenomena of the circulation of the blood,
                    which, when viewed with relation to that function, form together so beautiful
                    and harmonious a system. These phenomena, taken abstractedly, are ultimately
                    resolvable into such as result from a few general powers, as muscular
                    contractility, membranous elasticity, the hydraulic properties of the blood,
                    &amp;c. The phenomena of digestion, in like manner, when subjected to analysis,
                    are found to be results of the combined agencies of the muscular action of the
                    stomach and intestines, of the chemical powers of the gastric juice, the bile,
                    &amp;c. of the organic powers of secretion, and so forth; all of which concur in
                    the production of a definite object, namely, the conversion of the aliment into
                    chyle. The combined processes subservient to this purpose, constitute, when
                    viewed in their relation to final causes, the function of digestion.</p>
                <p>(103.) However the laws which regulate the vital phenomena may appear, on a
                    superficial view, to differ from those by which the physical changes taking
                    place in inorganic matter are governed, still a more profound investigation of
                    their real character will shew that, when viewed abstractly from the
                    consideration of final causes, there is really no essential difference between
                    them, either as to their comprehensiveness, their uniformity of action, or the
                    mode in which they are to be established by the generalization of particular
                    facts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See an Essay by

                    difficulty of effecting these inductive generalizations is undoubtedly
                    incomparably greater in the former than in the latter; but this difficulty is
                    similar to that which impedes our progress in all cases where the existing
                    combinations which are the objects of study, are too numerous and too
                    complicated to yield to our powers of analysis. We have examples of this
                    difficulty in many branches of physical science; in meteorology, for example,
                    where no one can doubt that the phenomena are the results of the ordinary
                    physical powers, of the laws of which we are tolerably cognisant; but the
                    operations of which, in effecting the daily and hourly changes of atmospheric
                    phenomena, have hitherto baffled the most persevering and penetrating inquiries
                    directed to this highly important branch of physics. There is, in like manner,
                    no distinct evidence of the material particles, which compose the organized and
                    living fabric, being actuated by any powers or principles different from those
                    which are inherent in them, in their ordinary or inanimate state. They are, in
                    both cases, obedient to certain definite physical laws, the operation of which
                    is determined <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498822" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8822-0595"
                    />by the peculiar circumstances of their mode of combination, and the peculiar
                    conditions under which they are brought into action.</p>
                <p>(104.) It may, in like manner, be contended, that the affinities which hold
                    together the elements of living bodies, and which govern the elaboration of
                    organic products, are the same with those which preside over inorganic
                    compounds; and that the designations of <hi rend="italic">organic</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">vital affinities</hi> are expressive only of peculiarities
                    attending the circumstances and conditions under which they are placed, but do
                    not imply any real difference in the nature of the powers themselves. If our
                    knowledge of these circumstances and conditions were complete, their identity
                    would be at once revealed to us; but until that period, which must be very far
                    distant, has arrived, we must be content with gathering a few indications, which
                    occasionally break out from the clouds of mystery in which thesubjectis
                    obscured, of the similarity of operation between these two apparently contending
                    powers, the ordinary chemical, and the extraordinary vital affinities. Every
                    fresh discovery in animal and vegetable chemistry, by shewing the mutual
                    convertibility of many of the proximate principles of organic compounds, adds to
                    the number of those indications. Hence it becomes every day more and more
                    probable that the forces immediately concerned in the production of chemical
                    changes in the body, are the same as thosewhich are in constant operation in the
                    inorganic world; and that we are not warranted in the assertion that the
                    operations of vital chemistry are directed by distinct laws, and are the results
                    of new agencies.</p>
                <p>(105.) We are therefore led to the conclusion, that the vital properties are not,
                    as it is commonly expressed, superadded to matter in the process of
                    organization, but arc the result of the material constitution, that is, of the
                    peculiar combinations and arrangement of the ultimate molecules of the organized
                    tissues, which call out and develope the properties previously existing in those
                    molecules, but which cannot be effective unless these circumstances exist.</p>
                <p>(106.) However natural it may be to conceive the existence of a single and
                    presiding principle of <hi rend="italic">vitality,</hi> we should recollect that
                    this, in the present state of our knowledge, is only a fiction of the mind, not
                    warranted by the phenomena themselves, in which we perceive so much real
                    diversity, and therefore inadmissible as the result of a philosophical
                    induction. We find that vitality ceases in different textures, at different
                    periods, prior to the total extinction of life; a phenomenon which appears
                    scarcely compatible with the unity of any such power.</p>
                <p>(107.) It is well known that attemptshave in like manner, from time to time, been
                    made to reduce the phenomena of the inorganic world, to a single primordial law;
                    instead of being content to refer them to the operation of distinct laws, such
                    as those of gravitation, cohesion, elasticity, light, heat, electricity,
                    magnetism, and chemical affinity. The phenomena usually ascribed to these great
                    powers of nature have, for instance, been considered as resolvable into one
                    universal principle of <hi rend="italic">attraction.</hi> By other philosophers,
                    they have been regarded as the effects of a general and sole power of <hi
                    rend="italic">repulsion.</hi> None of these simplifications are as yet warranted
                    by facts; and equally vain, in the present state of the science, is the
                    endeavour to reduce all the vital phenomena to one single law. It is possible,
                    or perhaps even probable, that future researches may be successful in
                    establishing the identity of some of the powers we now conceive to be distinct,
                    with other powers already known. Thus, in the physical sciences, the recent
                    discoveries that have taken place in electro-magnetism, have satisfactorily
                    established the identity of the magnetic and electric agencies. The same may
                    possibly be accomplished in future times, with regard to heat and light, which
                    are already connected together by so many analogies. But no such approximation
                    can yet be attempted with any prospect of success, between the muscular, the
                    nervous, the sensorial, and the organic powers. No speculative ingenuity can
                    reduce them to a single physical power; nor can we establish any kind of
                    association between them, but by the consideration of another and a totally
                    different class of relations, namely, those they bear to the general object
                    which they combine to produce. This, however, is to substitute final for
                    physical causes; a mode of procedure which we have seen, is totally at variance
                    with the principles of philosophical induction. It is physical causes only which
                    are the legitimate objects of philosophical analysis, and the true bases of the
                    physical sciences.</p>
                <p>(108.) We shall now proceed to give an account of each separate function; taking
                    them in the order of their respective simplicity, with reference not only to
                    their objects, but also to the powers which are concerned in their
                    accomplishment.</p>
                <p>We shall accordingly begin with the consideration of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mechanical functions,</hi> as being more simple in their character, and
                    implying the operation of the simpler powers of organization; together with the
                    peculiar faculty of muscular contractility, which is the great source of
                    mechanical power provided for carrying on the greater movements of the machine.
                    We shall, in the second place, review that class of functions which depend more
                    especially on the operation of the <hi rend="italic">organic affinities,</hi>
                    and which have for their objects the nutrition and extension of the organs, and
                    their maintenance in that state of chemical, as well as mechanical condition,
                    which fit them for the performance of their respective offices. We shall then be
                    properly prepared for the study of that higher class of functions, which
                    appertain to <hi rend="italic">sensation,</hi> and all the other faculties
                    connected with mind; functions which imply, in addition to all the powers
                    concerned in the preceding functions, others of a superior order, but which,
                    although in the highest degree interesting and important, are incomparably the
                    most obscure and complex of all. Our attention will, in the last place, be
                    directed to the functions relating to <hi rend="italic">reproduction,</hi> the
                    study of which requires a previous knowledge of every other department of
                    physiology.</p>
                <p>CHAP. V» THE <hi rend="smallcaps">mechanical</hi> FUNCTIONS.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">On Organization in
                    general.</hi></p>
                <p>(110.) If we analyze the ideas attached to the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >organization,</hi> we find that it implies, as its essential condition, a
                    specific arrangement of parts, adapted to some particular purpose, and composing
                    by their assemblage, an individual system endowed with life. It seems
                    impossible, therefore, to attach the idea of organization to a mere fluid,
                    because the mechanical condition of the particles of a fluid is such as to
                    preclude the capability of any permanent arrangement. It appears to be essential
                    to every organized structure, that there shall be solid parts provided for
                    containing those which are fluid. All animal bodies accordingly, are composed of
                    solids and fluids; the former being more permanent in their nature and
                    arrangement, and constituting the basis by which the general form of the body is
                    determined; and the latter, being lodged in appropriate cavities formed by the
                    solids, but capable by their mobility of undergoing more rapid changes of place,
                    and of chemical composition.</p>
                <p>(111.) It may in general be said, that the solids bear but a small proportion to
                    the fluids, which enter into the composition of the body. It is difficult,
                    however, to determine the exact proportion which they bear to one another; in
                    the first place, because this proportion is not fixed, and admits of variation
                    in different ages, circumstances, and conditions of the system; and secondly,
                    because it is scarcely possible to effect the complete separation of these two
                    constituent portions; partly from the ready conversion of the solids into
                    fluids, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> and partly from the tenacity of
                    their mutual adhesion. Some estimate of this proportion has been attempted to be
                    formed, by carefully drying <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498835"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-8835-0596"/>the dead body in a stove, or oven; and the result
                    of some experiments has been, that in an adult man, the weight of the fluids is
                    to that of the solids, as six to one, or, according to other experiments, as
                    nine to one. From the examination of an adult Egyptian mummy, which may be
                    supposed to contain nothing but the dry fibres of the body, a still lower
                    proportion has been assigned to the solid part; since this mummy weighed only
                    seven pounds and a half.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Bedard, <hi rend="italic">Elémens</hi><hi rend="italic">de Anatomie
                    Générale,</hi> pp. 77.</p></note></p>
                <p>(112.) The possibility of reducing all the organic textures of the human body to
                    one elementary material, which might be regarded as the basis of the whole, was
                    long a favourite subject of speculation among anatomists: and Haller has devoted
                    to it the first section of his great work on Physiology.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Elementa Physiologia
                    Corporis Humani.</hi></p></note> He conceives that all the solid parts of the
                    frame arc ultimately composed of fibres; the animal fibre being the simplest
                    form of organized matter, and being to the physiologist, what the line is to the
                    geometrician, that from which all other figures are produced. This simple fibre,
                    he observes, is invisible, even with the assistance of the microscope; it is
                    only by the union of the primary fibres, that visible fibres are constituted;
                    and from the assemblage and lateral adhesion of these, again, thin plates of
                    animal substance are formed, while the grosser substance of the organs
                    themselves, is composed of a complicated contexture of these plates and fibres.
                    This supposed basis, or essential constituent, of all animal textures, has been
                    by some termed the <hi rend="italic">animal parenchyma,</hi> and by others, has
                    been designated by the general name of <hi rend="italic">animal
                    membrane.</hi></p>
                <p>(113.) Besides this spongy or areolated texture, which composes by far the
                    greater bulk of the organs of the body, Haller has also admitted two other
                    constituent parts, namely the <hi rend="italic">muscular,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">nervous substances.</hi> These views have since been generally
                    adopted by physiologists, with some slight modifications. Many have thought it
                    necessary to introduce, in addition to the preceding, an element which they
                    consider as of a tubular form, constituting vessels fitted to contain fluids.
                    This was the favourite doctrine of Boerhaave, who supposed that the simple
                    fibres, or the smallest into which they can be conceived to be divisible, formed
                    by their lateral adhesion, a membrane of the first order, which, when coiled up
                    into a tube, would constitute a vessel of the first order. These vessels, again,
                    when interwoven together, composed a new order of membranes, by the duplication
                    of which a second order of vessels was formed. Successive series of membranes
                    and vessels were thus constructed, until they acquired a magnitude sufficient to
                    be visible to the eye. According to this hypothesis, therefore, all the parts of
                    the body might ultimately be resolved into a congeries of vessels, arranged in
                    these ascending orders. This hypothesis, which evidently rested on the most
                    visionary basis, has been ably refuted by Albinus, and by Haller. It has,
                    however, left some traces in the opinions expressed by many subsequent
                    anatomists, who still cherished the idea of the universal vascularity of the
                    animal fabric, and of this vascularity being essential to organization. The
                    skilful injections of Ruysch, who succeeded in introducing coloured fluids into
                    vessels, the contents of which are naturally transparent, had long ago shown
                    that there exists an order of vessels too minute to be otherwise detected. Dr.
                    William Hunter has, even in later times, adopted the opinion that every living
                    part is necessarily vascular; and that where there is no circulation, there can
                    be no life. Maseagni was also a strenuous advocate of the hypothesis of the
                    universal vascularity of the animal textures; but he conceived that every part
                    is made up of a congeries of minute lymphatic vessels. We shall have occasion
                    afterwards to point out the fallacy of these views.</p>
                <p>(114.) Although the analysis of animal tissues, into the three primitive elements
                    we have pointed out, namely, into the membranous, the muscular, and the nervous
                    fibres, be founded on the most prominent and well marked features of distinction
                    which they exhibit, yet there are perhaps other kinds of texture also, which
                    possess sufficiently characteristic properties to entitle them to rank as
                    elementary tissues: these are the <hi rend="italic">albugineous fibre</hi> of
                    Chaussicr, and the <hi rend="italic">epidermoid substance</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and to these we might also add, in order to make the analysis complete,
                    the <hi rend="italic">cartilaginous</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">osseous
                    structures.</hi></p>
                <p>(115.) But this analysis of animal textures, has, by some later anatomists, been
                    carried, in another point of view, still farther. With relation to the forms
                    assumed by the elementary tissues, they have been referred to three kinds, the
                    <hi rend="italic">fibrous,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">lamellar,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">granular,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">globular.</hi> The two former
                    are exemplified in the structure of the cellular substance, which composes the
                    greatest portion of the animal fabric; the fibrous is characteristic of the
                    muscular and ligamentous structures; the fibrous, united with the granular, is
                    exhibited in the texture of the glands, and in the medullary substance of the
                    nervous system; and the globular is most perfectly shown in the composition of
                    the chyle, the blood, and several of the secretions.</p>
                <p>(116.) Anatomists have sought for still more general results, by means of
                    microscopical investigations. When very high magnifying powers are employed,
                    both the muscular fibre, and the nervous or medullary matter, appear to be
                    resolvable into a mass of globular particles, analogous to those which compose
                    the opaque portion of the blood. Meckel has founded upon these observations the
                    following system: He conceives that every animal structure is ultimately
                    resolvable into two kinds of substance, the one formed into minute, but solid
                    spherular masses, or globules; and the other, being an homogeneous, but
                    amorphous matter, either uniting together these globules in the way of a cement
                    interposed between them, or constituting by itself, what has been termed the
                    cellular substance, membrane, and the various structures derived from membrane.
                    Dr. Edwards, on the other hand, has carried this notion to the utmost possible
                    length; for he represents the cellular and membranous substances, as being
                    themselves composed of globules; so that, according to his views, the whole
                    structure of an animal body will consist of globules.</p>
                <p>But the later, and more careful investigations of Dr. Hodgkin and Mr.
                    Lister,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    of Dr. Edwards’ work.</p></note> appear to have established, that the globular
                    appearance of the different organized textures, when viewed with microscopes of
                    high magnifying power, is altogether an optical deception. A similar conclusion,
                    indeed, was, many years ago, deduced by Dr. Monro, from his microscopical
                    researches, detailed in his work on the Nervous System.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Combinations of
                    Textures.</hi></p>
                <p>(117.) Such being the results of the general analysis of animal textures, into a
                    few primary elements, we are next to consider the combinations of these textures
                    which are actually presented to us by nature, in the various organs of the body;
                    and in order to possess the most comprehensive views on the subject, it will be
                    proper to study these organs as forming systems of which the several parts are
                    related to each other by similarity of composition and of properties. The most
                    elaborate arrangement founded on this principle is that of Bichat, who
                    distinguishes the constituent textures of the body into twenty-one different
                    kinds.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See his <hi
                    rend="italic">Anatomie Générale.</hi></p></note> But it may be objected to his
                    classification, that it is founded on distinctions of function, as well as on
                    those of structure. We <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498848"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-8848-0597"/>therefore prefer following on this subject, the
                    arrangement of Béclard, which proceeds on one uniform principle, namely, that of
                    mechanical conformation. Taking this principle as our guide, we shall find that
                    the systems of organs may be easily reduced to eleven different classes; namely,
                    1, the <hi rend="italic">Cellular</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 2, the <hi

                    rend="italic">;</hi> 9, the <hi rend="italic">Medullary</hi> or <hi

                    >Vascular</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, 11, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glandular</hi> systems of structures. The properties of these several tissues
                    will come under our review in connexion with the functions to which they are
                    more immediately subservient. The three first of these, however, claim our
                    immediate attention, as being the simplest, and most generally diffused over the
                    body.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Cellular Texture.</hi></p>
                <p>(118.) This is the simplest form in which the animal substance presents itself to
                    our observation; and it appears to be not only the real basis of the structure
                    of all the other organs, but also the general medium which unites their several
                    parts together, as well as the bond of connexion between adjacent organs. It is
                    accordingly, of all the simpler textures, that which is the most extensively
                    diffused over the body; not only pervading the substance of the organs, but also
                    filling up all the intervening spaces, and preserving them in their proper
                    relative situations. Haller found it to consist of an irregular assemblage of
                    plates and fibres, crossing one another in all manner of directions; so that
                    when stretched or expanded by the insinuation of any fluid between the plates,
                    the whole presents a cellular structure. These cells, which are produced by the
                    separation of the plates from each other, are of no regular shape, but
                    communicate freely with one another throughout the whole extent of the substance
                    in which they are met with.</p>
                <p>(1l9∙) As there is a continuity of the cellular substance in every part of the
                    body, where it exists in this form, there must, in like manner, be a continuity
                    in the cavities of these cells; and the consequence of this structure is, that
                    any fluid, such as air, or water, which may happen to be introduced into any one
                    part, will readily find its way into adjoining parts, and will thus gradually be
                    diffused over the whole body. If the fluid be water, as happens in dropsies, it
                    will, by its gravity, tend to accumulate in the most depending parts of the
                    body, as the ankles, while a person is standing or sitting; and it will leave
                    these parts, and be more generally distributed, after he has remained for some
                    time in a horizontal posture.</p>
                <p>The cellular texture may easily be inflated by air; and this may happen in
                    consequence of injury, even during life; in which case the air gradually
                    insinuates itself into every part of the frame, puffing up the skin to an
                    extraordinary degree, so as totally to obliterate the features of the face, and
                    disfigure the whole body. If measures be not taken to let the air escape, the
                    patient is at length destroyed by suffocation. A remarkable instance of this
                    disease, which is termed <hi rend="italic">Emphysema,</hi> is given by Dr,
                    William Hunter, in an essay on the properties of cellular texture, contained in
                    the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Medical Observations and
                    Inquiries,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Page 20,
                    et seq∙</p></note> and which also deserves particular notice, as presenting the
                    best account of this branch of general anatomy.</p>
                <p>(120.) The cells, or rather intervals between the plates and fibres of this
                    substance, contain in the natural and healthy state, a quantity of aqueous
                    fluid, which has been termed the <hi rend="italic">cellular serosity,</hi> and
                    which serves the purpose of lubricating the surfaces of the plates, and thus, by
                    diminishing friction, of facilitating their relative motions on each other. To
                    this circumstance we may also trace many of the mechanical properties of the
                    cellular texture; such as its perfect flexibility, and its great extensibility
                    in various directions; while it exerts, at the same time, considerable powers of
                    cohesion. The combination of these two latter properties is the source of
                    another, which it possesses in a very eminent degree, that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elasticity,</hi> or the power of recovering its original form, when the
                    disturbing force, whether producing compression or extension, has ceased to act.
                    It is evident that by possessing all these properties, the cellular texture is
                    eminently qualified to fulfil the important offices assigned to it, of serving
                    as the elastic scaffolding or canvass for sustaining all the other parts, and
                    retaining them in their proper situations; and whilst it is the universal
                    mechanical cement, or medium of connexion between them, it is at the same time
                    admirably adapted to facilitate their re lative movements and mutual actions,
                    which are required for the performance of their respective functions.</p>
                <p>(121.) Another property, besides elasticity, has also been ascribed to the
                    cellular substance and other textures derived immediately from it. It consists
                    in a peculiar kind of contractility, attended by a sudden corregation and
                    curling up of its substance. As this property has been supposed to bear some
                    relation to muscular contractility, we shall defer its consideration till we
                    come to treat of that property.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Adipose Texture.</hi></p>
                <p>(122.) This texture contains the oily secretion which is known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">fat.</hi> The adipose matter, or fat, is lodged in particular
                    portions of the cellular texture, ap propriated to this office. It consists of
                    very minute grains or globules, distinguishable only by the aid of the
                    microscope. Each of these globules is contained in a separate investment, or
                    sac, constructed of an exceedingly fine and delicate membrane, formed out of the
                    constituent plates of the cellular substance, and having no external opening.
                    The size of these vesicles is stated to be from the eighthundredth to the
                    six-hundredth part of an inch in diameter. They are collected together in small
                    rounded masses, united by vessels, and presenting an appearance under the
                    microscope, not unlike that of a bunch of grapes. They are lodged in the cells
                    of the cellular substance in various situations throughout the body, and
                    contribute to fill up the hollows which occur in different places between the
                    bones and muscles, and other organs. They are very abundant immediately under
                    the skin; and in some parts are evidently interposed as cushions for the
                    protection of organs exposed to injury from pressure or other mechanical
                    violence.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the cells in the cellular substance which are occupied by the
                    fat, arc different from those which are the seat of dropsical accumulations of
                    fluid; and that they do not, like the latter, communicate with one another; for
                    it is found that each portion of fat always remains stationary in the same cell
                    in which it was originally lodged.</p>
                <p>(123.) The fat varies considerably in its consistence in different parts of the
                    body, according to the purpose it is intended to serve. At the usual temperature
                    of the living body, however, it is retained very nearly in a state of fluidity.
                    The quantity accumulated in the body is very different at different periods of
                    life; and varies also according to the state of health, and the peculiar habit
                    and constitution of the individual. It is whiter in its colour, and more firm in
                    its consistence, during the earlier periods of life, and becomes more soft, and
                    acquires a yellow tinge as age advances.</p>
                <p>(124.) The fat of animals has been resolved by <hi rend="italic">Cheoreul,</hi>
                    who undertook an elaborate analysis of this substance, into two proximate
                    principles, to which he gives the names of <hi rend="italic">stearin</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">elain.</hi> The former, derived from the Greek word <hi
                    rend="italic">στeαρ,</hi> signifying tallow, is of a much more solid consistence
                    than the latter in ordinary temperatures, and does <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193498861" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8861-0598"/>not melt under a heat of from
                    110° to 120° of Fahrenheit. It is obtained from fat by digesting it in alcohol,
                    in the form of white crystalline needles, which are deposited as the fluid
                    cools. It is a white brittle substance, void of taste or odour, and resembling
                    wax in its appearance. If, after the stearin has been deposited, heat be applied
                    to the remaining solution, so as to drive off the alcohol, there remains an oily
                    matter, which continues fluid at 59° of Fahrenheit, and is called, by <hi
                    rend="italic">Chevreul, elain,</hi> from the Greek term for oil, eλαιov.</p>
                <p>The consistence of the fat of different animals, and in different parts of the
                    same animal, admits of considerable diversity, according to the proportions in
                    which these two ingredients are contained; the abundance of stearin is the
                    principal cause of the hardness of tallow or suet, whilst an increased
                    proportion of elain characterises the composition of marrow, which is one of the
                    most fluid kinds of fat.</p>
                <p>(125.) The marrow which occupies the central cavitΓes of the cylindrical bones,
                    and which also exists in small quantities in the canals that pervade the
                    substance of the denser portions of the bones, is perfectly analogous in its
                    composition and structure to the fat in other parts of the body. The oily
                    particles are contained in membranous vesicle, which are themselves connected
                    together, and retained in their places by a fine net-work of plates and fibres,
                    corresponding to the general cellular structure of other parts, but of a
                    peculiarly delicate contexture.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Membranous Structures.</hi></p>
                <p>(127.) When the texture of cellular substance becomes consolidated by the
                    intimate adhesion of the plates and fibres of which it is originally composed,
                    which, of course, produces the complete obliteration of its cells, it
                    constitutes the different varieties of <hi rend="italic">membranous
                    structures.</hi> These structures are of different degrees of thickness, and
                    compose masses of different degrees of density. When expanded into a continuous
                    sheet or plate, it forms what is more properly termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >membrane.</hi> These membranes, when sufficiently thin, are semi-transparent,
                    and have a smooth and uniform surface. Haller found that all membranes are
                    resolvable, by long maceration in water, into a flocculent spongy substance, in
                    which the original cells of the cellular texture from which they were formed,
                    could be rendered apparent by inflating them with air.</p>
                <p>(128.) Membranes retain almost all the mechanical properties belonging to the
                    cellular substance from which they are derived; for they are equally flexible
                    and elastic, although possessing superior strength and firmness. But in one
                    respect they exhibit a marked difference, while the simple cellular texture, as
                    we have seen, allows of the general communication of fluids introduced into its
                    cells, from one part to another; membranes are for the most part impermeable to
                    fluids, and are in consequence employed with the express design of preventing
                    their diffusion.</p>
                <p>(129.) The property possessed by membranes of contracting in their dimensions by
                    the evaporation of the water they contain, and which is united with the animal
                    material by a very weak affinity, constitutes what may be termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">hygrometric property. ' ,</hi></p>
                <p>All the membranes are capable of being dried by the continued application of a
                    moderate heat, and may be kept in this dry state for a great length of time
                    without undergoing any change. But if a dry membrane be immersed in water, it
                    absorbs a considerable quantity, recovers its softness and flexibility, and
                    expands in all its dimensions. These effects are greater when the action of
                    warmth is combined with that of moisture. A membrane will absorb moisture even
                    from the atmosphere, and again part with it, according to its different states
                    of humidity. Philosophers have availed themselves of this property in the
                    construction of an hygrometer, or instrument for indicating these varying states
                    of the atmosphere with respect to dryness or humidity. Any long slip of dried
                    membrane, suspended in the air, and stretched by a moderate weight, may be made
                    to act on a moveable index by any mechanical contrivance rendering the
                    variations in its length visible on a large scale, and will serve the purpose of
                    an hygrometer. The membrane will be found to lengthen by exposure to a humid
                    atmosphere, from which it imbibes moisture, and again to contract by the
                    evaporation of this moisture in a drier air.</p>
                <p>A piece of catgut, which is prepared from the membrane of a sheep, will answer
                    the same purpose. We find, accordingly, that the state of the weather has a
                    considerable effect upon the tone of a musical instrument made of catgut. A
                    violin, or harp, may be in perfect tune in one situation, and yet become quite
                    out of tune when placed in an atmosphere of greater humidity, as in that of a
                    room filled with company.</p>
                <p>The principle of which these facts are illustrations, is to a certain extent
                    applicable to the animal body. The doctrine of the animal fibres being braced or
                    relaxed, which was formerly a more fashionable language than it is at present,
                    may perhaps have been carried too far, but it has certainly a foundation in
                    truth. Warmth and moisture have a powerful influence on the body, and their
                    effect is partly mechanical; and this operation, which is primarily exerted on
                    the skin, renders them efficacious in the relief of inflammatory action, by
                    diminishing the tension of the inflamed parts. This effect is not merely
                    temporary, but may become the permanent habit of the system. Thus, we find that
                    the inhabitants of elevated countries where the air is peculiarly dry, are more
                    hardy, and possess more of the <hi rend="italic">vis tonica</hi> in their
                    frames, than those who dwell in a humid climate, or in low and swampy plains.
                    The Swiss and other inhabitants of mountainous tracts, may in this respect be
                    contrasted with the Dutch and Flemish, who have in general a constitutional
                    laxity of fibre; and similar differences have been observed in the lower animals
                    among varieties of the same race.</p>
                <p>(130.) All these properties of membrane, taken together, adapt them for being
                    employed in various useful ways in the animal economy. Membranes in general are
                    employed to establish relations not only between adjacent, but also between
                    distant parts; they strengthen their connexions, and, whilst in some they allow
                    of relative motions in certain directions, and to a certain extent, in others
                    they restrain them and limit their degrees. Almost every organ is furnished with
                    a firm covering of membrane, which gives it protection and support. For all
                    these purposes, a looserand more yielding cellular tissue would not have
                    possessed adequate strength.</p>
                <p>(131.) As the cellular substance is the basis of membrane, so membrane, in
                    different modifications, constitutes the essential portion of many other parts
                    of the body; such as all those recipient organs, having the form of sacs or
                    pouches, like the stomach, and especially those which are provided for the
                    retention of fluids, as the gall-bladder, and urinary bladder. Membranes are
                    also formed into tubes of various kinds, destined to transmit their fluid
                    contents to various parts. These tubes, known under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">vessels, canals,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ducts,</hi> are also
                    frequently furnished with a valvular apparatus, likewise composed of membrane,
                    allowing of the passage of the fluid only in one direction.</p>
                <p>(132.) The structure and properties of every description of membranes have been
                    minutely investigated by Bichat, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Anatomie
                    Générale,</hi> has given us an elaborate classification of the animal textures.
                    He establishes two general divisions of membranes, namely, the simple and the
                    compound. Of the former be makes three classes; first, the mucous membranes, the
                    surface of which is defended by a mucous secretion; secondly, the serous
                    membranes, characterised by the serous nature of the fluid with which their <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193498874" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8874-0599"/> surface is
                    constantly moistened; and thirdly, the fibrous membranes, which are
                    distinguished by their peculiar structure, as being composed of dense and
                    inelastic fibres. The compound membranes are formed by the intermixture of two
                    or more of the simpler membranes, and exhibit a combination of the characters of
                    each.</p>
                <p>(133.) <hi rend="italic">Serous membranes</hi> are universally met with
                    where-ever there are internal cavities in the body, which are closed on every
                    side, that is, have no communication, by any channel, with the external air;
                    such cavities being always lined by serous membranes. This is exemplified in the
                    cavities of the chest, which are three in number; namely, one on each side,
                    containing the right and left lung, and the intermediate cavity, occupied by the
                    heart. The membranes lining the former are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >plewrae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the membrane lining the latter, the
                    <hi rend="italic">pericardium.</hi> The great cavity of the abdomen, in which
                    are situated the organs of digestion and chylification, is lined by the <hi
                    rend="italic">peritoneum,</hi> which is also a serous membrane. The same, also,
                    applies to the cavities in the interior of the brain, which are called <hi
                    rend="italic">ventricles,</hi> and also the external surface of the organ, which
                    are lined by the <hi rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >arachnoid coat,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pia mater.</hi> The serous
                    membranes, after lining their respective cavities, are extended still farther,
                    by being reflected back upon the organs inclosed in their cavities, so as to
                    furnish them with an external covering. If it were possible, therefore, to
                    dissect these membranes from off the parts which they invest, they would have
                    the form of a sac without an opening, the organ invested by one of their folds,
                    being altogether external to the cavity of that sac; just as happens when a
                    double night-cap is worn, of which the part immediately covering the head is
                    analogous to that portion of the serous membrane which adheres to, and invests
                    the organ; whilst the external portion of the cap represents the lining of the
                    cavity in which that organ is said to be contained.</p>
                <p>(134.) Hence it will readily be understood, that the serous membranes never open,
                    or allow of any perforation, for the passage of blood vessels, nerves, or ducts,
                    to or from the enclosed organs; but that they are always reflected over those
                    parts, forming a sheath round them, and accompanying them in their course. It
                    also follows, as a necessary consequence, that their free surfaces completely
                    isolate the parts between which they intervene. The great viscera, suspended in
                    the bags formed by their serous coverings, can have no communication with the
                    adjacent parts, except at the points where their vessels enter; in all other
                    situations there is no continuity of parts, although there may be
                    contiguity.</p>
                <p>(135.) In every serous membrane we may distinguish two surfaces having very
                    different characters: the external surface, or that by which they adhere to the
                    surrounding organs, and the internal surface, which is in immediate contact with
                    another portion of the same membrane, but without adhering to it. This interior
                    surface is remarkable for its perfect smoothness and polish; and it is
                    continually preserved in a state of moisture by a serous fluid, which exudes
                    from it. This fluid has been termed the <hi rend="italic">liquid of
                    surfaces,</hi> and consists almost entirely of water, with a very minute
                    proportion of albuminous matter. Its presence is evidently of the greatest use
                    in facilitating the motions of the parts contained within the cavities, with
                    relation to their sides, by diminishing friction, preserving the smoothness of
                    the surfaces applied to each other, and preventing their mutual adhesion. When
                    the internal surface of these membranes is exposed to the air in living animals,
                    or immediately after death, this fluid exhales in the form of vapour, to which
                    formerly great attention was paid, and which was dignified with the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">halitus.</hi> In consequence of disease, this fluid of surfaces
                    sometimes accumulates in one of these cavities, and thereby produces a dropsy of
                    that respective cavity: a fact which proves the power of serous membranes to
                    retain these fluids, and not, as in the case of the cellular substance, to allow
                    of their diffusion into the adjoining organs.</p>
                <p>(136.) The serous membranes constitute the simplest form of condensed cellular
                    substance; they are not divisible into any regular layers; although cellular
                    portions may be removed from the outer surface by which they are attached to the
                    surrounding parts. In the natural state they are exceedingly thin, and
                    transparent; but become thicker and opaque by disease. Although perfectly
                    flexible, they possess considerable strength; theyarc exceedingly extensible;
                    but they arc not in the same proportion elastic: for after they have been
                    stretched, they give but feeble indications of a power of retraction.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Osseous Fabric.</hi></p>
                <p>(137.) For the purpose of thoroughly understanding the whole mechanism and
                    operations of any complicated engine,, or system of machinery, the best and most
                    natural course is to commence with the study of the solid frame-work, which
                    gives stability to the whole fabric, and affords fixed bearings from which the
                    powers, regulating the movements of its different parts, exert their respective
                    powers. This purpose of procuring mechanical rigidity and· support, is the
                    appropriate function of the osseous system, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >skeleton</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which is composed of a connected series
                    of solid structures, called <hi rend="italic">bones,</hi> deriving their
                    mechanical properties from their peculiar chemical composition, and almost
                    crystalline hardness, and which constitute one of the most important of the
                    constituent textures of the body. Our first object of attention, therefore, in
                    considering the mechanical functions, is the study of this system of
                    structures.</p>
                <p>(138.) The bones, then, are to be viewed as the densest and most solid parts of
                    the animal frame; constituting the basis of support to the softer textures,
                    affording protection to all the vital organs, and furnishing those powerful
                    levers which are essential to the advantageous action of the muscles concerned
                    in locomotion, and in the various movements of the limbs. With reference to
                    their form, they have usually been divided into three classes: the <hi
                    rend="italic">long cylindrical bones</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">broad and flat bones</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">short or square bones,</hi> which include those of a more
                    irregular form, and not referable to either of the other two heads. To the first
                    class belong the principal bones of the upper and lower limbs, which are adapted
                    more especially to the purposes of motion. Under the second may be ranked the
                    bones of the skull, which serve for the protection of the. brain; and the third
                    include the vertebrae, the bones of the face, and the small bones which concur
                    in the formation of the wrist and the ankle. There are, besides, other bones,
                    such as the ribs and the bones of the pelvis, of a more anomalous description,
                    which are rather distinguished by their irregularity than by any definite
                    character.</p>
                <p>(139.) On examining the mechanical structure of bones, we find that their
                    external surface is generally their hardest part, and that it consists of a
                    solid plate, or layer of bony matter, of different thickness in different bones,
                    and in different parts of the same bone. In the cylindrical bones this firm and
                    compact substance extends only to a certain depth, and within this the structure
                    is spongy and cellular. To the latter part the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >cancelli</hi> has been given. In the middle of the long bones the central parts
                    are occupied by the marrow; but as we continue our examination, by taking
                    different sections across the bone, in proportion as we approach the
                    extremities, we find the dense external substance diminishing in thickness,
                    while the proportion of the spongy part increases, and encroaches upon the space
                    in the centre occupied by the marrow, which at length disappears, so that at the
                    very extremity of the bone, nearly the whole area of the section is filled by
                    the cancelli, while the outer covering of solid bone is merely a thin
                    superficial plate. In the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498887"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-8887-0600"/>flat bones, having, of course, an upper and under
                    surface, the plates of bone forming each of these surfaces, are termed the two
                    <hi rend="italic">tables,</hi> and the celhdar portion which is found between
                    them is called the <hi rend="italic">diploe.</hi> In many of the more
                    irregularly shaped bones, neither cancelli nor diploe are found, the whole
                    substance being compact. Dr. Bostock observes, that the transition from the
                    compact to the spongy part of a bone is not marked by any decided limit; but
                    they pass into each other by insensible degrees, so as to shew that there is no
                    essential difference between them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Elementary System of Physiology,</hi>

                <p>(140.) Bones present the appearance of fibres on their surface. This is seen
                    particularly in all bones that have been long exposed to the weather, or that
                    have been long boiled. In the cylindrical bones most of these fibres are
                    longitudinal; but in the flat bones they generally run in a radiated direction.
                    In the short bones their course is much more irregular and difficult to trace.
                    In the compact part of the section of a bone, the appearance of plates is not
                    very distinguishable; but certain cavities are discovered which, for the most
                    part, run in a longitudinal direction, and nearly parallel to one another. They
                    are of various lengths; and their diameters are exceedingly small. They have
                    transverse or oblique canals, which establish communications between them; and
                    some of which also open into the larger cancelli in the middle of the bone.
                    These cavities have been called the canals of Havers,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Osteologia nova,</hi> § 35,

                    long time considered as dubious; but it has been lately verified by Mr.

                    microscope, obtained distinct views of them, and was enabled to trace their
                    course. He ascertained the diameter of these canals to be about the 400th of an
                    inch; and farther discovered that they are lined with an extremely fine vascular
                    membrane, and that they are filled with marrow.</p>
                <p>(141.) The intimate structure of bone was first minutely investigated by
                    Malpighi, who discovered that its basis consists of an animal membrane having an
                    areolated, or cellular form. Duhamel<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    frequently disposed in plates or laminae; and he described these plates as
                    forming concentric rings, analogous to those which compose the trunk of a tree;
                    but there is no other foundation than mere fancy for this analogy. We owe to

                    1758.</p></note> the important fact, that the chief properties of bone are
                    derived from the presence of an earthy ingredient, which is deposited in the
                    animal basis, or parenchyma of the bone.</p>
                <p>(142.) The analysis of a bone into its two constituent parts is easily effected
                    by the agency either of acids or of heat. By macerating a full grown bone for a
                    sufficient time in diluted muriatic acid, the earthy portion of the bone,
                    amounting to nearly one-third of its weight, is dissolved by the acid; the
                    animal portion only remaining. This animal basis retains the bulk and shape of
                    the original bone, but is soft, flexible, and elastic; possessing, in a word,
                    all the properties of membraneous parts, and corresponding in its chemical
                    character to condensed albumen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This was first satisfactorily shewn by Mr. Hatchett. <hi
                    rend="italic">Phil Trans,</hi> for 1800.</p></note> A portion of this solid
                    animal substance affords gelatine by long boiling in water, especially under the
                    pressure, admitting of a high temperature, to which it may be subjected in
                    Papin’s digester. On the other hand, by subjecting a bone to the action of fire,
                    the animal part alone will be consumed, and the earth left untouched,
                    preserving, as before, the form of the bone, but having lost the material which
                    united the particles, presenting a fragile mass which easily crumbles into
                    powder. This earthy basis, when chemically examined, is found to consist
                    principally of phosphate of lime, which composes eighty-two hundredths of its
                    weight; and to contain also, according to Berzelius, minute portions of fluate
                    and carbonate of lime, together with the phosphates of magnesia and of soda.</p>

                <p>1. The long bones of the extremities contain more earthy matter than those of the
                    trunk.</p>
                <p>2. The bones of the upper extremity contain somewhat more earthy matter than the
                    corresponding bones of the lower extremity; thus the humerus more than the
                    femur, and the radius and ulna more than the tibia and fibula; this difference
                    is, however small, being about one half per cent.</p>
                <p>3∙ The humerus contains more earthy matter than the radius and ulna, and the
                    femur more than the tibia and fibula.</p>
                <p>4. The tibia and fibula contain, as nearly as possible, the same proportions of
                    animal and earthy matter, and the radius and ulna may also be considered alike
                    in constitution.</p>
                <p>5. The vertebrae, ribs, and clavicle, are nearly identical as regards the
                    proportion of earthy matter; the ileum contains somewhat more of the earth, the
                    scapula and sternum somewhat less: the sternum contains more earthy matter than
                    the scapula.</p>
                <p>6. The bones of the head contain considerably more earthy matter than the bones
                    of the trunk, as observed by Dr. J. Davy; but the humerus and other long bones
                    are very nearly as rich in earths.</p>
                <p>7. The metatarsal bones may probably be ranked with those of the trunk in
                    proportional constitution.</p>
                <p>8. The cancellated structure (at least in the rib) contains less earthy matter
                    than the more solid parts of the bone; this difference, however, is not
                    considerable.</p>
                <p>9∙ The bones of the trunk of the foetal skeleton are as rich in the proportion of
                    earthy matter as those of the adult; at least the difference is too small to be
                    material.</p>
                <p>10. The bones of the foetal extremities, on the other hand, are deficient in
                    earthy matter, which is a fact simply explicable from the circumstance that such
                    an excess of earths as appears necessary to very great strength of bone is not
                    needed at birth, and therefore only appears in after life.</p>
                <p>The existence of a general law, regulating the proportion of earthy deposit in
                    the different bones, (which is shown by the curious agreement of relative
                    proportions observed between the foetal and adult skeletons,) adds one more to
                    the many proofs of the regularity and perfection of design which nature evinces
                    in her operations.</p>
                <p>(143.) It appears evident, then, from these and other facts, that the basis of
                    the osseous structure is essentially the same as that of membraneous parts,
                    being composed of fibrous laminae or plates, which are connected together so as
                    to form, by their intersection, a series of cells analogous to those of the
                    cellular texture. In the interstices of these plates, or in the cells
                    themselves, the particles of phosphate of lime are deposited; the particles
                    being held in union by the interposed membrane, which performs the office of a
                    cement. Hence there is no necessity for admitting the hypothetical explanation
                    of Gagliardi,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Anatomia</hi><hi rend="italic">Ossium.</hi></p></note> who
                    maintained that the bony plates are held together by small processes, like
                    nails, which, rising from the inner plates, pierce through the adjoining ones,
                    and are fixed into the more external plates. Of these processes, or <hi
                    rend="italic">claviculi,</hi> as he called them, he described four different
                    kinds, the perpendicular, the oblique, the headed, and the crooked. But no
                    subsequent anatomist has been able to verify these observations; and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193498900" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8900-0601"/> the account given
                    by Gagliardi remains on recordas a curious instance of the extent to which an
                    observer of mere appearances is liable to deceive himself by the influence of
                    too vivid an imagination. Monro states, that in bones fitly prepared, he could
                    only see numerous irregular processes rising out from the plates. Duhamel,
                    trusting to a fancied analogy between the process of ossification, and the
                    growth of trees, imagined that a bone is composed of a series of regular
                    concentric laminae. But this hypothesis has been refuted by Scarpa,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>De Perit. Structura
                    Ossium.</p></note> who investigated, with great care, both the mechanical
                    structure of bone and the mode of its formation; and concludes that the ultimate
                    texture of bone is not lamellated but reticular. Raspail has indulged in
                    speculations of a still more questionable nature respecting the ultimate osseous
                    texture, which he endeavours to assimilate with that vesicular form, which he
                    views as the essential character both of animal and of vegetable organization.
                    Dr. Benson observes<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Cyclopoedia of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. i. p. 433.</p></note> that all
                    writers, before the time of Scarpa, considered the structure of bone as
                    laminated, or fibrous and laminated; whilst, according to all later authorities,
                    it should be regarded as cellular. In the works of the former, however, we may
                    notice intimations of a reticular texture; and in those of the latter, on the
                    other hand, we meet with the expressions of a <hi rend="italic">tendency</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">disposition</hi> to a laminated arrangement. “If, with these
                    opinions before us,” he continues, “we come to examine for ourselves, we shall
                    have no hesitation in agreeing with Scarpa that it is really cellular. At the
                    same time, it must be confessed, that the sides of the cells are, in the compact
                    tissue, so pressed together, that the appearance of ’laminae is often very
                    striking; and, again, that the sides of the cells have, in most places, the
                    appearance of fibres; when the earthy portion is removed by an acid, we can tear
                    out with a pin the membranous fibres, and almost demonstrate the fibres. But a
                    closer examination will shew that we have torn the cells, and destroyed the true
                    texture. The laminated disposition supposed to be shewn by exfoliation, the
                    weather, burning, &amp;c., may all be proved to be deception; and there can
                    seldom, indeed, be exhibited a plate, however small, of equal thickness
                    throughout, which has been removed by any of these agents. There is, however, an
                    approach to the laminated arrangement, and every cell is formed of particles
                    which approach to the form of fibres. The longitudinal canals of Havers,
                    Lenwenhoeck, and Howship, probably result from the flattened cells, and may be
                    deceptive appearances in the old bone, or the channels for blood vessels,
                    &amp;c.”</p>
                <p>(144.) Bones are invested on every part of their surface, excepting in those
                    parts where they are plated with cartilage, with a firm plate of membrane,
                    termed <hi rend="italic">the periosteum,</hi> which conveys blood vessels to the
                    bone, and establishes mechanical connexions between it and surrounding parts.
                    This membrane belongs to the class of fibrous textures, being composed of
                    numerous inelastic fibres of great density and strength, passing in various
                    directions, and composing a kind of ligamentous tissue, interlacing with the
                    fibres of the ligaments which encircle the joints.</p>
                <p>The inner surface of the periosteum is connected with the bone by the vessels
                    passing from the one to the other, and also by numerous prolongations which dip
                    down into the osseous substance. The blood-vessels of this membrane are
                    numerous, and easily rendered apparent by means of injections, especially in
                    young subjects. Besides the more obvious uses of the periosteum, in affording
                    protection to the surface of bones from injurious impressions they might receive
                    from the action of surrounding parts, and interposing a membranous layer for the
                    defence of the latter, Bichat ascribes to it the more important office of
                    affording fixed centres of support to the general system of fibres, in its
                    mechanical relations to the rest of the frame. The periosteum which covers the
                    bones of the skull has received the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pericranium.</hi></p>
                <p>(145.) The internal cavities of the bones are, as is well known, occupied by an
                    oily secretion, termed the <hi rend="italic">marrow,</hi> contained in a
                    delicate structure, composed of minute vesicles which are filled with the fluid
                    oil, and which are connected by fine threads and plates of fine cellular tissue.
                    Monro describes the vesicles as perfectly distinct, having no communication with
                    one another, and as presenting, under the microscope, the appearance of a
                    cluster of pearls.</p>
                <p>Many have been the conjectural uses assigned to the mar row by the older
                    physiologists; it was at one time very generally imagined that it served, by its
                    mechanical properties, to temper the brittle quality of the earthy materials
                    which form the chief constituent portion of the bone; a purpose, however, which
                    it is impossible it could fulfil, as, instead of being mixed up and blended with
                    the phosphate of lime, or diffused generally through the substratum of the bone,
                    it is lodged in separate cavities, and thereby prevented from any union with
                    bony matter, or intermixture with its substance. The marrow is, in general
                    possessed of little sensibility, except in a few points, where it is traversed
                    by the nervous filaments supplying the bone itself. It is regarded by
                    physiologists of the present day rather as constituting a part of the general
                    store of nutritious matter, which is kept in reserve for particular occasions of
                    exigency, than as having any mechanical relation with the dense texture within
                    which it is lodged. The circumstance of its being wholly absent in the bones of
                    birds is a clear proof that there is no mutual dependence between the functions
                    of the latter and the presence of the marrow.</p>
                <p>(146.) All the internal cavities of bones occupied by the marrow are lined with a
                    vascular membrane, which follows all the windings of the canals and of the
                    cancelli, and has been called the <hi rend="italic">internal periosteum.</hi> It
                    may easily be rendered visible by sawing a long bone longitudinally, and
                    plunging it in boiling water, by which treatment the membrane is made to detach
                    itself from the bone, and contract upon the marrow which is within it, and to
                    which it is closely attached. It has then the appearance of a fine cobweb.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Cartilage.</hi></p>
                <p>(147.) The structure which ranks next to bone in respect to its density is <hi
                    rend="italic">cartilage,</hi> a term which expresses a firm and dense substance,
                    apparently homogeneous in its texture, semipellucid, and of a milk-white or
                    pearly colour. Substances of this description are found to enter into the
                    composition of several parts of the body. The surface of a cartilage is
                    perfectly uniform, and presents no visible eminences or pores; nor can any
                    cavities or inequalities of any kind be perceived in its internal texture. When
                    it is cut into with a sharp knife, the section exhibits an uniform appearance,
                    like that of a piece of glue. Yet, after exposure for a certain time, the
                    surface thus cut begins to contract, and a serous fluid is perceived slowly to
                    exude from it, proceeding from certain invisible pores, which are in all
                    probability minute capillary vessels, of which the diameters are too small to
                    admit the coloured globules of the blood. That a delicate system of circulating
                    passages exist in cartilages, is shewn by various diseased conditions, in which
                    sometimes granulations have been seen to arise from their surfaces, and at othqr
                    times extensive absorption of their substance has taken place; and although
                    insensible, on ordinary occasions, to wounds inflicted by cutting instruments,
                    yet in others, when sudden pressure is made on them under peculiar
                    circumstances, extreme pain arises, giving warning of serious injury
                    impending.</p>
                <p>Cartilaginous structures appear to be composed of albumen alone, with scarcely
                    any intermixture of gelatin. Dr.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498913" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8913-0602"/>
                <p>John Davy found that they contain a small proportion of phosphate of lime,
                    amounting to about the two hundredth part of their weight. Mr. Hatchett,
                    however, does not regard this substance as an essential ingredient in their
                    composition.</p>
                <p>The mechanical property which particularly distinguishes cartilage is elasticity,
                    a quality which it possesses in a greater degree than any other animal
                    structure, and which adapts it to many useful purposes in the economy. Hence it
                    forms the basis of many parts where, contrary to the purposes answered by the
                    bones, pliancy and resilience as well as firmness are required; and hence
                    cartilage is employed when a certain shape is to be preserved, together with a
                    capability of yielding to an external force. The flexibility of cartilage,
                    however, does not extend beyond certain limits; if these be exceeded, fracture
                    takes place. Great density bestowed upon an animal structure, indeed, appears to
                    be in all cases attended with a proportionate degree of brittleness. These
                    mechanical properties of cartilages, as well as their intimate structure,
                    although nearly homogeneous in all, are subject to modification in different
                    kinds of cartilage. Cartilages are covered with a fine membrane, termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">perichondrium,</hi> analogous in its structure and office to the
                    periosteum, which we have already had occasion to point out among the fibrous
                    membranes, as investing the bones.</p>
                <p>(148.) Cartilages are distinguished into those which are <hi rend="italic"
                    >temporary</hi> and those which are <hi rend="italic">permanent structures.</hi>
                    The former are only met with in the earlier periods of life, during the growth
                    of the body, and are gradually removed to make way for the deposition of bone.
                    When about to undergo this change, small canals have been detected in the
                    substance of these temporary cartilages. The permanent cartilages are those
                    which retain the cartilaginous structure throughout every period of life. They
                    have been distinguished into three or four different kinds, such as the
                    mem-braniform, the interosseal, the articular, and the interarticular
                    cartilages.</p>
                <p>(149·) The <hi rend="italic">membraniform cartilages</hi> are included by Bichat
                    in the class of fibro-cartilaginous structures hereafter to be described. They
                    furnish a basis of support to the softer parts, and in some measure supply the
                    place of bone, giving a determinate shape and firmness to parts where bone would
                    have been inconvenient. They possess greater tenacity and less brittleness than
                    the other kinds of cartilage. By their elasticity they admit of considerable
                    variation of figure, yielding to external pressure, and recovering their proper
                    shape as soon as the pressure is removed. Of this kind are the cartilages of the
                    nose and ear, and also those of the larynx and trachea. These cartilages are
                    extremely thin, and are invested with a very thick and firm perichondrium, to
                    which they are connected by means of a number of fibres traversing their
                    substance, and rendering their surfaces rough and porous. Long maceration
                    enables us to detect these fibres, and to resolve the whole into a cellular and
                    albuminous substance.</p>
                <p>(150.) The <hi rend="italic">interosseal cartilages</hi> pass from one bone to
                    another, adhering firmly by their extremities to each. They answer the same
                    purpose as would be attained by an increase of extent in one or both of the
                    bones, with the further advantage of allowing of obscure degrees of motion,· and
                    deadening the effects of jars incident to percussion. The cartilages of the ribs
                    are of this class. They are covered with perichondrium. When they have been
                    steeped in water for a great many months, they are divisible into laminae, of an
                    oval shape, which are united by fibres passing obliquely between them.</p>
                <p>(151.) The <hi rend="italic">articular,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">diarthrodial
                    cartilages,</hi> are those plates of cartilaginous substance which adhere
                    firmly, and almost inseparably, to the surfaces of those bones which are opposed
                    to each other in the joints, or over which tendons and ligaments slide. In some
                    joints the whole of the surface of the bone within the capsular ligament is
                    covered with cartilage; in others, only the parts of bones which move upon each
                    other; the remaining part being covered with ligament. This latter disposition
                    is met with in the joint of the hip. This kind of cartilage, like the others,
                    appears perfectly smooth on its surface, and also when a section is made through
                    its substance; but by a sufficiently long maceration, to allow of a commencement
                    of putrefaction, its fibrous structure may be detected. The elastic resilience
                    of these cartilages has a powerful tendency to lessen the shocks incident to
                    sudden and violent actions.</p>
                <p>(152.) Cartilages of a similar kind are found in the cavities of certain joints,
                    and have hence been called <hi rend="italic">interarti-cular cartilages.</hi>
                    They have no immediate connexion with the bones forming the joint, but are
                    attached only to the inside of the capsular ligament. They are thus rendered
                    somewhat moveable, and being interposed between the bones, allow them a greater
                    latitude of motion, while they at the same time contribute to adapt their
                    surfaces more perfectly to each other. By long maceration in water, a laminated
                    structure is more distinctly perceived in this kind of cartilage than in any of
                    the others.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Fibro-Cαrtilagmous Structures.</hi></p>
                <p>(153∙) Many structures exist in the human body which appear to be of an
                    intermediate nature between ligament and cartilage, in which a fibrous texture
                    is united to a cartilaginous basis, and which combines the characteristic
                    properties of both these textures. They are distinguished from the purely
                    ligamentous parts by their high degree of elasticity, and from cartilage by
                    their fibrous texture. Accordingly we find them employed when this combination
                    of properties is requisite for the functions of the parts. They form additions
                    to interarticular ligaments, and eke out the borders of cavities adapted to the
                    reception of the rounded heads of bones.</p>
                <p>(154.) The principal instances of large masses of fibrocartilaginous structures
                    occur in those which unite the bodies of the vertebrae and of the bones of the
                    pelvis. These <hi rend="italic">intervertebral substances,</hi> as they are
                    termed, impart great elasticity to the spine; and diminish the effects of
                    concussion. When the body has been long in the erect position, the weight of the
                    head and upper parts of the trunk occasions the compression of these
                    intervertebral substances, and the height of the person is diminished. By
                    continuance for an equal time in a horizontal posture, this superincumbent
                    pressure being removed, they recover their original dimensions. Hence a person
                    is taller when he rises in a morning than after sustaining the fatigues of the
                    day; and the difference of stature often amounts to a whole inch.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Ligamentous Structures.</hi></p>
                <p>(155.) Structures possessing inferior degrees of solidity, but still exhibiting
                    structures of considerable density, are met with in the interior of the body,
                    and serve various mechanical purposes of cohesion and support. Many of these may
                    be regarded as mere modifications of membrane; but yet the peculiarities of
                    structure and of properties exhibited by ligamentous textures point them out as
                    requiring to be classed separately. Bichat, who has viewed them as composing a
                    system of structures, has given to it the title of <hi rend="italic">the fibrous
                    system</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a name which is liable to the objection of
                    not being sufficiently distinctive; since, as we shall afterwards find, many
                    other parts, and especially the muscles, are no less fibrous than the tendons
                    and the ligaments. As a general designation of this class of fibres, we have
                    therefore preferred the term of <hi rend="italic">ligamentous system,</hi> which
                    sufficiently expresses the general mechanical purpose which they are designed to
                    serve in the animal economy.</p>
                <p>(156.) This system includes a great number of structures, which, although very
                    similar in their nature and office, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498926"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-8926-0603"/>have received different names, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">ligaments, tendons, fasciae, aponeuroses, capsules,</hi> &amp;c.
                    Fibres of a similar kind to those which constitute these parts, also enter into
                    the composition of other organs, imparting to them different degrees of
                    mechanical strength.</p>
                <p>(157.) Various as are the forms and dispositions assumed by ligamentous fibres,
                    they present us with two principal varieties, according as they are expanded
                    into thin and broad plates, or ligamentous membranes, or collected into thick
                    and elongated cords. The first division includes fibrous membranes, fibrous
                    capsules, tendinous sheaths, and aponeuroses.</p>
                <p>(158). <hi rend="italic">The fibrous membranes</hi> resemble ordinary membranes,
                    but have, superadded to the structure of the latter, numerous denser fibres,
                    which give them greater strength, and fit them for affording mechanical support
                    to various organs. Thus the periosteum of the bones is a membrane of this
                    description. The internal periosteum of the skull or <hi rend="italic">dura
                    mater</hi> has a similar structure. The external coat of the globe of the eye,
                    or <hi rend="italic">sclerotica</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the investing
                    membranes of many of the glands, as the kidneys, belong to the class of fibrous
                    membranes; to which also we may perhaps refer some of the coats of the larger
                    blood-vessels, and of the excretory ducts of glands. Besides enveloping organs,
                    these fibrous membranes often extend into their interior, forming partitions, or
                    even cells, which contribute to their firmness and support.</p>
                <p>(159·) <hi rend="italic">The fibrous capsules</hi> present the form of sacs,
                    which surround certain joints, especially those of the shoulder and hip, and
                    preserve the connexion between the bones which form these joints. These
                    capsules, again, are lined internally by serous or synovial membranes, supplying
                    the fluid which lubricates the surfaces of the parts playing upon each
                    other.</p>
                <p>(160.) <hi rend="italic">The tendinous sheaths</hi> are formed by fibrous
                    membranes of a cylindrical shape, which surround the tendons in those parts
                    where they pass over bones, and are particularly subjected to friction, or
                    liable to occasional displacement during the action of the muscles which move
                    the joint. Some of these include only one tendon in their respective cavities,
                    as those of the fingers and toes: others receive several tendons, as those
                    belonging to the muscles of the wrist and ankle joints.</p>
                <p>(161.) <hi rend="italic">Aponeuroses</hi> consist of extended sheets of fibrous
                    texture, principally belonging to the organs of locomotion; and disposed in some
                    instances so as to form coverings of parts; while in others they constitute
                    points of attachment to muscles. Thus they may be distinguished into
                    aponèu-roses for enveloping, and aponeuroses for insertion. The former, which
                    are generally termed fasciae, either surround the muscles of the limb, forming a
                    general sheath for it, as in the fore-arm and thigh; or else they invest and
                    confine some particular muscles. The aponeuroses for insertion either form broad
                    or narrow surfaces, or consist of separate fibres, giving attachment to
                    particular portions of muscles, or form arches, which both admit of their
                    connexion with muscular fibres, and at the same time allow of the passage of
                    vessels.</p>
                <p>(162.) The second division composes the proper ligaments and tendons, all of
                    which have more or less the form of cords.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ligaments</hi> connect together the articular surfaces of
                    bones, and oppose a very considerable resistance to any force tending to their
                    displacement. The fibres which enter into their composition, generally preserve
                    a direction nearly parallel; but frequently they are extended in various ways,
                    forming an intertexture calculated to resist extension in different directions;
                    and from their mere flattened form, bringing these ligaments nearer to the
                    description of fibrous membranes.</p>
                <p>( 163.) The <hi rend="italic">tendons</hi> are generally more simple in their
                    structure, consisting of elongated cords; but in some instances they are more
                    complicated, being divided into several smaller cords.</p>

                <p>(165.) The structure of all these parts, as their name imports, is essentially
                    fibrous; the individual fibres which ' compose them being exceedingly slender
                    filaments of a very dense, firm, and inelastic substance; sometimes parallel to
                    each other, as in the tendons and ligaments, and sometimes variously interwoven,
                    as in the fibrous membranes. In some portions of the denser structures hereafter
                    to be noticed, the fibres are so closely united as to present an almost
                    homogeneous appearance; but in all the parts hitherto considered, the bundles of
                    fibres admit of being separated by maceration; and are resolvable into
                    lengthened filaments of extreme tenuity. It has not been perfectly ascertained
                    what is the diameter of the fibres when this subdivision has been carried to its
                    utmost limit; but they appear in this ultimate state of division to be as fine
                    as the filaments spun by the silk worm. These ultimate fibres are distinguished
                    by their flexibility, their extreme tenacity, and their brilliant whiteness.
                    They are probably in no case tubular, but solid throughout, although Maseagni,
                    extending to them his general system of organic textures, regards them as formed
                    of lymphatic vessels. Chaussier,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Organization.</p></note> with great appearance of truth, considers them as a
                    peculiar and primary organic tissue, to which he has given the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">albugineous fibre,</hi> in order to distinguish it from the mere
                    simple cellular or membranous fibre, which constitutes the basis of the general
                    substance of the body.</p>
                <p>(166.) The fibres which enter into the composition of these ligamentous textures,
                    are united by a cellular tissue of extreme fineness and tenuity, which is
                    rendered evident after maceration when the ligamentous fibres aredrawn asunder.
                    Their arrangement at the surface of these structures is such as to produce that
                    glistening and satin-like lustre which results from a surface of high polish and
                    density; an appearance which is very characteristic of the fibrous structures.
                    This smoothness and resplendent white colour is possessed in the greatest degree
                    by tendons, which have in general a greater extent of motion than the ligaments,
                    and therefore require a higher degree of polish.</p>

                <p>(167.) Having noticed the properties of those elementary textures that furnish
                    those cohesive and resisting forces which are necessary for the mechanical
                    purposes of the animal fabric, we have next to review those combinations of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193498939" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8939-0604"/> structure which
                    have been adopted for establishing the connexions between the various parts of
                    the frame, and which adapt them to those objects. These modes of connexion admit
                    of great variety, according to the different mechanical relations which must
                    take place between them; and more particularly with reference to the degrees of
                    mobility which are to result from their union. In many cases the parts placed in
                    juxtaposition require to be fixed in their places by the firmest bonds which can
                    secure their relative immobility: in others, the freest motion must be allowed;
                    while in various other instances, we find almost every intermediate degree of
                    flexion allowed, and every kind of connecting mechanism employed. But from the
                    deep implanting of the teeth in the jaws, like nails firmly fixed in wood, and
                    the mutual locking in of the bones of the skull by indented sutures, like the
                    dove-tailed junctions of carpentry, to the freely rotating joints of the limbs,
                    as in those of the shoulder or the hip, we may trace various modes of
                    articulation which are calculated to limit the extent and to regulate the kind
                    of movements, in subordination to particular ends. There is certainly no part of
                    the human fabric, wonderfully and fearfully as the whole of it has been made,
                    which exhibits more palpable evidences of express mechanical contrivance and
                    adaptation to specific purposes, than the construction of the joints, and of the
                    whole of their auxiliary apparatus. It is well observed by Paley,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Natural Theology.</p></note>
                    that every joint is a mechanical curiosity, and a proof of contriving wisdom.
                    They are, indeed, as Cicero has truly expressed it, “mirabiles commissuras, et
                    ad stabilitatem aptas, et ad artus finiendos accommodatas, et ad motum, et ad
                    omnem corporis actionem.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>" <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> De Natura Deorum, I. ii. c∙
                    35.</p></note></p>
                <p>(168.) There are two circumstances which determine the kind of relative motion of
                    which a joint, by which term is more particularly meant the connexions of
                    adjacent bones, is capable. The first of these comprises the form of the
                    contiguous surfaces of the bones themselves which are brought to play on each
                    other, and their mode of apposition; the second relates to the structure and
                    mechanical conditions of the inteijacent flexible parts, such as the ligaments,
                    the cartilages, and the membranes, which impart different degrees of
                    elastibility or springiness, and variously modify the motions which result. With
                    respect to the first, the principal diversities arise from the various extent of
                    range allowed with regard to the planes of motion; and these varieties are
                    naturally distributed under two heads; the one being a semi-rotatory motion
                    within a considerable extent of a spherical surface, as exemplified in what are
                    called the ball and socket joints; the other, in which the angular motion is
                    restricted to a single plane, as is the case with what are termed the
                    hinge-joints. It is not necessary here to advert to the further distinctions to
                    which a minute examination of all the different modifications of these kinds of
                    mechanism, which are exhibited in the solid structures of the body, would lead
                    us; which the older physiologists pursued with great diligence, and which they
                    were fond of dignifying with a formidable array of technical terms; a sufficient
                    account of these now obsolete denominations having been already given under the
                    head of <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy</hi> in this work. It will be sufficient
                    for our present purpose to observe, in general, that the long bones of the limbs
                    have their extremities expanded so as to form broad surfaces where they are in
                    apposition with the contiguous bones, between which a joint is formed. In the
                    ball and socket joint, it is the moveable bone which has the rounded head, and
                    the fixed bone, or that nearest to the trunk of the body, which contains the
                    corresponding cavity or socket. Such at least is the case in man; but some
                    animals present us with examples of a contrary arrangement; that is. of the
                    concave surface of the moveable, turning on a convex projection of the fixed
                    bone. Bones of a flat or irregular shape are, in general, much more limited in
                    their motions, when they form joints, than those of a lengthened cylindrical
                    form.</p>
                <p>(169·) In proportion to the extent of motion allowed in the joint, we find
                    provisions adopted for diminishing friction, and guarding against injury. In all
                    the articulations the ends of the bones which enter into their formation, are
                    invested with a smooth and polished plate of cartilage; a substance which, by
                    its modified hardness, and great elasticity, is especially adapted to both these
                    purposes. Its limited degree of organization, also, gives it many advantages in
                    withstanding the influence of pressure, especially if suddenly made, and
                    frequently repeated. In some joints this investing layer of cartilage is of
                    equal thickness throughout, so that it appears as a crust, regularly moulded
                    over the articular surface of the bone which it covers, and exactly preserving
                    its figure; but, in other cases, it is found to be thicker at the middle than at
                    the marginal parts; thereby increasing the convexity of the projecting portion,
                    or diminishing the concavity of those which recede; both of which appear to be
                    provisions for ensuring, as the case may be, the uniformity of contact of the
                    adjacent parts composing the joint. These superficial articular cartilages, or
                    “cartilages of incrustation,” as they have been termed, appear to be composed of
                    a multitude of slender fibres, strongly adhering together, and all of them being
                    perpendicular to the tangential planes of the surface of the bone they invest,
                    like the pile of velvet, and disposed, therefore, in a manner very similar to
                    that of the fibres of the enamel of the teeth, which is superimposed in nearly
                    the same way&gt;on the bony part of the tooth. The most complete investigation
                    of this structure will be found in a paper of Dr. William Hunter’s, published in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For 1743, vol. 42, p. 544.</p></note> It
                    results from this conformation, that the fibres, on the application of pressure,
                    yield to a certain degree, and bend in waves; just as happens to velvet when it
                    is compressed; and they again resume their perpendicular positions on the
                    removal of the compressing force.</p>
                <p>(170.) The whole of the interior surface of each joint is lined with a smooth and
                    glistening membrane of great tenuity, forming a cavity closed on every side, and
                    supplying a peculiar secretion, termed the <hi rend="italic">synovia,</hi>
                    obviously intended for the lubrication of all the contiguous surfaces. Similar
                    <hi rend="italic">synovial membranes,</hi> as they are called, forming, in like
                    manner, closed sacs, are met with, surrounding the sheaths of the tendons, and
                    interposed between other parts, the motions of which would expose them to
                    considerable friction. In the former case, when employed in the articulations,
                    they are termed <hi rend="italic">capsules</hi> of the joints; in the latter,
                    they have received the inappropriate name of <hi rend="italic">Bursae
                    Mucosae.</hi> The synovia is a transparent and viscid fluid, slippery to the
                    feel, and capable of being drawn out into strings by the fingers. It has been
                    imagined that the secretion is principally derived from certain fringe-like
                    processes, chiefly visible in the knee and hip-joints, and constituting what
                    have been called the <hi rend="italic">alar ligaments.</hi> These membranous
                    appendages, which project into the cavity of the joint, and appear to be formed
                    by folds of the synovial membrane, containing some cellular substance, and small
                    pel!ets of adipose matter, present an appearance very similar to that of the
                    epiploic duplicatures of the peritoneum, and especially of the appendices
                    epiploicae of the colon.</p>
                <p>(171.) The motions which a joint is capable of performing are often modified and
                    extended by the interposition of detached plates of cartilage, connected only by
                    ligament with the synovial capsule, and capable of shifting their position, so
                    as to enlarge the range and modify the mode of action. Those which we have
                    already described under the title of <hi rend="italic">interarticular
                    cartilages,axe</hi> met with chiefly in those <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193498952" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8952-0605"/>joints where the motion is
                    frequent and considerable, and where the ends of the bones are subjected to
                    great pressures; as in the junction of the lower jaw with the temporal bone, and
                    in the knee-joint. The <hi rend="italic">semilunar</hi> cartilages, in this
                    latter example, increase the depth of the articular cavity, and ensure, in all
                    the motions of the joint, a perfect adaptation of the surfaces to one
                    another.</p>
                <p>(172.) The bones are retained in connexion, their junction strengthened, and
                    their relative movements farther regulated, by the ligaments which invest the
                    joint. Of these there are two kinds, the <hi rend="italic">capsular,</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">fascicular</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the former
                    investing the joint on all sides in the case of the ball and socket
                    articulation; and the latter passing from bone to bone in different directions,
                    limiting the motion more or less to a particular plane. When, in the
                    hinge-joint, they are placed externally on the two sides, they form what are
                    called <hi rend="italic">lateral ligaments</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in
                    the case of the knee, additional securities are provided, by short and round
                    ligaments, crossing one another in the interior of the joint; these are the <hi
                    rend="italic">crucial ligaments.</hi> Besides these, we often find other
                    ligamentous bands, passing more obliquely, and dispersed in different
                    directions, which assist in strengthening the joint, preventing the displacement
                    of the bones, and thus completing the mechanical apparatus of each articulation.
                    The muscles which surround the joint also contribute very powerfully in
                    retaining the bones in their proper places, and preventing the sudden
                    dislocations which might otherwise occur during the strains incident to rapid
                    and violent actions.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Package of Organs.</hi></p>
                <p>(173.) The great mechanical objects of adhesion and support being provided for by
                    the organic systems we have now considered, our attention may next be directed
                    to purposes of a subordinate and special nature, and which relate to local
                    adaptations, comprehending what Paley has aptly termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >package</hi> of the organs. Art and contrivance have been as manifestly
                    displayed in fulfilling these more limited objects, as in the more extended
                    designs of the general fabric. When we consider the vast mùltiplicity of parts,
                    which it requires the study of years of patient instruction and dissection to be
                    thoroughly acquainted with, which are closely arranged and stowed in the narrow
                    space allotted for them in the body, we cannot but be struck with the care that
                    has been taken in their disposal in the most convenient manner, and with the
                    greatest economy of room. The brain consists of a prodigious number of fibres,
                    gathered together in curious folds, or convolutions, in order that they may
                    occupy the smallest possible bulk, and be contained within the circumscribed
                    cavity of the skull, which is to afford them protection. Within how small a
                    compass are lodged all the delicate parts which compose the complex organ of
                    hearing, and which are encased in a hollow space, scooped out of the most solid
                    parts of those bones. Equal care has been bestowed in the lodgment and package
                    of the viscera which occupy the other cavities of the body, namely, the thorax
                    and abdomen. Those which are of greatest importance to life, and whose delicate
                    texture admit most easily of being injured, are always placed in situations of
                    greatest security, and effectual care is taken to provide additional protection
                    by means of bones, cartilages, or other denser mechanical fabrics. All the
                    organs are tied down and secured in their places by membranes, so adjusted in
                    regard to breadth and flexibility, as to allow of those motions which their
                    functions require; or, in other cases, to restrain their displacement, by
                    tightly binding them in their situations. AΠ the important viscera are invested
                    with coverings proper to themselves, composing capsules, which are generally of
                    great density and strength, and calculated to give them effectual protection
                    against pressure or other mechanical causes of injury. The muscles, which are in
                    strongest and most frequent action, are firmly braced and tied down by sheets of
                    fibro us tissue, inserted into the neighbouring bones, and preventing them from
                    starting from their places when urged into sudden and violent contractions.
                    Lastly, all the spaces intervening between the muscles,blood-vessels, nerves,
                    and bones, are filled up with a quantity of cellular and adipose substances,
                    sufficient to leave no vacuity. Hence arises that rounded and flowing outline
                    which has been given to the body, and which forms one of the constituent
                    elements of its beauty.</p>
                <p>(174.) The provision of a general envelope to the whole of this complex system of
                    organs, may be regarded as another consideration which appertains to the subject
                    now before us, namely, the package of the body; but its importance is such as to
                    entitle it to be treated of under a separate section.</p>
                <p>(175.) This combination of structures, individually possessing different degrees
                    of rigidity, but cemented together by a highly elastic medium, and bound down by
                    a general envelope of considerable strength, produces a result, which, being of
                    considerable importance with reference to the mechanical condition of the
                    fabric, is deserving of special notice. It is matter of observation that the sum
                    of the cohesive forces among the particles composing the mass of animal tissues,
                    is balanced, in the living body, only by the resistance arising from the
                    rigidity or incompressibility of the parts opposed to them; or, in other words,
                    the force of elasticity in the cellular and membranous textures is not in a
                    state of neutrality, but the equilibrium is maintained only by the mechanical
                    circumstances of situation. Thus it happens that, when these circumstances are
                    altered, and the equilibrium disturbed, elasticity comes into play and produces
                    a shrinking of the whole mass. The result is that, in the natural state, every
                    part is kept on the stretch; but retracts as soon as its elasticity is allowed
                    to act by the removal of the extending cause. This will happen whenever the
                    contents of hollow organs are withdrawn, whenever the parts themselves are
                    divided transversely by a cutting instrument, and also when, by a change of
                    position, their extremities are brought nearer together, and the mass assumes a
                    more rounded figure. This property, the result of a high degree of unbalanced
                    elasticity, has long been known, though described under various names. The term
                    by which it has most frequently been designated is that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tone</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tonicity</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                    Bichat, who has given a good description of its effects, denominated it
                    “contractilité de tissu” and “contractilité par défaut d’extension,” whilst he
                    regards tonicity as another and distinct property not of a mechanical, but of a
                    vital nature. The observations we have formerly made on the vital properties,
                    will show that we regard the distinction which he here makes as being founded on
                    very questionable grounds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">The Integuments.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The External Integuments.</hi></p>
                <p>(176.) The skin, which gives covering to the whole body, together with its
                    various prolongations and parts connected with it, and constituting altogether
                    the <hi rend="italic">integuments,</hi> are complex structures. They consist, in
                    the first place, of ordinary cellular tissue; secondly, of the same substance in
                    a more condensed and membranous form; and, thirdly, of a stratum of adipose
                    substance; but they also present us with a kind of structure which differs
                    totally from any of those we have hitherto had occasion to notice. For the clear
                    understanding of these distinctions, it will be necessary, first to explain in
                    greater detail the composition of the external integuments, or the skin.</p>
                <p>The parts of which skin consists are arranged in layers; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193498965" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8965-0606"/>and in giving an account of
                    these we shall take them in an order the reverse of that in which they are
                    usually considered; beginning with the innermost layers, and proceeding
                    successively to the more external.</p>
                <p>(177.) That portion of the integuments which is called <hi rend="italic">the true
                    skin,</hi> is in most parts of the body separated from the subjacent muscles or
                    boncs, by a stratum of fat, or rather of adipose substance; that is, as we have
                    already seen, of a cellular and vesicular structure, containing the minute
                    globules of the fat. In other parts, the attachment of the skin is effected
                    merely by interposed common cellular substance, of more or less thickness and
                    density in different places. The succeeding layer is that which forms by far the
                    largest portion of the integuments, and has been denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >the corion,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">true skm.</hi> Its ultimate structure
                    is described by Haller as being analogous to that of membranous parts; that is,
                    composed of a dense intertexture of short fibres and of plates, artificially
                    interwoven together, and united by the close adhesion of their surfaces. It may
                    in this view, therefore, be considered as merely a denser tissue of the common
                    cellular substance, which is, in fact, the basis of most animal structures. This
                    density increases gradually as we trace the texture from the inner to the outer
                    parts; while at its interior surface it passes gradually into the looser
                    cellular texture which is beneath it. Bichat gives a similar description of the
                    essential structure of the corion, but states that, in addition to this, there
                    are found a great number of dense fibres, of a whiter colour than the rest,
                    interspersed throughout its substance, which pass in all possible directions, so
                    as of themselves to compose a close net-work, and leave certain interstices or
                    <hi rend="italic">areolae.</hi> This reticulated texture, with the interposed
                    vacuities, may be discovered by long-continued maceration, which loosens the
                    adhesion of the fibres. Small masses of fat are found occupying the intervals
                    between them. Thus the dense fibres of the corion may be regarded as the chief
                    support or skeleton, as it were, of the whole fabric, giving it its requisite
                    form, consistence, and other mechanical properties.</p>
                <p>(178.) The external portion of the corion is more finely organized than the rest.
                    It has been considered as forming a distinct layer of the skin, named by Bichat,
                    from the large proportion of minute blood-vessels it contains, the vascular
                    net-work; and by other anatomists, <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">papillare,</hi> from its presenting on its outer surface, when
                    viewed with the microscope, an immense number of little eminences or conical
                    projections, which have been termed <hi rend="italic">papillae.</hi> These
                    papillae were discovered by Malpighi, and have been since described and
                    delineated by Ruysch, Albinus, and many other anatomists. Cheselden and others,
                    however, have doubted their existence, at least as a necessary appendage of the
                    corion; for papillae are perfectly visible to the naked eye on the upper surface
                    of the tongue, where they are presented on a very large scale. They are also
                    easily perceived, with a magnifying glass, at the tips of the fingers, as well
                    as in other organs endowed with a peculiar sensibility to impressions of touch.
                    But in those parts of the body which have not the same sensibility, and are
                    seldom employed as the vehicles of touch, they are so minute as scarcely to
                    admit of detection; and their existence has been inferred rather from analogy
                    than from distinct and positive observation.</p>
                <p>(179∙) The external surface of the corion, or of the corpus papillare, is covered
                    with a thin layer of a soft substance, which has been termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rete Mucosum.</hi> It was first observed by Malpighi, in the skin
                    of the negro, and is hence often called after him the <hi rend="italic">Pete
                    Malpìghianum.</hi> The structure, and even existence of this membrane have given
                    occasion to much controversy. Malpighi had announced it as being a stratum of
                    soft matter, disposed in the form of lines which crossed one another in various
                    directions. Blumenbach and other anatomists describe it as merely a thin layer
                    of pulpy matter, without any distinct reticulated structure. Bichat, on the
                    other hand, denies altogether its existence as a proper membrane, and supposes
                    that what Malpighi saw and described is merely a collection of very delicate
                    vessels, which, after having passed through the corion, form a network on its
                    surface. In this opinion he is supported by other anatomists of high authority,
                    as Chaussier and Rudolphi. NIr. Cruickshank,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>On Insensible Perspiration.</p></note> on the contrary, who
                    has bestowed great pains on the examination of this subject, entertains no doubt
                    of the existence of the rete mucosum, both in the external skin, and also even
                    in some of its productions in the interior of the body. Dr. Gordon admits of the
                    presence of the rete mucosum in the skin of the negro, where it is easily
                    demonstrated; but asserts that it cannot be found in that of the European. On
                    the whole, the positive evidence in favour of the real existence of this
                    membrane appears to preponderate; and at any rate, it seems admitted on all
                    hands, that the colouring matter of the skin, which is black in the negro, and
                    has different tints in the other varieties of the human race, is situated in
                    that part which has been assigned as the seat of the rete mucosum. By some it
                    has been stated that <hi rend="subscript"> φ</hi> the rete mucosum extends in a
                    uniform layer over the whole surface of the true skin; by others that it is
                    perforated in various parts by the papillae of the corion, and exists only in
                    the interstices of these papillae.</p>
                <p>(180.) The outermost layer of the skin is the <hi rend="italic">cuticle</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">epidermis,</hi> which gives a uniform covering to every part
                    of its surface, adhering closely to it, and being accurately applied to all its
                    inequalities. It adheres with considerable tenacity to the subjacent skin,
                    through the medium of the rete mucosum, and its attachment is perhaps also
                    secured by fibres passing from the one to the other. In the dead skin a
                    separation is easily effected by maceration in water, and by a state of
                    incipient putrefaction. In the living body the cuticle is detached by the
                    operation of a blister, or by scalding water, which produce an effusion of
                    serous fluid on the outer surface of the corion. As the cuticle is impervious to
                    this fluid, it is raised, and gives rise to a permanent vesicle.</p>
                <p>(181.) When the cuticle is carefully separated from the corion, after its
                    connexion has been loosened by putrefaction, a multitude of very slender
                    transparent filaments are seen, stretching between these two layers, which are
                    torn asunder when farther extended. Dr. william FI unter believed these
                    filaments to be the terminations of those vessels which exhale the perspiration,
                    and nearly the same views have been entertained with regard to their nature by
                    Bichat and by Chaussier. Cruickshank, on the contrary, considered them to be
                    processes from the cuticle, and not vessels.</p>
                <p>(182.) Many erroneous notions have at different times prevailed with respect to
                    the intimate structure of the epidermis. Lecuwenhoeck conceived that it is
                    composed of a number of laminae, or scales, which he represented as having an
                    imbricated arrangement, that is, overlapping each other successively, like the
                    scales of a fish. But it is now generally admitted that this was a deceptive
                    appearance. The division of layers, which it may seem to admit of in parts where
                    it is of unusual thickness, is merely an artificial separation, not warranted by
                    any natural distinction of textures. Although some have pretended to discover in
                    it a congeries of vessels, especially lymphatics, yet the most accurate and
                    unbiassed observers declare that they cannot perceive in the epidermis, a
                    specific texture of any kind or <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498978"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-8978-0607"/>any regular arrangement of its parts. Dr. Gordon
                    gives it as his decided opinion that it is “truly inorganized, and
                    non-vascular.”</p>
                <p>(183.) Leewenhoeck imagined also that he could discern a number of perforations,
                    or pores, as he termed them, in the cuticle. But later and more scrupulous
                    inquirers have looked in vain for these supposed pores; and it is now generally
                    admitted that none such exist. Indeed, one of the most characteristic properties
                    of the cuticle is its impermeability to fluids, under ordinary circumstances.
                    The latest inquiries into this subject are those of Mr. Chevalier, who describes
                    the cuticle as composed of an infinite number of small <hi rend="italic"
                    >velamina,</hi> regularly arranged, so as to form a bibulous and exquisitely
                    hygrometrical covering.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Lectures οη the Gene αl Structure of the Human Body, p. 133.</p></note> The
                    mode in which the occasional transmission of fluids through this substance takes
                    place in cutaneous absorption, and perspiration, will be the subject of future
                    discussion. The only real distinguishable pores in the cuticle are those which
                    give passage to the hairs, and to the sebaceous follicles hereafter to be
                    noticed.</p>
                <p>Thus, then, there is presented to us in this layer of the integument, a kind of
                    structure differing essentially from either the cellular or membranous tissues
                    which have already been described. The epidermis is an animal texture, nearly
                    homogeneous in its substance, possessing but a moderate degree of extensibility,
                    and approaching to the nature of an inorganic substance, inasmuch as it exhibits
                    no appearance of vascularity, and a total absence of nerves, or other medium of
                    connexion with the living system. Bichat even considers its vitality as
                    exceedingly obscure; he doubts whether it can be said to possess life; but is
                    inclined to regard it as a semi-organized, or rather inorganic body, placed by
                    nature at the point of communication between external dead matter and the living
                    skin, and serving as a gradation between them.</p>
                <p>(184.) The nails and the hair are to be classed as structures very similar to the
                    epidermis, of which, indeed, they are often regarded as mere appendages. The
                    nails, in particular, have so intimate an adhesion to the epidermis, that both
                    are generally detached together, by maceration. They consist of hard,
                    transparent, and semi-elastic plates, formed of a substance analogous to the
                    horns of animals. They adhere to the subjacent corion, (which is in those parts
                    furnished with a great abundance of minute blood-vessels, and of which the
                    papillae are arranged in longitudinal and parallel rows, very close to one
                    another,) in a manner similar to that in which the epidermis adheres to the
                    corion in other parts. The internal surface of the nail is soft, pulpy, and
                    marked with longitudinal grooves corresponding to the lines which they cover and
                    enclose; and by this mutual adaptation the connexion between them is extremely
                    intimate. The innermost edge of the nail is received into a groove formed of a
                    duplicature of skin fitted for its reception. The epidermis belonging to this
                    portion of skin is folded back upon it, and on arriving at the root of the nail,
                    quits the corion, is reflected over the external surface of the nail, and
                    becomes identified with its substance.</p>
                <p>The nails, in all their mechanical properties, correspond to the cuticle, and may
                    be regarded as the same substance in a greater state of condensation.</p>
                <p>The hair consists of slender filaments, which appear to be formed of nearly the
                    same substance as the nails, and may be considered, in a mechanical point of
                    view, as still more condensed forms of cuticle. Each hair is provided at its
                    root, with an expanded portion, or bulb, from which its extension proceeds, and
                    which, by the intervention of its vessels, connects it with the corion, in which
                    it is imbedded, just as the roots of a vegetable attach it to the soil. The
                    strength of hair is exceedingly great, compared with its small diameter, as has
                    been frequently ascertained by trying the weights which it can support without
                    tearing. There is no substance, indeed, which would be better adapted for making
                    ropes than human hair, provided it could be procured of sufficient length. It
                    scarcely possesses any extensibility, and is consequently inelastic. If exposed
                    to moisture, it imbibes a certain quantity of water; and this absorption is
                    accompanied with an increase in the length of the hair. From its having this
                    property, it has been employed by De Saussure as a hygrometer, or instrument for
                    indicating the degree of moisture or dryness of the atmosphere. In order to
                    adapt it to this purpose, however, it requires to be freed from a quantity of
                    oily matter, which it naturally contains, by maceration in an alkaline solution.
                    The colouring matter of the hair is supposed to correspond in its nature, as it
                    does in its appearance, to that which is contained in the rete mucosum of the
                    skin.</p>
                <p>Thus we find that there is a very considerable similarity between the hair, the
                    nails, and the cuticle, with regard both to structure, composition, and
                    mechanical properties; and that they may be regarded, when once their formation
                    has been completed, as equally devoid of vascularity, and as possessed of the
                    lowest degrees of organization and vitality; if, indeed, these latter properties
                    can at all be attributed to them.</p>

                <p>(185.) The structure which characterises the external integuments, is continued
                    in various places into the internal parts; and is found, with certain
                    modifications, in all those membranes which line the internal surfaces of
                    cavities or channels having an external opening. This is the case with the whole
                    track of the alimentary canal; including the mouth, pharynx, oesophagus,
                    stomach, and intestines. It is exemplified, also, in all the passages of the air
                    in respiration, as the nostrils, larynx, trachea or wind-pipe, bronchia or air
                    tubes, and the air vesicles of the lungs. All those passages which open
                    externally, such as those of the ears, urethra, and vagina, are likewise
                    defended by a lining of mucous membrane.</p>
                <p>(186.) Bichat has considered the mucuous membranes as forming a distinct system
                    of structure. Analogous in many respects to the serous membranes, they present,
                    in others, the most marked differences. They agree in their office of affording
                    protection to the organs to which they are attached; and their structure, in as
                    far as it is chiefly resolvable into condensed cellular tissue, is very similar.
                    But as they have to serve the additional office of defending the parts which
                    they invest against the irritating qualities of the substances that may come in
                    contact with them, and which may be either the external air or the food, or
                    extraneous bodies, received from without; or else secretions formed by the
                    internal organs, which are to be conducted to the surface, it was necessary that
                    the fluid which covered them should have properties adapted to this object.</p>
                <p>(187.) We find, accordingly, that instead of the watery liquid which exudes from
                    serous membranes, the mucous membranes prepare a secretion containing a large
                    proportion of mucus. Hence a more complicated structure is required in the
                    mucous than in the serous membranes. They are divisible into several layers;
                    that which connects them with the parts surrounding the passage or cavity which
                    they line, is of a denser structure; while the one which forms the inner surface
                    of the cavity is softer, and somewhat pulpy in its consistence. Its surface is
                    beset, in many parts, with numerous minute processes, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >villi,</hi> as they are termed.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498991" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8991-0608"/>
                <p>These have been supposed to bear some analogy to the papillae of the corion; and
                    the general correspondence of the structure of the mucous membrane and of the
                    external integuments has been farther pursued in the examination of the fine
                    pellicle which gives an universal covering to the pulpy portion, and which has
                    been assimilated to the cuticle. There can be no doubt that the cuticle
                    belonging to the skin is continued over the membranes which line many of the
                    passages above enumerated, and may be traced for a considerable way in those
                    passages. As we advance farther, this cuticular covering becomes gradually
                    thinner, till it ceases to be perceptible.</p>
                <p>(188.) But the circumstance which more especially characterises the mucous
                    membranes, is the presence of a number of small cavities, <hi rend="italic"
                    >crypts</hi> or <hi rend="italic">follicles</hi> as they are called; which have
                    more or less of a spheroidal shape, and which open upon the surface of the
                    membrane by a distinct orifice, or duct of communication. These minute sacs or
                    follicles are themselves lined with an extremely fine cuticular membrane,
                    derived from the general covering of the surface on which they are met with.
                    They are found filled with mucus, and are therefore considered as the sources
                    whence that secretion is principally derived.</p>
                <p>(189.) Follicles of a similar structure are found in the various parts of the
                    skin; but the substance which they produce, and which they effuse upon the
                    surface of the skin, is more of an oily, than of a mucous nature. It has been
                    termed <hi rend="italic">sebaceous matter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    small cavities which prepare this matter, are known by the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">sebaceous glands</hi> or <hi rend="italic">follicles.</hi></p>
                <p>(190.) Thus it appears, that although the offices of the external integuments of
                    the internal mucous membranes are sufficiently distinct, yet a general analogy
                    exists between them in many points of their structure, sufficient to justify
                    their being arranged under the same order, in a general classification of animal
                    structures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV— <hi rend="italic">Muscular Action.</hi></p>
                <p>(191.) Having now considered the system which constitutes the passive instruments
                    of the fabric, it is time that we direct our attention to the active powers
                    which are the sources of motion, and the springs of animation and of energy in
                    the living body.</p>
                <p>(192.) As in an extensive system of machinery, economy is best consulted by the
                    employment of a single moving power, such as a fall of water, the impulse of the
                    wind, the current of a river, or the force of steam, so, in the animal economy,
                    nature has provided the muscular power, and applied it in every instance where
                    great mechanical power was required to accomplish the intended object. But
                    before inquiring into the nature of this new animal power, it will be necessary
                    to consider the properties of those organs, the muscles, in which this power
                    appears to reside.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Structure of Muscles.</hi></p>
                <p>(193.) <hi rend="italic">Muscles</hi> are organs composed of certain fibres,
                    endowed with a peculiar power of contracting in their length, under certain
                    circumstances. These fibres are generally disposed in a parallel direction, and
                    variously united together by intervening cellular substance. The muscular system
                    forms a large proportion of the weight, and certainly the greater part of the
                    bulk of the human body.</p>
                <p>(194.) On examining the structure of a muscle, we find the minuter fibres are
                    every where surrounded by a fine cellular texture, which connect them together
                    into bundles, ' which have been called <hi rend="italic">fasciculi.</hi> These
                    bundles are connected to each other by coarse cellular membrane, so as to form
                    fasciculi of larger size: these, again, are united together into still larger
                    fasciculi by a still more loose cellular tissue. This system of package is
                    continued until .we arrive at large cylindrical bands of fibres, which have been
                    termed <hi rend="italic">lacerti,</hi> and which, being applied laterally to
                    each other, and covered by a general investment of membrane, compose the entire
                    muscle. The fasciculi, as well as the cellular membrane, are coarser in some
                    muscles than in others. Thus thej^are thicker in the large muscles of the limbs,
                    than in the delicate muscles appropriated to the eye, and other organs of sense.
                    The structure which has now been described is easily discovered in a portion of
                    muscle which has been cut transversely, and then boiled for some time, or
                    macerated in alcohol.</p>
                <p>(195.) Physiologists have not contented themselves with these general views of
                    the structure of muscles, but have been solicitous to ascertain the nature and
                    dispositions of the ultimate fibres to which muscles owe their characteristic
                    properties. The microscope has been resorted to for this purpose; but the
                    success of those observers who have trusted to this instrument in establishing
                    any certain facts, has by no means corresponded with the diligence and zeal with
                    which they have engaged in the inquiry. We find in this, as in many other
                    subjects where the appearances resulting from the employment of very high
                    magnifying powers are the objects of research, that the greatest discordance
                    prevails among the accounts given by different observers. Lcewenhoeck, who was
                    one of the first who applied the microscope to the investigation of the intimate
                    structure of organized bodies, but who was too often led away from the truth by
                    the ardour of his imagination, describes the ultimate muscular fibres, or those
                    which admit of no further mechanical division without a separation of their
                    substance, as being almost inconceivably minute. He states them to be many
                    thousand times smaller than a fibre which would only be just visible to the
                    naked eye. He represents them as cylindrical in their shape, and parallel to
                    each other, but pursuing a serpentine course. He remarks that they are of the
                    same figure in all animals, although differing considerably in their diameter in
                    different animals, and that without any relation to the size of the animal. He
                    observed, for example, that the fibril of the frog was larger than that of the
                    ox.</p>
                <p>(196.) Muys, a Dutch anatomist, who was engaged for a period of twenty-five years
                    in the most laborious researches on this subject, arrived at a very different
                    result from Leewenhoeck; for he concludes that the real ultimate fibrils of
                    muscles are in all cases, even when the comparison was extended to animals,
                    exactly of the same size.</p>
                <p>(197∙) Among the more modern anatomists, Prochaska<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>De Cαrne Musculari.</p></note> has bestowed
                    the greatest care in the examination of this subject; and his account has every
                    appearance of being entitled to our confidence. He states expressly that the
                    muscular fibrils are not all of the same diameter, but differ in different
                    animals, and even in different parts of the same animal. Each individual fibril,
                    however, when carefully separated from all extraneous matter, is of uniform
                    thickness throughout its whole extent, and perfectly continuous, even in the
                    longest muscles, from one end to the other. He confidently asserts that they are
                    solid; and instead of being cylindrical, that they have a prismatic, or
                    polyhedral shape, generally flattened, or thicker on one side than on the other;
                    a transverse section of the muscle thus presenting the appearance of basaltic
                    columns in miniature. Their diameter is stated to be about the fiftieth part of
                    that of the globules of the blood. Their surface was found to present a number
                    of depressions or wrinkles; a circumstance which gives them a serpentine
                    appearance. These transverse lines he attributes to the numerous blood-vessels,
                    nerves, and membranous bands which cross the fibrils at diffèrent points.</p>
                <p>(198.) According to Hooke and Swammerdam, the muscular<pb break="no"

                    series of globules. Other physiologists, such as Cowper and Stuart,<note

                    hypothesis, believed them to be composed of a series of rhomboidal vesicles. The
                    Abbe Fontana<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sur les
                    Poisons.</p></note> in general agrees with Prochaska in his representation of
                    muscular fibrils. He remarks that they are furnished with transverse bands at
                    regular intervals, and that they may always be distinguished by their parallel
                    disposition from the fibres of membrane, which are more or less contorted.</p>
                <p>Sir Anthony Carlisle<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Philosophical Transactions for 1805.</p></note> states that a muscular fibre
                    duly prepared, by washing away all adhering extraneous substances, and viewed by
                    a powerful microscope, appears to be asolid cylinder, the covering of which isa
                    reticulated membrane, and the contained part, a dry pulpy substance, irregularly
                    granulated, and of little cohesive power when dead.</p>
                <p>(199·) Mr. Bauer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid,
                    for 1818, p. 164∙</p></note> who is one of the latest authorities on this
                    subject, represents the ultimate muscular fibrils, as composed of a row of
                    globules, exactly corresponding in size to those of the blood when deprived of
                    their colouring matter; that is, about the five-thousandth part of an inch. Ry
                    l° <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> g maceration in water, he finds that the
                    mutual cohesion of these globules is loosened, and the fibre is consequently
                    broken down and resolved into a mass of globules. The general results of Mr.
                    Bauer’s observations were confirmed by various observers in France, such as Dr.
                    Edwards, and by Messrs Prevost and Dumas, Béclard and Dutrochet.</p>
                <p>(200.) On the other hand, the more recent, and apparently accurate researches of
                    Dr. Hodgkin and Mr. Lister,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Appendix to Dr Hodgkin’s translation of Dr. Edwards’ work, <hi

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Philosophical Transactions for 1837, p.
                    371.</p></note> have clearly shewn that the supposed globular structure of the
                    muscular fibre is a mere optical deception, arising from deficient defining
                    power in the microscope employed; and that the fibre is continuous throughout
                    its whole length, and sometimes marked by transverse striae, which occur at
                    intervals much smaller than the diameter of the fibre itself. They have also
                    pointed out this circumstance as constituting a remarkable distinction between
                    the muscles of voluntary and those of involuntary motion, with regard to this
                    striated structure; for it is only the fibres of the former which are
                    characterized by innumerable very minute, but clear and fine parallel lines, or
                    striae, which cross the fibre transversely. Mr. Skey concludes from his
                    researches, that these fibres in man have an average diameter of one
                    four-hundredth of an inch, and that they are surrounded by transverse circular
                    striae varying in thickness, and in the number contained in a given space. He
                    describes these striae as constituted by actual elevations on the surface of the
                    fibre, with intermediate depressions, considerably narrower than the diameter of
                    a globule of blood. Each of these muscular fibres, of which the diameter is one
                    four-hundredth of an inch, is divisible into bands or fibrillae, each of which
                    is again subdivisible into one hundred tubular filaments, arranged parallel to
                    one another in a longitudinal direction, around the axis of the tubular fibre
                    which they compose, and which contains in its centre a soluble gluten. The
                    partial separation of the fibrillae gives rise to the appearance of broken or
                    interrupted circular striae, which are occasionally seen. The diameter of each
                    filament is one sixteen-thousandth of an inch, or about a third part of that of
                    a globule of the blood. On the other hand, the muscles of involuntary motion,
                    (or as Bichat would term them, of <hi rend="italic">organic life)</hi> are
                    composed, not of fibres similar to those above described, but of filaments only;
                    these filaments being interwoven with each other in irregulari v disposed lines
                    pf various thickness, having for the most part a longitudinal direction, but
                    forming a kind of untraceabla net-work. They are readily distinguishable from
                    tendinous fibres, by the filaments of the latter being uniform in their size,
                    and pursuing individually one unvarying course, in lines parallel to one
                    another. The fibres of the heart appear to possess a somewhat compound character
                    of texture. The muscles of the pharynx exhibit the character of the muscles of
                    voluntary motion; whilst those of the oesophagus, the stomach, the intestines,
                    and the arterial system, possess that of the muscles of involuntary motion. The
                    determination of the exact nature of the muscular fibres of the iris, presented
                    considerable difficulties, which Mr. Skey was not able satisfactorily to
                    overcome.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Muscular Contractility.</hi></p>
                <p>(201.) The proper muscular fibre is so completely surrounded by cellular
                    membrane, and is of so small a diameter, that it is scarcely possible to
                    determine with accuracy its physical properties, independently of those of the
                    tissue in which it is imbedded. The contractile power with which it is endowed,
                    can be studied only as its effects are exhibited by collections of fibres, such
                    as those which constitute the muscles; although in these it must obviously be
                    combined with the elastic power of the cellular texture entering into its
                    composition.</p>
                <p>(202.) It will soon be evident, however, that the property by which the muscular
                    fibre is eminently characterized, is that of suddenly contracting in its length,
                    and thus of bringing the two ends of the muscle, and the parts to which those
                    ends are attached, nearer to each other. This contraction is produced with
                    astonishing quickness and force, overcoming considerable resistances, and
                    raising enormous weights. It is generally the effect of the will of the animal
                    to move the parts to which the muscle is attached; but it may also be excited by
                    other causes. The agent which thus produces muscular contraction is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">stimulus.</hi></p>
                <p>(203.) Under the appellation of stimuli, are included manythings whichseem
                    scarcely to have any property in common, except that of acting upon the muscular
                    fihres, either directly, or through the mcdiura of the nerves which supply them.
                    The contact of many bodies will produce this effect by mere mechanical impulse,
                    independently of any other quality they may possess. Whatever occasions a
                    mechanical injury to the texture of the muscle or nerve, or an actual breach of
                    substance, such as the puncture, division, or laceration of the fibres, will
                    immediately excite muscular contraction. This effect also results from the
                    application of any substance exerting a chemical action on the part; a class of
                    stimuli which comprehends a great variety of agents, such as acids, alkalies,
                    and most of the salts which they form by their mutual combinations, as also the
                    earthy and metallic salts, alcohol, the volatile oils; and above all, oxygen,
                    either in the form of gas, or when contained in substances that part with it
                    readily. Even water itself seems to have some corrugating power when it is
                    applied directly to the muscular fibre; its action, however, is much increased
                    by minute quantities of salt which it may hold in solution. Thus it is found
                    that hard water promotes the contraction of the muscles of fish that have been
                    crimped more than fresh water; and a similar difference of effect is often
                    observed in boiling meat in soft or in hard water.</p>
                <p>(204.) But besides these, there are several of the vegetable and animal products
                    which, when applied to the body, produce muscular contraction by an agency which
                    cannot <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499017" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9017-0610"/>clearly
                    be traced to any chemical property they possess. This class of stimuli includes
                    a variety of substances which are denominated <hi rend="italic">acrid,</hi> and
                    others which are called <hi rend="italic">narcotics,</hi> because when largely
                    applied they destroy altogether the power of contraction, and soon extinguish
                    life. As an example of this latter class, we may take opium and hydrocyanic
                    acid.</p>
                <p>(205.) Some particular muscles have a disposition to be acted on more especially
                    by particular kinds of stimuli. Each stimulus applied to the body generally,
                    appears to exert a particular influence upon certain parts of the system which
                    are predisposed to be affected by it, while on other parts it appears to be
                    wholly inert. Thus emetic substances act principally on the stomach, even when
                    applied to a different part of the system; and cathartic substances act
                    specifically on the intestines. The muscular fibres of the heart arc more
                    particularly excited to contraction by the influx of blood into the cavities of
                    that organ; and, in like manner, every system of muscular fibres concerned in
                    carrying on the vital functions, has a specific disposition to be affected by
                    its appropriate stimulus.</p>
                <p>(206.) All the muscles which move the joints of the limbs, and the several parts
                    of which the skeleton is composed, together with several muscles attached to the
                    softer parts, such as the eye, tongue, and throat, are excited to contract by
                    the stimulus of the will, and are therefore called <hi rend="italic">voluntary
                    muscles.</hi> They compose a class by themselves, as distinguished from those
                    muscles which are not under the control of volition, and which are therefore
                    involuntary muscles, such as the heart, stomach, intestines, and bloodvessels.
                    The nature of this distinction, and of the different laws under which each class
                    of muscles act, will be afterwards pointed out, when we come to treat of the
                    physiology of the nervous system.</p>
                <p>(207.) The natural state of a muscle, or that in which it exists when not acted
                    upon by any external cause, is relaxation. When contracted, its surface, from
                    being smooth, becomes furrowed, its middle portion swells out, and grows
                    exceedingly hard and firm, while the extremities are drawn nearer to each other,
                    so that the muscle is now both thicker and shorter than it was before.</p>
                <p>(208.) It has been frequently made a question whether the increase of thickness
                    exactly compensates for the diminution of length. This point might be determined
                    by ascertaining whether the specific gravity of a muscle undergoes any
                    alteration during this change. Glisson had inferred from some experiments which
                    he had made on this subject, that the bulk of a muscle is, on the whole,
                    diminished when it is in a state of contraction. Sir GilbertBlane,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. for 1805, p. 22,
                    23.</p></note> on the contrary, inferred from experiments which he made on
                    fishes confined in a glass vessel with a very slender neck, that the absolute
                    bulk, and of course the specific gravity, of their muscles remains the same
                    whether they are contracted or relaxed; for the level of the water in the narrow
                    stem of the vessel was observed to be unaffected by the muscular exertions made
                    by the fish. Mr. Mayo, by an experiment of this kind on the heart of a dog,
                    found the bulk of that organ unchanged during its contraction or
                    relaxation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Anatomical
                    and Physical Commentaries, p. 12.</p></note></p>
                <p>(209∙) The long-continued, or frequent application of a stimulus to a muscle,
                    tends to impair its power of contracting, or, in other words, to exhaust its
                    irritability. This liability to exhaustion is exemplified by all the muscles
                    that are under the controul of the will. We cannot continue to exert the same
                    muscle, or set of muscles, with the same degree of power beyond a certain time,
                    however strong may be the motive to continue that action, and whatever mental
                    effort we may make to persevere. If, for example, we extend the arm in a
                    horizontal line, with a weight held in the hand, we shall find, in the course of
                    a few minutes, that the source of fatigue becomes intolerably acute; and the '
                    arm at length drops from mere exhaustion, in spite of every voluntary
                    effort.</p>
                <p>(210.) The contraction of a muscle ceasing on the removal of the stimulus that
                    produced it, relaxation succeeds, and the muscle becomes again elongated; not,
                    however, in consequence of any inherent power of elongation, but from the
                    operation of causes which are extraneous to it. The elasticity of surrounding
                    parts is often sufficient to produce this effect; but in most cases the
                    elongation of the relaxed muscle is the consequence of the action of other
                    muscles, which produce motion in a contrary direction. Almost every musclehas
                    another corresponding muscle, or set of muscles, which are antagonists to it. If
                    the one, for instance, binds a joint, the antagonist musclc unbinds or extends
                    it; and by this action must elongate the former muscle.</p>
                <p>(211.) The swelling of the muscles of the limbs, when they are in strong action,
                    is matter of familiar observation. It is this circumstance, above all others,
                    which renders a knowledge of anatomy so essentially necessary to the painter and
                    the sculptor. In every attitude and in every movement of the body some
                    particular set of muscles are in action, and consequently swelled and prominent,
                    while others are relaxed and less conspicuous; and unless these differences were
                    accurately noted and faithfully expressed, it would be impossible to give a
                    correct representation of the living figure.</p>
                <p>(212.) Although the fibres which compose the smaller portions of a muscle are
                    arranged in parallel directions, yet the disposition of the mass of fibres,
                    relatively to the whole muscle, varies considerably according to the action
                    which the muscle is intended to perform. We find them, in some cases, radiating
                    from, or converging to a particular point; and sometimes we even find that the
                    different portions of a muscle having this structure can act independently of
                    the rest. The temporal muscle is an instance of a muscle of which the fibres
                    converge from the circumference to a central point, where they are inserted into
                    the coronoid process of the lower jaw. In other cases the fibres composing the
                    muscle pass in a circular direction so as to close upon some organ which they
                    surround, or to compress the bodies they enclose. Thus the eye and the mouth are
                    closed each by a circular or orbicular muscle. In other parts, muscles of this
                    description are called <hi rend="italic">sphincters.</hi> Some parts, as the
                    iris, are provided with both radiating and circular fibres, the one used for
                    dilating, and the other for contracting the central aperture. We meet with a
                    circular arrangement of muscular fibres in the coats of the various pipes and
                    canals of the body, such as the blood-vessels generally, and also the alimentary
                    passages; and together with these circular fibres are also often found bands of
                    longitudinal fibres, which shorten the tube, while the former tends to contract
                    its diameter, and press upon its contents. The several hollow receptacles for
                    fluids, such as the heart and the stomach, present us with a still greater
                    complication in the arrangement of their muscular fibres, in which we may
                    sometimes trace layers of fibres having a spiral course.</p>
                <p>(213.) But it very frequently happens that the action of a muscle is wanted when
                    its presence would be exceedingly inconvenient. The common medium of connexion
                    employed by mechanicians, when the object to be moved is at too great a distance
                    to admit of the direct application of the power, is that of a rope or strap. In
                    the animal machine the same purpose is effected by means of tendons, which are
                    long strings attached at one end to the muscle, and at the other to the bone, or
                    part to be moved. If the muscles by which the fingers are bent and extended, for
                    instance, had been placed in the palm or back of the hand, they would have
                    en-larged<pb break="no" facs="nls:193499030" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9030-0611"/> that
                    part to an awkward and clumsy thickness, which would not only have destroyed the
                    beauty and proportion of the organ, but have impeded many of its uses as an
                    instrument. They are therefore disposed at the arm, even as high up as the
                    elbow, and their tendons pass along the joints of the wrist, to be affixed to
                    the joints of the fingers they are intended to move.</p>
                <p>(214.) The employment of tendons also reduces the space which would have been
                    necessary for the direct insertion of the muscular fibres in a bone, so that the
                    same bone may be acted upon in a great variety of ways, by means of the tendons
                    attached to it proceeding from a great number of muscles.</p>
                <p>(215.) Another advantage resulting from the employment of tendons is, that by
                    their intervention a great number of fibres are made to act in concert, and
                    their united power is concentrated upon one particular point. In this respect,
                    also, they resemble a rope, at which a great number of men are pulling at the
                    same moment, by which means their combined strength is brought into action.
                    These tendons are variously disposed with respect to the muscular fibres to
                    which they are attached. It is but in a few muscles that the fibres are arranged
                    in a perfectly longitudinal direction. We often find them covered on both sides
                    with a tendinous investment, the muscular fibres proceeding obliquely from the
                    one to the other. This arrangement forms what is called a penniform muscle,
                    which may be either single or double. The structure is frequently even more
                    complex than this, a number of tendinous layers being interposed among the
                    fleshy fibres. By means of tendons a different direction may also be given to
                    the moving power, without altering its position. There are many instances of
                    this employment of tendons, in which they are made to pass through a loop, which
                    serves as a pulley, an expedient which is adopted in one of the oblique muscles
                    of the eye.</p>
                <p>(216.) We have already seen, that wherever friction takes place by the motion of
                    tendons over bones, or other hard parts, a bursa mucosa is interposed, which
                    obviates in a great measure the injurious effects that would otherwise result
                    from the rubbing of the parts.</p>
                <p>(217.) But although it be true that the force with which muscles contract is very
                    great, yet the extent to which they are capable of exerting that force is in
                    general very limited, and would be insufficient for most of the purposes their
                    contraction is intended to serve, unless it were very considerably enlarged by
                    mechanical expedients. In the practice of mechanics we find a variety of
                    contrivances had recourse to for attaining this object; namely, the production
                    of a great extent of motion, by a power acting through very limited space. But
                    most of these devices would not answer in the human body, from the inconvenience
                    which would attend their application. We find that nature has solved this
                    problem in the simplest possible manner. In the first place, the tendons are
                    inserted into the bones they are designed to move, very near to the centres of
                    motion, so that a small extent of contraction in the muscle will produce a great
                    range of motion at the other extremity of the limb. The principle is here
                    obviously that of what mechanicians have termed a lever of the third class,
                    namely, that in which the power is applied at some point intermediate between
                    the fulcrum and the weight to be raised, or resistance to be overcome. Secondly,
                    the direction of the power so applied, with reference to the line connecting the
                    point of application and the centre of motion, or what is termed the radius of
                    rotation, is oblique; that is, it forms with it an acute angle. Here again we
                    may perceive another cause of the increase of motion, obtained by a smaller
                    extent of contraction above that which would have resulted if the power had been
                    applied at right angles to the radius of rotation, which is obviously the
                    mostadvantageousmodeof employingthat power, when the object is to economise it,
                    by giving it the greatest mechanical advantage. It must happen, indeed, by such
                    a disposition of the force, that a large portion of it is lost, being spent on a
                    fixed obstacle, namely, on the bone of the joint, against which the pressure is
                    exerted; but the quickness and velocity of the motion that results are
                    undoubtedly increased. Thirdly, the muscular fibres are themselves obliquely
                    disposed with respect to the tendons, so that the same cause operates in a
                    similar manner here also. Lastly, pairs of muscles are placed so as to form an
                    obtuse angle with one another, and are made to contract at the same time. Their
                    actions, therefore, will partly concur, and partly oppose one another. They will
                    conspire to produce a movement in the parts to which their extremities are
                    attached, in a direction intermediate to that of the muscles themselves; for it
                    is a fundamental law of dynamics, that when a body is urged by two forces
                    inclined to each other at any angle, it will move as if it were urged by a force
                    in the direction c&lt;f the diagonal of a parallelogram, having for its sides
                    lines corresponding’in their direction and their lengths to the directions and
                    relative intensities of the two component forces.</p>
                <p>(218.) In all these cases it is evident that there must be a great loss of force;
                    but when the muscular power is concerned, we almost always find that strength is
                    sacrificed to convenience, and that construction adopted which unites in the
                    whole the most advantages. We must allow, that the muscular power is turned to
                    the best account when it is made to perform in the completest and quickest
                    manner the intended motion. We find, in following the mechanism not only of the
                    joints of the limbs, but of the whole system of organs, both internal and
                    external, that the mode in which this force is applied is diversified in every
                    possible way. Its combinations are varied, and its action modified beyond
                    calculation, though the original power be still essentially the same, and

                <p>(219.) The source of that enormous mechanical power which seems to be an inherent
                    property of the muscular power, has long been sought for by physiologists; but
                    it has always continued to elude their most patient and laborious researches. It
                    was at one period a favourite subject of speculation to devise hypotheses as to
                    mechanical arrangements of particles capable of producing results similar to
                    those of muscular contraction. Borelli<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>De Motu Animalium.</p></note> conceived that each muscular
                    fibre might be composed of a series of minute bladders, or vesicles, of a
                    rhomboidal figure. Stuart supposed that these vesicles were round. But on either
                    hypothesis they were conceived to be empty, while the muscle remained in its
                    natural state of relaxation. On the sudden introduction of a fluid of some kind
                    into these vesicles, their sides would be separated, they would become
                    distended, and assuming a more spherical form, would consequently be shortened
                    in their longitudinal diameter; and as this shortening would take place
                    simultaneously in all the vesicles, the whole muscle would be contracted in its
                    length, and at the same time proportionally dilated in its breadth. The
                    contrivance had certainly the merit of ingenuity, inasmuch as it explained the
                    swelling of the muscle as well as its shortening, in the act of contraction. But
                    it evidently will not bear the test of serious examination. No such structure as
                    is implied in the hypothesis has ever been rendered visible to the eye, however
                    dexterously the microscope may have been applied to the muscular fibre; nor can
                    we find any power sufficient to propel so large a quantity of fluid as would be
                    required for the distension of the vesicles; an effect also which, in order that
                    the theory may correspond with the phenomena, must be produced almost
                    instantaneously The resistance that would be opposed to the entry of a fluid so
                    propelled would be incalculable, and incomparably greater <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499043" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9043-0612"/>than that exerted by the
                    muscle itself, which latter force, it may be observed, it is the professed
                    object of this theory to explain. The hypothesis itself,, therefore, on which
                    the theory is built, involves a greater difficulty than the simple fact. Such,
                    indeed, was a very common mistake in the speculations of the earlier
                    philosophers, <hi rend="subscript"> λ</hi> who were ever prone to theorize
                    without having any legitimate basis for the formation of a theory; their
                    foundations being often more in need of support than the superstructure they
                    attempted to raise upon it. It reminds us of the Indian fable of the world being
                    carried on the back of an elephant, whilst the elephant was supposed to require
                    a tortoise for its own support.</p>
                <p>(220.) The hypothesis that the fibres of muscles have a spiral shape, and pass in
                    a contorted line from one end of the muscle to the other, like the turns of a
                    corkscrew, a form which readily admits of elongation or contraction, according
                    as it is more or less contorted, is quite as unsatisfactory as the former; and
                    equally open to the fundamental objection, that it leaves the original source of
                    motion still unexplained. Muscular power, indeed, does not appear, from what we
                    hitherto know of its laws, to bear any close analogy to any of the other great
                    principles in nature, which we recognize as original sources of mechanic force;
                    and until such analogy can be traced, all our endeavours to explain the
                    phenomena of muscular contraction must be fruitless.</p>
                <p>(221.) It was a favourite notion with the physiologists of the seventeenth
                    century, that an effervescence was excited in the interior of the muscle, by
                    some chemical operation; such as a mixture of acid and alkali. Willis and others
                    ascribed muscular contraction to a fermentation occasioned by the union of the
                    particles of the muscle, with a supposed nervous fluid, or ethereal spirit
                    contained in the blood.</p>
                <p>(222.) But in fact, the only power in*nature to which irritability can be
                    compared in the quickness and suddenness of its variations, as well as in its
                    dependence on peculiar qualities of matter, is electricity, and more
                    particularly that form of electricity which constitutes galvanism. Attempts have
                    accordingly been often made, since the phenomena of galvanism have engaged so
                    much attention in the philosophic world, to explain muscular contraction by
                    means of this principle; and endless have been the fanciful hypotheses invented
                    for this purpose. Each muscular fibre was at one time considered as performing
                    the office of a separate Leyden jar, charged with opposite electricities on its
                    exterior and interior; whilst the filament of nerve which penetrated into its
                    substance was the conducting wire, that occasioned the discharge of the jar.
                    After the discovery of the voltaic pile, it was immediately conceived that an
                    arrangement corresponding to the plates of the pile, existed among the particles
                    of nerve and muscle, thus composing a galvanic apparatus, ready to discharge
                    itself when the proper communications were effected. 'The latest hypothesis of
                    this kind, is that of Prevost and Dumas, who conceived that the muscular fibre
                    was thrown, during its contraction, into serpentine flexures, in consequence of
                    the attractions of electrical currents, passing in similar directions through
                    minute filaments of nerves, the directions of which were at right angles to the
                    axis of the fibres. But in the present state of the science, all these analogies
                    are far too vague and remote to serve as the foundation of any solid theory.</p>
                <p>(223.) It has been the fashion among some physiologists to consider muscular
                    contraction as only a particular mode of attraction, and as included in the
                    general law of attraction which subsists among all the particles of matter; but
                    this is a generalization totally unwarranted by the phenomena. Others have
                    maintained that contractility is to be ascribed to the attraction of life, and
                    to be merely a modification of vitality. Thus, Girtanner imagined that this
                    property resided even in the living fluids, and was co-extensive with organized
                    nature. This, however, is equivalent to the assertion, that the phenomena
                    requires no explanation at all; for it certainly leaves the question just where
                    it was before. We already knew that the effect of muscular power indicated a
                    peculiarity to the nature of that power, for they appeared different from any
                    other. To say that it is a peculiar modification of the power of life, gives us
                    therefore no new information, unless it be meant that it is similar in its
                    nature to the other powers which the living organs exhibit; but it would, in
                    that case, convey an erroneous idea, because, the phenomena themselves being
                    different, cannot, according to the rides of legitimate induction, be ascribed
                    to the same physical cause. We have already pointed out the fallacy of this mode
                    of reasoning, in which final causes are confounded with physical causes, and
                    substituted for them as philosophical explanations of phenomena.</p>
                <p>(224.) There is, unquestionably, a greater degree of cohesion in the particles
                    which compose the fibres of muscles in their living, than in their dead state.
                    This cohesive power, in consequence of the connexions of the muscle in the body,
                    is equivalent to a constant tendency to contraction. Hence, the fibres of
                    muscles are in a constant state of tension, like an elastic substance kept upon
                    the stretch. This property, evidently derived from contractility, has been
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">tonicity,</hi> a term which has also, as we have
                    seen, been applied to the peculiar state of tension of cellular and membranous
                    structures, derived from a particular condition of their elasticity. (See §
                    175.) It produces the state of <hi rend="italic">tone</hi> in a muscle; or that
                    in which it is disposed to contract to a greater degree, than its connexions
                    with the neighbouring parts will allow. This explains why, on cutting a muscle
                    across, the cut edges retract to a considerable extent, leaving a wide gap at
                    the place of section: when, by a sudden effort, the tendo achilles is ruptured,
                    the muscles in the calf of the leg to which that tendon had been attached, being
                    released from this stretching force, retract to a great extent, and form a large
                    and hard swelling high up in the leg.</p>
                <p>(225.) On minutely examining the phenomena of muscular contraction, it will be
                    found, even in those instances in which the contractile power appears to be
                    exerted with undiminished vigour for a certain time, that each individual fibre
                    undergoes, during the interval, a succession of changes of condition,
                    contracting and relaxing alternately. It is only a certain number of the fibres
                    that are in action at the same moment; their power is soon exhausted; and until
                    recruited by repose, other sets of fibres are thrown into contraction, so as to
                    supply their place. They thus relieve one another in succession, until by
                    frequent action the exhaustion becomes more general, and the restoration less
                    complete. In this state, the whole muscle is fatigued, its contractions become
                    irregular and unsteady in proportion as they are more feeble, and the whole
                    action is tremulous, and incompetent to the production of the desired effect.
                    These tremulous movements are very obvious when the muscles are weakened from
                    any cause, as well as when exhausted by excessive action. Dr. Wollaston<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Philosophical Transactions
                    for 1810, p∙ 2.</p></note> with his usual acuteness, detected, by a very simple
                    experiment, the minute oscillations consequent upon these continual and rapid
                    alternations of contraction and relaxation in the fibre. When the finger is
                    inserted in the ear with a moderate degree of force, and the pressure is
                    continued with as much steadiness as possible, a peculiar vibratory sound is
                    heard, similar to that of a carriage rolling on the pavement. This must
                    evidently proceed from a corresponding vibratory action of the muscular fibres.
                    It appears, therefore, as Dr. Wollaston remarks, that the voluntary effect in
                    this case, although it may seem to us to be perfectly continuous, consists in
                    reality, of a great number of vibrations repeated at extremely short
                    intervals.</p>

                <p>(226.) There is a peculiar kind of contractility possessed by rnembranous
                    structures, which has often bcen supposed to bear an analogy to muscular
                    contractility, or even to be some modification of this property. It is called
                    into action by the application of a certain degree of heat, and also by some
                    powerful chemical agent, such as the concentrated mineral acids; and the effect
                    produced is a sudden corrugation, or curling up of the membranous part. This
                    phenomenon was noticed by Haller, and was termed by Bichat <hi rend="italic"
                    >racorrussement.</hi> Alcohol, and many of the neutral salts produce, but more
                    slowly, effects which are similar in kind, though much inferior in degree; but
                    in this case the corrugation continues to increase, if the agent continues
                    applied, which does not happen when the more powerful agents, as the acids, or
                    boiling water are employed; for the continued operation of these latter agents
                    is to dissolve and disorganize the animal substance. Bichat took considerable
                    pains to investigate these phenomena, and has pointed out<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Anatomie Générale.</p></note> several
                    circumstances by which this property may be distinguished from mere membranous
                    elasticity. From muscular contractility, indeed, it differs much more
                    considerably, and depends, therefore, in all probability, on principles totally
                    different from that remarkable animal property.</p>

                <p>(229∙) The bones of the skull are contrived with singular artifice and skill to
                    afford protection to the brain, an organ, as we have seen, of peculiarly soft
                    and delicate texture, and of which the functions are so refined as to require
                    for their accomplishment the most perfect freedom from external pressure, and
                    even from any harsh vibration or concussion of its parts. It is evidently with
                    this view that the bony covering of the brain, or skull-cap, as it has been
                    called, is constructed in the form of a vault or dome, as being the best
                    calculated to resist external pressure, on the well-known mechanical principle
                    of the arch. But pressure applied vertically to an arch necessarily gives rise
                    to an outward horizontal thrust at the two ends of the arch. In architecture,
                    various expedients are resorted to for opposing this force. In a bridge it is
                    resisted by the solid abutments where the arch takes its rise on each side. In
                    the higher arches of ornamental architecture it is counteracted by the weight of
                    a buttress placed over the origin of the arch, and in harmony with the design of
                    the whole. For the support of the roof of a building, which has to rest upon
                    perpendicular walls, either these walls must be built of a strength equal to
                    withstand this horizontal pressure, or, what is generally resorted to, a
                    tie-beam must be attached to the base of the roof, which tie-beam will resist by
                    its cohesive strength the force which tends to stretch it, derived from the
                    outward pressure of the roof.</p>
                <p>(230.) In the architecture of the skull we find the exemplification of these
                    methods, and their strict conformity with the refined principles of mechanics.
                    The two parietal bones on the sides, the frontal bone before, and the occipital
                    bone behind, may be considered as the four great stones which compose the convex
                    part of the dome. If we first consider the parietal bones, viewing them as
                    constituting a single arch, we find that their lower edges are bevelled off at
                    an acute angle, so as to be overlapped on each side by the upper edge of the
                    temporal bone, which continues the curvature as far as the basis of the skull.
                    Thus the two parietal bones are effectually wedged in between the two temporal
                    bones, and any pressure applied on the top of the head, which would of course
                    tend to thrust their lower sides outwards, is resisted by the temporal bones.
                    But these temporal bones are themselves locked into the irregularly-shaped
                    sphenoidal bone, which, as we have seen, forms the central piece of the basis of
                    the skull, being in actual contact with every one of the bones which compose it,
                    as well as the face, in which the organs of all the senses, except that of
                    touch, is contained. The os sphénoides thus performs the office of a great
                    tie-beam to the lower part of the arched roof of the skull; and the same
                    principles will be found to hold good when the section of the skull is taken in
                    the longitudinal direction; the os frontis before, and the os occipitis behind,
                    which sustain their share of any pressure made on the upper parts of the head,
                    being so locked in, by the bending inwards of their lower processes, with the
                    sphenoid bone, as effectually to prevent their starting outwardly.</p>
                <p>(231.) Another circumstance in the architecture of the skull is particularly
                    deserving of notice, as it exhibits the most marked instance of provident
                    design. It relates to the structure of the bones themselves, which is that best
                    calculated to resist fracture on the one hand, and on the other to prevent the
                    transmission of vibrating concussions to the brain. It is manifestly with this
                    view that it is composed of two plates of bone, the external one fibrous, tough,
                    and not easily broken; the inner one more dense and rigid, offering the most
                    poweful resistance to simple direct pressure; yet, on that very account, more
                    fragile in its nature, and partaking therefore in the quality of brittleness,
                    which belongs to all the harder bodies, such as glass or flint. It was on
                    account of its possessing this property that it was named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tabula</hi><hi rend="italic">vitrea</hi> by anatomists. But while it is evident
                    that such an accident would have been of frequent occurence if that part of the
                    bone had been directly exposed to every casual blow, this evil has been
                    carefully guarded against by the interposition of a spongy intertexture of bony
                    fibres, the <hi rend="italic">cancellated structure,</hi> as it is termed, which
                    forms a thick layer between the two laminae of bone, or as they have been
                    called, the outer and the inner <hi rend="italic">tables</hi> of the skull. This
                    intervening layer operates as a cushion, arresting the progress of the
                    vibrations from the external to the internal plate of bone, and preventing
                    fracture.</p>
                <p>(232.) Even when the impetus is so great as to penetrate through this resisting
                    medium, still the force with which it impinges on the subjacent parts must be
                    very considerably moderated, and the danger of injury to the brain diminished.
                    It is with a similar design of giving protection that a soldier’s helmet is
                    lined with leather or covered with hair; a provision which we even find in the
                    head-piece of the Roman soldiers, in whose equipment utility alone was
                    consulted, and nothing was admitted that served the purpose of mere ornament.
                    Wherever the bones of the skull <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499069"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9069-0614"/>are more particularly exposed to blows, we find a
                    greater thickness of bone provided for the sake of additional power of
                    resistance.</p>
                <p>(233.) The <hi rend="italic">sutures,</hi> or joinings of these bones, are also
                    admirably contrived to stop the transmission of vibrations arising from
                    percussion from extending to any distance round the skull. These sutures,
                    externally, where the tough and fibrous plates of bone are united, present a
                    serrated line; the fibres at the edges of each being mutually inserted between
                    those of the contiguous bone. But this dove-tailed joining is not met with in
                    the inner table; there the edges of the bone are smooth and placed in simple
                    contact. This is evidently done in order to prevent the chipping off of the
                    minute parts of a brittle structure, had they been interlaced together as the
                    fibres of the outer table are. But still the interruptions afforded by the
                    suture tends in a great degree to check the progress of fracture.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Face.</hi></p>
                <p>(234 ) The organs of the principe <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> senses, the eye,
                    the ear, the nostrils, and the mouth, are protected by the bones of the face,
                    which likewise form part of the skull. The eyes are exceedingly well defended by
                    the superciliary ridge of the frontal bone above, and also by the orbital plate
                    which supports the anterior lobes of the brain; anteriorly they are protected by
                    the projection of the nasal bones, and outwardly by the arched process which
                    divides them from the temples: while the prominent cheek bones below guard them
                    from injury in that quarter. No part of the body has so effectual a protection
                    from bone as the internal organ of hearing: nor is there any part of the osseous
                    system so hard as the portion of the temporal bone in which this organ is
                    lodged. The nasal cavities, in like manner, which are occupied by the membranes
                    receiving impressions from odorous effluvia, are formed in deep recesses of
                    bone. The organ of taste is also protected by the jaws, though less completely,
                    because the same parts are required to enjoy extensive power of motion.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Thorax.</hi></p>
                <p>(235.) The heart and lungs, which are lodged in the cavity of the thorax, are
                    defended before and behind by the spine and sternum; and laterally by the ribs,
                    which form bony arches, the shape best calculated for resisting pressure applied
                    externally. They are formed of separate pieces, with intervals between, in order
                    to admit of motion: for the cavity of the chest requires to be alternately
                    enlarged and contracted in the performance of respiration, which is a function
                    of primary importance in the animal economy.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Spine.</hi></p>
                <p>(236.) The support of the trunk and upper parts of the body, including the head,
                    is entrusted to a column of bones, the assemblage of which constitutes the
                    spine. The spine is that part of the skeleton of all animals composing the four
                    superior classes, namely, the mammalia, birds, fishes, and reptiles, which is
                    most constantly found, and which exhibits the greatest uniformity of structure.
                    The individual bones which compose the spine are so intimately united and so
                    firmly secured by ligaments on every side, that they appear in the living body
                    as one continued bone, and the whole assemblage is known, in ordinary language,
                    by the name of the <hi rend="italic">back-bane.</hi> The purposes answered by
                    this complex fabric are numerous and important. It is the great central beam of
                    the fabric, and furnishes the basis of support to all other bones of the
                    skeleton. It serves, in particular, to unite the bones of the limbs with the
                    trunk, so that they form with the latter one connected frame-work. It is the
                    axis of their principal motions, the common fulcrum round which they all
                    revolve. It has an intimate mechanical relation with all the parts of the body.
                    It affords attachment to the great muscles which move the trunk and the
                    principal joints of the extremities. It contains and gives protection to that
                    important organ, the spinal cord, from which, as we have seen, almost all the
                    nerves of the body take their origin, and which is unquestionably, next to the
                    brain, the most essential organ in the economy. Whilst the spinal column
                    performs these offices, it is at the same time capable of considerable flexion,
                    both laterally and longitudinally; and admits also of some degree of twisting
                    motion, in a plane perpendicular to its axis.</p>
                <p>(237.) No where has art been more conspicuously displayed than in the
                    construction of an apparatus adapted to fulfil such opposite and apparently
                    imcompatible functions. To secure the firmness and strength which are required
                    in the basis of support to the whole body, in the key-stone, as it were, of its
                    various arches, whilst it is at the same time rendered capable of so great a
                    variety of motions, objects which seem utterly at variance with its also
                    affording protection to a tender and delicate organ, in which the least pressure
                    would be attended with fatal consequences, must be allowed to be a most
                    difficult problem of mechanism. And yet these various, complicated, and
                    apparently inconsistent offices, we find executed by one and the same
                    instrument. Flexibility is obtained by subdividing it into a great number of
                    small portions, each of which is separately allowed but a small degree of
                    bending upon the next; and thus a considerable motion is obtained in the whole
                    column, with but a very inconsiderable one at each joint. Each bone, as was
                    described in the account of its anatomy, is connected with its neighbour by a
                    broad basis of attachment; and the slight relative motions of which they are
                    susceptible are chiefly entrusted to the lateral articulations. Whilst these
                    broad bones give the whole chain its requisite firmness and stability, they are
                    so constructed as to afford a passage, without any diminution of their strength,
                    to the substance of the spinal marrow. For this purpose each of the bodies is
                    hollowed out so as to form a continued groove all down the back; and over this
                    groove a broad arch is thrown from each side, converting it into a complete
                    canal. In order to preserve the continuity of this canal, and prevent the
                    ver-tebrae from shifting upon one another so as to press upon the spinal cord
                    within, during the various movements of the body, further securities are
                    provided. They are severally connected together by their projecting processes,
                    which lock into one another, and are still more firmly secured by the ligaments
                    that bind them down on every side. Thus, the bodies of the vertebrae are guarded
                    against the danger of accidental slipping, but they are defended also from
                    displacement by any force short of what would break the bone.</p>
                <p>(238.) But besides all these provisions the vertebral column is protected from
                    injury arising from violent jolts or jars, by having interposed between each
                    adjoining vertebrae, the peculiar springy substance known by the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">intervertebral cartilage or ligament</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    for it in reality partakes of the nature of both these textures. It is a
                    substance quite peculiar to this part of the frame. Its compressibility and the
                    elastic force with which it recovers its shape when relieved from the
                    compressing power, must greatly lessen the quantity of motion required of each
                    bone during the flexion of the column, as well as soften all the concussions
                    incident to violent motion. No chasm is left by their separation when the spine
                    is bent; and the unity of the whole column, and of the channel in its centre, is
                    preserved unbroken. A passage is at the same time allowed between each
                    contiguous vertebrae for the nerves which issue in pairs from the spinal cord,
                    to distribute their branches and filaments to every part of the body.</p>
                <p>(239.) The natural curvatures in the line of the vertebral column also contribute
                    materially to the elasticity of the whole framework. On receiving any shock in
                    the direction of its length, the impulse, instead of being propagated <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193499082" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9082-0615"/> the whole length
                    of its line, is diverted from its course and taken off by the flexures of the
                    column; and the maintenance of its natural position is effected more by the
                    power of the muscles attached to the spine, than by its inherent elasticity.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The Pelvis.</hi></p>
                <p>(240.) The broad expansion of bone which extends on each side of the pelvis, and
                    the extremities of which form the hips, are evidently designed as a basis of
                    support for the viscera of the abdomen. The lower portion of the bones of the
                    pelvis is at the same time rendered light by being formed into several arches;
                    strengthened at the points where it is exposed to the greatest pressure, and at
                    the same time affording room for the articulations of the thigh bones.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">The Limbs in General.</hi></p>
                <p>(241.) The third office of the skeleton is to furnish levers for accomplishing
                    the progression and other movements of the body, which require great force,
                    great extent, and great precision of motion. These objects are attained by the
                    limbs, which, as is well known, arc divided into separate portions, obviously
                    for the purpose of increasing the facility of adaptation to a great variety of
                    movements and of actions which the individual may be called upon to perform.</p>
                <p>(242.) The principal bones of the extremities have the shape of lengthened
                    cylinders, and compose a system of levers adapted to the regular and accurate
                    application of the moving force, and for the execution of rapid, extensive, and
                    powerful movements. The circumstance of their hollow and cancellated structure
                    is a palpable instance of provident adaptation to the office for which they are
                    framed. It may be mathematically demonstrated, that if the quantity of materials
                    assigned for the construction of the bone be given, there is no mode in which
                    those materials could have been more advantageously disposed for resisting a
                    transverse force, that is, a force tending to break it across, than the form of
                    a tube, or hollow cylinder, which is that actually given to them by nature. If,
                    for instance, the same quantity of matter had been collected into a solid
                    cylinder of the same length, it would have been subject to fracture by a much
                    smaller force than that which it bears without injury in its actual tubular
                    form. This remark was long ago made by the elder Dr. Monro,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Anatomy of the Bonce and Muscles, p. 2!
                    ∙</p></note> who observes that the resistance opposed by a body of cylindrical
                    shape to a force applied transversely is in the direct ratio of its diameter;
                    hence the same number of fibres disposed round the circumference of a circle in
                    such a way as that their sections would present the appearance of a ring, will
                    resist with greater force than if they had been united at the centre, so that
                    their section would present a circle of much smaller diameter than the ring. The
                    hollow cylindrical bones are accordingly found in those situations where the
                    power of resisting external force is principally wanted, while it is at the same
                    time an object of importance not to add unnecessarily to the weight. A simple
                    experiment will illustrate in a very striking manner this proposition. Let a
                    cylindrical glass rod and a glass tube be taken of the same length and also of
                    the same weight, so that they may both contain the same quantity of materials.
                    If each be then supported at their two ends, on a frame adapted to the purpose,
                    it will be found that the same weight which, when hung from the rod, will break
                    it asunder, will, when transferred to the tube, be sustained without even
                    bending it in any sensible degree-Dr. Porterfield has given an elaborate
                    mathematical demonstration of the general proposition.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh Medical Essays, vol. i. p.
                    95.</p></note></p>
                <p>(243.) There are few subjects in physiology which present so many interesting
                    points of inquiry, or afford more abundant proofs of intelligence and design
                    than the mechanical properties of the osseous fabric. From the account we
                    formerly gave of the composition of bone, it appears that it is constructed of
                    two prjncipal materials, an earthy basis, which is the phosphate of lime, and an
                    animal or membranous substance, which possesses considerable tenacity. To the
                    first of these ingredients the bones owe their solidity and hardness. No
                    inorganic matter, not even the metals, has so great a cohesive power, with a
                    given weight of materials, as the earthy bodies; and this is probably the reason
                    why the phosphate of lime has been selected as the substance employed to give
                    the necessary solidity and hardness to bones. But these qualities, if carried to
                    excess, would be accompanied with brittleness. To guard against this evil, the
                    cohesion of the inorganic earth is tempered by the interposition of an elastic
                    organic material; this is the cellular tissue, within the cells of which the
                    bony matter is deposited, and which acts the part of a cement, binding them more
                    strongly together, and at the same time obviating the excessive brittleness
                    which a substance of more uniform hardness would have possessed. Thus, by the
                    admirable blending of these two elements, two qualities which, in masses of
                    homogenous and unorganized matter are scarcely compatible with one another, are
                    happily united.</p>
                <p>(244.) The manner in which the cylindrical bones are connected together is also
                    highly deserving of attention. There are, indeed, few parts of the mechanism of
                    animals more peculiarly fitted to excite our admiration than the structure of
                    the joints. Every provision seems to have been made for facilitating their
                    motion, and every precaution taken to enable them to act with safety. Their ends
                    are enlarged for the purpose of affording a broader surface of junction, and for
                    procuring greater firmness and security of connexion. The rough and hard
                    substance of bones would have been particularly exposed to injury if they had
                    been allowed to grate upon one another without some intervening smooth surface.
                    In all the joints, at the places where the ends of the bone would have suffered
                    from this cause, we find them tipped with a white, smooth, and elastic
                    cartilage. Dr. Paley<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Natural Theology.</p></note> has very aptly compared this expedient to the
                    plating of a metallic instrument with a different metal. Detached portions of
                    cartilage, are, as we have seen, frequently placed between the bones, which
                    thus, instead of working upon each other, work upon the intermediate cartilages.
                    This is analogous to the contrivance practised by mechanics, who interpose a
                    loose ring where the friction pf the joints of any of their machines is great,
                    and who particularly resort to it where some strong and heavy work is to be
                    done. It is precisely under similar circumstances that the same contrivance is
                    employed in the human body; and the analogy is a striking evidence of that art
                    and foresight which are manifested in the plan of its conformation. The
                    lubricating quality of the synovia is also an exquisite provision designed to
                    diminish friction.</p>
                <p>(245.) The ligaments which bind the ends of the bones together, and restrain the
                    direction of their motions, are admirably calculated to perform the offices
                    assigned to them. Like the bones, they unite qualities which are rarely met with
                    in conjunction. They have all the properties we can desire in a rope; namely,
                    perfect flexibility, with great power of resisting extension. It is hardly
                    imaginable how great a force is required to stretch, or rather to break asunder
                    a ligament, for it will not yield in any sensible degree until the force is
                    increased so as at once to tear it to pieces. Yet with all this toughness, it is
                    so flexible as to oppose no impediment to the suppleness of the joint. “Every
                    joint,” says Dr. Paley, “is strictly a mechanical instrument, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499095" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9095-0616"/>as manifestly contrived, and
                    as accurately defined as any that can be produced out of a cabinet maker’s shop.
                    Their durability is no less astonishing. A limb shall swing upon its hinge, or
                    play in its socket, many hundred times in an hour, for sixty years together,
                    without diminution of its agility.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">The Lower Extremities.</hi></p>
                <p>(246.) The three portions into which the lower extremities are divided, namely
                    the <hi rend="italic">thigh, leg,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">foot,</hi> being
                    united by joints, and moveable upon one another, are calculated to serve the
                    double purpose of firm columns of support to the body while standing, and of
                    facilitating and regulating its movements while advancing. It might, on a
                    superficial view of the subject, be supposed that, in standing in the erect
                    posture, the weight of the body would be more firmly and effectually supported
                    had the whole limb consisted of a single straight column. But independently of
                    the greater strain to which such a structure would be exposed, in consequence of
                    the great length of bone required, it would, in fact, have had less stability
                    than it now possesses. A marble sta .ue of a man resting merely on the feet in a
                    natural attitude, would be overthrown by a small impulse; and even in the living
                    body, it is an infallible consequence of the laws of mechanics, that if ever the
                    perpendicular line drawn from the centre of gravity happen to pass beyond the
                    base of support, the body must inevitably fall in spite of every muscular
                    exertion that can be made. The only way to prevent such an accident is to bring
                    back the centre of gravity nearer to a point above the centre of the base before
                    it has actually passed it; and this we instinctively do when we feel ourselves
                    in danger of falling to one side, by extending the arm horizontally on the
                    opposite side.</p>
                <p>(247.) But the limb being divided into joints, these joints would give way under
                    the weight of the body, were they not prevented from bending by the constant
                    action of the muscles. The continual muscular effort required in standing is
                    nearly as great an expenditure of muscular power as the act of walking. Soldiers
                    on parade remaining in the same attitude, experience even more fatigue than they
                    would suffer by a march during an equal time, because the same muscles are
                    constantly in action. The posture of a soldier under arms, with his thighs and
                    legs in the same straight line, is one which requires a painful effort to
                    preserve. The moment the word of command is given him to “stand at ease,” the
                    muscles on one side immediately relax, the right knee is slightly bent, the
                    tension of the ankle-joint is relieved, and the body, sinking upon the left hip,
                    has its height diminished by above an inch and a-half. The weight of the trunk
                    is sustained more directly by the column of bones of the left limb, which
                    support that weight at a greater mechanical advantage than before; for the
                    oblique direction of the neck of the thigh bone, with regard to the bones of the
                    pelvis, which is very great in the perfectly erect position, is now diminished.
                    But the great source of relief is that a different set of muscles is called into
                    play on every change of posture; those which were before fatigued have time to
                    recruit their energies, and become prepared afterwards to afford in their turn
                    the same relief to others by resuming their exertions.</p>
                <p>(248.) Strictly speaking, it is quite impossible for even the strongest man to
                    remain for even a very short interval of time in precisely the same position.
                    The fatigue of the muscles which are in action soon become sensible, and relief
                    is instinctively given to them by varying the points of support. Thus we may
                    observe that in standing, the weight of the body is naturally thrown alternately
                    from one foot to the other. The action of standing must be considered as a
                    series of perpetual, but obscure movements, by which the centre of gravity is
                    continually shifted from one part of the base to the other; the tendency to fall
                    in any one direction being perpetually counteracted by small and insensible
                    movements in the contrary direction. Long habit has rendered ns unconscious of
                    these exertions, and inattentive to the sensations which prompt them. But a
                    child, when acquiring the art of walking, is sensible of all these difficulties,
                    and does not learn to walk but by reiterated lessons, and by the experience of
                    many falls. It is by a practice of the same kind, and continued during a longer
                    period, that the rope-dancer learns to support himself on a narrower or more
                    unstable base than that which nature has provided. This he effects, not by
                    keeping his centre of gravity precisely in the mathematical perpendicular to the
                    rope, but by continually shifting it from side to side; never allowing it to
                    fall above a certain very minute distance, and immediately correcting the
                    vacillation by a movement which gives it an impulse in the contrary
                    direction.</p>
                <p>(249 ) The flexures of the joints of the lower extremities, it may be observed,
                    take place alternately in opposite directions. Thus, the thigh is bent forwards
                    upon the pelvis; the leg is bent backwards upon the thigh; and the foot, again,
                    is bent forwards upon the leg. This arrangement is obviously the one best
                    adapted to convenience, both as regards the folding the parts when bent, and the
                    commodious disposition of the muscles, which perform the opposite motions <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> flexion and extension. As the weight of the body occasions
                    the flexion of the joints, so it is that flexion which the muscles are chiefly
                    required to counteract; and this is the duty of the extensor muscles. We
                    accordingly find, that in each joint, the latter are much larger, and more
                    powerful than the flexors. They are enabled also to act with greater mechanical
                    advantage, in consequence of their being inserted into projecting processes of
                    the bones, evidently provided with this express intention. This is the purpose
                    of the trochanter of the thigh bone, and the projecting bone of the heel. The
                    same object is accomplished, in a still more artificial manner, in the
                    knee-joint, by an additional bone, the <hi rend="italic">patella,</hi> or
                    knee-pan, into which the great extensor muscles situated in the tore part of the
                    thigh are inserted, and which renders their action much more efficient, both by
                    diminishing its obliquity, and by removing it farther from the centre of
                    rotation. It acts, therefore, as a pulley, which is a species of lever; and it
                    is so contrived, that while the knee is bent, and the muscles at rest, as when
                    we are sitting, this bone sinks down, concealed in a hollow of the knee. When
                    the extensor muscles begin to act, they draw out the patella from this hollow;
                    and in proportion as they contract, and their strength diminishes, the patella
                    gradually rising, gives greater mechanical advantage to their action, which is
                    greatest of all when, by their complete contraction, their power is most
                    expended.</p>
                <p>(250.) The structure of the feet is also admirably contrived, as a secure basis
                    for the support of the whole superincumbent weight of the body, and of all the
                    additional burdens which the body may be made to sustain. The arrangement of the
                    bones is in as strict conformity to the principles of the arch as those of the
                    skull. The bones of the tarsus constitute what may be called a double arch; that
                    is, an arch in two different planes, at right angles to one another. There is,
                    in the first place, one great longitudinal arch, springing from the point of the
                    heel to the ball of the great toe: and there is, in the second place, a
                    transverse arch formed among the tarsal bones themselves, one within another.
                    Near the heel this arch is composed of the astraguhis, os calcis, and
                    naviculare; and farther on, by the cuneiform or wedge-like bones, the name of
                    which expresses their office, analogous to that of the stones at the crown of an
                    arch of masonry. The elasticity, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499108"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9108-0617"/>is well as security, resulting from all these
                    arches, imparts that ease and spring so remarkable in the step, and obviates the
                    injurious jar that would be otherwise inevitably communicated to the body by
                    leaps, by falls, or other accidents.</p>
                <p>(251.) In walking, the first action consists in fixing one foot firmly on the
                    ground, by transferring to it the whole weight of the body; the other foot being
                    then at liberty to move, is with the leg carried forwards. This projection of
                    the limb is necessarily attended with a corresponding advance of the centre of
                    gravity, which proceeds to move forwards till it arrives beyond the basis of the
                    foot on which the body is resting. Whenever this happens, the body, being
                    unsupported, begins to fall, and would continue to fall, were not the other foot
                    in advance, and ready to receive it, and stop its further descent. This is the
                    reason why we experience so disagreeable ajar, if in walking inattentively, the
                    foot we had advanced happens to arrive at a lower level on the ground than had
                    been expected; as when, for instance, we meet with a descending step for which
                    we were not prepared. The body on these occasions, falling through greater space
                    than usual, acquires a certain velocity of descent, and this unusual velocity
                    being suddenly checked, commuicates a shock to the whole system.</p>
                <p>(252.) λVhile the weight of the body is thus transferred alternately from one
                    foot to the other, the centre of gravity of the body, while it is continually
                    carried forwards, is at the same time alternately raised and lowered, so as to
                    describe at each step a small arch; and its whole motion may be represented by a
                    waving line, having lateral as well as longitudinal inflexions, and composed of
                    a succession of short curves. In taking long steps, we are obliged to raise the
                    centre of gravity through a longer arch, and therefore to a greater height. This
                    is consequently more fatiguing than a shorter step. If, however, we go into the
                    contrary extreme, and take too short steps, the advantage obtained in lessening
                    the height of the arches described by the centre of gravity, is more than
                    compensated by the greater quickness required in the motions necessary for
                    keeping up the same rate of walking.</p>
                <p>(253.) The lateral undulation of the body during walking is never performed with
                    precise equality on both sides; and the amount of the accumulated deviations
                    would be considerable, did. we not avail ourselves of the assistance of the
                    sense of sight in counteracting it. This will appear from the well-known fact,
                    that it is impossible for a person who is blindfolded to continue to walk in a
                    straight line for any considerable distance. Even on a perfectly level plain, we
                    unavoidably incline to the right or to the left; and the want of consciousness
                    that we are doing so, prevents us from rectifying the error; so that while we
                    imagine we have un-deviatingly pursued a straight course, we may perhaps, when
                    the bandage is removed from our eyes, find ourselves near the very spot from
                    whence we had commenced our circum-ambulatory excursion.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">The Upper Extremities.</hi></p>
                <p>(254.) The upper extremity, though exempt from the office of supporting any part
                    of the weight of the trunk, and intended for a variety of very different uses,
                    presents us with exactly the same number of divisions as the lower extremities;
                    excepting that in the skeleton, if we compare the scapula to the bones of the
                    pelvis, there is an additional bone provided in the clavicle, or collar bone, by
                    means of which the bones of the arm are articulated with those of the trunk. The
                    extremity of the clavicle, indeed, by which it joins the sternum, is the pivot
                    on which all the great motions of the arm are performed. The interposition of
                    the scapula is evidently for the purpose of giving a more extended surface for
                    the attachment of the strong muscles destined to act upon the arm and upper part
                    of the trunk, and which also lend their aid in performing the movements
                    necessary for respiration. It also contributes its share in the defence of the
                    back part of the chest.</p>
                <p>(255.) The joint of the shoulder is of the ball and socket kind, and admits,
                    therefore, of the greatest latitude of motion. That of the elbow is a simple
                    hinge-joint, and restricted consequently to mere flexion and extension. A
                    rotatory motion was here unnecessary; for the free rolling of the arm at the
                    shoulder answers every purpose that can be desired, and the elbow-joint is
                    rendered more secure by this limitation of its motion; for it will always be
                    found, that whenever a hinge-joint is sufficient for the purposes required, it
                    is employed in preference to that of the ball and socket, which, from its very
                    extensive range of motion, must necessarily be looser in its structure, and more
                    liable to dislocation.</p>
                <p>(256.) In the wrist, which is the great centre of all the ' motions of the hand,
                    a construction was called for which might allow of the utmost latitude of
                    motion. The following were the three kinds of movement required; first, simple
                    flexion and extension; secondly, lateral flexions; and, thirdly, twisting, or
                    rotation of the hand, as when it is employed in turning a screw. If all these
                    different motions had been entrusted to a simple ball and socket joint, they
                    could not have been well performed without great strains and hazard of
                    dislocation. This danger is admirably obviated by distributing the motions among
                    several articulations. No part of the bony system is more complex than the
                    wrist, which consists of eight small bones crowded into a very narrow space, and
                    lashed together by many strong ligaments, that form bands crossing one another
                    in every possible direction. While they are together fitted to the bones of the
                    fore-arm in the manner of a hinge-joint, their mutual connexions allow at the
                    same time of considerable lateral flexion.,</p>
                <p>(257∙) But still the rotatory or twisting motion of the hand, which is perhaps
                    the most useful of all, is not provided for by this mechanism. For the
                    accomplishment of this object there is employed a contrivance to which the rest
                    of the system presents nothing similar. The wrist is connected not so much with
                    the principal bone of the fore-arm, as with a subsidiary bone of equal length
                    with it, and placed in a parallel position, termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >radius</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and its peculiar mode of junction is such
                    as to enable it to describe round the former a complete semicircle. In these
                    rolling motions the radius carries along with it the hand, which thus turns in
                    perfect security; for it is difficult to conceive how a force could well be
                    applied, so as to separate bones having so long a lever of resistance. Thus,
                    while the wrist is exempt from the weakness incident to circular joints, it
                    possesses all the properties which we find in the most moveable.</p>
                <p>(258.) The manner in which the fingers are disposed in the hand, like radii from
                    a common centre, is such as to allow them very free play, and to extend their
                    sphere of action. But the chief perfection of the hand, as a mechanical
                    instrument of prehension, consists in the structure of the thumb, which is
                    furnished with muscles of so great a strength, compared with those of the
                    fingers, as to enable it to oppose and balance their united power. Hence the
                    hand is capable of grasping a spherical body, and of keeping firm hold of a
                    variety of objects, which it would otherwise have required the concurrence of
                    both hands to retain.</p>
                <p>(259∙) The passage of the tendons, by which the fingers are bent, is particularly
                    deserving of notice, and has often been appealed to as a signal instance of
                    express contrivance. As the uses of the hand require the bending of each joint
                    of the fingers independently of the others, it was necessary that separate
                    muscles and separate tendons should be provided for each. The muscles are most
                    advantageously placed high up in the arm, and convenience requires that those
                    muscles which bend the last joints should lie beneath those that bend the middle
                    joints. Had the tendons pro <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499121"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9121-0618"/>cceding from the latter been directly inserted
                    into the middle of the second bone of the finger, they would have been exactly
                    in the way of the tendons which are underneath, and which are proceeding to a
                    more distant insertion. They are therefore split into two branches, each being
                    inserted into the side of the bone; and the lower tendon is thus allowed to pass
                    on securely between them. This structure has also this further advantage, that
                    it procures a more ready flexion of the last joint than of the other joints; a
                    provision, the purpose of which is manifest, since it tends effectually to
                    prevent the escape of the object we wish to lay hold of. “There is nothing,”
                    says Dr. Paley, “in a silk or cotton mill, in the belts, straps, or ropes, by
                    which motion is communicated from one part of the machine to the other, that is
                    more artificial, or more evidently so than this perforation.” “Let a person
                    observe his own hand while he is writing, the number of muscles that are brought
                    to bear upon the pen, how the joint and adjusted operation of several tendons is
                    concerned in every stroke, yet that five hundred such strokes are drawn in a
                    minute. Not a letter can be turned without two or three tendinous contractions,
                    definite both as to the choice of the tendon, and as to the space through which
                    it moves. Yet how correctly does the work proceed; how faithful have the muscles
                    been to their duty; how true to the order which endeavour or habit has
                    inculcated. Let us watch the hand while playing upon a musical instrument. All
                    the changes produced, though extremely rapid, are exactly measured, even when
                    most minute; and display on the part of the muscles an obedience of action alike
                    wonderful for its quickness and its correctness.”</p>
                <p>(260 ) To specify all the instances of express contrivance in the mechanical
                    conformation of the hand would fill a volume. As an organ of touch it is
                    admirably formed. No instrument is better adapted to the practice of the
                    mechanical arts; none could be better fitted for examining the properties of
                    bodies, and the laws of the material world, of which none <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the other senses, unassisted by that of touch, could impart to us any
                    accurate knowledge. So great are the advantages which the possession of this
                    organ has conferred upon the human race, that many philosophers, prone to
                    paradox, have ascribed to this circumstance alone the whole of the intellectual
                    superiority which he enjoys over the brute creation.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I— <hi rend="italic">Chemical Constitution of
                    Organized Matter.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Necessity of Aliment.</hi></p>
                <p>(251.) A constant supply of nutritive matter is necessary for the continuance of
                    life, a necessity arising from a variety of causes. In the first place, the
                    substance of which the body is formed is exposed to various sources of waste and
                    dissipation, and is continually verging to a state in which the organs become
                    unfit for the performance of their functions. The chemical affinities by which
                    the elements of organized substances are retained in that peculiar mode of
                    combination which constitutes their living state, are, as we shall presently
                    see, very nicely balanced, and would be unable to preserve them in that
                    condition were not some means provided for counteracting their natural tendency
                    to decomposition. By the active exercise of their respective functions all the
                    organs, but more especially the muscular and nervous systems, experience a
                    deterioration of their component parts, and suffer decay and waste. Fresh
                    materials are required for supplying this continual expenditure. A certain
                    degree of temperature must also be kept up, otherwise the muscles would lose
                    their faculty of contracting, and the nerves their power of conveying
                    impressions to and from the sensorium. Materials are therefore necessary to be
                    employed as fuel for keeping up the vital warmth. The daily consumption of
                    combustible materials, apparently used for this purpose in the animal economy,
                    is, we shall afterwards find, ' very large, and forms a considerable proportion
                    of the food received into the body.</p>
                <p>(262.) All that we have now said refers to the body in its adult or mature state,
                    when it has attained its full dimensions, and when all that is required is its
                    preservation in that state. But during all that period of life when the body is
                    increasing in its size, it is evident that its growth can only take place in
                    consequence of the addition of new particles to those already composing the
                    substance of the body; and some parts, such as the hair and nails, continue to
                    grow even to the latest period of life. At every age some part is liable to be
                    injured or destroyed, and a provision is in most cases made for the reparation
                    of that which has been injured, or even for the replacement of that which had
                    been destroyed. These objects can be effected only by the supply of new
                    materials derived from external sources.</p>
                <p>The changes effected by the long series of assimilatory processes being
                    essentially chemical, it becomes necessary to institute a particular inquiry
                    into the chemical constitution of organized substances in their successive
                    stages of mutation, from the most simple to the more complex conditions in which
                    they are found to exist in the composition of an animal body.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Chemical conditions of organized matter.</hi></p>
                <p>(263.) The parts, which by their assemblage constitute an organized body, when
                    compared with unorganized matter, exhibit in their chemical, as well as in their
                    mechanical characters, the most well marked and striking contrast.’ Complexity,
                    variety, and difficulty of analysis, are the leading features as much in the
                    former, as in the latter of these subjects of consideration. Combinations
                    equally artificial, equally the result of design, and of refined elaboration,
                    are exhibited both in the mechanism of organic structures, and also in the
                    chemical constitution of organic substances. Compared with the latter, all the
                    bodies which are presented to us in the mineral kingdom, are extremely simple;
                    and their study presents no difficulties of an insurmountable nature. The number
                    of primary or elementary substances, or of those at least which we regard as
                    simple, is, indeed, greater in the mineral kingdom, than that of those which
                    enter into the composition of animal or vegetable bodies; but they are for the
                    most part found united in binary combinations, or are, at least, easily
                    resolvable into a small number of such binary compounds. In the products of
                    animal or vegetable systems, we find a less variety of ultimate principles; but
                    this is more than compensated by the infinitely greater diversity of modes in
                    which they are combined. The same elements, instead of forming with each ∙ other
                    mere binary combinations, generally exist in more complicated states of union ,∙
                    there, four, five, or even a greater number of constituent substances, having
                    their affinities nicely balanced, and harmonized into one individual
                    combination.</p>
                <p>(264.) From this diversity in the mode of union, there arise remarkable
                    differences in the properties of different organized products, formed from the
                    same ultimate principles: nor can we, as in bodies belonging to the mineral
                    kingdom, with an exact knowledge of the nature and proportions of the component
                    substances, proceed, by any artificial arrangement, to the actual formation of
                    the compounds themselves. No approach has yet been made by human ingenuity, to
                    the imitation of nature in these refined operations of vitality.</p>
                <p>(265.) Another consequence resulting from this difference in constitution between
                    organized products and the inorganic bodies of the mineral kingdom, is that the
                    affinities by which the elements of the former class of bodies are held in
                    union, being nicely balanced, are more subject to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499134" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9134-0619"/>change. The equipoise is
                    easily disturbed and subverted. The principles have a constant tendency to react
                    on each other, so as to give rise to a new order of combinations; which readily
                    take place by slight alterations of circumstances. All organic products are
                    susceptible of decomposition by heat alone; they are readily acted upon by
                    various agents, as water or atmospheric air; and they are generally liable to
                    spontaneous changes, to fermentation, and putrefaction.</p>
                <p>(267.) Such, then, arc the distinguishing features of the chemical properties
                    belonging to the products of organization; simplicity as to the number of
                    ultimate elements; complication in the mode and order of combination;
                    unsteadiness in the balance of affinities retaining them in union, and
                    consequent proneness to decomposition, and impracticability of their artificial
                    formation by a reunion of their principles.</p>
                <p>(268.) Whilst the products of the animal kingdom participate with vegetable
                    bodies in these common characters, which distinguish them from inorganic
                    materials, they differ from the former in several subordinate circumstances of
                    chemical relation. The constituent principles of animal substances are somewhat
                    more numerous, and their affinities more nicely adjusted, and more easily
                    disturbed. Their chemical constitution is the result of still more delicate
                    processes, and of a more elaborate organization. The three great component
                    elements of all vegetable bodies, arc <hi rend="italic">oxygen, hydrogen,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">carbon</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but animal substances
                    generally contain, besides these, a considerable proportion of a fourth element,
                    namely <hi rend="italic">nitrogen,</hi> the presence of which has a considerable
                    influence on the changes they undergo when subjected to the operation of foreign
                    agents, or left to the spontaneous operation of internal causes of
                    decomposition. <hi rend="italic">Phosphorus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sulphur</hi> must also be enumerated among the component parts of the greater
                    number of animal substances; and the affinities exerted by these elements also
                    tend to modify the results produced by these various causes. The greater the
                    number of elementary ingredients present in any assemblage, the greater will be
                    the tendency to form binary or ternary combinations; and the more will the
                    affinities be divided between different elements, and pass easily from one mode
                    of arrangement into another. Hence the greater susceptibility to decomposition
                    which characterises animal products, when compared with vegetable.</p>
                <p>(269∙) In addition to the substances already mentioned, we must also reckon among
                    the constituents of animal substances, <hi rend="italic">lime, potash,
                    soda,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">iron</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but these
                    exist only in small quantities.</p>
                <p>(270.) Some of the most important qualities distinguishing animal substances are
                    owing, in particular, to the predominance of nitrogen in their composition. This
                    substance is disengaged from them in large quantities by the action of the
                    nitric acid. This acid, indeed, itself contains nitrogen; but it has been
                    ascertained, that in producing this effect, the acid does not undergo any
                    decomposition; so that the nitrogen is furnished not by the acid, but entirely
                    by the substance subjected to its action. <hi rend="italic">Ammonia</hi> is
                    evolved both during the putrefaction of animal substances, and also by the
                    application of a heat sufficient for their decomposition; and this ammonia
                    results from the combination of the nitrogen with hydrogen during these
                    processes. <hi rend="italic">Cyanogen,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">prussic
                    acid,</hi> is also a frequent product of these operations; and is known to
                    consist chiefly of nitrogen. Under these circumstances, also, the phosphorus
                    enters into new combinations, particularly with the hydrogen and azote, and
                    forms compound gases, which are extricated both during the putrefaction and
                    destructive distillation of animal substances. By becoming acidified by its
                    union with oxygen, it enters into combination with earths, alkalies, and oxide
                    of iron, and forms a variety of neutral salts. The same observations also apply
                    to the sulphur which is found in certain quantities in several animal
                    substances.</p>
                <p>(271.) Another general difference in the chemical composition of animal and of
                    vegetable substances, is that the former contain a smaller proportion of carbon,
                    and a greater proportion of hydrogen than the latter. Carbon may be regarded as
                    the base of vegetable matter, to which oxygen and hydrogen are attached; while
                    hydrogen appears to be the principal component part of animal matter, and is
                    there combined with nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, and phosphorus. Hence during the
                    decomposition of animal substances by heat, the chief products are ammonia and
                    empyreumatic oil, in both of which hydrogen is a principal constituent. In
                    general animal matters contain less oxygen than vegetable, and hence afford less
                    acid by their decomposition; and the coal which remains differs from vegetable
                    charcoal in being much less combustible.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Proximate Animal Principles,</hi></p>
                <p>(272.) In the numerous and di versified products of the animal kingdom, we may
                    trace different degrees of complication in the composition of their elements.
                    Several substances present the appearance of greater simplicity, and appear to
                    result from the more direct union of a few elements, and to preserve among
                    various shades of modification the same general properties, and the same
                    distinctive characters. The more compound products often admit of an
                    intermediate analysis into these comparatively simpler constituents, which are
                    distinguishable from each other by a certain uniformity of character, and which
                    we may presume are obtained in the same state as that in which they existed in
                    the compound subjected to the analysis. These form what are termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">intermediate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">proximate principles of
                    animal bodies,</hi> in contradistinction to the <hi rend="italic">elementary
                    principles,</hi> which are the resultof the ultimate analysis of the substance.
                    These proximate principles may be considered as forming by their mixture, or
                    combination, all the varieties of animal matter; and they are therefore the more
                    immediate object of attention to the chemist in his analysis of animal
                    substances.</p>
                <p>(273.) The only method resorted to by the earlier chemists, in the infancy of
                    science, for ascertaining the composition of animal substances, was that of
                    subjecting them to the process of distillation at a high temperature, by which
                    their proximate principles were entirely destroyed, and either converted into
                    new compounds, or resolved into their ultimate elements. Many of these being
                    gaseous, were suffered to escape, and were totally disregarded. Scarcely any
                    light could be thrown upon the composition of animal bodies by such an imperfect
                    mode of examination. Successive improvements were afterwards introduced into
                    this branch of chemical research, consisting chiefly in the application of
                    various re-agents, from which instructive results were derived.</p>
                <p>(274.) The modern art of animal analysis may be considered as comprising three
                    different kinds of operations, which, however, admit of being variously
                    combined. The first consists in observing the spontaneous changes resulting from
                    various natural circumstances in which the substances may be placed; the second
                    depends on the application of chemical agents, employed either as tests to
                    indicate the existence of particular elements or proximate principles, or as
                    menstrua, which, by their specific affinities, may separate the elements or
                    primary compounds from each other; while the third set of operations, reverting
                    to the original plan of destructive analysis, effects the complete decomposition
                    of the substance, but carefully collects all the volatile and gaseous matter,
                    and deduces an accurate estimate of the nature and proportions of the ultimate
                    elements. We obtain, for example, a certain quantity of water, carbonic acid,
                    and ammonia; and knowing the proportions of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, which
                    they respectively contain, we are <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499147"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9147-0620"/>able to ascertain the precise amount and relative
                    proportion of the elements which entered into the constitution of the substance
                    analysed.</p>
                <p>(275.) The general result of the investigations which have been conducted by the
                    last of these methods is, that the simple bodies of which animal substances
                    consist are comprised in the following list:</p>
                <p>1. Oxygen</p>
                <p>2. Nitrogen</p>
                <p>3. Carbon</p>
                <p>4. Hydrogen</p>
                <p>5. Lime</p>
                <p>6. Phosphorus</p>
                <p>7. Sulphur</p>
                <p>8. Soda</p>
                <p>9. Potass</p>
                <p>10. Chlorine</p>
                <p>11. Magnesia</p>
                <p>12. Iron</p>
                <p>13. Silica</p>
                <p>14. Manganese.</p>
                <p>(276.) Of these, the first six may be considered as the principal elementary
                    ingredients of animal substances. Magnesia and silica are found only in very
                    minute quantities, and may therefore be in a great measure considered as foreign
                    bodies. The soft parts of the body are composed almost entirely of oxygen,
                    nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen; while lime and phosphorus form the basis of the
                    hard parts.</p>
                <p>(277.) The proximate principles most generally met with in animal substances
                    are,</p>
                <p>1. Gelatin</p>
                <p>2. Albumen</p>
                <p>3. Fibrin</p>
                <p>4. Mueus.</p>
                <p>(278.) To these have been added some others, such as <hi rend="italic">urea,
                    picromel, stearin, elain, οsmazome,</hi> and several <hi rend="italic"
                    >saccharine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">acid principles,</hi> which being more
                    limited in their extent, will fall more properly under consideration in the
                    review we shall give of the substances which chiefly contain them. We shall
                    first then present an account of the properties of the four essential principles
                    above enumerated.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Gelatin.</hi></p>
                <p>(279.) Gelatin may be extracted by long continued boiling in water from almost
                    all the hard and solid parts of the body, such as the skin, membranes,
                    ligaments, cartilages, and even the bones themselves. By the slow evaporation of
                    the water which thus holds it in solution, the gelatin may be obtained in a
                    state of purity, when it appears as a hard, brittle, and semi-transparent
                    substance, which breaks with a glassy fracture. It varies somewhat in its
                    appearance, according to the source from which it has been obtained. Glue may be
                    taken as an example of dried gelatin, in which, however, a few impurities are
                    contained. Isinglass may be considered, on the whole, as the purest form under
                    which gelatin is met with, and it exhibits most completely the characteristic
                    properties of that proximate animal constituent.</p>
                <p>(280.) One of the most striking characteristics of gelatin is the property it
                    exclusively possesses, when united to a quantity of water, of dissolving slowly,
                    but completely, forming a solution of an opaline colour, which is perfectly
                    fluid when warm, but becomes concrete on cooling, assuming the tremulous
                    appearance so well known as belonging to jelly. In this state it readily again
                    becomes liquid, by the application of a gentle heat, and may, by the continuance
                    of that heat, be brought back to the state of dryness. These alternate solutions
                    and desiccations may be repeated for any number of times, without any change
                    being produced in the chemical constitution of the gelatin. The proportion in
                    which gelatin forms a solution capable of concreting by cooling, has been
                    ascertained by Dr. Bostock in the following manner. One part of dry gelatin to
                    100 parts of water gave a solution which completely stiffened by cooling. But
                    when the proportion of water was 150 parts to one of gelatin, a compound was
                    produced, which though evidently gelatinous, did not assume the concrete
                    form.</p>
                <p>(281.) Solid gelatin undergoes no change if it be kept perfectly dry; but when
                    united with water, either in the form of solution or of jelly, it very soon
                    becomes putrid; an acid first makes its appearance, a fetid odour arises, and
                    ammonia is afterwards formed.</p>
                <p>(282.) The most ready and convenient test of the presence of gelatin in any
                    fluid, is a solution of tannin; the addition of which immediately occasions, by
                    the combination of these two principles, a copious precipitate, which assumes a
                    solid form. This precipitate collects into an elastic adhesive mass, which soon
                    dries in the open air, and forms a brittle resinous-like substance, very similar
                    in appearance to over-tanned leather. It is perfectly insoluble in water, and is
                    not susceptible of putrefaction. It is this combination oftannin with gelatin
                    that constitutes the preservative part of tanned leather, and which enables it
                    to resist the transmission of moisture. The solutions of tannin most
                    conveniently applicable as tests of gelatin, may be prepared by an infusion of
                    an ounce of gall-nuts in a pint of water; or, as Dr. Bostock has proposed, the
                    extract of rhata-nia, digested in hot water, and filtered after it becomes cold.
                    A considerable precipitate is produced by these infusions, when the proportion
                    of gelatin to the water is so small as to compose only the five thousandth part
                    of the solution. The precipitate afforded by tannin is not, however, to be
                    considered as a decisive test of the presence of gelatin; for, as we shall
                    presently find, it also occurs in consequence of the presence of albumen. In
                    order to prevent any confusion from this cause, it will be necessary to have
                    recourse also to another test, that of corrosive sublimate, which is found to
                    precipitate albumen, but not gelatin. If, therefore, by adding corrosive
                    sublimate, we obtain no precipitate, we may be certain of the presence of
                    albumen.</p>
                <p>(283.) Gelatin is insoluble in alcohol, but when already in solution in water, it
                    is not precipitated by that fluid. Acids dissolve it with great facility, even
                    when much diluted, especially when aided by heat. The nitric acid effects its
                    decomposition, during which nitrogen, and then nitrous gas, are disengaged in
                    considerable quantities; and oxalic and malic acids are evolved, and may be
                    obtained from the residuum. Sulphuric acid, with the assistance of heat, partly
                    converts it into a substance resembling sugar. Chlorine combines with gelatin,
                    forming a white substance, which assumes the form of filaments.</p>
                <p>The pure liquid alkalies dissolve gelatin very readily. The solution is a brown
                    viscid substance, which possesses none of the properties of soap, and is not
                    precipitated by acids. This property of remaining dissolved after acids are
                    added to the alkaline solution, distinguishes gelatin from albumen, fibrin, and
                    other animal products, and is therefore a valuable mode of discriminating its
                    presence, and of separating it from them in analysis.</p>
                <p>(284.) Gelatin is precipitated by several of the metallic salts and oxides, but
                    not so unequivocally as to afford satisfactory tests of its presence. Like all
                    the other -constituents of animal bodies, gelatin, while it preserves its
                    essential properties, is susceptible of many shades of variation, and appears
                    therefore under a diversity of forms, such as glue, size, isinglass, &amp;c; but
                    although many valuable remarks on this subject are contained in Mr. Hatchett’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Observations ωι the Component Parts of Animal Membrane,</hi>
                    published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1800, we are still very much in
                    the dark as to the circumstances which occasion the differences in the several
                    kindsof animal gelatin.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Albumen.</hi></p>
                <p>(285.) The proximate principle which, from its composing the greater part of the
                    white of the egg has been termed <hi rend="italic">albumen,</hi> is most
                    abundantly met with in almost all the parts of animals, whether solid or fluid.
                    It is the chief basis of several of the more solid textures of the body, such as
                    the membranous and fibrous structures, and the parenchymatous substance of the
                    glands and viscera; and it also forms a large proportion of the blood and of the
                    secreted fluids.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499160" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9160-0621"/>
                <p>In the white of the egg, albumen exists in a state of solution in water, and
                    combined with a small quantity of soda. By agitation with a still larger
                    quantity of water, the two fluids unite, and form a viscid liquid, the component
                    parts of which do not separate by standing.</p>
                <p>(286.) The characteristic property of albumen is its capability of coagulating,
                    or passing from a liquid to a solid form, by the action of heat, of acids, and
                    of alcohol, and several metallic salts and oxides. This change takes place in
                    undiluted albumen, at a temperature ofabont160° of Fahrenheit. After it has been
                    once coagulated, albumen is no longer soluble in water, unless by long boiling,
                    aided by pressure. By a long continued gentle heat, coagulated albumen gradually
                    has its moisture dissipated, and the solid matter, amounting to about one-fifth
                    of the original weight, is left behind, in the form of a hard brittle
                    transparent substance.</p>
                <p>(287.) If the albumen be much diluted, it appears to be incapable of coagulation
                    by the usual means; but still it was found by Dr. Bostock, that a solution
                    containing only one thousandth of its weight of albumen, although not properly
                    coagulated, was rendered perceptibly opaque by a boiling temperature; so that
                    heat may be considered, for all practical purposes, as a sufficiently accurate
                    test of its presence in any fluid. During coagulation there is no absorption of
                    oxygen; nor is any gas extricated: and hence there appears to be no reaction of
                    the principles of the albumen upon each other. The nature of the change which
                    takes place during this transition from the fluid to the solid form, is by no
                    means well ascertained. Dr. Thomson supposed the fluidity of albumen to depend
                    on the presence of alkaline matter; and its coagulation to the removal or
                    neutralization of this alkali; and some experiments which were devised by Mr.
                    Brande tend strongly to support this theory. He found that a rapid and abundant
                    coagulation took place in the white of an egg subjected to the action of a
                    galvanic battery, around the negative pole, where the alkali must have been
                    separated; while a thin film only collected round the positive pole. He
                    discovered also, by these experiments, that galvanic electricity may be applied
                    successively to the detection of very minute quantities of albumen, which would
                    not be rendered sensible by any other test.</p>
                <p>(288.) Another agent w+ich immediately effects the coagulation of albumen, unless
                    it be previously much diluted, is alcohol. Ether also produces the same
                    effect.</p>
                <p>(289∙) Acids in general occasion the coagulation of albumen; but several of them
                    afterwards redissolve the coagulum if assisted by heat. This is at least the
                    case with the three mincralacids. Thecoagulum formedby acidsalways retains in
                    combination a portion of the acid which has been employed. That produced by
                    nitric acid is the least soluble; and hence nitric acid occasions a precipitate
                    from solutions of albumen, which are so dilute as not to be affected by other
                    acids. Thenard remarks that the coagulum produced by acids, is re-dissolved by
                    pure alkalies, and even by ammonia, which does not dissolve albumen that has
                    been coagulated by heat. Nitric acid, when concentrated, decomposes albumen,
                    extricatingfrom it azotic gas, andduringits solution, nitrous gas. Oxalic and
                    malic acids are formed, and a’thick oily matter, soluble in alcohol, appears on
                    the surface. On the other hand, when coagulated albumen is subjected to the
                    action of dilute nitric acid, it is after some time converted into a substance
                    having the properties of gelatin. For this highly curious fact <hi rend="italic"
                    >we</hi> are indebted to Mr. Hatchett.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See his paper already quoted from the Philosophical
                    Transactions for 1800.</p></note> Alum, probably in consequence of its excess of
                    acid, coagulates albumen, provided the solution be not very dilute. One part of
                    albumen in five hundred of water is rendered slightly turbid by a solution of
                    alum, but without any formation of a precipitate.</p>
                <p>(290.) The triple prussiate or ferrocyanate of potass is, according to Dr. Henry,
                    an extremely delicate test of the presence of albumen, and may be used to
                    discover it in fluids to which other tests are inapplicable. To enable it,
                    however, to produce a precipitate, a very slight excess of acetic acid should be
                    previously added, either to the test, or to the liquid suspected to contain
                    albumen.</p>
                <p>(291.) Another delicate test of the presence of albumen is a solution of
                    corrosive sublimate; and it is the more valuable, inasmuch as it has no effect
                    on solutions either of gelatin or of mucus. Dr. Bostock found that a single drop
                    of a solution of corrosive sublimate added to a liquor containing one thousandth
                    of its weight of albumen, renders it visibly milky, and at the end of some hours
                    a flocculent precipitate falls to the bottom of the vessel. The same re-agent
                    produces a sensible effect on a liquid, containing only half that quantity, or
                    one two-hundredth of albumen.</p>
                <p>(292.) Many other metallic salts, throw down a precipitate from solutions of
                    albumen, as the acetate of lead, the nitro-muriate of tin, the nitrate of
                    silver, and the nitro-muriate of gold; but as they produce a similar effect on
                    other species of animal matter, they are scarcely deserving of confidence as
                    tests of any one in particular. A solution of tannin, which, when added to
                    albumen, occasions, after some time, a precipitate, may sometimes afford useful
                    indications in analytical inquiries, for it may be distinguished from that
                    produced from gelatin by its want of density and cohesion.</p>
                <p>(293.) Albumen is readily dissolved by the pure liquid alkalies, which disengage
                    ammonia from it, and form with the residue a saponaceous compound. This soap,
                    when dissolved in water, is precipitated by acetic or muriatic acids.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Fibrin.</hi></p>
                <p>(294.) The proximate animal principle, known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >fibrin,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">animal gelatin,</hi> exists in large quantity
                    in the blood, and forms the basis of the muscular flesh of animals. When
                    properly prepared, and freed from the admixture of extraneous matter, it
                    presents a substance of a white colour, destitute of taste or smell, of a
                    fibrous texture, and of a soft and elastic consistence. When dried it is
                    brittle, and has a certain degree of transparency; it undergoes no change from
                    the action of either air or water.</p>
                <p>(295.) When exposed to heat, it contracts very considerably, and exhibits
                    movements like horn, exhaling at the same time the smell of burned feathers.
                    When subjected to great heat, it yields the usual animal products of water, oil,
                    ammonia, carbonic acid, and carburetted hydrogen, with a large carbonaceous
                    residuum. This charcoal is very difficult to incinerate, owing to the presence
                    of phosphoric salts, which are fused by the heat employed for that purpose, and
                    form a glassy coat on the surface. A considerable quantity of carbonate of lime
                    is found in the residual ashes.</p>
                <p>(296.) The acids exert a considerable action upon fibrin. Concentrated acetic
                    acid renders it soft and transparent; and the whole mass is converted by heat
                    into a tremulous jelly. By the addition of water, and the continued application
                    of heat, a complete solution is effected, attended with the evolution of
                    nitrogen. Fibrin combines with muriatic acid in two proportions; the one gives a
                    neutral compound soluble in water; the other, containing an excess of acid, is
                    insoluble, but becomes soluble by the action of pure water. Concentrated
                    sulphuric acid decomposes and carbonizes fibrin. Diluted with six times its
                    weight of water, this acid acquires a red colour by being digested with fibrin,
                    but scarcely dissolves any sensible portion; but part of the acid is absorbed by
                    the remaining mass, which becomes a compound of fibrin and an excess of
                    sulphuric acid. Water deprives it of this excess, and a neutral combination is
                    obtained, which is soluble in water, and has the same characters <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499173" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9173-0622"/>as neutral muriate of fibrin.
                    The action of nitric acid upon fibrin is much diversified, according to its
                    dilution or state of concentration. When the acid is diluted with a large
                    quantity of water, a great abundance of nitrogen gas is disengaged. This gas is
                    entirely derived from the fibrin, and not from the acid, which, as Berthollet
                    ascertained, has suffered no decomposition during the process. The residuum, in
                    this case, is principally oxalic acid, with a small quantity of malic and acetic
                    acids, and a portion of fatty matter. When the nitric acid is undiluted, on the
                    other hand, it undergoes decomposition, and nitrous gas, mixed with nitrogen
                    gas, is disengaged. When fibrin is digested for twenty-four hours in nitric acid
                    of the specific gravity 1.25, it is converted into a pulverulent mass, of a pale
                    citron colour, which is deposited at the bottom of the liquid. By washing it in
                    water, the excess of acid is carried off, and the colour gradually becomes of a
                    deep orange. Fourcroy and Vauquelin considered this yellow matter to be a
                    peculiar acid, which they distinguished by the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >yellow acid.</hi> But Berzelius has shewn that it is merely fibrin combined
                    with nitric and malic acids. When the action of nitric acid on fibrin is very
                    slow, it is gradually converted into a state somewhat analogous to gelatin.</p>
                <p>(297.) Fibrin, when subjected to the action of caustic alkali, increases in bulk,
                    becomes transparent and gelatinous, and at length is entirely dissolved, forming
                    a yellowish green solution. From this solution it is precipitated both by acids
                    and alcohol, but seems to have undergone some change for it is not as before,
                    soluble in acetic acid. Fourcroy had asserted, that the compound of fibrin and
                    alkali resembles soap; but it does not, in fact, appear to have any analogy with
                    saponaceous bodies.</p>
                <p>(298.) Alcohol of the specific gravity of 0.81, converts fibrin into a kind of
                    adipocirous matter, which is soluble in alcohol, and precipitated by the
                    addition of water. It has a strong and unpleasant odour. The alcoholic solution
                    leaves, on evaporation, a fatty residue, which did not pre-exist in the fibrin,
                    but which, like the original substance, is soluble in acetic acid. By the action
                    of ether, fibrin is converted into the same kind of adipocire, but which has a
                    more offensive odour, and is in larger quantity.</p>
                <p>(299∙) After the account we have given of the three proximate principles which
                    enter so largely into the composition of animal matter, namely, gelatin,
                    albumen, and fibrin, it will be useful to take <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    comparative view of the analogies they present, and of the differences by which
                    they are distinguished, both in their properties and composition. They are
                    apparently composed of the same ultimate elements, combined in proportions which
                    are not widely different. They admit accordingly of mutual conversion into one
                    another, by processes which produce a slight alteration in the proportion of
                    their constituents. By the action of the nitric acid fibrin is converted into a
                    kind of gelatin, and a similar change has been effected on albumen by the same
                    re-agent. All these substances are presented both in the liquid and solid forms,
                    and pass readily from the former to the latter of these states, without any
                    apparent change in their chemical constitution. They are all of them
                    indestructible when perfectly dry, but readily undergo putrefaction when united
                    with water. Yet the modes in which they are respectively acted upon by water are
                    different, and affords an easy character of distinction between them. Gelatin is
                    soluble in cold water; the solution when evaporated becomes gelatinous; and if
                    this jelly be dried, it is still again soluble. Albumen is likewise soluble in
                    water; but whenever the temperature is raised to 170°, it separates by
                    coagulation, and this coagulum is not again soluble. Fihrin is clearly
                    distinguished by its total insolubility in water at any temperature, at least
                    under the common atmospheric pressure.</p>
                <p>(300.) Then these principles likewise differ in their composition; for though
                    they seem to consist of some ultimate principles of nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen,
                    carbon, phosphorus, and sulphur, yet these differ somewhat in their proportions.
                    The most accurate analysis of these substances into their ultimate elements are
                    those of MM. Gay Lussac and Thenard, the results of which are exhibited in the
                    following table:</p>

                <p>It appears from the above analysis, that the principal difference of composition
                    occurs in the proportion of nitrogen. Gelatin contains the least of this
                    element; albumen more; and fibrin a quantity considerably larger than either of
                    the others. The latter substance appears therefore to be the most animalized
                    product. It also contains the largest quantity of carbon, as appears indeed from
                    the greater residuum of charcoal which it leaves after destructive distillation.
                    Sulphur is perhaps peculiar to the composition of albumen. On the other hand,
                    the proportion of oxygen is considerably greater in gelatin than in either of
                    the other two substances. This predominance of oxygen, together with the less
                    compactness of its mechanical composition, are probably the causes of the
                    greater tendency which gelatin shows to pass into the acid fermentation. In this
                    respect also, gelatin shows itself to be less completely animalized than the
                    other proximate principles, and to partake more of the chemical character of
                    vegetable substances, which are well known to evolve an acid in the progress of
                    spontaneous decomposition. There are indeed some vegetables, as the tribe of
                    fungi, that become alkaline by their putrescence; and these are found to contain
                    nitrogen; so that gelatin on the one hand, and the fungi on the other, may be
                    regarded as forming, on each side, the connecting links between these two great
                    kingdoms of nature.</p>
                <p>(301.) It is a curious subject of speculation to reduce the proportions resulting
                    from the analysis of the French chemists, to those which are most reconcileable
                    to the atomic theory. They will then stand as follows:</p>

                <p>In the conversion of albumen into jelly, by the slowly continued action of nitric
                    acid, we may conclude that the acid imparts a portion of its oxygen to the

                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Mucus.</hi></p>
                <p>(302.) The term <hi rend="italic">mucus</hi> has been employed in very different
                    senses by different writers. Some have applied it vaguely to almost every animal
                    substance which was not referable to any other class. Fourcroy and Vauquelin,
                    while they include under this term the viscid secretions which lubricate the
                    alimentary and other passages that open at the surface of the body, they have
                    admitted its claim to be considered as a peculiar proximate principle, but
                    regard it as analogous to vegetable gum, from which they suppose it to differ
                    only by containing a proportion of nitrogen. Their descriptive account of its
                    properties, however, are deficient in the precision which the subject seems to
                    require, and which have been aimed at by subsequent chemists. Berzelius, it is
                    true, refuses to allow that there is any such common principle as mucus, and
                    founds his opinion on the ground that the chemical characters of the fluids
                    which bear that name, are very various in different parts of the body, and are
                    modified in different situations, according to the particular purposes they are
                    intended to fulfil. Mr. Hatchett, in his interesting paper on <hi rend="italic"
                    >the Component Parts of Animal Membrane,</hi> has attempted to fix the meaning
                    of the term more definitely. Viewing mucus as extremely analogous in its
                    properties to gelatin, he considers these two substances as merely modifications
                    of each other; the former characterized by its incapability of being
                    gelatinized; the latter by possessing that property; while both are soluble in
                    water.</p>
                <p>Dr. Bostock, in his excellent papers on <hi rend="italic">the Analysis of Animal
                    Fluids,</hi> has endeavoured to establish definite characters as belonging to
                    this fluid, when existing in a state of purity. He states that if the solid
                    matter obtained from the evaporation of saliva to dryness, be re-dissolvedin
                    water, and filtered, the solution will consist of mucus alone, or with scarcely
                    any extraneous substance. By a careful evaporation he found that the solution
                    contained one two-hundredth part of its weight of mucus. He also obtained a
                    similar principle by macerating an oyster in water, and evaporating the liquid.
                    It thus appeared that the water had dissolved about one-fiftieth of its weight
                    of animal matter. Mucus thus obtained resembles gum-arabic, excepting that it is
                    somewhat more opaque. Like it, it has scarcely any taste, dissolves readily in
                    water, and forms an adhesive solution. Alcohol added to this solution has no
                    tendency to coagulate it. No appearance of coagulation is produced by exposing
                    the fluid tor some time to the heat of boiling water; nor is there any tendency
                    to gelatinize, by evaporating and afterwards cooling the fluid. No distinct
                    effect is produced on the solution of mucus, either by the nitro-muriate of tin,
                    corrosive sublimate, or the infusion of galls. The subacetate of lead, or
                    Goulard’s extract, occasions an immediate opacity, and after some time, a flaky
                    precipitate.</p>
                <p>(303.) Dr. Bostock concludes that a decided and essential difference is thus
                    established between mucus and jelly, by the different effects produced by
                    tannin, and by subace-tate of lead. Tannin is a most delicate test of jelly, but
                    does not in any degree affect mucus. Goulard’s extract, on the other hand, is a
                    delicate test of mucus, but does not in any degree affect jelly. The bichloride
                    of mercury, (corrosive sublimate), on the contrary, which is one of the most
                    accurate tests of albumen, does not appear to affect either jelly or mucus.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the attempts which Dr. Bostock made to devise a method of
                    directly determining the proportion of mucus in a compound fluid, he was not
                    able to succeed, in consequence of the facility with which Goulard’s solution
                    decomposes the different extraneous ingredients, both animal and saline, which
                    are almost always present in substances that contain mucus, even in a state the
                    nearest approach ing to purity. The salts are particularly liable to act upon
                    the metallic solutions employed as tests; so that it is impossible to say how
                    much of the effect is owing to each of these separate causes. The precipitates
                    thrown down from mucus by subacetate of lead, and nitrate of silver, were found
                    by Mr. Brande to consist both of the muriates and phosphates of those metals.
                    Mr. Brande also attempted to obtain mucus free from neutral salts, by subjecting
                    it to the action of galvanic electricity. He thus detected a small quantity of
                    albumen in saliva, which was not discoverable by the ordinary tests.</p>
                <p>(304.) A great resemblance has frequently been noticed between the mechanical
                    properties of animal mucus and vegetable gum; and Dr. Bostock found that they
                    strongly resemble each other also in their chemical qualities. A solution of
                    gum-arabic, containing one grain of gum to two hundred grains of water, was not
                    affected either by the bichloride of mercury, nor by tannin. With the
                    nitro-muriate of tin, and with the nitrate of silver, there was only a slight
                    degree of opacity; but with the subacetate of lead there was a dense precipitate
                    instantly formed.</p>
                <p>(305.) On the whole, however, animal mucus in its chemical relations appears to
                    be most nearly allied to albumen; and the constituent upon which its
                    characteristic properties principally depend, would seem, as Dr. Bostock
                    remarks, to be a mere modification of this substance.</p>
                <p>(306.) We shall conclude our account of this substance by the following direction
                    as to the order in which it will be most convenient to conduct our analytical
                    inquiries of a fluid, which may be supposed to contain either albumen, jelly, or
                    mucus. The first step is to observe the effect of the bichloride of mercury; if
                    this produce no precipitate, we may be certain that the fluid in question
                    contains no albumen. We should next employ the infusion of galls, and if this
                    also occasion no precipitate, we may condude that the animal matter held in
                    solution consists of mucus alone. Such being the chemical properties of the
                    chief proximate principles of animal organization, we have next to examine the
                    mode in which these substances are produced in the economy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Arrangement of the
                    Functions of Assimilation.</hi></p>
                <p>(307.) The means provided by nature for meeting the various demands of the
                    system, by converting materials derived from without into the proximate
                    principles of animal organization, the properties of which we have now examined,
                    constitute a separate class of functions distinct from all the others. They
                    might not unaptly be termed the <hi rend="italic">rcparatory functions í</hi>
                    but as the changes which are effected in the materials received into the body
                    for its conversion into nutriment are wholly of a chemical nature, we thought
                    they might, with still greater propriety, be termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chemical functions,</hi> in contradistinction to those the objects of which are
                    entirely of a mechanical nature, and which have already passed under our
                    review.</p>
                <p>(308.) The rcparatory, or chemical functions, may be divided into two great
                    orders; the first consisting of those which effect all the changes that the food
                    undergoes during its conversion into blood; the second, of those which apply the
                    blood, or nutriment thus properly prepared, to the various purposes for which it
                    is wanted, and which effects in it those chemical changes that are required for
                    those objects.</p>
                <p>(309∙) The first order may again be subdivided into several subordinate
                    processes, including, 1st, The preparation which the food undergoes in the mouth
                    by <hi rend="italic">mastication,</hi> or mechanical division. 2d, Its admixture
                    with saliva and other secretions, which is generally termed <hi rend="italic"

                    by the influence of various agents, such as the bile, the pancreatic and
                    intestinal secretions; and its ultimate conversion into chyle, and separation
                    from the excrementitious portion, comprising the processes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >chylification.</hi> 6th, Its <hi rend="italic">absorption</hi> by the lacteals,
                    its transmission to the heart, and its <hi rend="italic">sanguification,</hi> or
                    conversion into blood. To the above functions the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >natural functions</hi> was given by the older physiologists, and the name is
                    retained in many modern works in medicine.</p>
                <p>(310.) The second order comprehends, in like manner, a number of most important
                    functions, which, from their immediate influence on the continuance of life,
                    have been emphatically denominated the <hi rend="italic">vital functions.</hi>
                    'They consist, 1st, of the <hi rend="italic">Circulation</hi> of the blood, by

                    in its turn to the chemical action of the air respired; is freed from its excess
                    of carbon, and becomes oxygenated, or arterialized, and fit to be applied to the

                    expresses a variety of changes effected in the blood, by passing through glands
                    and other secreting organs, adapting it to different purposes in different
                    cases. Closely allied in its object to secretion is the function of (4th) <hi
                    rend="italic">Nutrition,</hi> whereby the several parts of the body receive
                    accessions to their growth, and are maintained in the condition requisite for

                    decayed particles in the body. 6th, The last function in this order, which
                    completes the series of chemical changes going on in the living laboratory of
                    the body, is <hi rend="italic">Excretion,</hi> or the separation of useless or
                    noxious materials from the blood, and their rejection from the system. We shall
                    proceed to the consideration of these functions in the order in which they have
                    been enumerated. But for the proper understanding of the subjects they involve,
                    it will be necessary to premise an inquiry into the chemical nature of the
                    substances which are received into the body as food.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III— <hi rend="italic">Properties of
                    Food.</hi></p>
                <p>(311.) The food of man is more various in its kind than that of any other animal;
                    for it comprehends a great multitude of articles both of an animal and vegetable
                    nature. Hence man has been regarded as entitled to the appellation of an
                    omnivorous animal. His powers of digestion, however, though capable of being
                    exercised upon a great variety of materials, are yet inadequate to the
                    assimilation of many substances, which form the exclusive food of several of the
                    larger quadrupeds whose structure and economy are not very remote from those of
                    man. The human stomach and intestines are incapable of extracting nourishment
                    from the fibrous or membranous parts of vegetables, like the ox, the sheep, and
                    other herbivorous animals; nor have they the power of digesting hard and solid
                    bones, like the hyaena, the dog, and other highly carnivorous quadrupeds.
                    Neither the leaves of trees nor the grasses, have ever, in any age or country,
                    been used as the food of man. Many savage races of the American continent,
                    though possessing vast tracts of country abounding in trees and grass, have
                    frequently been visited by the extremes of famine, by which whole districts have
                    been depopulated. When Australia was first visited by Europeans, the native
                    inhabitants were found only occupying the sea-coast, gathering up a scanty and
                    precarious subsistence from the shell-fish casually thrown upon the shore; but
                    the settlements which have since been made have occasioned their retirement into
                    the interior, and their numbers have rapidly diminished. It is obvious that, had
                    the leaves of the vegetables which grow wild in those regions been capable of
                    affording the smallest sustenance, they would have necessarily been resorted to
                    in these ex tremities of hunger. But no authenticated instance of the kind
                    occurs in the history of the human race.</p>
                <p>(312.) Man, however, seems to enjoy the exclusive privilege of having organs of
                    digestion equally adapted to the assimilation of both animal and vegetable
                    aliment of certain kinds; and the range which is allowed him in this respect is
                    most extensive. Hence we find, that in most countries where there prevails a
                    high degree of civilization, and where religious scruples do not interfere, both
                    animal and vegetable food is indiscriminately employed by all who can procure
                    them. In many parts of the globe, indeed, necessity compels a restriction to
                    certain kinds of diet; and in some the same restriction is imposed as a
                    religious duty. Thus the Gentoos live entirely on the vegetable produce of the
                    earth, to which, however, they add the highly nutritious article of milk. The
                    Birmans, who are a remarkably active and robust race, are said to live
                    exclusively upon vegetable food. On the other hand, the inhabitants of the
                    mouths of many of the African rivers, live wholly upon the produce of the ocean.
                    The flesh of the rein-deer constitutes the principal food of the Laplander. In
                    general it would ap ∙ pear that the inhabitants of cold climates consume a
                    larger proportion of animal food than those of the torrid zone. Whence it has
                    been, with much probability, inferred, that less combustible matter is required
                    by the system in situations where the external temperature is habitually high; a
                    remark which, if well founded, is conformable to the principle already laid down
                    in our statement of the purposes to which <hi rend="italic">a</hi> portion of
                    the food is applied, namely, that of keeping up the animal temperature. In the
                    ruder periods of society, when the arts of civilization had not yet diffused
                    their beneficial influence over mankind, it is probable that men were more
                    carnivorous than in the present state of the world. The introduction of the use
                    of corn, and other grains of the same class, has effected in this respect an
                    important change in the condition of the species; but it would appear that the
                    introduction, of this great benefit was very gradual, and must have required a
                    long succession of ages before the cultivation of the gramina had attained any
                    degree of perfection.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Animal Food.</hi></p>
                <p>(313.) The parts of animals which are chiefly consumed as ibod is the muscular
                    flesh; but milk, and the different products obtained from milk, together with
                    eggs, also compose articles of diet. The animals from which these aliments are
                    derived, are principally the herbivorous mammalia, different tribes of birds and
                    fish, a small number of the class of reptiles, and several species of mollusea
                    and crustacea. The flesh of the mammalia and of birds consists principally of
                    fibrin and gelatin, intermixed also with fat. Milk may be considered as an
                    emulsion of albumen, oil, and sugar, suspended in a large quantity of water. The
                    two former ingredients, when obtained separately, constitute repectively cheese
                    and butter. The eggs of birds chiefly contain albumen, together with a small
                    quantity of oil. Fish contains less fibrin, but a larger proportion of albumen
                    and gelatin than the flesh of either quadrupeds or birds; and in some fish there
                    is joined to these constituents a large quantity of oil. This also is the case
                    with those crustacea and mollusea which are used as articles of diet. When we
                    come, therefore, to analyze the proximate principles from which animal nutriment
                    is derived, we find them reducible to the following: namely, fibrin, albumen,
                    oil, gelatin, and sugar; together with a few others, such as ozmazome, which are
                    of minor importance.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Vegetable Food.</hi></p>
                <p>(314.) The parts of vegetables most frequently consumed as food, are the seeds,
                    seed-vessels, fruits, stalks, roots, and tubera, and more commonly the leaves.
                    The most nutri-tious<pb break="no" facs="nls:193499212"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9212-0625"/> amongst the proximate principles resulting from
                    the analysis of these vegetable materials, are gluten, farina, mucilage, oil,
                    and sugar. The seeds of the cerealia or of rice constitute the chief bulk of the
                    food in those countries where civilization has made any considerable progress.
                    Of all these kinds of grain, wheat appears to contain, in proportion to its
                    bulk, the greatest quantity of nutriment; and this arises from its abounding in
                    gluten, which of all the vegetable principles appears to be best adapted to the
                    human organs of digestion. In its properties it bears a strong resemblance to
                    animal substances; and it appears, indeed, by chemical analysis, to contain a
                    large proportion of nitrogen. Hence it may be considered as the most animalized
                    of the vegetable products. Gluten is contained in most vegetables which afford
                    farina, and is also found in the leaves of many esculent vegetables, such as the
                    cabbage.</p>
                <p>(315.) <hi rend="italic">Farina</hi> is found in great abundance in wheat and
                    other grains, and also forms a large proportion of the nutritive portion of
                    rice, and of certain tubers, among which the principal is the potatoe. The
                    leaves, stalks, and seed-vessels of plants are rendered nutritious by the
                    mucilage which they contain, which is generally united with a portion of
                    sugar.</p>
                <p>(316.) The saccharine principle contained in vegetables, and blended with their
                    other elements, contributes greatly to render them nutritious; though in its
                    pure state, as extracted from the sugar-cane, or the beet, it is rather used as
                    a grateful addition to other articles of diet than as a separate source of
                    nutriment. Sugar may be extracted from a great variety of plants besides those
                    above mentioned. The maple, the birch, the parsnip, the cocao-nut, walnut,
                    maize, and carrot, contain it in great abundance, as is the case, indeed, with
                    every species of grain used as food. Almost all fruits are more or less
                    saccharine. Figs, grapes, and dates, which contain it in large quantity, form a
                    very considerable proportion of the food of the inhabitants of the south of
                    Europe, and the African nations on the borders of the Mediterranean. All fruits
                    contain a basis of mucilage, and in many this mucilage is combined with oil as
                    well as with sugar.</p>
                <p>(317.) Atterhpts have frequently been made to reduce all nutritious substances to
                    a single principle common to all of them, and to establish accordingly a scale
                    of nutriment, the place which any substance should occupy on that scale being
                    regulated by the proportion in which this essential principle existed in it.
                    Haller conceived that jelly might be considered as fulfilling this condition,
                    and as being the essentially nutritive substance in nature.<note anchored="true"

                    Cullen thought that this property appertains to two substances, the nutritions
                    matter being either of an oily or saccharine nature, or consisting of these two
                    qualities combined.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    these, and many other attempts at generalization, made by different
                    physiologists at different times, are premature and unphilosophical, since they
                    associate in the same class substances having properties totally dissimilar,
                    although they concur onīy in that of affording materials for the support of the
                    animal system. Perhaps the most exact classification of the kind is that of
                    Magendie, who refers all alimentary substances, whether animal or vegetable, to
                    the following heads, namely, farinaceous, mucilaginous, saccharine, acidulous,
                    oily, caseous, gelatinous, albuminous, and fibrinous.</p>

                    the articles of food used by man may, according to their chemical relations, be
                    arranged under three heads, namely, the saccharine, the albuminous, and the
                    oily. Sugar, the basis of the first class of alimentary substances, he finds to
                    consist of carbon in different proportions, from thirty to fifty per cent,
                    chemically combined with water. The basis of albumen and oil are more compound,
                    but are also united with water, the proportion of carbon existing in some of the
                    oils being nearly eighteen per cent. He is of opinion that two at least of these
                    elements must be blended together in our food in order to render it either
                    nutritious or digestible. Milk, the food provided by nature for the young
                    animal, exhibits the most perfect union of these three elements.</p>
                <p>(319∙) It must be evident, however, upon a slight consideration, that
                    notwithstanding all the attempts that have been made to establish an accurate
                    scale of nutriment, more must depend upon the powers possessed by the digestive
                    organs to convert the particular kind of food into nutritious matter, than upon
                    its being able to supply the elements requisite for composing nutriment. Thus
                    there are many substances, such as oil for example, which contain a very large
                    proportion of the elements which compose the blood, but which are extremely
                    difficult of digestion, and consequently cannot of themselves be considered as
                    nutritious, although when blended with other substances which contain fewer of
                    these elements, but which enable the stomach to exert a proper action upon the
                    compound, they become highly nutritive. This remark applies also to sugar,
                    which, although adding considerably to the nutritive qualities of those
                    vegetable products which contain it, would not, if used alone, be capable of
                    supporting life. Magendie found, that dogs fed upon sugar alone soon became
                    unhealthy, and if that diet was persisted in, perished from inanition.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Physiologie, tom. ii. p.
                    390.</p></note> Dr. Stark made numerous experiments upon himself, to which,
                    indeed, he ultimately fell a victim; from these it appears, that substances
                    which afford most nutriment, if their use be persevered in for any length of
                    time, to the exclusion of other diet, soon produce derangement of the stomach,
                    and failure of its digestive power. Peculiarities are often met with in the
                    stomachs of different individuals with respect to the power of digesting
                    particular kinds of food. In this respect much depends upon previous habits; so
                    that it is scarcely possible to establish any general rules with regard to the
                    nutritious qualities of different species of aliment, that are not invalidated
                    by innumerable exceptions. The quantity of liquid that is taken in along with
                    the solid food is also exceedingly various in different individuals; that which
                    is suited to the digestion of the one being found to disagree with another. If
                    we except soups, which of course consist of the soluble parts of materials out
                    of which they are prepared, and also milk, the liquids received into the stomach
                    rarely contain any notable proportion of nutritious matter, but seem rather to
                    aid the digestion of more solid food, either by supplying the place of a
                    solvent, or by acting as a stimulus to the stomach. They are also in many cases
                    necessary for supplying the loss occasioned by perspiration, which in hot
                    climates, by regulating the temperature of the body, is essential to the
                    preservation of health. These purposes are answered by many vegetable infusions,
                    such as tea and coffee, and also by fermented liquors, although the latter
                    contain to a certain extent many of the materials of nutrition, such as sugar
                    and mucilage, besides the stimulant principle of alcohol.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Condiments.</hi></p>
                <p>(320.) With a view to the same stimulant effect, various substances are added in
                    small quantities to our food, which act as condiments. Of these the principal is
                    common salt, a taste for which seems to be natural to a great number of animals,
                    and which, used in small quantity, has the effect of promoting digestion. Other
                    condiments, such as pepper, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499225"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9225-0626"/>mustard, garlic, and various other spices and
                    aromatics, are employed chiefly from the agreeable impression they make upon the
                    palate; but they in many cases check the tendency to fermentation which many
                    kinds of food are liable to undergo in the stomach. As a general rule, to which,
                    of course, there are many exceptions, whatever is agreeable to ths palate is
                    adapted also to the digestive powers of the stomach. A certain degree of variety
                    in the articles of diet is more conducive to the nourishment pf the body than
                    confinement to any single article.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">Appetites.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Hunger.</hi></p>
                <p>(321.) Hunger is a peculiar sensation excited m the stomach by the want of food,
                    and by the presence of the gastric juice in that organ conjointly. It is
                    evidently an affection pf the nerves of the stomach, for it is a good deal
                    dependent on the State of the nervous system. Its periodical recurrence at
                    stated times shews that it is a good deal under the dominion of habit. Hunger
                    often suddenly ceases upon the occurrence of sudden emotions of grief or anger,
                    and is much influenced by other causes of mental excitation. Literary men deeply
                    absorbed in meditation often forget that they have occasion for nutriment, and
                    are unconscious of the calls of hunger. Hence such persons are often great
                    sufferers from disordered digestion.</p>
                <p>(322.) The presence of the gastric juice appears however to be a natural stimulus
                    to appetite, its primary action being probably in the nerves of the stomach. A
                    similar effect may be produced, when the stomach is full, by taking spirituous
                    liquors, or high-seasoned dishes. Those physiologists who were inclined to refer
                    the phenomena of the living body to mechanical causes, ascribed the sensation of
                    hunger to the friction of the surfaces of the stomach against one another, which
                    they supposed took place when it was empty; but the anatomy of that organ,
                    which, from its rounded form, and from the softness of its texture, would seem
                    totally incapable of producing friction by any of its movements, is totally at
                    variance with this hypothesis. Others have conceived that the collapse of the
                    stomach in its empty state, by deranging the position of the liver and spleen,
                    drags down the diaphragm, and thus excites irritation in the nerves of those
                    regions; and they endeavour to support this doctrine by the alleged fact, that
                    hunger is prevented and appeased by wearing a’tight girdle, which occasions
                    pressure on the stomach and gives support to the neighbouring organs. But the
                    instances already given of the dependence of hunger on the states of the nervous
                    system, are sufficient to prove that it is not owing to any mechanical
                    cause.</p>
                <p>(323.) The chemical physiologists attempted to explain the phenomena solely by
                    the action of the gastric juice on the coats of the stomach, which they imagined
                    it tended to corrode, and hence gave rise to an uneasy sensation. It is much
                    more probable, however, that the impression made by this secretion is
                    exclusively on the nerves of the stomach; and there is no doubt but that this
                    action is one of the principal causes of hunger; for it has been found, that, if
                    after long fasting, when there is a considerable accumula-lation of gastric
                    juice, and when the sensation of hunger is extremely intense, it at once ceases
                    if the gastric juice be removed by an emetic; or even if it be much diluted by
                    taking large quantities of hot water.</p>
                <p>(324.) The effects of long abstinence from food are, great loss of strength,
                    emaciation, discoloration of the blood and of the secretions, an increase of
                    nervous susceptibility, fever, loss of sleep, painful sensations in the region
                    of the stomach, followed by total loss of appetite, delirium, and death. It has
                    been said, that the exterior of the bodies of those who die of famine has
                    exhibited a shining appearance in the dark, as if they had been impregnated with
                    uncombined phosphorus,</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Thirst.</hi></p>
                <p>(325.) Thirst is a sensation somewhat analogous to hunger with respect to its
                    cause and effect, and with respect of its depending on particular states of the
                    nervous system. It is considerably more distressing and intplerable than hunger.
                    The seat of the sensation appears to be in the mouth and fauces, although its
                    origin is generally in the state of the stomach, or general condition of the
                    system. In the healthy condition of the organs it is a natural impulse prompting
                    us to supply the system with the fluids requisite for carrying on its functions.
                    But in the case of fevers, and other morbid states, thirst is sometimes
                    excessive, and, if indulged without restriction, would prove highly injurious.
                    In cases where a preternatural opening has been made into the oesophagus through
                    the neck, the sensation of thirst is found not to be in any degree assuaged by
                    fluids applied to the mouth, or even swallowed, if they escape through the
                    wound, and do not descend into the stomach; whereas, it is immediately relieved
                    when the same fluids are introduced into the stomach.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V.— <hi rend="italic">Preparation of the Food for
                    Digestion.</hi></p>
                <p>(326.) The preparatory processes to which the food is subjected previous to its
                    introduction into the stomach, are partly of a mechanical and partly of a
                    chemical nature. It is masticated by the teeth and jaws, and at the same time
                    mixed with the saliva and mucous secretions of the membrane lining the mouth,
                    fauces, and oesophagus. The effect produced by these operations is to reduce the
                    food to a soft and uniform pulp, which is more easily acted upon by the solvent
                    powers of the gastric juice than if it had been swallowed entire.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Mastication.</hi></p>
                <p>(327.) During mastication a great number of muscles are called into action. The
                    principal of these are the powerful muscles that elevate the lower jaw, namely,
                    the temporal, the masseter, and the pterygoid muscles, the latter of which are
                    capable of giving at the same time some degree of lateral motion to the jaw,
                    adapting it thereby to effect a grinding action by the medium of the teeth. The
                    lower jaw forms a lever of the third kind with a double angle, the fulcrum being
                    at the condyles, which are curiously articulated with the skull, by means of an
                    interposed cartilage. Its motions are almost entirely confined to those of
                    elevation and depression; but it has also a more limited extent of lateral
                    motion.</p>
                <p>(328.) The teeth, which are the great agents in mastication, have already been
                    described and their different classes enumerated, under the head of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Anatomy.</hi> The respective purposes served by each class are
                    sufficiently evident from their shape and position in the jaw. The incisor, or
                    front teeth, are employed for cutting or dividing the food like a pair of shears
                    or scissors; the cuspidati, or eye-teeth, placed a little farther back in the
                    jaw, are particularly adapted to lay hold of, and tear asunder, fibrous textures
                    that afford considerable resistance; their action may be compared to that of
                    pincers. Mr. Hunter, after reviewing their different forms in the different
                    tribes of quadrupeds, is enabled to trace a similarity in shape, situation, and
                    use of the cuspidati, from the most imperfect carnivorous animal, which he
                    believes to be the human species, to the most perfect carnivorous animal, the
                    lion. The bicuspidati and molares compose what are called the grinding teeth,
                    and their chief office is the trituration of substances already torn off by the
                    cuspidati, or cut by the meeting of the incisors. The molares especially, being
                    placed nearer to the articulation of the jaw, or centre of motion, act with
                    greater power in exerting<pb break="no" facs="nls:193499238"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9238-0627"/> pressure on whatever is between them. If we wish
                    to break a very hard body, the shell of a nut for example, we instinctively
                    place it between the backmost molares, where the resistance it opposes to
                    fracture acts by the shortest lever.</p>
                <p>The bony substance of the teeth is preserved from the injury to which it would be
                    exposed by the friction ofhard substances, and by the contact of corroding
                    fluids, and the influence of the air, by being cased in enamel, which, as we
                    have seen, is considerably harder than bone. In consequence of the peculiar mode
                    of its formation, the enamel is incapable of being renewed by a fresh growth
                    when it has been worn away by friction. When, however, the teeth are lost by
                    age, accident, or disease, their alveoli close and are obliterated by
                    absorption; the gums then acquire a degree of hardness, that renders them an
                    imperfect substitute for the teeth in mastication.</p>
                <p>(329.) The chief agent in distributing the food so as to place it in proper
                    situations between the teeth for the purpose of mastication, and for
                    transferring it to the fauces, is the tongue. This organ consists almost
                    entirely of muscular fibres, which are variously arranged, and interwoven
                    together in a very intricate manner, so as to render it capable of motion in
                    every possible direction. Its root is affixed to a bone which is peculiar to it,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">os hyoides,</hi> from its resemblance to the Greek
                    letter υ, which furnishes a basis of attachment to the greater number of the
                    muscles of the tongue, and the extremities of which being extended considerably
                    backwards, serve to keep the palate expanded and always prepared to receive the
                    food. But the tongue also contains a set of muscular fibres, which proceed
                    longitudinally through the centre of that organ, unattached to any bone, and
                    serving to contract its length. The tongue is thrust out of the mouth, not by
                    any power of elongation in the muscles, as might at first sight appear to be the
                    case, but by the contraction of that portion of the radiating fibres proceeding
                    backwards from the inside of the jaw and the os hyoides, and drawing forwards
                    the root of the tongue when they act alone. This complex structure is admirably
                    adapted to the great variety of uses to which the tongue is applied, not only in
                    mastication and deglutition, but also in speaking.</p>
                <p>(330.) The muscular actions of the lips and cheeks are also intimately concerned
                    in mastication; and ample provision is made for their varied movements by being
                    furnished with so great a number of muscles as those which cover the face, and
                    are attached more or less to the lips and corners of the mouth.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Insalivation.</hi></p>
                <p>(.331.) While the food is under the action of the organs of mastication which
                    effect its mechanical division, it is at the same time mixed up with the saliva.
                    This fluid is found, when chemically examined, to consist principally of mucus
                    and albuminous matterheid in solution in water, together with a small proportion
                    of saline ingredients.</p>
                <p>(332.) Dr. Bostock considered that he had detected two kinds of animal matter in
                    the saliva, one composing the soft masses, and giving it its consistence and
                    physical characters, nearly similar to coagulated albumen, the other dissolved
                    in the water of the fluid along with the salts, and resembling the serosity of
                    the blood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edin. Med.

                    corresponding in its properties to mucus, and states the saline ingredients to
                    be chiefly alkaline muriates, with a small quantity of lactate of soda and of
                    pure soda.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    state the solid contents of the saliva to vary from one to twenty-five per cent,
                    and to consist of salts, mucus, and ozmazome, to which are added, in some cases,
                    a little albumen and a little fatty matter, containing phosphorus. The
                    soluble-salts consist of alkaline carbonate, which gives an alkaline character
                    to the fluid, acetate, phosphate, sulphate, muriate, and sulpho-cyanate. The
                    alkali in man is almost solely potass; while, in the dog and sheep, it consists
                    of soda, with very little potass. The presence of sulpho-cyanic acid, on the
                    other hand, is almost peculiar to the human saliva, being scarcely perceptible
                    in that of the dog. Some insoluble salts, namely, phosphate of lime, carbonate
                    of lime, and carbonate of magnesia, are also detected in the saliva, but in very
                    minute quantity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Tiedemann and Gmelin, represent the chemical properties of the chyle as being
                    essentially the same in all animals, and consider the animal matter it contains

                <p>(333.) When viewed by a good microscope, the saliva is generally found to contain
                    globules of very minute size.</p>
                <p>(334.) The saliva is secreted by the parotid and other glands in the vicinity of
                    the mouth, and is poured out in considerable quantities during mastication. It
                    has been estimated that about six or eight ounces of saliva are at each
                    principal daily meal mixed up· and incorporated with the food. It flows much
                    more abundantly during a meal, and particularly if the food that is eaten
                    possesses stimulating qualities, and has a sapid flavour. The quantity is
                    augmented by the appearance, or even the idea of food, when the appetite is
                    keen. The influence of the nerves which supply the salivary glands is very
                    marked in regulating their secretions, as we shall have occasion to observe more
                    at length, when we come to consider the function of secretion. The pressure of
                    the muscles of the cheek on the parotid gland assists no doubt in the quick
                    discharge of the secretion of that gland by its excretory ducts; and the same
                    remark applies also to the submaxillary and sublingual glands, which also
                    prepare saliva, and whose ducts open into the mouth; for we find, that during
                    mastication all the muscles about the mouth are in continual action. The tongue
                    presses the food on all sides, and thrusts it between the grinding teeth, while
                    the muscles of the cheek, but more particularly the buccinator, against which
                    the food is pressed by the tongue, forces it back again under the teeth, until
                    the whole has been sufficiently subjected to their action; and during the whole
                    of this time it is gradually receiving additions of saliva, which thus become
                    intimately and uniformly mixed up with every portion of the divided food. When
                    completely chewed, it is collected together on the surface of the tongue, which
                    sweeps round the different parts of the mouth for this purpose, and moulds it
                    into the form of a bolus; and the point of the tongue being then raised, and its
                    basis depressed, an inclined plane is formed, along which the bolus is propelled
                    backwards, and delivered to the pharynx, which is expanded to receive it.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Deglutition.</hi></p>
                <p>(335.) The action of swallowing, simple as it may appear to be, is in reality
                    extremely complex, consisting of a succession of muscular contractions, nicely
                    adjusted and balanced, so as to co-operate harmoniously in the production of one
                    general effect, the descent of the food along the oesophagus. The whole exhibits
                    one of the most beautiful examples of mechanical contrivance that is to be met
                    with in the body.</p>
                <p>(336.) The pharynx, as we have seen, is a large muscular bag, shaped like a
                    funnel, capable of being contracted in diameter, and of compressing its soft
                    contents by means of the muscles which are expanded round it, and are called the
                    constrictors of the pharynx. Other muscles are provided <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499251" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9251-0628"/>for elevating it, that is,
                    for bringing it nearer to the base of the tongue. While the food is passing
                    downwards, the velum pendulum is expanded, thrown backwards, and raised by the
                    muscles adapted to perform these motions, so that it closes the posterior
                    nostrils, and acting as a valve, prevents any portion of what is swallowed from
                    passing either into those cavities or into the eustachian tubes. The bolus is
                    thus directed towards the oesophagus, being carried thither by the peristaltic
                    motion of the pharynx, while the root of the tongue being at the same time
                    depressed, the epiglottis is turned backwards, and being applied to the glottis,
                    accurately closes its aperture, so that no part of the alimentary matter can
                    pass into the larynx. The mass of food being now arrived at the upper part of
                    the oesophagus, is propelled towards the stomach by the successive contractions
                    of its circular fibres. The mucus, which is secreted in abundance by all the
                    surfaces along which it passes, and continually lubricates them, very much
                    facilitates its descent. The longitudinal fibres of the muscular coat of the
                    oesophagus contribute their share in this action, by shortening and dilating
                    those portions of the canal into which the food is about to enter. Dumas
                    distinguishes four stages in this process; first, that by which the aliment is
                    propelled towards the pharynx; the second, consisting in the dilatation of that
                    cavity, by which it receives the bolus transmitted to it; the third, by which
                    the pharynx closes upon its contents, and propels it downwards to the
                    oesophagus; and the fourth, in which, by the action of the oesophagus, the food
                    is propelled into the stomach.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Physiologie, tome i. p. 341.</p></note></p>
                <p>(337.) When any impediment exists to the due performance of these actions, fluids
                    are swallowed with greater difficulty than solids, because the particles of the
                    former having a continual tendency to spread themselves, it requires a closer
                    and more exact application of the organs to prevent their escape, while they are
                    compressed in giving to the fluid its proper direction. The action of suction
                    performed by the tongue, with the assistance of the muscles of the cheeks and
                    lips, which remove the pressure of the atmosphere from the surface of the fluid
                    to which the mouth is applied, is also very complex. The tongue acts here as a
                    piston; and sometimes the action is effected by the muscles of inspiration.</p>

                    rend="italic">Chymification.</hi></p>
                <p>(338.) The food has now passed from the oesophagus into the stomach, through its
                    cardiac orifice, which has so been named from its supposed sympathy with the
                    heart, near which it is situated. The office of the stomach is to convert the
                    food which it receives into the soft pultaceous mass of a grey colour, which has
                    been denominated <hi rend="italic">chyme.</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The older authors made no distinction between
                    chyme and chyle, the latter substance being the product of the formation of the
                    small intestines.</p></note> These secretions do not proceed from any glands
                    that admit of being readily distinguished, their existence being rather inferred
                    from the presence of the secretion. The membranes composing the coats of the
                    stomach are capable of great distension, so as to contain a large quantity of
                    food, while at other times that organ is contracted to a very small size, partly
                    by the elasticity of its texture, but principally by the action of the circular
                    and longitudinal fibres which encompass its cavity, and which constitute its
                    muscular coat. These fibres are so disposed as to enable the different portions
                    of the stomach to act separately and successively on its contents, producing
                    what has been termed the <hi rend="italic">peristaltic,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">vermicular motion.</hi> Two purposes are answered by these
                    actions; in the first place, the food contained in the stomach is agitated and
                    thoroughly mixed together, while it is at the same time exposed to the chemical
                    action of the gastric juice; and secondly, the ultimate effect of this motion is
                    to carry the mass very gradually towards the pylorus, through which it is
                    transmitted into the beginning of the intestinal canal.</p>
                <p>(339∙) While the food is thus rolled and agitated by the peristaltic action of
                    the muscles, it is at the same time subjected to a degree of pressure, the
                    purpose of which seems to be, to bring into closer approximation the solvent
                    fluids with the materials on which they are to act, and thereby increase the
                    chemical power of the former, and also to repress the evolution of gas, which
                    has a tendency to be generated during the species of fermentation which the
                    aliment undergoes in the process of digestion.</p>
                <p>(340.) The principal agent in effecting those changes which constitute digestion,
                    that is, which convert the aliment into chyme, is the gastric juice. The
                    important office which this secretion performs has induced chemists to bestow
                    great pains in obtaining its correct analysis, and in examining all its physical
                    properties. when carefully collected, it appears to be a transparent and
                    colourless fluid, having a saline and somewhat bitter taste, occasionally
                    possessing acid properties, but probably in its natural and healthy condition
                    being neither acid nor alkaline. It contains a small proportion of albumen,
                    together with a matter which is either gelatin or mucus. But while it thus
                    differs to all appearance in so trifling a degree from many of the other
                    secretions, it yet possesses very extraordinary solvent powers over the
                    substances usually employed as food. Even when made to act upon these substances
                    in vessels out of the body, provided they are kept in a temperature equal to
                    that of the human body, it will reduce them in a few hours to the state of a
                    soft pulp, producing apparently the very same change which is induced upon the
                    same species of aliment by the digestive process within the stomach. It is
                    evident that the chemical analysis of the gastric juice affords as yet no clue
                    to the explanation of this singular property. The power which the gastric juice
                    possesses of coagulating milk, and other albuminous fluids, and of retarding the
                    putrefaction of animal and vegetable substances subjected to its action, and
                    even of counteracting this process when it has already commenced, are equally
                    involved in mystery, and baffle all our endeavours to explain them on any of the
                    hitherto known chemical principles.</p>
                <p>(341.) There are three ways in which the gastric juice has been observed to act
                    on alimentary matter; the first is that of coagulation, which is exerted on all
                    the fluid forms of albumen, whether existing in the serum of the blood, or the
                    white of the egg, or in different secretions, more especially milk. It is by
                    means of this property, indeed, that cheese is obtained from the coagulation of
                    its albuminous portion by the addition of rennet, which is an infusion of the
                    digestive stomach of a calf. The object of this coagulation appears to be to
                    detain the substance for a longer time in the stomach, and subject it more
                    completely to the solvent power of the same fluid, by previously acquiring a
                    solid form, which prevents its escape by the pylorus.</p>
                <p>(342.) The second kind of action exerted on the food by the gastric juice is that
                    of counteracting the tendency to putrefaction, and even to the ascescent
                    fermentation. This effect takes place in a remarkable degree in many carnivorous
                    animals, who frequently take their food in a half putrid state; and in whom the
                    first operation of the gastric juice is to remove from it all putrescence;
                    shewing that this secretion possesses the property not only of preventing
                    putrefaction from taking place, but also of suspending its further progress when
                    it has actually commenced.</p>
                <p>(343.) The third species of chemical action exhibited by the gastric-juice is
                    that of solution. That this effect takes place independently of any concurrent
                    mechanical operation <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499264"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9264-0629"/>of the tnuscular powers of the stomach hasbeen
                    very decisively proved by the experiments of Reaumur, of Stevens, and of
                    Spallanzani. Those of Stevens in particular, are highly valuable, from being
                    made on the human subject. He was fortunate enough to meet with a man who had
                    been in the habit of swallowing stones, which he could afterwards, by a
                    voluntary effort, reject by vomiting from his stomach. Taking advantage of this
                    power, Stevens induced him to swallow hollow metallic spheres perforated with
                    holes, and filled with different kinds of alimentary substances, which, after
                    being allowed to remain a sufficient time in the stomach, were returned, and
                    their contents examined. It was invariably found that the food under these
                    circumstances of exposure to the gastric fluid alone, and protection from
                    external pressure of a mechanical nature, was more or less completely dissolved,
                    and reduced to the state of a pulp. He afterwards pursued a similar train of
                    experiments on dogs, causing them to swallow the perforated spheres, and after a
                    certain time destroying the animals, and examining the changes effected in their
                    contents.</p>
                <p>(344.) Spallanzani has also varied and multiplied experiments of this kind in a
                    manner that leaves no room to doubt the truth of the conclusion deduced from
                    them as to the solvent power of the gastric secretion. Dense membranes and even
                    bones are reduced into a pulpy mass by this fluid in many animals, while at the
                    same time many bodiesofcomparatively delicate textures, such as the skins of
                    fruits, and the fibres of flax or cotton, are not in the slightest degree
                    affected by it. This difference of action on different substances is analogous
                    to the operation of chemical affinity, and corroborates the theory that
                    digestion is effected principally by chemical agency. The results of these
                    experiments have been fully confirmed by experiments made on the stomachs of
                    persons, who, in consequence of a wound, had a permanent opening into that organ
                    from the skin of the abdomen.</p>
                <p>(345.) Portions of the stomach are sometimes found dissolved after death. This
                    takes place more especially when death has occurred suddenly during the act of
                    digestion. This effect can never take place during life, because the living
                    structures resist the solvent power of the gastric juice, which affects only
                    dead animal matter. Thus it happens that worms, and the larvae of insects live
                    for a considerable time in the stomach, without being acted upon by its
                    secretions.</p>
                <p>(346.) Gas is frequently evolved in the stomach during the process of digestion;
                    but this would appear to take place only in a disturbed or morbid condition of
                    that process, and by no means to be a necessary attendant upon healthy
                    digestion.</p>
                <p>(347.) Acid is also frequently developed during imperfect digestion; but it
                    appears from the experiments of Dr. Prout, which have been fully confirmed by
                    other experimentalists, that this effect is also attendant upon healthy
                    digestion, and that it is principally the muriatic acid which is thus disengaged
                    from its combinations, and makes its appearance in a free state. The lactic
                    acid, an acid which appears to be a modification of the acetic, also is present
                    in considerable quantity.</p>
                <p>Professor Tiedemann and Gmelin,in an elaborate treatise on Digestion lately
                    published, found the acetic acid always present in the gastric juice. They
                    observe that water alone, at the temperature of the human body, is capable of
                    dissolving many of the substances employed as food; and of these many that arc
                    not soluble in water are so in the diluted muriatic and acetic acids at a high
                    temperature, and they are inclined to ascribe to a chemical solution of this
                    kind the principal change effected by digestion.</p>
                <p>(348.) Among the agents concerned in the digestion of the aliment, the high
                    temperature at which the contents of the stomach and intestines is retained,
                    must be considered as one of the most important. The heat of the body
                    unquestionably tends to promote the chemical action of the secretions which
                    effect these changes. While digestion is taking place, both orifices of the
                    stomachare closed, and there often comes on a feeling of chilliness, especially
                    in a weakly constitution, in consequence of the demand which the stomach makes
                    upon it for an additional supply of heat to assist in the process that is going
                    on. There is also disinclination to exertion, and frequently a tendency to sleep
                    while digestion is performing. Yet the indulgence in this disposition, as well
                    as violent exercise immediately after a meal, tend equally to retard the
                    formation of chyme. The circumstances most favourable to perfect digestion, are
                    gentle exercise, with cheerfulness, and moderate mental exertion</p>
                <p>(349∙) It appears from Dr. W. Philip’s experiments, which were conducted chiefly
                    on rabbits, that food recently taken is always kept distinct and unmixed with
                    that which has remained for some time in the stomach, the former being
                    introduced into the centre of the mass previously present. The food is more
                    digested the nearer it is to the surface of the stomach, and is least digested
                    in the small curvature, more so at the larger end, and still more perfectly at
                    the middle of the great curvature. The state of the food found in the cardiac
                    portion is different from that found in the pyloric portion of the stomach; for
                    in the latter it is more uniform in its consistence, more dry and compact, and
                    apparently more thoroughly digested. Thus it would appear that it is at the
                    large end of the stomach where the gastric juice is secreted in greatest
                    abundance, that the first and principal operations of digestion take place, and
                    that from this part the food is gradually propelled towards the small end,
                    becoming more completely changed during its progress.</p>
                <p>It appears from the experiments of De Beaumont on an individual who lived many
                    years with a fistulous opening into the stomach, which allowed the contents of
                    that organ to be at all times examined, that the different kinds of aliment all
                    require to undergo the chemical action of the gastric juice in order to be
                    reduced to the state of chyle; but that the rapidity of this process differs
                    considerably, according to the delicacy of the natural texture of the food, and
                    the extent of its previous mechanical division. Animal substances are found to
                    be more rapidly converted into chyme than vegetable; and oily substances,
                    although containing a large proportion of nutritious elements, are comparatively
                    difficult of digestion. Some curious evidence was afforded by Dr. Roget and Dr.
                    P. Μ. Latham, on the occasion of an epidemic scurvy which prevailed in the years
                    1823 and 1824, among the prisoners in the Milbank Penitentiary, that too liquid
                    a diet, consisting of too large a proportion of soups, although abundantly
                    supplied, did not furnish sufficient nourishment for the preservation of health;
                    probably from their not being retained in contact with the coats of the stomach
                    during the time requisite for their undergoing the process of digestion<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See An Account of the disease
                    lately prevalent in the General Penitentiary. By P. Μ. Latham, M.D. London,

                <p>(350.) A great number of hypotheses were devised by the older physiologists in
                    order to explain the process of digestion. These we shall only briefly
                    enumerate, without engaging in any laboured refutation of what, in the present
                    advanced state of science, does not require much examination to prove the
                    fallacy. The ancients had generally adopted the opinion of Hippocrates, which
                    was enforced by Galen, that the food was digested by what was called a process
                    of <hi rend="italic">concoction.</hi> This, however, seems to be only another
                    term for digestion, instead of affording any explanation of its nature. Some
                    physiologists considered digestion as resulting from a degree of putrefaction; a
                    process which is in reality of a totally opposite nature, although agreeing in
                    some minor <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499277" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9277-0630"
                    />points, such as the breaking down of the cohesion of the particles, and the
                    occasional disengagement of gas. Others, reasoning from the analogy of the
                    stomachs of granivorous birds, which are provided with a strong muscular
                    apparatus for the purpose of grinding, conceived that a similar process took
                    place in the human stomach, and that digestion was the effect of mechanical
                    trituration. But the experiments of Stevens and Spallanzani, the results of
                    which have been already stated, are alone sufficient to overhirn this
                    hypothesis.</p>
                <p>(351.) The earlier chemical physiologists ascribed digestion to a species of
                    fermentation. This term, however, appears to have been misapplied, in as far as
                    digestion is conceived to be identical with either the acetous or vinous
                    fermentations; and if it were meant to convey the idea of a peculiar species of
                    chemical change taking place in the stomach, and in no other situation, then
                    nothing is gained by the substitution of the term employed for that of
                    digestion, which must express precisely the same idea. More modern writers have
                    imagined they were giving an explanation of the phenomena of digestion, by
                    referring them simply to the action of the vital principle, or the vital powers,
                    or the principle of life, or by whatever name they chose to designate an
                    imaginary agent which gave rise to all those phenomena, not referable either to
                    mechanical or chemical principles. But after the remarks we have elsewhere made
                    on this radical error of substituting final for physical causes, and of
                    prematurely generalizing the principles which actuate the living system, it is
                    needless farther to insist upon the fallacy of this mode of reasoning.</p>
                <p>(352.) A doctrine has lately been advanced, with greater semblance of truth, that
                    digestion is essentially a nervous function; that is, one which is directly
                    dependent on nervous power. A variety of facts unquestionably prove that the
                    functions of the stomach are very much influenced by the states of the nervous
                    system. The section of the par vagum, or eighth pair of nerves, in the neck of
                    an animal, is followed by the almost total interruption of digestion; whence we
                    may infer that the influence conveyed by these nerves is necessary both for the
                    secretion of the gastric juice, and perhaps also for the muscular actions of the
                    stomach. It is exceedingly remarkable, however, that where the galvanic
                    influence is sent through the mutilated nerves, by means of a voltaic battery,
                    digestion may be renewed, and goes on for a considerable time; whence it has
                    been inferred by Dr. W. Philip, that the nervous power, or the agency which is
                    conveyed through the nerves, and which influences secretion, is itself identical
                    with the electric or galvanic fluid.</p>
                <p>(353.) The pyloric orifice of the stomach is furnished with a circular band of
                    fibres, covered by a fold of the nervous coat; and acting as a sphincter muscle,
                    which closes the passage during the early stages of digestion, so as not to
                    suffer the escape of the food until it has undergone the requisite changes which
                    constitute its digestion. The aliment is conveyed to the pylorus in proportion
                    as it has undergone these changes. There appears to exist in this part of the
                    stomach a peculiar and extremely delicate sensibility, and a power of selecting
                    those portions of the food that are properly digested, and of allowing them to
                    pass, while those which are undigested are retained in the stomach.</p>
                <p>It would appear, however, from some recent experiments, that a portion of aliment
                    passes unchanged through the pylorus along with the chyme. We observe, for
                    instance, that many hard substances, such as the stones of cherries and plums,
                    find their way through the pylorus without much difficulty. The seeds of many
                    plants are only softened by their detention in the stomach, and passing with no
                    other change through the intestinal canal, are prepared for germination in the
                    soil to which they may be transferred. Thus many species of plants and trees
                    have been known to grow at places very remote from each other in consequence of
                    their seeds having been conveyed by birds that had swallowed them.</p>
                <p>CHAP. VII CHYMIFICATION. ∙</p>
                <p>(354.) The aliment, now converted by the process of digestion into chyme, after
                    passing the pylorus, enters into the duodenum, which is the first of the small
                    intestines. In the duodenum the chyme undergoes fiirther changes, which are
                    quite as great and as essential to its proper assimilation, as those which the
                    food experienced in the stomach, and they are at the same time involved in equal
                    obscurity. Almost all that is known respecting the nature of these changes, is,
                    that soon after the chyme has been received into the intestines, it begins to
                    separate into two parts; the one a white milky fluid, which is termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">chyle</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the other, residual matter,
                    which afterwards becomes <hi rend="italic">faces,</hi> and is eventually ejected
                    from the body.</p>
                <p>(355.) Previously to our examining the processes by which this separation is
                    effected, it will be proper to consider the chemical properties of the
                    chyle.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Properties of Chyle.</hi></p>
                <p>(356.) Chyle is the fluid which is prepared from the food taken into the stomach,
                    and which, being the last process of digestion, is formed in the intestinal
                    canal. It is only of late years that we have acquired any accurate knowledge of
                    its chemical properties. It is evident that experiments on this fluid can only
                    be instituted on quadrupeds, and that it is only by reasoning from analogy that
                    we can extend the knowledge so obtained to the human economy. If chyle be taken
                    from the thoracic duct of an animal a few hours after it has taken food, it has
                    very much the appearance of cream, being a thick fluid of an opaque white
                    colour, without smell, and having a slightly acid taste, accompanied by a
                    perceptible sweetness. It restores the blue colour of litmus, previously
                    reddened by acetic acid; and appears, therefore, to contain a predominance of
                    alkali. λVhen subjected to microscopic examination, chyle is found to contain a
                    multitude of globules, of smaller diameter than those of the blood, and
                    corresponding in size and appearance to those of milk. In about ten minutes
                    after it is removed from the thoracic duct, it coagulates into a stiff jelly,
                    which in the course of twenty-four hours separates into two parts, producing a
                    firm and contracted coagulum, surrounded by a transparent colourless fluid.</p>
                <p>(357.) The coagulated portion, according to Vauquelin, is a substance of a nature
                    intermediate between albumen and perfect fibrin, marking the transition from the
                    one to the other. It has perhaps, indeed, a closer resemblance to the caseous
                    part of milk than to fibrin. It is rapidly dissolved both by pure and
                    sub-carbonated alkalies, forming pale brown compounds. Its solution in ammonia
                    has a reddish hue. The acids throw down a substance intermediate between fat and
                    albumen, -which an excess of nitric acid redissolves in the cold; and sulphuric,
                    muriatic, oxalic and acetic acids, by boiling for a short time, also dissolve
                    it. Diluted sulphuric acid also very readily effects its solution. Very dilute
                    nitric acid gradually converts it into adipocire; when the acid is more
                    concentrated, the coagulum assumes the appearance of gelatin; and when heat is
                    applied, oxalic and carbonic acids are evolved. It is insoluble either in
                    alcohol or ether.</p>
                <p>(358.) That portion of chyle which retains the liquid form contains a portion of
                    albumen, which may be coagulated by heat, alcohol, or acids. The clear liquid,
                    reduced by evaporation to half its bulk, deposits crystals, which were found by
                    Mr. Brande to bear a strong resemblance to those of sugar or milk.</p>
                <p>(359∙) A few saline bodies, similar to those existing in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499290" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9290-0631"/>most animal fluids, were
                    found by Dr. Marcet, to be present in chyle.</p>
                <p>(360.) The principal ingredients in chyle are, therefore, according to Vauquelin,
                    lst, a large proportion of albumen; 2d, a smaller one of fibrin; 3d, a fatty
                    substance which gives to the chyle the appearance of milk; 4th, several salts,
                    such as carbonate of potass, muriate of potass, and prophosphate of iron.</p>
                <p>(361.) Berzelius is strongly inclined to distrust the supposed analogy between
                    chyle and milk, as having but little foundation in their real chemical
                    nature.</p>
                <p>(362.) It would be exceedingly interesting to ascertain the differences which
                    exist in the properties of chyle taken from different orders of animals, that we
                    might be able to trace the influence of different kinds of food upon this fluid.
                    Dr. Marcet and Dr. Prout have made comparative experiments with this view upon
                    the chyle taken from different dogs, some of which were fed exclusively on
                    animal, and others on vegetable food. The chyle in the former case was found to
                    be much whiter, contained more solid matter, and yielded more albumen than in
                    the latter. The general results of these experiments are contained in the
                    following table. Some faint traces of oily matter and of sugar of milk were
                    obtained, but in quantities too minute to be estimated.</p>

                <p>(363.) When both kinds of chyle were submitted to destructive distillation, the
                    vegetable chyle produced three times as much carbon as the animal chyle; the
                    latter, therefore, probably contained a greater proportion of hydrogen and
                    nitrogen. The chyle of a horse, derived of course from vegetable food alone, was
                    found by Vauquelin to be in a more animalized state than that which Dr. Marcet
                    procured from dogs. Dr. Prout, also, comparing the chyle as prepared from
                    vegetable and from animal food, found the former to contain more water and less
                    albuminous matter, while the fibrin and the salts were nearly the same in both,
                    and both exhibited traces of oily matter. On the whole, he states the difference
                    between the two kinds of chyle as being less considerable than had been observed
                    by Dr. Marcet. On tracing the successive changes which the chyle undergoes in
                    its passage along the vessels, he found that its resemblance to blood increases
                    in each of these successive stages of its progress.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aηηαls of Philosophy, xiii.

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Functions of Intestines.</hi></p>
                <p>(364.) At the part of the duodenum where the separation of the chyme into chyle
                    and residual matter takes place, the ducts from the pancreas and the liver
                    terminate, so that the chyme is subjected to the action of the secretions from
                    these two important glands, namely, <hi rend="italic">A∖c pancreatic juice,</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">bile,</hi> which slowly distil into the duodenum. Sir
                    Benjamin Brodie concluded, from experiments which he made upon living animals,
                    that the formation of chyle is the immediate result of the admixture of bile
                    with the chyme. In studying the changes which occur in this process, it will be
                    necessary first to examine the chemical properties of these secretions.</p>
                <p>(365.) The secretion from the pancreas, which flows into the intestine, and is
                    mixed with the digested food almost immediately on its exit from the stomach,
                    has, no doubt, some share in the process of chylification; but as it appears to
                    be exceedingly analogous, both in its sensible properties and chemical
                    composition, to the saliva, it is difficult to understand the mode of its
                    operation, independently of mere dilution. As it is found, however, to contain a
                    large quantity of albumen, a great portion of this substance may perhaps go to
                    the formation of chyle.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Properties of Pile.</hi></p>
                <p>(366.) The bile, a secretion prepared by the liver, is poured into the same part
                    of the intestine as the pancreatic juice. Its great importance in the animal
                    economy induced physiologists from the earliest times to pay much attention to
                    its chemical properties. Its analysis has been attempted by Boyle, Boerhaave,
                    and Baglivi, and more recently by Fourcroy, Cadet, Thenard, and Berzelius. But
                    it unfortunately happens, that in several important particulars the accounts
                    given by these different chemists do not accord with one another. These
                    discrepancies, as Mr. Brande observes, seem partly to arise from the extreme
                    facility with which chemical reagents react on this secretion, so that many of
                    the supposed <hi rend="italic">educts,</hi> or component parts which have been
                    enumerated by different chemists, are probably <hi rend="italic">products</hi>
                    of the different operations to which it has been submitted, or, at all events,
                    modifications of its true proximate elements.<note anchored="true"

                    Bile.</p></note> The bile of the ox, from the facility of preserving it, has
                    been that chiefly selected as the subject of experiment, and made the standard
                    of comparison with that of man and other animals.</p>
                <p>(367.) The substances to which this fluid owes its specific properties are,
                    according to Thenard, first, a peculiar inflammable resin, soluble in alcohol;
                    secondly, <hi rend="italic">picromel,</hi> a substance insoluble in water and in
                    alcohol, incapable of being crystallized, but forming, with resin and a small
                    portion of soda, a triple compound which is soluble in water; and it is in this
                    state that it exists in bile; and, thirdly, a yellow matter, distinct from
                    either of the former. In addition to the soda, which is combined with the resin
                    and picromel, bile contains a small quantity of phosphate, muriate and sulphate
                    of soda, as also phosphate of lime, and a minute trace of iron.</p>
                <p>(368.) Berzelius denies the correctness of the distinctions which Thenard has
                    endeavoured to draw between the three animal ingredients of bile above
                    mentioned. He gives to its characteristic principle, the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">biliary matter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and describes it as
                    being of a resinous nature, and precipitable by acids; the precipitate, or <hi
                    rend="italic">picromel,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">gallensteff</hi> of
                    Berzelius, being a compound of the acid employed and this biliary matter.
                    According to Thenard, human bile differs from that of the ox chiefly in
                    containing no picromel. Μ. Raspail considers bile to be essentially a
                    saponaceous substance, with a trace of soda.</p>
                <p>(369∙) The peculiar matter of <hi rend="italic">bile</hi> is found in the
                    residual matter, and does not enter into the composition of chyle. The chief
                    uses of the bile appear to be those of a chemical agent, promoting the
                    decomposition of the chyme, and also stimulating the secretion of mucus, and the
                    peristaltic motion of the intestines. Digestion may, however, go’ on to a
                    certain degree, and imperfectly, although the flow of bile into the intestines
                    be entirely prevented.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Functions of the Small Intestines.</hi></p>
                <p>(370.) Professors Tiedemann and Gmelin found, from their experiments, that the
                    upper part of the small intestines contains a considerable quantity of
                    uncombined acid, which is principally the acetic, mixed with a little butyric,
                    and rarely with the muriatic On proceeding to the lower parts of the small
                    intestines, they found the fluids had alkaline<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499303" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9303-0632"/> instead of acid properties.
                    This gradual disappearance of acid is probably in part the effect of its
                    neutralization by the free alkali contained in the bile. The following,
                    according to these physiologists, are the changes which take place in the
                    contents of the small intestines. The chyme, which is acid, mixes with the bile,
                    the pancreatic juice, and the mucous secretion from the coats of the intestine.
                    The muriatic acid combines with the soda of the bile, and at the same time
                    disengages from it the acetic or carbonic acids with which it had been
                    previously united. It also separates the mucus and cholesterine of the bile in
                    the form of white flakes, which have often been mistaken for chyle. The
                    pancreatic juice and the intestinal mncus contribute, in some unknown manner, to
                    this effect. Their chemical changes are promoted, and the contents of the
                    intestines successively propelled forwards along the whole tract of the canal,
                    by the peristaltic actions of the muscular coat, the effects of which are
                    analogous to those we have already described as taking place from a similar
                    action in the stomach.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Function of the Spleen.</hi></p>
                <p>(371.) It is probable that the spleen is an organ subservient to some purpose
                    connected with digestion; but what that precise purpose can be is a question
                    involved in great obscurity. A vast number of hypotheses and conjectures have
                    been hazarded on this subject; but they are, for the most part, devoid of even
                    the slightest probability. Any theory that assigns a very important office to
                    the spleen will be overturned by the fact, that in many animals the removal of
                    this organ, far from being fatal, or interrupting in any sensible manner the
                    continuance of the functions, seems to be borne with perfect impunity. Sir E.
                    Home has of late years advanced an opinion, for which there appears to be some
                    probability, namely, that the spleen serves as a receptacle for any superfluous
                    quantity of fluid taken into the stomach, and which, if not removed, might
                    interfere with the regular process of digestion. This excess he supposes is
                    transmitted directly to the spleen by communicating vessels, and lodged there
                    until it is gradually removed, partly by the veins, and partly by the
                    absorbents.</p>
                <p>(372.) It appears, indeed, from the observations of Bichat, Leuret, Lassaigne,
                    and others, that during digestion, and even after copious draughts of liquids,
                    the vessels of the spleen become exceedingly turgid with blood. Hence the
                    opinion has arisen, that the chief use of the spleen is to relieve the stomach
                    and intestines from that congestion which would otherwise take place in their
                    blood-vessels during digestion. The very vascular, approaching to a cellular
                    structure, of the spleen, which very readily admits of dilatation, would seem to
                    countenance this hypothesis.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Functions of the Large Intestines.</hi></p>
                <p>(373.) The functions of the large intestines are not confined to the mere
                    conveyance and expulsion of feculent matter, although the exact nature of the
                    changes which take place in their contents, and the subserviency of those
                    changes to the object of nutrition, have never been clearly determined. It would
                    appear that some important changes are effected in that enlarged portion of the
                    canal which is termed the <hi rend="italic">coecum,</hi> and which has by some
                    been regarded as a kind of supplementary stomach, in which fresh chyme is
                    formed, and fresh nutriment extracted from the materials that have passed
                    through the small intestines. This chymous product is supposed to be converted,
                    as in the former case, into a species of chyle, which, from containing a greater
                    proportion of oil, bears a resemblance to fat, and is in this state absorbed
                    from the inner surface of the great intestines. The capability of the great
                    intestines to extract nourishment from their contents is proved by the fact,
                    that nutritious matter injected into them has been known to support life for a
                    certain time, and also from their being able to effect the coagulation of
                    milk.</p>
                <p>(374.) A certain quantity of gas is almost constantly present in the intestinal
                    canal, and often also in the stomach. Magendie and Chevreul, who have analysed
                    these gases, found that what the stomach contained consisted of a mixture of
                    oxygen and nitrogen; but that in the lower intestines the oxygen had wholly
                    disappeared, as also a great part of the nitrogen, and that, instead of these,
                    the component parts of the gas were carbonic acid, hydrogen, carburetted
                    hydrogen, and a little sulphuretted hydrogen.</p>
                <p>(375.) The time required for the completion of the processes we have described as
                    taking place in the stomach, the small, and the large intestines, varies much,
                    not only according to the nature of the food, but according to the conditions of
                    the organs and of the general health, and to constitutional peculiarities. The
                    digestion of food in the stomach is usually considered as requiring three or
                    four hours. Animal food is longest retained, and undergoes the greatest
                    alteration in the stomach. Vegetable food, on the other hand, passes more
                    quickly and with less alteration, out of the stomach, and undergoes more change
                    in the intestines than animal food.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VIII.— <hi rend="italic">Lacteal
                    Absorption.</hi></p>
                <p>(376.) The chyle, which has been prepared in the duodenum, and along the whole
                    course of the small intestines, in the manner we have described, is received by
                    absorption into the lacteals, and by them conveyed to the thoracic duct, which
                    transmits it to the great veins in the vicinity of the heart. The lacteal
                    vessels may be considered as forming part of the great system of absorbents
                    which, as we shall afterwards find, are extensively distributed throughout the
                    body. We shall therefore reserve their description until a general account is
                    given of this system, in treating of the function of absorption generally.</p>
                <p>(377.) The discovery of the lacteals was made in the year 1622 by Aselli, in the
                    mesentery of a dog, which he had killed a few hours after the animal had made a
                    plentiful meal. Their termination in the thoracic duct was discovered by Pecquet
                    in 1651. They originate by open mouths from the villi of the inner coat of the
                    small intestines, in the form of very minute tubes, which soon unite into one
                    common vessel proceeding from each of the villi; and these vessels afterwards
                    joining successively form larger and larger branches, which ascend along the
                    mesentery, generally following the course of the veins, till they are collected
                    at the root of the mesentery, and, after passing through numerous glands,
                    terminate at the lower end of the thoracic duct, where there is an enlargement
                    which has been called the <hi rend="italic">receptaculum chyli.</hi></p>
                <p>(378.) Since uncertainty, however, still exists respecting the minute anatomy of
                    the lacteals, at their origin from the intestine, many anatomists having in vain
                    sought for the appearances above described. Their open orifices can only be seen
                    when the lacteals are distended with chyle, and they are more readily detected
                    in fishes where they have no valves, and where therefore the branches admit of
                    being injected from their trunks. Their coats, although thin and perfectly
                    transparent, yet possess considerable strength, so as to allow of being
                    distended by injections without being ruptured; and even afford decisive
                    indications of having the power of contracting and propelling forwards their
                    contents. The utility of the numerous valves with which they are provided in
                    every part of their course, in preventing any retrograde motion of the fluid
                    they transmit, is sufficiently obvious.</p>
                <p>(379∙) The power by which the chyle is made to enter the open orifices of the
                    lacteals, is by no means easily determined. It has been referred generally to
                    capillary attraction. But the application of the laws which govern the ascent of
                    fluids in rigid inorganic tubes, to the elastic vessels of the living system, is
                    liable to much fallacy. The phenomena appear to indicate that the lacteals
                    exercise, in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499316"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9316-0633"/>cxclusiveabsorption of chyle, a power of selection
                    somewhat analogous to that of chemical or electric attraction. It has been
                    supposed, accordingly, that there is a specific attraction between chyle and the
                    lacteal vessels, which causes that fluid to enter into them; while other fluids
                    which are presented to the same vessels are rejected. This obscure subject has
                    given rise to various speculations, which are more curious and ingenious than
                    leading to any satisfactory conclusion. It is now generally agreed among
                    physiologists, that the power which the lacteals possess of admitting the
                    absorption of extraneous substances, if it exist at all, is exceedingly limited,
                    and is exerted only on rare occasions.</p>
                <p>Various experiments made on animals fully warrant the conclusion, that by far the
                    greater portion of the nutritive matter imparted to the system is conveyed into
                    the bloodvessels through the channels we have been describing, namely, the
                    lacteals and the thoracic duct. On the other hand, there appears to be evidence
                    that a large portion of the thinner fluids received into the stomach passes at
                    once into the veins by the immediate absorption of these veins: for they always
                    disappear rapidly from the stomach, in whatever quantity they are introduced. It
                    is probable also, that some admixture of the contents of the lacteals with those
                    of the blood-vessels takes place in the mesenteric glands, and that part of the
                    chyle finds its way into the mesenteric veins by more direct channels than that
                    of the general circulation.</p>
                <p>(380.) An elaborate series of experiments was undertaken by Tiedemann and Gmelin,
                    with a view to ascertain whether there exists any direct communication between
                    the digestive cavities and the blood-vessels, exclusive of the known channel
                    through the lacteals and thoracic duct. The experiments consisted in mixing with
                    the food of certain animals various odorous, colouring, and saline materials,
                    the presence of which might be easily detected by their appearance, odour, and
                    other sensible or chemical properties; and in comparing, after a proper interval
                    of time, the state of the chyle with that of the blood in the mesenteric veins.
                    The odorous substances employed were camphor, musk, alcohol, oil of turpentine,
                    and assafcetida. These were generally discovered to have found their way into
                    the system, by their being detected in venous blood, in the urine, but not in
                    the chyle. The colouring matters were sap-green, gamboge, madder, rhubarb,
                    alkanet, and litmus; these appeared, for the most part, to be carried off
                    without being absorbed; while the salts, namely potass, sulphuro-prussiate of
                    potass, muriate of barytes, muriate and sulphate of soda, acetate of lead and of
                    mercury, and prussiate of mercury, were less uniform in their course. A
                    considerable portion of them seemed to be rejected, while many of them were
                    found in the urine, several in the venous blood, and a very few only in the
                    chyle. Hence the authors conclude, that the odorous and colouring substances
                    never pass into the lacteals, and that saline bodies do so occasionally only, or
                    perhaps incidentally; the whole of them are, however, found in the secretions,
                    and they must, therefore, have entered into the circulation by some other
                    channel than the lacteals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>(381.) There appears not, as far as we know, to be any thing specific in the
                    action of the thoracic duct, which, as it appears, transmits its contents into
                    the subclavian vein, as it receives it from the absorbents.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IX.— <hi rend="italic">Sanguification.</hi></p>
                <p>(382.) The chyle consists, as we have seen, of alimentary matter, reduced to a
                    certain state, which may be regarded as the first stage of animalization, having
                    already made a near approach to the nature of that blood into which it is
                    afterwards to be converted. This conversion of chyle into blood takes place
                    after its introduction into the sanguiferous system of vessels, and while it
                    passes round in the course of circulation. During this course, it necessarily
                    traverses the minute vessels of the lungs, where it is subjected to the chemical
                    action of atmospheric air, and its constituents gradually acquire the
                    characteristic properties which they possess as the ingredients of the blood.
                    The chief changes experienced are, first, that the fibrin of the chyle obtains a
                    greater cohesive tendency, and a power of spontaneous coagulation; and,
                    secondly, that the white globules of the chyle receive an addition of red
                    colouring matter, and are invested with an external vesicle, by which their size
                    is increased. But in order correctly to estimate their changes, it will be
                    necessary to take a general review of the chemical and other physical properties
                    of the blood.</p>
                <p>(383.) The nature and properties of the blood have attracted a very large share
                    of the attention of physiologists in all ages; and immense labour has been
                    devoted to the investigation of its chemical constitution.</p>
                <p>(384.) When examined immediately on its being drawn from the vessels, the blood
                    appears as a smooth and homogeneous fluid, of an unctuous adhesive consistence,
                    of a slightly saline taste, and of a specific gravity somewhat exceeding that of
                    water. It exhales a vapour which has a peculiar smell; but which, when condensed
                    and collected, affords a liquor not differing sensibly from water. Much
                    importance was formerly ascribed to this vapour, which was dignified with the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Halitus.</hi> As the blood does not preserve the same
                    consistence at different times, its density is liable to variation. Haller
                    states the specific gravity of human blood to be at a medium, 1.0527. Dr. Milne
                    Edwards says that it varies from 1.052 to 1.057∙ Dr. Davy states that the
                    specific gravity of arterial blood is 1.049, and of venous blood, 1.051.
                    Although it appears homogeneous, it is found by microscopical examination to
                    contain a large proportion of minute globular particles, diffused through a
                    liquid.</p>
                <p>(385.) In a few minutes after its removal from the body, a thin film appears on
                    the surface, and after a short time, which on an average is about seven minutes,
                    the whole mass becomes cohesive, and what is termed its <hi rend="italic"
                    >coagulation</hi> has taken place. After it has remained for some time in this
                    gelatinous state, a separation of the mass into two distinct parts gradually
                    takes place. A yellowish liquid oozes out from beneath the surface of the mass,
                    and at length the whole is resolved into a clot, or solid portion of a dark red
                    colour, which is called the <hi rend="italic">crassamentum,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">cruor,</hi> and consists chiefly of fibrin, and a yellowish
                    liquid, called the <hi rend="italic">serum.</hi> The proportion between these
                    two parts has been variously estimated; and does not indeed admit of accurate
                    determination, from its being variable in itself under different circumstances.
                    On an average, however, it may be stated, that the crassamentum amounts to about
                    one-third of the weight of the serum; Dr. Scudamore and Mr. Wood found, however,
                    by taking the mean of twelve experiments, that the crassamentum amounted to
                    53.307 per cent. The period at which coagulation begins and is completed, varies
                    not only with the condition of the blood itself, but also with the circumstances
                    in which it is placed. It commences sooner as the vessel is more shallow; but on
                    an average it may be said to begin in about three or four minutes, and to be
                    completed in seven or eight. But the contraction of the coagulum continues for a
                    long time after, and sometimes does not cease till the fourth day. It does not
                    appear that the specific gravity of the blood is sensibly altered during its
                    coagulation.</p>
                <p>(386.) Great difference of opinion has existed as to the occurrence of a change
                    of temperature during this process of coagulation. The analogy of other
                    instances in which the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499329"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9329-0634"/>conversion of a fluid into a solid is accompanied
                    with the evolution of heat, has induced many to think that a similar effect
                    attends the coagulation of the blood. Fourcroy stated, that a rise of
                    temperature actually takes place; but Hunter, on the contrary, adduced facts
                    leading to an opposite conclusion. The result obtained by Fourcroy has,however,
                    been confirmed by the experiments of Dr. Gordon, who found that the coagulating
                    portion of a quantity of blood was warmer than the rest by about six degrees. On
                    repeating the experiment on blood drawn from a patient labouring under
                    inflammatory fever, the rise of the thermometer was no less than twelve degrees.
                    Subsequent researches by Dr. John Davy, have, however, thrown considerable doubt
                    upon the accuracy of the above conclusion, by pointing out some sources of
                    fallacy in the investigation of Dr. Gordon. Dr. Scudamore, on the other hand,
                    found that heat was produced during coagulation, but to a less degree. Vogel and
                    Brande have ascertained that carbonic acid gas is disengaged; and this appeared
                    to happen to an unusual extent in blood drawn soon after a meal.</p>
                <p>(387.) The coagulation of the blood is a phenomenon not strictly analagous to any
                    other with which we are acquainted, and has never been satisfactorily explained.
                    The operation of external agents upon it is not so well marked as to enable us
                    to refer it to any general operation of the physical properties of matter.
                    Moderate differences of temperature produce scarcely any perceptible difference
                    in the tendency which the blood has to coagulate. Within the range of from 67°
                    to 105°, blood coagulates in the same time as at the usual temperature of 98°.
                    Sir Humphry Davy found that no difference in this respect takes place when blood
                    is exposed to nitrogen, nitrous, nitrous oxide, carbonic acid, carborated
                    hydrogen gases, or atmospheric air, although the contrary had been asserted by
                    Luzuriaga. Blood, indeed, coagulates more quickly when placed in a receiver from
                    which the air is rapidly exhausted, when slowly drawn into a shallow vessel, or
                    when exposed to atmospheric air, at a temperature of 120°. This process is
                    retarded by a very low temperature. Mr. Hewson placed blood in oil at a
                    temperature of 38°; at the expiration of six hours it continued fluid; but being
                    then allowed to attain a warmer temperature, it became coagulated in twenty-five
                    minutes. The same physiologist froze a portion of blood confined by ligatures in
                    the jugular vein of a rabbit; when thawed, the blood became liquified, and
                    coagulated. Admixture with certain neutral salts prevented altogether
                    coagulation from taking place. This happened when half an ounce of sulphate of
                    soda was mixed with six ounces of fresh blood; but on the addition of a double
                    quantity of water coagulation took place. Dr. Turner states that the coagulation
                    of the blood is prevented by the admixture of saturated solutions of chloride of
                    sodium, hydrochlorate of ammonia, nitre, and potass; while, on the contrary,
                    alum, and the sulphates of the oxides of zinc and copper, promote coagulation.
                    Blood coagulates slowly when drawn quickly into a deep vessel, or when detained
                    at rest in the vein of a living animal between two ligatures. In the latter
                    case, Mr. Hewson found the blood two-thirds fluid after the lapse of three hours
                    and a quarter. When the experiment was varied by blowing air into the vein, the
                    blood was found to have coagulated in a quarter of an hour. Blood extravasated
                    through the rupture of vessels, and retained in the cavities of the body, often
                    preserves its fluidity for a very considerable time. If the causes which are
                    capable of postponing coagulation have continued to operate beyond a certain
                    period, the blood is prevented from coagulating; thus recent blood remains
                    permanently fluid if it be constantly stirred for some minutes. It has been
                    proved by the experiments of Hewson, Hunter, Deyeux, and Parmentier, that the
                    coagulation of blood is not entirely prevented by diluting it with water; but
                    Dr. Crawford<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On Animal
                    Heat, p. 248.</p></note> showed that this process is retarded for several hours
                    by the admixture of blood with twelve times its bulk of water.</p>
                <p>(388.) There are many conditions of the living system that have a prodigious
                    influence on the tendency of the blood to coagulate, and that operate in a
                    manner which it is impossible to explain. Many causes of sudden death, as a blow
                    upon the stomach, or violent injury to the brain; lightning and electricity;
                    several animal poisons, as that of venemous serpents; narcotic vegetable
                    principles, as cyanogen; also excessive exercise, or even violent mental
                    emotions, when they produce the sudden extinction of life, prevent the usual
                    coagulation of the blood from taking place.</p>
                <p>(389∙) The doctrine maintained by Hunter, that the blood possesses life, and that
                    its coagulation is one of the acts of this living principle, is but little
                    calculated to remove the difficulty; for the operation of this principle in
                    producing coagulation would still be as much in need of explanation as the
                    phenomenon itself, which it professes to account for. We must, in the present
                    imperfect state of our knowledge, content ourselves with referring this
                    phenomenon to an inherent disposition which the fibrin possesses to assume the
                    solid form, when no counteracting cause is present. Dr. Bostock,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Physiology, p.
                    271.</p></note> observes, that as it is gradually added to the blood particle by
                    particle, while this fluid is in a state of agitation in the vessels, it has no
                    opportunity of concreting; but when it is suffered to lie at rest, either within
                    or without the vessels, it is then able to exercise its natural tendency.</p>
                <p>(390.) We have already stated that the crassamentum consists chiefly of fibrin;
                    but it owes its dark colour to the presence of what are called the red particles
                    of the blood, and which are entangled in it during its coagulation. The serum,
                    which is the part of the blood that remains fluid after the coagulation of the

                <p>(391.) The crassamentum is a mass of a soft consistence, which easily bears
                    cutting with a knife. Its mean specific gravity is about 1∙245. By long
                    continued ablution in water, it may be freed from the red particles which it
                    contains, and which are soluble in water. This may conveniently be effected by
                    enclosing the crassamentum in a linen bag, immersing it repeatedly in water, and
                    at the same time pressing it gently; or by allowing a stream of water to fall
                    upon it, till the water runs off colourless. There remains a white, solid,
                    fibrous, and elastic substance, which has all the properties of fibrin, and is
                    almost exactly similar to the basis of muscular flesh obtained by long boiling.
                    It may also be procured directly from recent blood, by stirring it, as it flows
                    from the vessel, with a bunch of twigs; or receiving it into a bottle, and
                    shaking it during its coagulation. When formed under these circumstances, it
                    exhibits a fibrous appearance, and the whole is converted into an irregular
                    net-work of dense fibres. Fibrin was formerly known under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">coagulable lymph,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gluten.</hi></p>
                <p>(392.) The <hi rend="italic">red particles</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >globules,</hi> contained in the blood, and enveloped in the fibrin during its
                    coagulation, have long attracted the attention of physiologists, from the
                    irregularity of their appearance, and the importance which was supposed to
                    attach to them. The first notice which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499342"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9342-0635"/>we find of them occurs in the writings of
                    Malpighi, soon after the introduction of the use of the microscope. They were
                    soon afterwards examined with great care and minuteness by the indefatigable
                    Lecuwenhoek, whose name stands foremost among those who made observations with
                    this instrument. They soon became the subject of much speculation, and laid the
                    foundation of many fanciful hypotheses which were current at the time, but are
                    now consigned to deserved neglect. Lecuwenhoek himself was led by his
                    imagination to the belief that these red globules were each composed of a series
                    of globular bodies of different orders descending in regular gradations. He
                    supposed each to be made up of six particles of serum; each particle of serum of
                    six particles of lymph, and so on in succession. This strange hypothesis,
                    visionary as it now appears, was so accordant with the prevailing taste for
                    mathematical disquisitions, that it was very generally adopted, and held a
                    powerful sway over the opinions and reasonings of the physicians of that age. It
                    forms a leading feature in the pathological speculations of Boerhaave; and
                    although its futility was sufficiently exposed by Lancisi and Senae, it
                    maintained its ground even to the time of Haller.</p>
                <p>(393.) But a better spirit began at length to prevail; the illusive dreams of
                    fancy were superseded by the sober and attentive observation of nature; and
                    truth was sought by the judicious cultivation of experimental inquiry, the only
                    legitimate path by which it can be approached. About the middle of the
                    eighteenth century, the Abbe de la Torré, employing microscopes of considerable
                    power, obtained the appearance of flattened annular bodies, with a perforation
                    in the centre. Hewson, who observed them with still greater attention to
                    accuracy, states them to be hollow vesicles of a flattened shape, and containing
                    a smaller, solid, and spherical particle, which was freely moveable within them,
                    or, as he compares it, “like a pea in a bladder.” He asserted, that by adding
                    water, these particles swell out into a globular shape, and afterwards burst and
                    disappear, in consequence of their being dissolved in the water; but if
                    moistened with an aqueous solution of any neutral salt, they preserve their
                    natural flat shape. Cavallo describes them as much more irregular in their form
                    than Hewson represented them; and he was led from his observations to the
                    conclusion that the appearance either of a perforation, or of a central
                    particle, is in realityan optical deception, arising from the refraction of the
                    light by which the objects are viewed, as it passes through the convex surfaces
                    of the globules. He also endeavours to explain the appearance which led Hewson
                    to believe that the central nucleus is moveable within the external vesicle, by
                    some apparent change in the position of the luminous image, in consequence of
                    accidental variations in the direction in which the light is viewed. Very small
                    artificial globules of solid glass which he constructed for the purpose,
                    presented under the microscope very nearly the same appearances as the globules
                    of the biood; and hence he concluded, that the latter, notwithstanding these
                    appearances, were nearly globular and composed of a uniform material.</p>
                <p>(394.) Notwithstanding the ingenuity displayed in this reasoning, the more
                    profound examination which the subject has received from Dr. Young, induces us
                    to revert, to a certain extent, to the opinion of Hewson. He observes that in
                    such examinations it is only necessary to employ a full and unlimited light, in
                    order to obtain a very distinct outline of what appears manifestly to be a very
                    simple substance. But we should remember that where the substances to be
                    examined are perfectly transparent, it is only in a confined and diversified
                    light that we can gain a correct idea of their structure. The eye is best
                    prepared for the investigation by beginning with the blood of a skate, of which
                    the particles are, from their greater size, so conspicuous, and of so
                    unequivocal a form, as at once to set aside the idea of a simple homogeneous
                    substance. They are oval and depressed, like an almond, but less pointed, and a
                    little flatter. Each of them contains a round nucleus which is wholly
                    independent in its appearance of the figure of the whole disc, being sometimes a
                    little irregular in its form, seldom deviating from its central situation, but
                    often remaining distinctly visible, whilst the oval part is scarcely
                    perceptible. This nucleus is about the size of a whole particle of human blood,
                    the whole oval being about twice as wide, and not quite three times as long. The
                    nucleus is very transparent, and forms a distinct image of any large object
                    which intercepts a part of the light by which it is seen, but exhibits no
                    inequalities of light and shade that could lead to any mistake respecting its
                    form. But if we place some particles of human blood under similar circumstances,
                    near the confines of light and shade, although they are little, if at all less
                    transparent, we immediately see an annular shade on the disc, which is most
                    marked on the side of the centre on which the marginal part appears the
                    brightest, and consequently indicates a depression in the centre, which De la
                    Torre mistook for a perforation. It is most observable when the drop is dying
                    away, so that the particles rest on the glass; and when a smaller particle is
                    viewed, it has merely a dark central spot, without any lighter central space.
                    Dr. Monro had represented the globules of the blood as being of an exceedingly
                    flattened shape, or, as he expresses it, “as flat as a guinea.” But Dr. Young
                    never saw them of this shape, although he states their axis as being sometimes
                    not more than one-third, or one-fourth of their greatest diameter. He also
                    states that they do not seem, as Hewson asserted, to have their dimensions much
                    affected by the fluid in which they are suspended, since they may easily be
                    spread thin on glass, and dried without much change in their magnitude, at least
                    in the direction of the surface to which they adhere; and they remain distinct
                    as long as the access of moist air is completely excluded. When they have been
                    kept for some time in water, and a little solution of salt is added, their form
                    and structure, as Hewson observed, are more easily examined, and appear to
                    resemble those of a soft substance, with a denser nucleus; but the comparison
                    which he makes of their being like a pea in a bladder, Dr. Young thinks is quite
                    inapplicable.</p>
                <p>(395.) It has commonly been asserted, and especially by Hewson, that these
                    particles are readily soluble in water; but Dr. Young has shewn that this
                    opinion is erroneous, and depends partly on their passing readily through the
                    filtering paper, a circumstance observed by Berzelius, and partly on the
                    extraction of a great part of their colouring matter, together with which they
                    lose much of their specific gravity, so that instead of subsiding, they are
                    generally suspended in the fluid. Their presence may still, however, be detected
                    by a careful examination; and they seem in this state to have recovered in some
                    measure their original form, which they had lost when first immersed in the
                    water. A curious observation on the influence of circumstances on the form of
                    the globules, has been made by Mr. Bauer. He remarks that in the skate they are
                    oval during the life of the animal, but become flattened after its death. This
                    circumstance may perhaps tend to reconcile some of the discordant statements
                    which have been made on this subject.</p>
                <p>(396·) The size of the red globules has also been very differently estimated by
                    different observers. These discrepancies receive some explanation by the
                    circumstance which Dr. Milne Edwards appears to have established, of the
                    globules differing considerably in their size in the same individual.<note

                    Blood.</p></note> The most accurate measurements appear to be those of Dr.
                    Young, and of Captain Kater, who both agree <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499355"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9355-0636"/>that the particles of human blood are between the
                    four-thousandth and the six-thousandth of an inch in their diameter; and they
                    may therefore be taken at a medium at the five-thousandth of an inch. Mr. Bauer
                    has stated them to be considerably larger, even as much as the one
                    thousand-seven-hundredth of an inch in their entire state, and that the central
                    part is the two-thousandth of an inch in diameter. But the observations of Dr.
                    Young are more probably correct, from their coincidence with those of Captain
                    Kater, which were conducted in a different manner.</p>
                <p>(397.) The difficulty of procuring the red particles in a separate state, unmixed
                    with serum, is so great as to preclude us from obtaining any distinct knowledge
                    of their chemical composition and properties. The colouring matter of the blood
                    has been termed <hi rend="italic">hematine,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >hernatosine.</hi> But according to Μ. Lecanu, the substance usually termed
                    hematine is in reality a combination of albumen and the pure colouring matter of
                    the blood, which he proposes to designate <hi rend="italic">globuline.</hi>
                    Although it appears from Dr. Young’s observations, that the globules themselves
                    do not dissolve in water, yet they impart to it the whole of their colouring
                    matter. The watery solution turns syrup of violets green; and after some time
                    deposits a flocculent precipitate, probably from the coagulation of albumen, the
                    presence of which is indicated also by the effect of boiling the solution. Hence
                    it has been concluded that the colouring matter consists of albumen, dissolved
                    by an excess of pure soda. When evaporated and calcined in <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> crucible, a residuum is obtained, amounting to about one-thousandth of
                    the weight of solid matter, and composed, according to Fourcroy and Vauquelin,
                    chiefly of subphosphate of iron.</p>
                <p>(398.) Berzelius,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>MedicoChirurgical Transactions, vol. iii p. 215.</p></note> who has made
                    minute inquiry into this subject, informs us that the colouring matter of the
                    blood, separated from the other part, leaves one-eightieth of an incombustible
                    residuum, of which rather more than one-half is an oxide of iron. The existence
                    of iron in the blood was first discovered by Menghini; but its amount was much
                    over-rated both by himself and many of the earlier chemists who succeeded him.
                    It is difficult to determine in what state this iron exists in the blood. It
                    would appear not to be in the state of any of the known salts of this metal;
                    because before the blood has been calcined, the iron escapes detection by any of
                    the tests which usually indicate its presence in solutions; and yet the
                    solubility of the colouring matter in the serum would, on the other hand, appear
                    to support the opinion of its possessing saline properties. Berzelius has been
                    able to deduce from his numerous experiments on this point, merely the negative
                    conclusion, that no salt of iron which he tried was capable of being combined
                    with the serum, so as to produce a compound similar to the colouring matter of
                    the blood; thus refuting the alleged synthetic proof adduced by Fourcroy, who
                    had stated that subphospfiate of iron dissolves in albumen, and imparts to it a
                    bright red colour, resembling that of blood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Sgstlme de Connais. Chymiques, vol. ix p. 207,

                <p>(399∙) It has long been the prevailing opinion that the blood derives its red
                    colour from the iron it contains; but the truth of this opinion has been called
                    in question by many writers of high authority, and in particular by Dr.
                    Wells<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans, for
                    1797, p. 410.</p></note> and by Mr. Brande.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans, for 1812, p. SO.</p></note> The experiments of
                    Dr. Wells, however, as is remarked by Dr. Bostock, seem only to prove that the
                    colour of the blood is not occasioned by any salt of iron, or by iron in such a
                    state as to be affected by the ordinary tests. Mr. Brande procured the colouring
                    matter from venous blood in a detached state, by removing the fibrin from it by
                    agitation while it was coagulating, and suffering the red globules to subside in
                    the serum, from which they could be obtained in a concentrated form. Examining
                    this portion by means of different reagents, he arrived at the conclusion, that
                    the colouring principle of the blood is an animal sub- ' stance of a peculiar
                    nature, susceptible, like the colouring matter from vegetables, of uniting with
                    bases, or mordants, and therefore admitting of being applied in the art of
                    dyeing. The most effectual mordants for the colouring matter of the blood are
                    the salts of mercury, especially the nitrate and bichloride, or corrosive
                    sublimate. On examining the colouring matter distinct from the crassamentum, Mr
                    Brande did not discover a greater proportion of iron than exists in the other
                    principles of blood. These results, in as far as they relate to the quantity of
                    iron, are at variance with the later and apparently more elaborate experiments
                    of Berzelius, who still maintains that the colouring matter of the blood
                    contains iron, not indeed discoverable by reagents, but decisively proved to
                    exist in its ashes. In every respect, except in containing that metal, the
                    colouring matter agrees with fibrin and albumen; and he seems disposed to
                    believe that its colour, though not depending on the presence merely of an oxide
                    of iron, may be produced by a compound of which the oxide is an essential
                    part.</p>
                <p>Vauquelin’s experiments<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Annales de Chimie et de Physique, i. 9.</p></note> may in some respects be
                    deemed to corroborate those pf Brande, inasmuch as they show that iron cannot be
                    detected by liquid tests in solutions of the colouring matter; but they at the
                    same time show that this metal is readily detected by these tests in the fluid
                    from which the colouring matter has subsided.</p>
                <p>(400.) The changes in the colour of the blood produced by its exposure to
                    different gases, are probably owing to their action on the red globules.
                    Arterial blood is blackened, and venous blood rendered darker, by nitrogen, or
                    carbonic acid gases; but its bright florid hue is restored by exposure to oxygen
                    gas. We shall have occasion to revert to this subject in treating of
                    respiration.</p>
                <p>(401.) Besides the ordinary red globules, others of a much smaller size have been
                    detected by Mr. Bauer floating in the serum, and even apparently generated while
                    the fluid is under examination. To these Sir Everard Home gave the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">lymph globules.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ibid for 1819, p. 2.</p></note></p>
                <p>(402.) The serum of the blood, or the fluid part which is left after the
                    separation of the crassamentum, is a transparent and apparently homogeneous
                    liquid, of a yellowish and sometimes greenish colour, of a saline taste, and
                    adhesive consistence. Its specific gravity is variable, but maybe taken, on an
                    average, at about 1∙025. When exposed to a temperature of 160°, the whole is
                    converted into a firm white mass, perfectly analogous to the white of an egg
                    which has been hardened by boiling. It may, in fact, be regarded as identical
                    with coagulated albumen, the chemical properties of which we have already
                    described.</p>
                <p>(403.) Although the whole of the mass of serum appears to be rendered solid by
                    the process of coagulation, yet if this coagulum be cut into slices, and
                    subjected to gentle pressure, or if it be placed on the mouth of a funnel, a
                    small quantity of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> slightly opaque liquor drains from
                    it, which is called the <hi rend="italic">serosity.</hi> It has a saline taste,
                    and a peculiar odour, and consists of several ingredients. Its existence as a
                    substance distinct from the albumen was first pointed out by Dr. Butt in 1760,
                    and its properties were farther examined by Dr. Cullen, who speaks of it as a
                    solution of fibrin in water. Hcwson believed it to be of a mucous nature.
                    Parmentier and Deyeux published, in 1790, an elaborate set of experiments which
                    they made upon it, from which they drew the conclusion, that the animal
                    substance contained in the scrosity was gelatin. This statement seemed so
                    satisfactory, from the apparent accuracy of the investigation, that it was
                    generally acquiesced in. Not only was jelly con-</p>

                <p>sidered as one of the constituents of the blood, but means were pointed out for
                    ascertaining its proportion; and its supposed agency in the economy was made the
                    foundation of many physiological speculations. But Dr. Bostock has since proved
                    that this opinion is not founded in fact. He was unable to detect the smallest
                    quantity of jelly either in the serosity of the blood, or in any other of the
                    albuminous fluids. In this conclusion he is fully supported by the testimonies
                    of Berzelius, Marcet, and Brande.</p>
                <p>(404.) It may be inferred from the experiments of Mr. Brande, that serosity
                    consists of a small quantity of albumen, still retained in solution by a large
                    proportion of alkali. According to Berzelius, the serosity contains no sulphuric
                    acid, and only a vestige of the phosphoric, and consists chiefly of water, with
                    some pure soda holding albumen in solution, of muriates of soda and of potass,
                    of lactate of soda, and a peculiar animal matter which always accompanies the
                    lactate. Dr. Bostock found the amount of solid contents to vary from the
                    forty-sixth to the seventieth part of its weight, or, on an average, about the
                    fiftieth. It has been a matter of dispute which of the mineral alkalies exists
                    in serum in an uncombined form. Dr. Pcarson maintained that it was potass; but
                    Drs. Bostock, ]∖Jarcet, and Berzelius, with much greater appearance of
                    correctness, allege that it is soda.</p>
                <p>(405.) The component parts of human serum, according to the analysis of Dr.
                    Marcet, are—</p>
                <p>(406.) This analysis coincides very nearly with that of Berzelius, who considers
                    the substance termed by Dr Marcet <hi rend="italic">muco-extractive matter</hi>
                    to be impure lactate of soda. But Dr. Bostock is led by his experiments to the
                    conclusion, that a peculiar animal substance exists in the serosity, not
                    coagulable by heat, or by any other means; not affected by corrosive sublimate,
                    or by tannin, which are the appropriate tests of albumen and of jelly
                    respectively, but copiously precipitated by muriate of tin, and still more
                    readily by the acetate of lead; and he thinks this substance is quite
                    independent of the lactate of soda, which may exist at the same time in the
                    blood.</p>
                <p>(407.) Wienholt discovered that the serosity contained a small quantity of the
                    peculiar substance which exists in greatest abundance in the flesh of animals,
                    and was first noticed as a distinct proximate principle by Rouelle. It was
                    subsequently termed <hi rend="italic">ozmazome</hi> by Thenard, who examined its
                    properties more minutely. This substance is of a yellowish brown colour; it is
                    soluble both in water and in alcohol, and is precipitated by infusion of
                    nutgalls, nitrate of mercury, and by the acetate and nitrate of lead. It is
                    still a matter of uncertainty what connexion exists between this substance and
                    the muco-extractive matter above mentioned. There is also another proximate
                    principle, namely, <hi rend="italic">urea,</hi> of which we shall afterwards
                    have occasion to speak, which is found in small quantity in the blood, when that
                    fluid is in its natural state, but which is abundantly found in the blood of
                    animals from which the kidneys have been removed. Besides Üiese, Dr. B.
                    Babington discovered the presence in the blood of an oily substance, separable
                    from the other parts by means of ether. Lecanu, in addition to this oily matter,
                    found a crystallizable fatty matter in the blood; and similar observations have
                    been made by Chevreul. Manganese is said to have been detected in the blood by
                    Wurzer.</p>
                <p>Μ. Boudet has also lately discovered a new substance in die serum, which he has
                    termed <hi rend="italic">uroline.</hi> This is a white, slightly opalescent
                    substance, fusible at 94° Fahrenheit, not forming an emulsion with water,
                    soluble in alcohol, not saponh fiable, and apparently containing nitrogen.</p>

                    Circulation.</hi></p>
                <p>(408.) The object of the function of circulation is twofold. The first is to
                    distribute to all the organs that due share of nutritive fluid which they
                    require for the performance of their respective offices, for the maintenance of
                    their temperature, and for nutrition, and to keep up a constant supply of this
                    fluid. The second, and no less important object, is to expose every portion in
                    succession of this fluid, which is the blood, to the influence of atmospheric
                    air in an organ appropriated to this particular purpose; the continual renewal
                    of the action of the oxygen contained in the air upon the blood, being necessary
                    for the maintenance of its salutary qualities, and indispensable to the
                    preservation of life. The organs in which this process is carried on are the <hi
                    rend="italic">lungs</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the function by which it is
                    accomplished is <hi rend="italic">respiration.</hi> The great agent for the
                    distribution of the blood both generally to the organs of the body, and
                    specially to the lungs, is the <hi rend="italic">heart</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the pipes through which it is conveyed to those parts are the <hi
                    rend="italic">arteries</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> those through which it is
                    brought back to the heart, the <hi rend="italic">veins.</hi> A set of finer
                    vessels interposed between the minute extremities of the arteries, jmd the
                    minute beginnings of the veins, are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >capillaries.</hi> The structure and distribution of all these parts, have
                    already been described in the treatise on <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy,</hi> to
                    which we of course refer for the descriptive details. The following brief
                    recapitulation, however, of the structure of the heart will assist us in
                    understanding the physiology of its action.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Cardiac Apparatus.</hi></p>
                <p>(409∙) The heart is a hollow muscle, of a conical shape, occupying the central
                    and inferior part of the cavity of the thorax, having its <hi rend="italic"
                    >basis</hi> turned towards the right side, and its point or <hi rend="italic"
                    >apex</hi> towards the left, nearly opposite to the space between the sixth and
                    seventh ribs, lts lower surface is somewhat flattened, where it lies upon the
                    diaphragm. Its basis, with which the great vessels are connected, is covered
                    with fat. The whole heart, and the roots of the large blood-vessels at its
                    basis, are protected by a general investment of membrane, which is a reflected
                    production of an extended serous membrane, forming a cavity for its reception,
                    and for allowing it considerable freedom of motion. This membrane, which is
                    remarkable for its strength, is called the <hi rend="italic">pericardium,</hi>
                    and is situated between the laminae of the mediastinum, which are separated in
                    order to contain it.</p>
                <p>(410.) The heart is principally made up of muscular fibres, the course of which
                    is extremely complex; some extending longitudinally from the basis to the apex,
                    others taking an oblique or spiral course; and a third running in a more
                    transverse direction. There are two considerable cavities, called <hi
                    rend="italic">ventricles,</hi> distinguished, according to their situation, into
                    the right and left ventricle. The former has also been called, in reference to
                    its functions, the <hi rend="italic">pulmonic,</hi> and the latter the <hi
                    rend="italic">systemic</hi> ventricle. They are separated by a strong and thick
                    partition, called the <hi rend="italic">septum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ventriculorum,</hi> which is composed of fleshy and tendinous fibres. Attached
                    to these, at the basis of the heart, are two hollow and fleshy projecting
                    appendages, called the <hi rend="italic">auricles,</hi> the cavities of which
                    are also separated from each other by a partition, distinguished by the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">septum auriculorum,</hi> and they open into those of the
                    ventricles. The right auricle, which, together with the right ventricle, is
                    placed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499381" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9381-0638"/>more in
                    front, receives the blood from the venae cavae, and transmits it to the right
                    ventricle, by which it is propelled into the trunk of the pulmonary artery. The
                    left auricle, in like manner, collects the blood from the four trunks of the
                    pulmonary veins, and transfers it into the left ventricle, by which it is
                    forcibly driven into the aorta, or main trunk of the arterial system of the body
                    at large The membrane which lines the cavities of the heart, and the great
                    vessels just mentioned, is produced so as to form valves at the two orifices of
                    both the ventricles; that is, where the auricles open into them, and also at the
                    origin of the arterial trunks which arise from the ventricles. The valves placed
                    between the right auricle and ventricle, are usually three in number, and are
                    called <hi rend="italic">valvulae</hi><hi rend="italic">tricuspides</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but in the left ventricle there are only two, and these are
                    named the <hi rend="italic">valvulae</hi><hi rend="italic">mitrales.</hi> The
                    membranes which form these valves are attached so as to project somewhat forward
                    in each of these cavities, and are connected with tendinous strings, called <hi
                    rend="italic">chordae tendineae,</hi> which arise from detached and projecting
                    portions of the muscular substance of the heart, named from their cylindrical
                    form, <hi rend="italic">earneae columnae.</hi></p>
                <p>(411.) The valves at the origin both of the pulmonary artery and of the aorta,
                    are three in number, and are called the <hi rend="italic">valvulae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">semilunares,</hi> from their semicircular figure; their
                    convexities are turned towards the ventricle; they are concave next to the
                    cavity of the artery; and in the middle of their loose edge is found a small
                    hard triangular substance called <hi rend="italic">corpus aurantianum,</hi> and
                    sometimes <hi rend="italic">corpusculum</hi><hi rend="italic">Morgagni,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">sesamoideum.</hi> When these valves are made to approach each
                    other, by the pressure of the blood in the artery in the direction of the
                    ventricle, they unite so as completely to clo <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> ≈e
                    the passage, and prevent any of the blood from returning. Opposite to the
                    semilunar valves, the artery bulges out and forms three projections, which have
                    corresponding pits or depressions within, and are called, from their discoverer,
                    <hi rend="italic">sinus Valsalvae.</hi></p>
                <p>(412.) Where the two venae cavae meet, there is a small angular projection, which
                    has been called the <hi rend="italic">tuberculum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lowerù</hi> The term <hi rend="italic">auricula</hi> more properly applies to
                    the jagged portions which project from the sidesofthe base of the heart, like
                    the ears of a dog from its head; whilst the expanded cavity where the venous
                    tubes enter is called the <hi rend="italic">sinus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >venosus.</hi> On the side next to the auricula, there is a remarkable semilunar
                    fold, projecting within the cavity, between the vein and auricle, so as to be
                    convex next to the vein, and concave next to the auricle. This doubling has been
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Eustachian valve.</hi> Between the concave part of
                    this fold, and the opening into the ventricle, is the orifice of the coronary
                    vein, which returns the blood that has circulated through the substance of the
                    heart itself, and which is provided, at this point, with its proper valves. In
                    the septum auriculorum is seen a depression, the <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi>
                    ∕hwa <hi rend="italic">ovalis,</hi> which is the remains of a passage of
                    communication between the right and left auricles that had existed in the foetal
                    state. The sides of the fossa ovalis are strong and thick, and have received the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">isthmus Vicussenii,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >columnae,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">annulus fossae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ovalis.</hi></p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Sanguiferous System in general.</hi></p>
                <p>(413.) The blood-vessels, consisting of arteries, veins, and capillaries, compose
                    by their assemblage what is termed the <hi rend="italic">sanguiferous
                    system</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the channels which they form for the
                    transmission of the blood constitute a double circuit. The principal circuit
                    consists of that through which the blood is distributed to all parts of the body
                    indiscriminately, and which includes therefore the whole system. But there is
                    also another circuit of lesser extent, which is performed by the blood, by its
                    being sent from the heart to the lungs, and again returned to the heart, after
                    circulating through those organs. This is termed <hi rend="italic">the lesser
                    circulation,</hi> by way of contrast with the circulation through all the rest
                    of the body, which constitutes <hi rend="italic">the greater circulation.</hi>
                    For effecting this lesser circulation, a distinct set of blood-vessels, namely,
                    the <hi rend="italic">pulmonary vessels,</hi> is provided.</p>
                <p>(414.) Thus, there are two separate systems of bloodvessels, which have no
                    communication with each other, except through the medium of the heart, which is
                    the common origin and termination of both. The <hi rend="italic">aortic
                    system,</hi> or, as some modern anatomists have chosen to designate it, the <hi
                    rend="italic">systemic system,</hi> is that which, taking its rise from the left
                    ventricle of the heart, begins with the <hi rend="italic">aorta,</hi> or main
                    trunk of the arteries which transmit the blood to the body at large, and is
                    completed by the veins which are collected into two trunks, called <hi
                    rend="italic">venae cavae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which trunks, again,
                    terminate in the right auricle of the heart. The <hi rend="italic">pulmonary
                    system,</hi> on the other hand, comprises the pulmonary arteries, which arise by
                    a single trunk from the right ventricle of the heart, and after circulating the
                    blood through the lungs, are continued into the pulmonary veins, and terminate
                    by four large trunks in the left auricle of the heart.</p>
                <p>(415.) All these vessels, whether arteries or veins, may be comprehended under
                    the following general description. They are flexible and elastic tubes, for the
                    most part of a cylindrical shape, and composed principally of a membranous or
                    fibrous structure formed into distinct layers, and composing what are called the
                    <hi rend="italic">coats of</hi> these vessels. The number of these coats has
                    been differently estimated by different anatomists; but it is now generally
                    agreed that those proper to the vessels themselves are principally three: the
                    <hi rend="italic">external,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">internal,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">middle,</hi> or what has been called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >musculdr</hi> coat. Besides these tunics, each vessel is surrounded by aloose
                    and flocculent cellular substance, which connects it with the parts through
                    which it passes, and accompanies it in its whole course; but this substance,
                    being merely a continuation of the cellular substance which fills up all the
                    vacuities of the body, is common to the vessel and to other parts, ought not
                    properly to be considered as belonging to the former, but as adventitious;
                    although some anatomists have dignified it with the title of the <hi
                    rend="italic">cellular coat.</hi></p>
                <p>(416.) The first proper coat of the vessel is the external coat, which is thicker
                    than the rest, and formed of a membranous structure, in which are intermixed a
                    few filaments of fibro-cellular substance, disposed obliquely with respect to
                    the course of the vessel, and interwoven with the membranous fibres. The
                    innermost membrane is thinner than the former, of a whiter colour, more or less
                    pellucid, and presenting a more uniform homogeneous structure. Its inner surface
                    is perfectly smooth, and much resembles in appearance the serous membranes.
                    Between these membranous coats, there exists a layer of fibres, which have been
                    generally supposed to be muscular, constituting what has been accordingly called
                    the <hi rend="italic">muscular coat.</hi> Compared with the diameters of the
                    vessels, these coats are proportionably thicker in the smaller than in the
                    larger vessels.</p>
                <p>(417∙) After giving this general description of the structure of the
                    blood-vessels, we proceed to notice some of the peculiarities which distinguish
                    each class of blood-vessels.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Arterial System.</hi></p>
                <p>(418.) Each of the great arterial trunks, belonging respectively to the aortic,
                    and to the pulmonic systems, are furnished, at their origin from the ventricles
                    of the heart, with valves of a semilunar shape, adhering by one of their sides
                    to the margin of the aperture of the ventricle, or mouth of the artery, and
                    having their loose edges turned towards the axis of the artery. These valves are
                    formed by a duplicature of the internal coat, which contains between their folds
                    a thin layer of ligamentous fibres, giving them considerable strength. No valves
                    are found in any other part of the arterial system.</p>
                <p>(419∙) The external coat of an artery is formed by a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499394" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9394-0639"/>dense tissue of fibres, which
                    are interwoven together in different directions, generally very obliquely with
                    regard to the length of the vessel. This texture becomes more compact as we
                    trace it towards the interior, so that the individual fibres can with difficulty
                    be distinguished, unless by a forcible tearing asunder of the substance they
                    compose. Hence the older anatomists have distinguished this inner layer of the
                    external coat, as forming a separate tunic, to which they have given the name of
                    the <hi rend="italic">nervous coat,</hi> implying thereby a participation in the
                    structure of tendons which were not at that time distinguished from nerves. The
                    division of the external coat into these two layers, is well marked in the
                    larger arteries; but in proportion as we examine the smaller branches, we find a
                    more uniform appearance, the whole assuming the firm and compact texture of
                    fibrous membranes. This portion of the arterial structure is exceedingly strong
                    and elastic, both with respect to a force stretching it in the direction of its
                    length, and also transversely, or in that of its diameter. Its toughness is such
                    that it is not easily cut asunder by a thread employed as a ligature upon the
                    vessel.</p>
                <p>(420.) The intermediate, or muscular membrane, is of considerable thickness, has
                    a yellow colour, and is composed of fibres, all of which are arranged
                    circularly; that is, in the circumference of the cylinder. In the large arterial
                    trunks, these fibres form a distinct layer or tunic; but the membrane acquires a
                    still greater proportional thickness in the smaller branches, and then admits of
                    subdivision, by dissection, into several layers. The exterior layers are less
                    dense than the interior; and those which are innermost are the densest of all.
                    The elasticity and firmness of this coat is chiefly in the direction of the
                    circular fibres of which it consists; so that it opposes considerable resistance
                    to any force which tends to dilate the vessel, but yields readily to any power
                    applied for its elongation. It may be considered as partaking of the properties
                    of muscular and ligamentous structures.</p>
                <p>(421.) The internal membrane of arteries, which has also been called the <hi
                    rend="italic">nervous, arachnoid,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">common coat,</hi> is
                    the thinnest of the three; although still, in the larger arteries, it admits of
                    division into two or more layers. The innermost of these is extremely thin and
                    transparent, and its surface is smooth and highly polished, in order that no
                    resistance may be opposed to the motion of the blood. The outer portions are
                    white and opaque, and pass gradually into the substance of the muscular tunic
                    with which it is connected. Its elasticity is very small, and its power of
                    resistance is limited, so that a ligature applied on the vessel generally
                    produces a laceration of the internal coat.</p>
                <p>(422.) The general form of the arterial system, if it were isolated from all
                    other parts, would resemble two trees, the trunks of which would be constituted
                    by the aorta, and by the pulmonary artery, and which divides and subdivides
                    successively into smaller and smaller branches, till they arrive at an extreme
                    degree of tenuity. Each portion which intervenes between these divisions
                    preserves the same uniform diameter, and is therefore exactly cylindrical. Each
                    branch is of course smaller than the trunk from which it arises; but the sum of
                    the areas of all the branches into which an artery divides itself, is in general
                    greater than the area of that artery; and consequently the total capacity of the
                    arterial system is progressively increasing in proportion to the number of
                    subdivisions which take place. Hence the whole system may in reality be
                    considered as composing a conical cavity, of which the aorta is the apex, and
                    the ultimate subdivisions the base. The number of subdivisions in the whole
                    course of an artery scarcely ever exceeds twenty, according to the estimate of
                    Haller, who took pains to ascertain this point. The most usual mode of
                    ramification is that of bifurcation, or division of a trunk into two branches,
                    which generally form between them an acute angle. In some instances, especially
                    among the larger arteries, we meet with a branch sent off at right angles from
                    the main trunk, or still more rarely at an obtuse angle.</p>
                <p>(423.) Arteries have numerous communications among their different branches.
                    These communications, or <hi rend="italic">anastomoses,</hi> as they are called,
                    are effected sometimes by the reunion of two arteries of nearly equal size,
                    which happen to be proceeding in similar directions, so as to compose one common
                    trunk, which proceeds in an intermediate direction, sometimes by collateral
                    branches proceeding obliquely from the one to the other; while on other
                    occasions, arteries unite from greater distances, so as to form a wide arch, in
                    which each appears to be continuous one with the other; and from the convex side
                    of which, branches are again sent off, which are distributed in minuter
                    ramifications. In some parts the anastomoses are so frequent and numerous, as to
                    resemble a net-work, or plexus of vessels.</p>
                <p>(424.) The principal arteries of the limbs are generally found running in
                    situations where they are best protected from injury, and where they are most
                    secure from pressure during the actions of the muscles. Hence they are chiefly
                    met with in the hollow spaces formed on the inner side of the flexures of the
                    joints.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Venous System.</hi></p>
                <p>(425.) The chief peculiarities in the structure of the veins, as distinguished
                    from that of the arteries, consist in the greater thinness, and diminished
                    density of their coats, the tenuity or absence of the muscular tunic, and the
                    numerous valves which occur in different parts of their course. The outer coat
                    resembles that of the arteries, but does not present so dense or so fine a
                    texture of fibres; and it possesses less absolute strength. The middle coat is
                    formed of fibres which are more extensile and flexible than those of arteries;
                    and their direction, instead of being transverse, is principally longitudinal.
                    These fibres are not constantly met with in all the parts of the venous system,
                    but vary much in their proportion to the rest of the structure in different
                    veins, as well as in their directions and thickness. It is only in the large
                    veins, near the heart, that this coat presents any appearance of muscular
                    fibres. The inner coat is thin and transparent, like that of the arteries; but
                    differs from the latter in being more extensible, less easily torn, and in its
                    containing a certain proportion of ligamentous fibres in its composition. Some
                    of the veins, such as those within the cranium, which are called <hi
                    rend="italic">sinuses,</hi> as well as the veins which traverse the bones, being
                    protected by the surrounding parts, appear to consist altogether of this inner
                    coat, and are unprovided with either the muscular or the cellular coats.</p>
                <p>(426.) The large veins follow in general the course of the arteries, but are
                    usually twice as numerous; so that where we meet with an artery, we generally
                    find it accompanied by two veins. Their general disposition is arborescent, like
                    the arterial system; but with reference to the function they perform, they may
                    be more aptly compared to the roots than to the branches of a tree; for in
                    following the course <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the blood in its circulation,
                    they may be said to take their rise from the minutest vessels, and successively
                    uniting into larger and larger tubes, to terminate by one or two main trunks in
                    the heart. The total capacity of the venous system is at least twice as great as
                    that of the arterial system. The distribution and general mode of ramification
                    of the veins, correspond very exactly to that of the arteries, presenting the
                    same ramified appearance, and the same frequent anastomoses. These collateral
                    communications are exceedingly numerous in the superficial veins, and wherever
                    they are liable to partial obstruction from external pressure. It is in these
                    situations also, that we meet with a great number of valves in the course of the
                    veins. The veins of the deep-seated organs are generally unprovided with valves
                    in any part of their course. The arteries, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499407"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9407-0640"/>as we have already seen, have no valves except at
                    their commencement.</p>
                <p>(427.) Besides the two venous systems appropriated to the greater and lesser
                    circulations, the former uniting in the venae cavae, and the latter in the
                    pulmonary veins, and therefore corresponding to the two arterial systems, there
                    is also another, and more partial system of veins, peculiar to the circulation
                    in the liver, and other viscera of the abdomen. This particular system, which is
                    that of the <hi rend="italic">vena portae,</hi> as it is called, is complete
                    within itself; that is, it constitutes a tree, having a common stem, with its
                    proper roots and branches, the whole of which is placed as an intermediate
                    system between the ultimate branches of the gastrie, intestinal, and splenie
                    arteries, of which the roots of the vena portae may be considered as the
                    continuations, and first radicles of the proper hepatic veins, which are the
                    continuations of the ultimate ramifications of the vena portae. By this
                    arrangement, the blood which has circulated through the stomach, the intestines,
                    and the spleen, is distributed by a new set of veins, throughout the substance
                    of the liver, and is returned to the general mass of blood in the venae cavae,
                    after circulating through that organ.</p>
                <p>To this peculiar venous system there is no corresponding arterial system.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Capillary System.</hi></p>
                <p>(428.) The ultimate ramifications of the arteries, as well as the beginnings of
                    the veins, are, in almost every part of the body, vessels of such extreme
                    tenuity, as to be imperceptible without the assistance of the microscope; and
                    they cannot even then be discerned, unless the part be artificially prepared by
                    the injection of some coloured substance into the vessels, or unless they have
                    been accidentally enlarged by disease, so as to have received the colouring
                    matter of the blood. Hence the ancients, who were ignorant both of the art of
                    injecting, and of the power of the microscope, were precluded from a knowledge
                    of the existence of these minute vessels. They believed that a substance, which
                    they termed <hi rend="italic">parenchyma,</hi> and which they conceived to be of
                    a spongy texture, was interposed between the terminal branches of the arteries,
                    and the beginning of the veins; and this opinion was adopted almost universally
                    by anatomists before the epoch of the discovery of the circulation, and was
                    entertained even after this period, by a great number of eminent anatomists,
                    down to the present day. But the injections of Ent, and the microscopical
                    observations of Malpighi and of Leewenhoek, have sufficiently demonstrated the
                    continuity of the canals by which the blood is made to pass from the arteries
                    into the veins. The researches of modern anatomists, indeed, by shewing the
                    amazing extent to which the minute division of the vascular system is carried,
                    and in which they pervade every part of the frame, have finally exploded the
                    hypothesis of the existence of interposed parenchyma, and have given rise to
                    another hypothesis of an opposite kind, namely, of all the textures of the body
                    being ultimately resolvable into vessels.</p>
                <p>(429.) The name of <hi rend="italic">capillary vessels</hi> is given to those
                    minute branches of either arteries or veins, whose diameter is finer than a
                    hair, and which can therefore scarcely be distinguished by the unassisted eye.
                    Authors have' endeavoured to establish three gradations of size in this class of
                    vessels; the largest being those which can be but just perceived by the eye
                    without a magnifying glass; the next, those which require the aid of the
                    microscope for their detection; and the third, those which are capable of
                    admitting only a single red globule of blood, and of which the calibre must
                    consequently be only a very little larger than these globules.</p>
                <p>(430.) The larger capillaries undergo several subdivisions in their course,
                    before they arrive at this extreme degree of tenuity; and indeed, their lateral
                    branches of communication are éo multiplied as they proceed, that the whole
                    forms a general and extensive net-work of vessels. The total capacity of the
                    capillary system far surpasses that of the arteries and veins; and they contain
                    therefore by much the greatest portion of the blood in the natural and healthy
                    state of the circulation.</p>
                <p>(431.) The vascular branches -which form the channels of communication between
                    the arteries and the veins, are, -with but very few exceptions, referable to the
                    class of capillary vessels. In this continuous course it is scarcely possible to
                    mark with precision, at what point the arterial portion may be said to
                    terminate, and the venous portion to commence. Neither the limit of size, nor
                    the change of direction, is sufficient to lay the foundations of such a
                    distinction; for the alteration of diameter is gradual, and the inflexions are
                    various, and frequently tortuous, so that no determinate criterion can be
                    assumed as characteristic of either artery or vein. Hence arises the propriety
                    of constituting a distinct class of capillary vessels.</p>
                <p>(432.) The texture of the capillaries, from the minuteness of their size,
                    scarcely admits of accurate observation. Their coats are thin, soft, pellucid,
                    and therefore invisible to the naked eye, and hardly discernible with the
                    microscope. It is most probable that they are formed, in every instance, by a
                    prolongation of the internal coats of the larger arteries and veins with which
                    they are continuous.</p>
                <p>(433.) As the capability of admitting coloured substances is apparently an
                    indispensable condition for their being visible, the existence of vessels of
                    still smaller diameter, containing only colourless fluids, must more or less be
                    matter of conjecture. A very great number of anatomists and physiologists,
                    however, among whom may be enumerated Boerhaave, Vieussens, Farricnus, Haller,
                    Soemmerring, Bichat, Blculand, Chaussier, have admitted the existence of another
                    order of capillaries, or <hi rend="italic">serous vessels,</hi> as they have
                    termed them, of which the diameter is too small to admit even a single red
                    globule, and which therefore circulate only the serous part of the blood. On the
                    other hand, the reality of these pretended vessels is contested by Prochaska,
                    Maseagni, Richerand, and others. Béelard, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatomie</hi><hi rend="italic">Générale,</hi> has given a review of the
                    arguments employed on both sides in this controversy, which is by no means as
                    yet set at rest, and which will probably have to be decided, more by
                    considerations of a physiological than of an anatomical nature.</p>
                <p>(434.) In speaking of the communications between the arteries and the veins, it
                    remains only to be noticed, that in many parts of the body there appears to be
                    interposed between the extreme branches of each, a spongy or cellular structure,
                    into which the arteries occasionally pour out blood, so as to distend these
                    cells, and from which the veins arise by open orifices, and absorb the blood, in
                    order to unload the cells, and remove the accumulation which has taken place.
                    Such a structure has been denominated the <hi rend="italic">erectile
                    tissue.</hi> It is exemplified on a large scale, in the spleen, and in some of
                    the sexual organs. We shall notice this structure afterwards.</p>
                <p>(435.) The different parts and textures of the body are supplied with vessels in
                    very different proportions. The organ which ranks first in respect to its
                    vascularity, is the lungs; after which come the integuments, the pia mater, and
                    choroid coat of the eye; next the glands, the glandular follicles, the lymphatic
                    glands, the cortical substance of the brain, the nervous ganglions. To these
                    will succeed in the order of vascularity, the muscles, the periosteum, the
                    adipose tissue, the medullary nervous substance, the bones, and the serous
                    membranes. The tendons and ligaments are amongst the least vascular parts. Still
                    less so are the cartilages, and the arachnoid membrane of the brain; and lastly,
                    the epidermis, and its appendages, as the nails and hair, together with the
                    enamel of the teeth, may be considered as parts entirely devoid of vessels.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499420" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9420-0641"/>
                <p>(436.) The actual mass of blood which the organs of the circulation have to move
                    through the channels we have just pointed out has been variously estimated by
                    différent physiologists. The lowest computation is that of Müller and
                    Abeildgaard, who made it out to be only eight pounds. Borelli estimated it at
                    twenty pounds; Planche at twenty-eight; Haller at thirty; Dr. Young at forty;
                    Hamberger at eighty; and Keill at one hundred. Blumenbach states the proportion
                    in an adult healthy man to be one-fifth of the entire weight of the body; but
                    Dr. Good, who has collected these authorities, is disposed to place but little
                    reliance on the latter mode of estimation, on account of the great diversity in
                    point of weight and bulk of adults, whose aggregate quantity of blood would
                    appear to be nearly the same. He thinks the mean of the above numbers, which is
                    between thirty and forty pounds, may safely be taken as nearest to the truth.
                    The proportion of the whole mass of blood which is contained in different parts
                    of the vascular system, varies according to age. In early life, there is nearly
                    an equal quantity contained in the arteries as in the veins. In the adult,
                    one-fourth only is contained in the arterial, and three-fourths in the venous
                    system; and the disproportion is greater as age advances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Phenomena of the
                    Circulation.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Course of the Blood in its Circulation.</hi></p>
                <p>(437∙) Having premised this general outline of the course which the blood takes
                    during its circulation, we shall now follow the several steps more in detail,
                    examining, as we proceed, the evidence afforded us that such is its real course;
                    and we shall lastly inquire into the several powers concerned in its
                    propulsion.</p>
                <p>(438.) We shall, for this purpose, begin at that part of its circuit at which the
                    blood is brought back from the lungs, after receiving the vivifying influence of
                    the air, and being thereby <hi rend="italic">arterialized,</hi> as it has been
                    called. The pulmonary veins, which convey it in this state to the heart, are
                    collected into four great trunks, which open into the left auricle of the heart.
                    As soon as the auricle is distended beyond a certain degree by this flow of
                    blood into it, it contracts and pours the whole of its contents at once into the
                    left ventricle. The constant stream of blood which is flowing towards the
                    auricle from the lungs, prevents any portion of the blood of the auricle from
                    flowing back into them when the auricle contracts. No sooner has the ventricle
                    received this blood, which has passed into it by a sudden influx, than it is
                    sti* mulated to a vigorous contraction of its muscular fibres, which,
                    surrounding the cavity in a spiral direction, contract its cavity, and, exerting
                    a powerful pressure on the contained fluid, propels it with prodigious force
                    into the aorta. The contraction of the ventricle is attended with the raising of
                    the mitral valve, interposed between it and the auricle, and the sides of that
                    valve being closely applied to the aperture by which the blood had entered the
                    ventricle, all return of the blood into the auricle is thereby prevented. The
                    whole of it rushes, therefore, as an impetuous torrent into the aorta, or main
                    trunk of the arterial system. The blood which has entered the artery is again
                    prevented from flowing back into the ventricle, by a valvular apparatus of the
                    same kind as that which occurs between the auricle and the ventricle. These
                    valves, placed at the entrance of the aorta, are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sigmoid,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">semilunar valves.</hi> They are three in
                    number, each being attached by its convex edge to the coats of the artery, to
                    which it is closely applied when the stream of blood is flowing in a direction
                    from the heart, but which is immediately raised, and the three loose edges
                    joining together, form a complete barrier to the passage of the blood when
                    moving in the contrary direction.</p>
                <p>(439∙) The blood, having passed into the aorta, is conveyed through its branches
                    and ramifications to all the parts where these ramifications extend, till it
                    reaches the capillaries, where it moves more slowly, yet still proceeds on its
                    course, supplying every part with the materials necessary for the maintenance of
                    their nutrition and vital powers. From the capillaries the blood is brought back
                    by the minuter branches of the veins, which, uniting successively to form larger
                    and larger trunks, are at length collected into the two venae cavae, the one
                    descending from the head and superior parts of the body, and the other ascending
                    from the inferior parts, and both joining at the right auricle of the heart. The
                    same process now takes place in the right cavities of the heart, which was
                    described as occurring in the left. The right auricle is filled with blood from
                    the venae cavae; it contracts and pours its contents into the cavity of the
                    right ventricle, which, being in its turn stimulated to contract, propels the
                    blood it had received from the auricle into the trunk of the pulmonary artery;
                    which artery likewise distributes it, by a similar system of ramifications, to
                    the membrane lining the air vesicles of the lungs. All retrograde motion of the
                    blood is prevented as effectually in this case as in the former, by the
                    interposition of the tricuspid valves between the auricle and ventricle, and by
                    the semilunar valves placed at the entrance of the pulmonary artery.</p>
                <p>(440.) From the ultimate ramifications of the pulmonary artery the blood is
                    conducted into the capillary vessels, which are spread over the membrane of the
                    air-cells of the lungs, where it undergoes the change of quality from venous to
                    arterial, consequent upon its exposure to the chemical action of the oxygen
                    which is contained in the atmospheric air admitted into those cells. From these
                    capillaries it is collected by the pulmonary veins, and returned, as before
                    stated, to the heart, to be again distributed to every part of the body.</p>
                <p>(441.) While one portion of the blood is circulating in the system, another
                    portion is circulating in the lungs. Both auricles are filled at the same
                    moment, and contract together; each sending its blood into the corresponding
                    ventricle. In like manner, the two ventricles contract simultaneously, and
                    propel their contents into their respective arterial trunks. The contraction of
                    the heart is called <hi rend="italic">the systole</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    its relaxation <hi rend="italic">the diastole.</hi></p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Proofs of the Circulation.</hi></p>
                <p>(442.) The discovery of the course which the blood takes in its circulation, a
                    discovery of such vast magnitude, that almost the whole of the present doctrines
                    of physiology and pathology are either directly founded on it, or are more or
                    less immediately related to it, was made in the beginning of the seventeenth
                    century. It was one of the earliest fruits of that active spirit of inquiry, and
                    rational process of investigation, which, since the era of Bacon, was beginning
                    to diffuse itself in Europe. It was an honour reserved for our illustrious
                    countryman Harvey, whose fame must live as long as science is cherished among
                    men. While it is the fate of other discoveries, that their authors are either
                    soon forgotten, or only known to a small class of those who devote their
                    attention peculiarly to the subject to which they relate, the name of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Harvey</hi> is become familiar to all who have any acquaintance
                    with general literature, or pretensions to a liberal education. However firmly
                    the truth of his great discovery be established in the present time, it was, in
                    its first promulgation, keenly contested by many contemporary physiologists. To
                    us who have no such prejudices to warp our judgment, and who are furnished with
                    so large a body of evidence on the subject, the controversy appears exceedingly
                    frivolous and absurd. Yet we must recollect that in every subject of human
                    opinion, it requires a considerable time to wean mankind from errors which have
                    been long and deeply rooted in their minds, however palpable such errors may
                    appear to the eyes of those who have not <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499433"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9433-0642"/>been so blinded. As it may still, however, be
                    satisfactory to know the grounds upon which the doctrine is founded, we shall
                    briefly enumerate the leading facts and arguments that establish it.</p>
                <p>(443.) The most striking proofs that the course of the blood along the arteries
                    is from the heart towards the extremities of those vessels, and along the veins
                    in the contrary direction, are obtained from ligatures on those vessels. If any
                    of the larger arterial branches be tied, that portion of the vessel which is
                    situated between the ligature and the heart, immediately swells, becomes
                    distended with blood, and exhibits strong pulsations; and if while in this state
                    it be punctured, the blood rushes out with violence, and in successive jets,
                    corresponding to the pulsations of the heart. The part beyond the ligature, on
                    the other hand, or that farthest from the heart, is flaccid and empty, and
                    affords no blood when divided; it is also void of pulsation. Phenomena precisely
                    the reverse of these are exhibited when similar experiments arc made on the
                    veins; in them, the part most distant from the heart becomes turgid, while the
                    nearer part is empty. This last experiment is one that is made every time a
                    person undergoes the operation ôf blood-letting. A ligature is applied round the
                    arm, from the pressure of which on the subcutaneous veins, they are made to
                    swell evejy where below the ligature, that is, farther from the heart; while all
                    the veins above the ligature are empty, the blood having been propelled onwards
                    in its course towards the heart. Those parts which are swelled pour out their
                    blood profusely on being punctured; and when the bandage is removed, the flow is
                    stopped, in consequence of the blood finding a ready passage to the heart.</p>
                <p>(444.) In the veins, we have additional evidence, from the structure of the
                    valves, that the blood can move only in one direction, namely, towards the
                    heart. The valves at the entrance of the ventricles and arterial trunks, which
                    allow of motion only in a particular course, lead to a similar conclusion with
                    respect to the direction of the current in its passage through the heart. It is
                    impossible by artificial means to force fluid injections through the heart, in a
                    course contrary to that in which the blood moves; and the same insuperable
                    resistance is experienced in the attempt to pass injections in other parts of
                    the circulating system, when in opposition to the natural course taken by the
                    blood, while the same fluids readily find their way from the arteries into the
                    veins, when thrown in that direction.</p>
                <p>(445.) Ocular demonstration of the course of the blood while circulating in the
                    smaller arterial and venous branches, and also in the capillaries, is afforded
                    by the microscope, when a very thin and transparent membrane in which such
                    vessels are distributed is placed in the field of a good microscope. The web
                    between the toes of a frog, the surface of its vesicular lungs, the mesentery,
                    the membrane in the tail of small fishes, are all of them capable of exhibiting
                    these phenomena, and present, indeed, a spectacle of the highest interest.</p>
                <p>(446.) The successive action of the cavities of the heart, in the order above
                    enumerated, may also be seen when the hearts of living creatures are exposed to
                    view; and this spectacle may be afforded without pain to the animal, if, after
                    its head has been completely separated from the body, respiration be kept up by
                    artificial means.</p>
                <p>(447.) The transfusion of the blood of one animal into the vessels of another is
                    a curious illustration of the doctrine of the circulation. In this operation,
                    the artery of one animal is connected by a tube with the vein of another animal;
                    the consequence of which is that the first is gradually emptied of its blood,
                    while the vessels of the other are in a state of repletion. If an opening be
                    made at the same time in the veins of this second animal, the blood originally
                    belonging to it will escape, and thus the whole mass of its circulating fluid
                    will be changed. Experiments of this kind were at one time very common, but they
                    have long ceased to excite curiosity, and are now rarely practised.</p>
                <p>That the blood moves with great rapidity and force through the larger vessels, is
                    proved by the immense quantity that is quickly lost if any great artery or vein
                    be wounded.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Powers concerned in the
                    Circulation.</hi></p>
                <p>(448.) We have next to enquire into the nature and magnitude of the forces by
                    which the blood is impelled in its course, the resistance opposed to its
                    progress, and the general laws by which its movements are regulated.</p>
                <p>(449∙) The subject will naturally divide itself into four parts; namely, as
                    relating to the powers of the heart, of the arteries, of the capillaries, and of
                    the veins.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Action of the Heart.</hi></p>
                <p>(450.) The intention and purpose of the auricles, which are placed as
                    ante-chambers to the ventricles, is to receive the blood in a constant stream
                    from the veins, which fill it gradually and equably, so that when the distension
                    has reached a certain degree, the auricle may contract and discharge the whole
                    of its contents, with a sudden impetus, into the ventricle. The thickness and
                    muscular force of the auricles are very inferior to those of the ventricles,
                    which being destined to propel the blood with considérable momentum into the
                    arterial system, are exceedingly powerful, but seem to require the stimulus of
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> sudden and forcible distension, in order to excite them
                    to a sufficiently energetic action. It appears, indeed, that this mechanical
                    distension and separation of their sides from the influx of fluid, is the
                    natural stimulus that excites them to contraction; for they are not affected by
                    any of the causes which produce contractions in the voluntary muscles, such as
                    irritation of the nerves which supply the heart. On the other hand, the mere
                    introduction of warm water into these cavities, when previously emptied of
                    blood, is sufficient to renew the action of the heart.</p>
                <p>(451.) It is exceedingly difficult to form any probable estimate of the absolute
                    force exerted by the heart, and more particularly by the left ventricle, in
                    propelling its contents. No inquiry in physiology was pursued with more ardour,
                    has been the subject of more various controversy, or has given rise to so many
                    voluminous and elaborate calculations.</p>
                <p>(452.) It will be quite evident that a very considerable power is required, in
                    order to enable the heart to propel the blood through the arteries, when we
                    consider the enormous resistances opposed to its progress, and when we also take
                    into account the great velocity given to it in its motion. The column of blood
                    already contained in the arterial system, must have its velocity accelerated, in
                    order to admit of the passage of fresh blood into the aorta. The arteries
                    require also to be distended for the admission of this additional quantity of
                    blood, every time that the ventricle contracts. The anglesand flexures which the
                    blood is obliged to follow in its course through the vessels, must be causes of
                    retardation, and must be productive of a loss of force, which the muscular power
                    of the heart is ultimately called upon to supply. The operation of all these
                    retarding causes is so complicated, that we need not be surprised at the problem
                    of the force exerted by the heart, having baffled the skill of the best
                    mathematicians, and their calculations being so widely different from one
                    another. Thus, while Keil estimated the power of the left ventricle at only five
                    ounces, Borelli calculated that its force could not be less than one hundred and
                    eighty thousand pounds. Dr. Hales computes it to be exactly fifty-one pounds and
                    a half; while Tabor concludes its amount to be one hundred and fifty pounds.
                    Such irreconcilable results sufficiently show the futility of most of the
                    reasonings on which they are founded, and the impossibility of making any
                    satisfactory <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499446" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9446-0643"
                    />approach towards the solution of the problem. We should, on the whole, be more
                    disposed to place confidence in the estimate of Hales, who moreover states, that
                    the velocity with which the blood passes into the aorta, is about one hundred
                    and fifty feet per minute, or two feet and a half per second; and that the
                    quantity of blood passing through the heart during each hour, is about twenty
                    times the whole mass of blood contained in the body; or, in other words, that
                    the whole mass completes twenty entire circulations in an hour. The great
                    velocity of the blood in the vessels is exemplified by the lact, that a fluid
                    introduced into one of the jugular veins of a horse, has been detected in the
                    opposite vein, and even in the vena saphena of the leg, in the course of half a
                    minute.</p>
                <p>(453.) It has been keenly disputed whether the heart is able completely to empty
                    its cavities at each contraction; and the question, which is not one of any real
                    importance, is hardly yet decided.</p>
                <p>(454.) Another subject of controversy which was much agitated among the French
                    physiologists in the middle of the last century, is, whether the heart is
                    shortened or elongated during its systole; that is, whether the apex approaches
                    the base during the contraction of the ventricle, or recedes from it. From the
                    numerous observations of Spallanzani, as well as of other experimentalists,
                    there seems to be no doubt that during the systole all the parts are brought
                    nearer to the tendinous ring surrounding the auriculo-ventricular orifices,
                    which may be regarded as the fixed pivot of its movements, and consequently the
                    length, as well as the other diameters of the heart, is shortened. During this
                    action, however, the curvature being suddenly straightened, the apex is
                    projected forwards, and produces that striking against the ribs which is felt by
                    the hand applied externally to the chest.</p>
                <p>(455.) The right ventricle having only to perform the lighter task of circulating
                    the blood through the lungs, is much inferior in thickness and strength to the
                    left ventricle, which has to propel the blood through the whole aortic system,
                    forming a course of much greater magnitude than that of the pulmonary vessels.
                    But, on the other hand, the capacities of the two ventricles are nearly equal,
                    as might be expected, when it is considered that the same quantity of blood
                    which is forced out from the one, must, in the course of circulation, pass
                    through the other; and that both the ventricles contract the same number of
                    times in a given interval. The quantity of blood expelled by the heart at each
                    contraction, is estimated by Blumenbach at two ounces. So that, reckoning the
                    whole mass of blood at thirty-five pounds, or four hundred and twenty ounces,
                    and the contractions to be repeated seventy-five times in a minute, the whole of
                    the blood will have passed through the heart in about three minutes; thus
                    agreeing very nearly with the estimate of Hales already stated, (§ 452.)</p>
                <p>(456.) It has been supposed that the heart exerts some force in the diastole as
                    well as systole; and that the recoil of the muscles when they spring back, after
                    they have performed their contraction, creates a force of suction, which
                    promotes the flow of blood in the great veins towards the licart. But the truth
                    of this proposition is exceedingly dubious.</p>
                <p>(457∙) The movements of the heart are completely involuntary; that is, are
                    entirely beyond the control of the will. Nor are its natural actions accompanied
                    by any sensations. They are, generally speaking, totally independent of the
                    nervous system; for they may be maintained after the destruction of the brain
                    and spinal cord, and even after all the nerves which supply the heart have been
                    divided. Yet these movements are capable of being influenced, often very
                    suddenly, by an impression made upon any considerable portion of the nervous
                    system. The regular contractions of the heart appear to be excited simply by the
                    stimulus of distension from the periodical influx of blood into its cavities.
                    This organ is evidently endowed with a very high degree, and a very peculiar
                    kind of irritability, not subject, like that of the voluntary muscles, to
                    exhaustion, by the most powerful exertions, reiterated for an indefinite
                    time.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Actions of the Arteries.</hi></p>
                <p>(458.) Whatever be the velocity with which the blood is projected from the heart
                    into the aorta, that velocity is soon retarded, in the course of its progress
                    from the larger to the smaller branches of that arterial trunk. This is amply
                    illustrated by the observation of the effects which follow the division or
                    wounds of arteries in different parts of their course. A wound of the carotid
                    artery is almost instantly fatal, from the deluge of blood which rushes out from
                    the opening. The division of the other large arterial trunks is no less
                    certainly fatal, if means be not at hand to stop the torrent that gushes out
                    with resistless impetuosity. In the smaller arteries, such as those in which the
                    motion of the blood can be viewed with the microscope, the current is very
                    languid and feeble. It is, in reality, however, much slower than it appears to
                    be; for it should be recollected, that in viewing the magnified image of an
                    object, its motion is magnified in the same proportion as its dimensions.</p>
                <p>(459∙) The cause of this continual retardation of the blood is to be traced in
                    the structure of the arterial system itself. The velocity of a fluid passing
                    through a tube of unequal diameter in different parts, must be inversely as the
                    area of the tube at each respective point of its length; that is, inversely as
                    the square of the diameter. Accordingly, if we suppose two cylinders of
                    diffèrent diameters joined together, and that a fluid is passing from one end to
                    the other, it must evidently move with less velocity in the wider than in the
                    narrower part; for if it did not, it would leave behind it a vacant space. But a
                    vacuum of this kind can never take place in the living body, in which, with
                    whatever other properties they may be endowed, the fluids are still obedient to
                    the laws of hydraulics. The arterial system consists of an assemblage of tubes,
                    which, though they continually diminish in their diameter as they divide into
                    branches, yet as the united area of the branches is always greater than that of
                    the trunk out of which they arose, they constitute, when taken as a whole, a
                    system of channels of continually increasing capacity, as we follow them from
                    the heart to the extremities. The whole cavity through which the blood moves,
                    may therefore be represented by a cone, having its apex at the heart, and its
                    base at the termination of the minutest arterial ramifications. The beginning of
                    the aorta is, in reality, the narrowest part of the whole channel, considered
                    with reference to the united areas of the successive order of branches as they
                    divide. The sum of all the areas of the minutest ramifications of the arteries
                    existing in the body, comprising myriads of myriads of vessels, if they could be
                    collected together, would form an area of immense extent. No wonder, therefore,
                    that the motion of the blood, when it arrives at this part of the circulation,
                    should be so prodigiously retarded as actual observation shews us that it
                    is.</p>
                <p>(460.) Notwithstanding this great difference in the velocity of the blood in
                    different parts of its arterial circulation, it would appear from the
                    experiments of Poiseuille, that the pressure exerted by the blood, as measured
                    by the column of mercury it will support at different distances from the heart,
                    is not very different.</p>
                <p>(461.) The arteries being always full of blood, and their coats distended by its
                    presence, the elasticity of these coats is always exerted, and produces a
                    constant pressure on the blood, independently of any force that may urge it
                    forwards. The entry of a fresh quantity of blood forced into them by the action
                    of the heart, produces a slight additional <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499459"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9459-0644"/>distention of their coats, and a consequent
                    reaction of their elasticity. This reaction of the arteries in each interval of
                    the heart’s pulsation, tends much to equalize the motion of the blood; and has
                    the effect also of propagating the impulse originally given to it by the heart
                    very quickly to the remoter parts of the arterial system. The velocity with
                    which this impulse is transmitted, is much greater than the actual motion of the
                    blood, and partakes of the natur,e of a wave, which, as is well known, advances
                    with incomparably greater rapidity than the progressive motion of the fluid
                    itself. It is the impulse given to the sides of the artery by this wave, as it
                    may be called, which constitutes the <hi rend="italic">pulse,</hi> and which is
                    more particulary rendered sensible on compressing the artery with the
                    finger.</p>
                <p>(462.) It has been a much disputed question, both here and on the continent,
                    whether the arteries assist the circulation by exerting any contractile power of
                    their own. The evidence in favour of their exerting such an action is very
                    strong, and apparently irresistible. The power of the heart, however enormous we
                    may suppose it to be, would appear to be quite inadequate to drive the whole
                    mass of the blood through the infinite number of narrow and contorted channels
                    through which it actually moves, were it not assisted by some additional force,
                    derived from the contractions of the arteries themselves. Many facts prove that
                    variations in the impetus of the blood, and in the quantity which circulates in
                    particular parts, occur at different times, quite independently of any general
                    alteration of the circulation, or of any corresponding change in the action of
                    the heart. The only assignable cause for such differences is <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> variation in the extent of action of the arteries. Numerous experiments
                    show that stimuli applied to the smaller arteries occasion in them a temporary
                    constriction at the points where irritation has been excited; which, after a
                    certain time, goes off spontaneously. Various other facts also prove that the
                    arteries have a power of spontaneous contraction; this power is exhibited in the
                    most unequivocal·manner when an artery has been cut across; the consequent
                    haemorrhage being, after some time, stopped by this action of the coats of the
                    artery. This contractile force of arteries is probably derived from muscularity,
                    although the muscular structure is not distinctly perceptible. It is
                    considerably greater in the smaller than in the larger arteries; and it is
                    probably greatest of all in the capillaries.</p>
                <p>(463.) Notwithstanding the facts above stated, the muscularity of the arteries is
                    denied by some of the most eminent of the continental physiologists; and among
                    others, Magendie, Broussais, Addon, Alard, Rolando, and Müller.<note

                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Action of the Capillaries.</hi></p>
                <p>(464.) The particular agents by which the circulation is carried on in the
                    capillary vessels cannot be very precisely determined; andthe subject has given
                    rise to much controversy among physiologists. The action of these vessels is
                    evidently of the greatest importance in relation to every other function, and
                    more especially to the production of every permanent change which may take place
                    in the form or composition of the organs. The variable state of the circulation
                    in different organs at different times, must be occasioned principally by
                    diversities in the actions of the capillaries. It appears from the experiments
                    of Hunter, that while the larger arteries possess a greater proportion of
                    elastic power, the smaller arteries have a comparatively greater muscular
                    contractility; and this reasoning may, with great appearance of probability, be
                    extended to the capillaries. It would appear, indeed, from various observations
                    on the inferior animals, and in particular from those made by Dr. W. Philip,
                    that the circulation in the capillaries may be kept up for some time after the
                    pulsation of the heart has entirely ceased, and even when that organ has been
                    altogether removed from the body. In many cases, indeed, the capillaries, when
                    viewed with the microscope, have been seen to contract on the application to
                    them of stimuli, which, in other cases, excite contractions in the muscular
                    fibre. The pulsatory motion of the blood given to it in the arteries by the
                    periodical contractions of the heart, is scarcely sensible in the smaller
                    arteries, and is totally lost in the capillaries, where we find the blood moving
                    in a uniform stream. This is anceessary consequence of the tortuous course of
                    the channels through which it passes, and of the numerous communications among
                    these vessels, which equalize the effects of the original impulse, and extend
                    them over the whole period of time that intervenes between one pulsation and the
                    next.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Action of the Veins.</hi></p>
                <p>(465.) The blood which is returned from every part of the system by the veins, is
                    gradually accelerated in its progress towards the heart, for a similar reason
                    that it was retarded in its transmission through the arteries, namely, that the
                    capacity of the channel through which this fluid is passing is continually
                    diminishing; for the united area of the beginnings of the veins is incomparably
                    smaller than the conjoined area of the two venae cavae. The office of the veins
                    generally appears, on the whole, to partake more of a mechanical action than
                    that of the arteries, though it is probable that the smaller veins may derive
                    from their structure powers analogous to those of the capillaries. The power
                    which impels the blood forwards in the veins is chiefly the impulse it has
                    already received, and the pressure exerted on it from behind, or what has been
                    technically termed the <hi rend="italic">vis a tergo.</hi> This force is
                    assisted also in many situations by the pressure made on the veins by the action
                    of the neighbouring muscles, which, in consequence of the valves placed in the
                    course of the veins, preventing all retrograde motion in the blood, must
                    contribute to force it onwards towards the heart. It is probable, however, that
                    the veins are not altogether destitute of a power of contraction, though less
                    considerable than that possessed by the arteries; and that the exertion of this
                    power has some share in accelerating the motion of the blood in the venous
                    system. Whatever power may arise from the force of dilatation exerted by the
                    auricles of the heart during their diastole, which, however, we have reason to
                    believe is very trifling, must be added to the account of the forces that tend
                    to promote the motion of the blood towards those cavities. Some have supposed
                    that a similar power is derived from the expansion of the chest in the act of
                    inspiration; but this, if it exist at all, is of very inconsiderable amount. The
                    venae cavae near their termination in the auricles, are furnished with a
                    distinct layer of muscular fibres, apparently for the purpose of enabling them
                    to resist the retrograde impulse communicated to the blood by the contraction of
                    the auricles.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Pulmonary Circulation.</hi></p>
                <p>(466.) There is nothing very different in the circulation through the pulmonary
                    arteries, capillaries, and veins, from what takes place in the corresponding
                    vessels of the systemic circulation, excepting that junctions are occasionally
                    formed between the smaller branches of the branchial arteries which have their
                    origin from the aorta, and the branches of the pulmonary artery. The phenomena
                    which occur in asphyxia, or death from suffocation, prove that the pulmonary
                    capillaries have a distinct action of their own in carrying on the circulation.
                    The beautiful net-work formed by the inosculating branches of the pulmonary
                    capillaries was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499472" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9472-0645"
                    />first observed by Malpighi, and has received the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pete</hi><hi rend="italic">mirabile</hi><hi rend="italic">Malpighi.</hi> The
                    pulmonary veins are wholly destitute of valves, not being exposed to variations
                    of pressure from the actions of the surrounding muscles. They are furnished,
                    like the venae cavae, with a reinforcement of muscular fibres, in the
                    neighbourhood of the left auricle in which they terminate.</p>
                <p>(467∙) In one respect, the vessels of the pulmonary circulation differ from those
                    of the systemic, namely, that the arteries are carrying dark-coloured blood, and
                    the veins florid blood; the former being termed <hi rend="italic">venous,</hi>
                    from having the qualities of that which is returned by the veins of the system;
                    the latter being termed <hi rend="italic">arterial,</hi> because it has the
                    qualities of that which circulates in the systemic arteries.</p>
                <p>CHAP. VIII RESPIRATION.</p>
                <p>(468.) The object of the function of respiration is the conversion of venous into
                    arterial blood, by its exposure to the chemical influence of atmospheric air
                    received into the lungs. This arterialization of the blood is a process more
                    essential to the continuance of life than even the assimilation of aliment. The
                    necessity for air is more imperious than the demand for food; and the
                    interruption to its supply cannot be continued for a few minutes without being
                    fatal to life. In comparing the extent to which this function is carried on in
                    the different classes of animals, we shall find that in general the intensity of
                    all the vital actions is nearly in proportion to the perfection in which the
                    objects of this function are accomplished.</p>
                <p>(469∙) The consideration of the function of respiration, then, comprises an
                    inquiry into the three following objects; first, the mechanical means by which
                    the air is alternately admitted and discharged from the lungs; secondly, the
                    provision made for bringing the blood to the lungs, and exposing it to the
                    action of the air; and, lastly, the chemical changes which are produced on the
                    blood by the action of the air in that organ. The means of fulfilling the second
                    of these objects has already been sufficiently explained in the account we have
                    just given of the circulation. It remains, therefore, that we consider the
                    firstand third branches of the inquiry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I— <hi rend="italic">Mechanism of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Respiration.</hi></p>
                <p>(470.) The anatomical structure of the organs of respiration, namely, the lungs
                    with its air passages, including the trachea, bronchiae, and air cells, together
                    with the general conical cavity of the thorax, bounded by the sternum in front,
                    the spine behind, and the ribs on every other side, while its lower side, or
                    basis of the cone, is closed by the diaphragm, have already been fully detailed
                    in the treatise on <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy,</hi> to which it is only
                    necessary here to refer.</p>
                <p>(471.) The mechanical act of respiration is divisible into two periods, that of
                    <hi rend="italic">inspiration,</hi> during which air is drawn into the lungs, so
                    as to distend their vesicles, and <hi rend="italic">expiration,</hi> during
                    which the air which had been so received is expelled.</p>
                <p>(472.) Inspiration is accomplished by enlarging the capacity of the thorax in all
                    its dimensions. This is effected by the action of different sets of muscles. The
                    principal muscle of inspiration is the diaphragm, which has an arched form, the
                    convexity being towards the chest. Its attachments by radiating fibres arising
                    from a central tendinous portion, and inserted into the ribs which form the
                    lower margin of the chest, are such, that when they contract they draw down the
                    middle tendon, and render the diaphragm more flat than it was before. Hence the
                    space above is enlarged. The flattening of the diaphragm takes place chiefly in
                    the fleshy lateral portions, but the middle tendon is also slightly
                    depressed.</p>
                <p>(473.) The second set of muscles employed in inspiration are those which elevate
                    the ribs; and the principal of these are the two layers of intercostal muscles.
                    Each rib is capable of a small degree of motion on the extremity by which it is
                    articulated with the vertebrae. This motion is chiefly an upward and a downward
                    motion. But since the ribs, as they advance from the spine towards the sternum,
                    bend downwards in their course, the effect of the vertical motion just described
                    will be that of raising the sternum, and increasing its distance from the spine;
                    enlarging, consequently, the capacity of the chest. The intercostal muscles are
                    disposed in two layers, each passing obliquely, but with opposite inclinations,
                    from one rib to the adjacent rib. Hence they act with the advantage of oblique
                    muscles on the principles formerly explained.</p>
                <p>(474.) Thus there are two ways in which the chest may be dilated; first, by the
                    diaphragm, and, secondly, by the muscles which elevate the ribs. In general,
                    when the respiration is natural and unconstrained, we chiefly breathe by means
                    of the diaphragm; but we also employ the intercostal muscles when the
                    respiration is quickened or impeded by any cause. If respiration should be
                    rendered difficult several other muscles are called into play in aid of the
                    intercostals; namely, the great muscles situated in the back and sides, which
                    connect the ribs to the spine and to the scapula; and several of the muscles of
                    the neck are also thrown into action as auxiliaries on these occasions, when the
                    respiration becomes laborious.</p>
                <p>(475.) The glottis is kept open, during inspiration, by the muscles of the larynx
                    which perform that office; and when a forcible inspiration is made, the nostrils
                    are expanded, the lower jaw depressed, and every action which can in the
                    remotest degree concur in the effect of removing all obstruction to the passage
                    of the air into the trachea, is exerted.</p>
                <p>(476.) Having thus shown how the cavity of the thorax is dilated, let us next
                    trace the effect of this expansion upon the lungs. It is obvious, that if when,
                    by the descent of the diaphragm and elevation of the ribs, the cavity of the
                    chest is enlarged, the lungs were to remain in their original situation, an
                    empty space would be left between them and the sides of the chest. But no vacuum
                    can ever take place in the living body; the air already present in the air-cells
                    of the lungs must, by its elasticity, expand these organs; and the external air,
                    having access to them by means of the trachea, will rush in through that tube in
                    order to restore the equilibrium. This, then, is <hi rend="italic"
                    >inspiration.</hi></p>
                <p>(477.) The expulsion of the air from the lungs constitutes <hi rend="italic"
                    >expiration.</hi> This takes place as soon as the air which had been inspired
                    has lost a certain portion of its oxygen, and received in return a certain
                    quantity of carbonic acid gas and of watery vapour, by having had communication
                    with the blood in the pulmonary capillaries. When thus contaminated it excites
                    an uneasy sensation in the chest, and the intercostal muscles relaxing, the ribs
                    fall into their original situation, and the relaxed diaphragm is pushed upwards
                    by the action of the abdominal muscles. The lungs, being compressed, expel the
                    air they had received, and this air escapes through the trachea. The movements
                    of inspiration are in like manner prompted by an uneasy sensation consequent
                    upon the presence of venous blood in the pulmonary system.</p>
                <p>(478.) Thus the lungs are merely passive agents in the mechanism of respiration;
                    for it does not appear that they have, as was at one time supposed, any inherent
                    power of extension or contraction, if we except only that arising from the
                    elasticity which they possess in common with all membranous textures. Hence, if
                    an opening be made in the sides of the chest, the lung on that side immediately
                    collapses, in consequence of the internal pressure of the air against its
                    air-cells, which kept the lung expanded, being <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499485" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9485-0646"/>balanced by the external
                    pressure of the atmosphere which has been admitted on the outer surface of the
                    lung.</p>
                <p>(479∙) The alternations of inspiration anu expiration, which together constitute
                    one act of breathing, take place, in ordinary health, about once for every four
                    pulsations of the heart; and as both are generally accelerated in the same
                    proportion, the same rule usually holds good in states of disease.</p>
                <p>(480.) The quantity of air taken into the lungs at each inspiration has been very
                    variously estimated by different experimentalists. It differs, indeed,
                    considerably in different persons, and in different states of the system; but
                    from the concurrent testimony of the most accurate experimentalists, the average
                    quantity appears to be about forty cubic inches. By a forcible expiration there
                    may be expelled, in addition to this quantity, about a hundred and seventy
                    inches more. But even after this effort has been made, there still remain about
                    a hundred and twenty cubic inches in the lungs; so that, adding all these
                    quantities together, it will appear that the lungs are capable of containing,
                    while in their most expanded state, after ordinary inspiration, about three
                    hundred and thirty cubic inches of air. One eighth of the whole contents of the
                    lungs, therefore, is changed at each respiration. If we suppose that we respire
                    twenty times each minute, the quantity of air respired during twenty-four hours
                    will amount to six hundred and sixty-six cubic feet.<note anchored="true"

                <p>(481.) Before we inquire into the changes produced on the blood by its exposure
                    to the air in the lungs, it will be proper to notice the changes which the air
                    undergoes by this process. The air of the atmosphere is found by chemical
                    analysis to consist of seventy-nine per cent of nitrogen, twenty of oxygen, and
                    one of carbonic acid.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The recent experiments of De Saussure tend to show that the proportional
                    quantity of carbonic acid gas in atmospheric air is even less than this. He
                    estimates it at only four parts by volume in a million volumes of
                    air.</p></note> When expired, the principal change which has taken place in it
                    is the substitution of a certain quantity, which, on an average, is about seven
                    and a half per cent, of carbonic acid gas for a nearly equal quantity of oxygen
                    gas, and the addition of a quantity of aqueous vapour. Air which has passed
                    through the lungs only once is incapable of supporting the combustion of a
                    taper, which is accordingly extinguished the moment it is immersed in the air.
                    The weight of the oxygen consumedin the air respiredin the course of a day, will
                    be found to amount to about two pounds and a quarter avoirdupois, or nearly
                    15,500 grains, occupying in its gaseous state a volume of 45,000 cubic inches,
                    ora little more than 26 cubic feet. The quantity of carbonic acid expelled from
                    the lungs is somewhat less than this; its total bulk in the twenty-four hours
                    amounting on an average only to 40,000 cubic inches, or 23*2 cubic feet. Its
                    total weight is 18,600 grains, or 2∙86 pounds avoirdupois. The weight of the
                    quantity of carbon contained in this amount of carbonic acid is 5,208 grains, or
                    very nearly three quarters of a pound; and that of the quantity of oxygen is
                    13,392 grains. Hence the quantity of oxygen which disappears from the air
                    respired, over and above that which enters into the composition of the carbonic
                    acid gas, is 2,108 grains, and had occupied, while in a* gaseous state, 5000
                    cubic inches. The only way in which we account for the disappearance of this
                    oxygen is, by supposing it to have been absorbed by the blood.</p>
                <p>(482.) The numbers given above are, of course, to be taken as imperfect
                    approximations to the truth, being deduced as the mean of the best authenticated
                    observations, in which, however, there exist such great discrepancies as to
                    render any accurate appreciations nearly hopeless. An excellent summary of the
                    results which have been arrived at by different experimentalists, with critical
                    remarks on their respective values, will be found in <hi rend="italic">Dr.
                    Bostock</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Elementary System of Physiology.</hi><note

                <p>(483.) Much difference of opinion has prevailed with respect to the absorption or
                    evolution of nitrogen during respiration. From the accurate experiments on this
                    subject made by Dr. Edwards, it appears that on some occasions there is a small
                    increase, and in others a diminution of the nitrogen of the air respired. But
                    the limits within which we must confine ourselves in this treatise, forbid our
                    entering into the experimental details from which this conclusion is
                    deduced.</p>
                <p>(484.) The quantity of water exhaled from the lungs in the course of a day, has
                    been estimated by Dr. Thomson at nineteen ounces, and by Dr. Dalton at
                    twenty-four.</p>
                <p>(485.) It should be observed, however, that the quantity of carbonic acid thrown
                    off' from the lungs, is liable to great variation from several causes; it has
                    been found by Dr. Prout to be greatest at noon, and least at midnight. It has
                    also been ascertained that it is less in youth than in middle age; and that it
                    is diminished by causes which induce fatigue or lessen the vital energies.</p>
                <p>(486.) We have next to inquire what changes have, in the meanwhile, been effected
                    in the blood by the action of the air to which it has been subjected in the
                    lungs. A visible alteration in the first place, is produced in its colour,
                    which, from being of a dark purple, nearly approaching to black, when it arrives
                    at the air cells by the pulmonary arteries, has acquired the bright intensely
                    scarlet hue of arterial blood when brought back to the heartby the pulmonary
                    veins. In other respects, however,its sensible qualities do not appear to have
                    undergone any material change. Judging from the changes produced on the air
                    which has beca.in contact with it, we are warranted in the inference that it has
                    parted with a certain quantity of carbonic acid and of water, and that it has in
                    return acquired a certain proportion of oxygen. Since it has been found that the
                    quantity of oxygen absorbed, is greater than that which enters into the
                    composition of the carbonic acid evolved, it is obvious that at least the excess
                    of oxygen is directly absorbed by the blood; and this absorption, constitutes,
                    no doubt, an essential part of its arterialization.</p>
                <p>(487.) It has been much disputed whether the combination which seems to be
                    effected between the oxygen of the air and the carbon furnished by the blood,
                    occurs during the act of respiration, and takes place in the air cells of the
                    lungs, or whether it takes place in the course of circulation. On the first
                    hypothesis, the chemical process would be very analogous to the simple
                    combustion of charcoal, which may be conceived to be contained in the venous
                    blood in a free state, exceedingly divided and ready to combine with the oxygen
                    of the air; and imparting to that venous blood its characteristic dark colour;
                    while arterial blood, from which the carbon had been eliminated, would exhibit
                    the red colour natural to blood. On the second hypothesis, we must suppose that
                    the whole of the oxygen which disappears from the air respired, is absorbed by
                    the blood in the pulmonary capillaries, and passes on with it into the systemic
                    circulation. The blood becoming venous in the course of the circulation, by the
                    different processes to which it is subjected for supplying the organs with the
                    materials required in the exercise of their respective functions, the proportion
                    of carbon which it contains is increased, both by the abstraction of the other
                    elements, and by the addition of nutritive materials prepared by the organs <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193499498" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9498-0647"/> of digestion; The
                    oxygen which had been absorbed by the blood in the lungs, now combines with the
                    redundant carbon, and forms with it either oxide of carbon, or carbonic acid,
                    which is exhaled during a subsequent exposure to the air in the lungs. Many
                    facts tend strongly to confirm our belief in the latter of these hypotheses.</p>
                <p>(488.) It appears from a multitude of experiments, as well as from observations
                    of the phenomena which take place in asphyxia, (that is, in the suspension of
                    the vital actions from an interruption to respiration, as in hanging or
                    drowning, or immersion in any gas not fitted for respiration,) that if the blood
                    be not arterialized, and if, retaining its venous character, it be circulated in
                    that state through the arteries of the system, it will act as a poison to the
                    organs to which it is sent, destroying both the nervous and sensorial powers,
                    and impairing the irritability of the muscles; and that this is the cause of the
                    rapidity with which death ensues under these circumstances. It thus appears that
                    respiration requires to be constantly kept up in order to free the blood from
                    the continual additions of carbon which are made to it by the various processes
                    of assimilation and absorption. It is also a principal agent in perfecting the
                    animalization of the chyle, which is added to the blood, and in converting it
                    into fibrin.</p>

                    Temperature.</hi></p>
                <p>(489∙) Since we find that the human body, as well as those of all warm-blooded
                    animals, is constantly maintained during life at a temperature higher than that
                    of the surrounding medium, at least in temperate climates, it becomes
                    interesting to inquire into the sources whence this heat is evolved. The union
                    of carbon and oxygen which takes place in consequence of respiration, is the
                    most obvious of these souries; and suggests that the evolution of animal heat
                    takes place in a manner somewhat analogous to the ordinary combustion of
                    carbonaceous fuel. The circumstance of the equable heat of every part of the
                    body, excepting the immediate surface where it is cooled by the contact of the
                    air, and by cutaneous perspiration, would be in perfect accordance with the
                    theory of Dr. Crawford already explained; for if the combination of oxygen with
                    carbon take place gradually in the course of the circulation, it will follow
                    that the evolution of heat will also take place at the same time, and in the
                    vessels employed in the circulation. Or even if the combination took place in
                    the lungs, if it could be shewn, as Dr. Crawford endeavoured to prove, that
                    arterial blood has a greater capacity for caloric than venous blood, all the
                    heat that would have been evolved in the pulmonary vessels would be absorbed by
                    the arterial blood, and given out in the course of its circulation, during its
                    gradual conversion into venous blood, which has a less capacity for caloric.</p>
                <p>(490.) It would appear, however, from some recent experiments of Dulong and
                    Despretz,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Mid er’s
                    Physiology, by Baly, p. 83∙</p></note> that only three-fourths of the whole
                    quantity of caloric produced by the living system can be explained by the
                    combination of oxygen with carbon in respiration. Probably, therefore, several
                    of the other chemical changes induced on the blood by the processes of secretion
                    and nutrition, contribute to the further evolution of caloric, and to the
                    maintenance of the animal temperature. This evolution appears, although
                    primarily dependent on respiration, to be in a great measure controlled by the
                    action of the nervous powers; and to be regulated by a variety of circumstances
                    in the condition of the other functions, especially that of the circulation,
                    which are very imperfectly known; and the inquiry into which would lead us into
                    a field of discussion far too extensive for the limits within which we must
                    confine ourselves in the present treatise. We must content ourselves, therefore,
                    with again referring to the work of Dr. Bostock for more ample information on
                    these subjects.</p>
                <p>CHAP. IX. SECRETION.</p>
                <p>(49I.) Secretion is that function by which various substances are either
                    separated from the blood or formed from it, in order to be applied to some
                    useful purpose in the economy. We have noticed, in the course of the preceding
                    inquiries, several instances of fluids prepared from the blood, and rendered
                    subservient to different uses in the economy. The saliva, the gastric and
                    pancreatic juices, the bile, and the mucus lubricating the surface of the
                    alimentary canal, are all examples of secretions subservient to digestion and
                    assimilation.</p>
                <p>(492.) Such being the general purpose answered by this function, we have first to
                    examine the apparatus provided for its performance; secondly, the nature of the
                    effects obtained; and, thirdly, the peculiar powers which are concerned in their
                    production.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I— <hi rend="italic">Apparatus for
                    Secretion.</hi></p>
                <p>(493.) The apparatus employed by nature for the performance of secretion varies
                    considerably in its structure, in different instances, according to the nature
                    of the product which is to result from the operation; and according as that
                    product is merely separated from the blood, in which it may already have
                    existed, or is formed by the combination of certain elements and proximate
                    principles furnished by that fluid. In the simplest cases, where that product is
                    principally aqueous, and apparently consists of nothing more than the serous
                    portion of the blood separated from it by mere transudation, we find no other
                    organs requisite than those smooth membranous surfaces which we have already
                    described under the name of <hi rend="italic">serous membranes.</hi> The mucous
                    secretions proceed, in like manner, from the modified, yet still simple action
                    of a membranous surface, of a rather more refined structure, namely, the <hi
                    rend="italic">mucous membranes.</hi> The more elaborate products of secretion,
                    on the other hand, which are apparently formed by combinations of pre-existing
                    elements, are obtained by the agency of organs of a more complicated structure,
                    which are denominated <hi rend="italic">glands.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Sect.</hi> II— <hi rend="italic">Glandular Apparatus.</hi></p>
                <p>(494.) The essential part of the structure of a gland consists in a collection of
                    tubes, more or less convoluted, united by cellular substance into masses of a
                    rounded form, constituting a <hi rend="italic">lobule.</hi> Each lobule has a
                    separate investment of membrane; and the whole aggregate of lobules is furnished
                    with a general membranous envelope, or capsule. In every gland we meet with a
                    complex arrangement of numerous arteries, veins, nerves, and lymphatics,
                    provided with ramified excretory ducts, which conduct away the secreted matter
                    that has been prepared in the substance of the gland.</p>
                <p>(495.) The above description of a gland does not include those organs, which,
                    although resembling the proper glands in their general appearance, perform no
                    distinct office of secretion, and are therefore unprovided with any excretory
                    duct. This is the case with those bodies belonging to the absorbent system,
                    which bear improperly the title of <hi rend="italic">lymphatic</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">conglobate glands.</hi> The spleen, the renal capsules, the pineal
                    gland, the thyroid gland, and the thymus, are, in like manner, improperly
                    included in the class of glands; for we have no evidence of their secreting any
                    fluid, and indeed know nothing of their real functions.</p>
                <p>(496.) The catalogue of glands, strictly answering to the definition, will
                    comprise the following organs, namely, the liver, pancreas, and kidneys; the
                    salivary, lacrymal, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499511"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9511-0648"/>meibomian glands; the tonsils, the ceruminous
                    glands of the ear, and the sebaceous glands of the face; the mammae, the
                    prostate, the testicle, Cowper’s glands, the glandulae odoriferae, and the
                    extensive system of mucous glands about the head and trunk. These parts,
                    although differing widely from each other in many respects, agree in a
                    sufficient number of particulars to allow of being classed together in one
                    organic system, which Bichat has termed the <hi rend="italic">glandular
                    system.</hi></p>
                <p>(497∙) Most of the glands are arranged in pairs, as the kidneys, testicles,
                    salivary and lacrymal glands, while others are single, as the liver and the
                    pancreas.</p>
                <p>(498.) The organization of the glandular system is exceedingly complex, and
                    cannot be unravelled without great difficulty. The tissue of which they arc
                    composed presents us with no regular arrangement of fibres, such as we see in
                    the muscles, ligaments, nerves, or bones; but the whole structure is made up of
                    a congeries of vessels and cells, having no very firm cohesion amongst
                    themselves, and hence admitting very readily of being separated by slight
                    mechanical causes. While organs which have a more extensive fibrous organization
                    possess considerable powers of resistance, a very moderate degree of violence is
                    sufficient to tear asunder the texture of a gland. The resistance in the latter
                    case is ow ing solely to the cohesion of the cellular tissue which connects
                    their parts, and which differs in its density and strength in different
                    glands.</p>
                <p>(499∙) There are three different ways in which the glandular tissue, or <hi
                    rend="italic">parenchyma</hi> of glands, as it has been gene-nerally termed, is
                    disposed. In those glands which have been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >conglomerate,</hi> a term which, as we have seen, has been used in
                    contradistinction to the <hi rend="italic">conglobate,</hi> or lymphatic glands,
                    the organ is made up of distinct portions, connected together by a large
                    quantity of loose cellular tissue, in the intervals of which the vessels and
                    nerves are situated. These larger lobes are again made up of smaller lobes
                    united in the same way. By successive divisions we obtain smaller and smaller
                    component portions, till we arrive at last at very small bodies still visible to
                    the naked eye, and which are called by anatomists <hi rend="italic">glandular
                    acini.</hi> These successive lobules are firmer in proportion as they are
                    smaller, being surrounded and connected with the adjoining portions by shorter
                    and denser cellular substance. The second, third, and even the fourth
                    subdivisions of these lobes may easily be followed with the scalpel. The acini
                    themselves are of a roundish figure and pale colour, and readily distinguishable
                    from other parts by the absence of fibres. The microscope shows them, however,
                    to be still farther divisible into smaller portions, between which are seen
                    plates of cellular substance, and if we attempt to pursue these subdivisions
                    with successively greater magnifying powers, we do not find that we can reach
                    their limit. The above description is particularly applicable to the salivary,
                    lacrymal and pancreatic glands.</p>
                <p>(500.) The second modification of glandular structure occurs in the liver and the
                    kidneys, in which it is impossible to trace these successive divisions into
                    lobules, after we have distinguished the primary lobes which they present. Their
                    structure exhibits an uniform and even tissue, made up of glandular acini,
                    closely united together into one substance. The connecting cellular substance,
                    if any such exist, is very short and small in quantity; and hence these organs
                    may be torn asunder with great ease, and their ruptured surfaces present the
                    appearance of granulations.</p>
                <p>(501.) The third description of glands applies to the prostate, to the tonsils,
                    and in general to all the mucous glands.</p>
                <p>(502.) On examining the course of the blood-vessels, the small arteries which
                    enter into a gland are found to ramify in various ways through a mass of
                    cellular texture. But it is a matter of great uncertainty w hat specific
                    structure intervenes between the secreting arteries and the commencement of the
                    excretory ducts. Two opinions have long divided anatomists on this subject.
                    Malpighi, who was one of the first who investigated the minute anatomy of
                    glands, asserted that the acini invariably contain a central cavity, or <hi
                    rend="italic">follicle,</hi> as it was termed, on the inner surface of which the
                    arteries are distributed, while the secreted fluid is collected in the follicle,
                    and conveyed away by the branch of the excretory duct which arises from the
                    follicle. He considered the mucous glands of the alimentary canal, which
                    undoubtedly present a structure of this kind, as the most simple forms of
                    glandular structure; the larger glands being only aggregations of these simpler
                    structures.</p>
                <p>(503.) The theory of Ruysch, who also bestowed extraordinary care in the
                    examination of glandular structures, is founded on the supposed continuity of
                    the extremities of the arteries with the commencements of the excretory duct.
                    This theory is so far opposed to that of Malpighi, that it pre-supposes all the
                    glands to consist merely of an assemblage of vessels and of cellular substance,
                    without any membranous cavities interposed between the arteries and excretory
                    ducts. The opportunities of dissection which Ruysch enjoyed, and his unrivalled
                    skill in the arts of injecting the vessels, and tracing their modes of
                    distribution, gave great weight to his opinions, which seemed to be immediate
                    deductions from what he saw, and had established as matters of fact. Fluids
                    could be made by injection to pass very readily from the blood-vessels into the
                    excretory ducts, both in the kidneys and liver. After these organs have been
                    accurately injected, they may be resolved, by subsequent maceration, into small
                    clusters of blood-vessels; what Malpighi had represented as hollow acini, seemed
                    to be in reality composed of a congeries of these minute vessels. This appeal to
                    the evidence of the senses, and the admirable preparations which supported it,
                    brought over almost all the anatomists of that time to the opinion of Ruysch;
                    and Boerhaave himself, who had been a zealous defender of the doctrine of
                    Malpighi, and written in support of it, was at length induced to adopt the views
                    of Ruysch.</p>
                <p>(504.) This controversy was sustained for a great many years in the schools of
                    medicine; and the opinions of anatomists continue even at the present time to be
                    divided upon this subject. Probably both these opinions may in part be correct,
                    as applied to different glands, though not universally true; and secretion may
                    perhaps be in some cases performed by continuous vessels, and in others by an
                    interposed parenchyma,ofacellularor more intricate organic apparatus.</p>
                <p>(505.) As the structure of the secreting organs admits of great variety, it may
                    be useful to advert to some of the terms by which these minute parts have been
                    designated. The terms <hi rend="italic">acini, cotulae, cryptae,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">folliculi,</hi><hi rend="italic">glandulae, lacunoe,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">loculi, utriculi,</hi> have been almost promiscuously used; being,
                    as Bell humorously observes, “so many names for bundles, bags, bottles, holes,
                    and partitions.” The term <hi rend="italic">acinus</hi> has been already
                    explained, (§ 499). <hi rend="italic">Cotulae</hi> are merely superficial
                    hollows, from the surface of which the secretion is poured forth. A <hi
                    rend="italic">crypta</hi> is a soft body, consisting of vessels not completely
                    surrounded with a membrane, but resolvable by boiling or maceration. <hi
                    rend="italic">Follicles</hi> are little bags appended to the extremity of the
                    ducts, into which the secretion is made, and from which it is carried off by the
                    ducts. <hi rend="italic">Lacunoe</hi> are little sacs, opening largely into
                    certain passages, and into which generally mucus is secreted.</p>
                <p>(506.) The <hi rend="italic">excretory ducts,</hi> whatever may be their exact
                    origin, consist at first of an infinite number of capillary tubes, which, like
                    the veins, soon unite together into more considerable tubes. These generally
                    pursue a straight course through the glandular tissue, unite with one another,
                    and form at last one or more large tubes. The only exception to this general
                    proposition occurs in the excretory ducts of the testicle, which pur <hi
                    rend="subscript"> s</hi> ue a singularly tortuous course before they unite into
                    the vas deferens on each side.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499524" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9524-0649"/>
                <p>(507.) There are three varieties in the mode of termination, with regard to the
                    excretory ducts of glands. In the first case, the ducts unite into several
                    distinct tubes, which open separately, and without any previous communication.
                    Sometimes these separate apertures are met with in a more or less distinct
                    prominence, as in the breasts, the prostate, and the sublingual glands. At other
                    times, the orifices are found in a depression, or kind of cul-de-sac, as in the
                    tonsils, and in the foramen coecum of the tongue. In the second case, which
                    includes the greater number of glands, their fluids are poured out by a single
                    tube, having a simple orifice. In the third case, some glands deposit the
                    produce of their secretion in a reservoir, where it is retained, in order to be
                    expelled at particular times: as is exemplified in the kidneys, liver, and
                    testicles. In this case there must be two excretory tubes; one to convey the
                    secretion from the gland to the reservoir, and the other to transmit it to its
                    final destination. The size of the excretory ducts will, of course, be regulated
                    very much by their number: when several are produced from one gland, they are
                    very small, and sometimes scarcely perceptible. Those which are single are
                    longer with reference to the size of the gland, and generally pass for some
                    distance, after quitting the gland. In the pancreas, however, this is not the
                    case, the common duct being concealed in the substance of the gland.</p>
                <p>(508.) Whatever the arrangement of the excretory ducts may be, they all pour
                    their fluids, either on the surface of the body, or on the surface of some of
                    the mucous membranes. In no instance do they terminate on serous or synovial
                    surfaces, or in the common cellular membrane. All the excretory ducts are
                    themselves, indeed, provided with an internal mucous membrane, which is a
                    continuation of the cutaneous, or mucous surface on which they terminate. In
                    addition to this they are furnished with an exterior coat, formed of a dense and
                    compact membranous and fibrous substance. Every excretory duct may therefore be
                    considered as made up of these two coats, namely the external one, which is
                    membranous, and the internal one, which is mucous.</p>
                <p>(509∙) Among the latest theories relating to the structure of the organs of
                    secretion, is that adopted by Müller,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>De Glandularum Secernentium Stmctura, &amp;c. Lipsiae.
                    1830.</p></note> who conceives that the glandular organization consists
                    essentially of a modification of the excretory duct, the remote extremity of
                    which, or that most distant from the discharging orifice, is closed; and the
                    particles of which exhibit a fine net-work, or plexus of minute blood-vessels,
                    whence the secretion is in the first place derived, and afterwards conveyed away
                    by the duct, into the cavity of which it is poured. The duct itself may be
                    variously divided and subdivided; and its trunk and ramifications may be
                    variously contorted and convoluted in different cases, without, however,
                    constituting any material difference in its essential structure.</p>

                <p>(510.) The classification of the various secretions which are met with in the
                    system has been attempted by different physiologists, but great difficulty has
                    presented itself in fixing on a principle susceptible of being practically
                    applied to substances of such different chemical and mechanical properties, as
                    are those which are to be the subjects of this arrangement. Haller,<note

                    ><p>Physiology, p 480.</p></note> distributes the secretions under the eight
                    heads of the aqueous, the albuminous, the mucous, the gelatinous, the fibrinous,
                    the oleaginous, the resinous, and the saline; an arrangement which, in a
                    chemical point of view, is the clearest and most natural that has yet been
                    devised. We shall briefly notice these several classes in the order above
                    stated.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Aqueous Secretions.</hi></p>
                <p>(512.) The aqueous secretions are those which consist almost entirely of water,
                    and of which the properties depend principally on its watery part; any other
                    ingredient it may contain being in too small a quantity to give it any specific
                    characters. The two secretions which are referable to this class are the
                    cutaneous perspiration, and the exhalation from the lungs.</p>
                <p>(513.) With regard to the fluid of perspiration, it seems doubtful whether it
                    contains any ingredients that are constantly present in it, or that are
                    essential to its nature. It appears to differ, indeed, considerably in different
                    individuals; and varies even in the same individual, according to the state of
                    the system. Its analysis was attempted by Berthollet, and afterwards by
                    Fourcroy; but the most complete examination into its properties is that of
                    Thenard, who considers it to be essentially acid, and that acid to be the
                    acetic. He found in it, also, an appreciable quantity of the muriates of soda
                    and of potass, with traces of the earthy phosphates and of oxide of iron,
                    together with a very minute quantity of animal matter. Berzelius, on the other
                    hand, who has examined this fluid still more recently, finds the free acid to be
                    the lactic, accompanied with the lactate of soda. An elaborate analysis of the
                    fluid of perspiration in a person labouring under disease, has also been made by
                    Dr. Bostock.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Medico
                    Chirurgical Transaction', xiv. 424.</p></note> The aqueous exhalations from the
                    lungs appears to be so perfectly similar to that from the skin, as not to
                    require further notice.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Albuminous Secretions.</hi></p>
                <p>(514.) The albuminous class of secretions are numerous, and comprehend both solid
                    and fluid substances. We have already seen that all membranous and fibrous
                    textures, but especially the latter, are composed principally of a material
                    corresponding in its chemical properties to coagulated albumen, (See § 165). But
                    there are many fluid secretions which contain large proportions of this
                    ingredient in an uncoagulated, or liquid state; such as the secretion which
                    exudes from serous membranes, and also occupies the interstices of the cellular
                    texture, and which has been termed the <hi rend="italic">liquid of
                    surfaces,</hi> (See § 135). This fluid also contains, besides coagulable
                    albumen, an animal matter similar to that which is found in the serosity of the
                    blood, and a small quantity of the usual saline matters which enter into the
                    composition of almost all animal products.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Mucous Secretions.</hi></p>
                <p>(515.) The mucous secretions are characterised by the presence of a substance
                    which does not pre-exist in the blood, but which is prepared by a proper
                    secretory or glandular action. The properties of this substance, or <hi
                    rend="italic">mucus,</hi> have been already noticed, (§ 301). To the head of the
                    mucous secretions, Dr. Bostock is inclined to refer also the saliva, the gastric
                    and pancreatic juices, the tears, and the semen.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499537" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9537-0650"/>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Gelatinous Secretions.</hi></p>
                <p>(516.) The gelatinous secretions derivetheir essential character from the
                    predominance of gelatin in their composition. This substance is found in great
                    abundance in most of the solids, and particularly in the membranous structures.
                    It is strictly a product of secretion; for it is not met with in the blood, and
                    must therefore be formed by some chemical change in the elements of the blood,
                    from which the materials for its preparation are derived. There is reason to
                    believe, from the discovery of Mr. Hatchett of the possibility of converting
                    albumen into gelatin by digestion in diluted nitric acid, during which the
                    albumen combines with an additional quantity of oxygen, that some change
                    analogous to this is effected in the living body during the process of its
                    secretion. The characteristic properties of gelatin have already been noticed,
                    (§ 279∙)</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The Fibrinous Secretions.</hi></p>
                <p>(517.) The fibrinous secretions compose the fifth class, and are so named from
                    their correspondence in chemical properties to the fibrin of the blood, which
                    fibrin is probably the source from whence these secretions derive this
                    ingredient. They constitute the organic products most completely animalized in
                    their chemical constitution; and they at the same time retain, in their physical
                    properties, the peculiar cohesive tendency and fibrous character of the
                    substance from which they are produced. The muscular fibre is the principal, if
                    not the only substance which comes under this head.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">The Oleaginous Secretions.</hi></p>
                <p>(518.) The oleaginous secretions derive their essential character from the
                    presence of an oily ingredient. They compose a numerous and varied class,
                    comprehending those in which the oil forms the greatest part of the substance,
                    and those in which it is more or less mixed with a large proportion of other
                    animal principles. The fat is the principal secretion included in the first
                    division; a substance which, from its being extensively deposited in various
                    parts of the body, must evidently be formed by some peculiar action of the
                    capillary system of vessels. As it consists almost wholly of hydrogen and
                    carbon, we must conclude that its formation is effected by the exclusion of
                    nitrogen and oxygen from the proximate elements of the blood, and the consequent
                    intimate combinations of their carbon and hydrogen. It is well known that the
                    formation of fat, by whatever chemical operation it may be effected, often
                    proceeds with great rapidity, whenever circumstances favour its production. The
                    marrow, as was formerly observed, belongs also to this class of secretions. Dr.
                    Bostock is disposed to refer to the same head the substance termed <hi
                    rend="italic">Cholesterine,</hi> which forms the basis of biliary calculi.</p>
                <p>(519·) Milk is a secretion owing its principal characters to the oil which it
                    contains, and which is combined with albumen, so as to form a kind of natural
                    emulsion. When collected in a separate mass, it forms the well-known substance
                    termed <hi rend="italic">butter.</hi> The oily particles are, however, in the
                    original state of milk, merely diffused by mechanical mixture throughout the
                    watery fluid, as is evident from the appearance of milk under the microscope,
                    when it exhibits a multitude of extremely minute globules, swimming in a
                    transparent liquor. The size of these globules has been variously estimated by
                    different observers, and indeed appears to be by no means uniform, varying in
                    different instances from the 10,000th to the 5000th of an inch in diameter.
                    These oily globules have a tendency to adhere together when the milk is allowed
                    to rest, and in the course of a few hours collect at the surface in the form of
                    cream, and by further coalescence they compose <hi rend="italic">butter.</hi>
                    The albumen may be obtained from the remaining fluid by the ordinary means of
                    coagulation, and constitutes curd, which, as is well known, is the basis of <hi
                    rend="italic">cheese.</hi> The clarified liquor which remains, yields, by
                    evaporation, a saccharine substance capable of being crystallized, and which is
                    known under the name of <hi rend="italic">sugar of milk.</hi> It differs from
                    common sugar by being less soluble in water, and by its total insolubility in
                    alcohol. Milk contains, besides these ingredients, several saline substances, as
                    the muriate and sulphate of potass, the phosphates of lime and of iron, and also
                    a peculiar animal matter, which yields a precipitate with infusion of galls.
                    Milk is found to differ from the blood, and from most of the animal fluids, by
                    the base of its salts being potass instead of soda. A peculiar acid, called the
                    <hi rend="italic">lactic·,</hi> is formed by the fermentation of milk, and even
                    alcohol may be obtained during this process. By the action of nitric acid on the
                    lactic acid, a new acid is produced, termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >saccholactic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mucic acid,</hi> which unites readily
                    with alkaline or earthy bases, and forms a peculiar class of salts.</p>
                <p>(520.) The substance of the brain bears a considerable analogy to the oleaginous
                    secretions, more especially to that of milk; for it consists of albumen
                    intimately combined with a peculiar oily ingredient. Rather more than one-fourth
                    of its solid substance consists, according to Vauquelin,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Annales de Chimie, lxxxi. p. 37.</p></note>
                    of a fatty substance, and nearly one-third of albumen; the remainder being
                    composed of osmazome, phosphorus, acids, salts, and sulphur.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">The Resinous Secretions.</hi></p>
                <p>(521.) The resinous secretions, which compose the seventh class, derive their
                    specific characters from an ingredient which is soluble in alcohol, and is
                    analogous to resin. Of these the most remarkable is the substance which
                    constitutes the basis, or specific ingredient, of bile. (See § 366.)</p>
                <p>(522.) In connexion with the process of secretion which takes place in the liver,
                    we have here to notice the remarkable peculiarity which occurs in the mode in
                    which the blood is circulated through that organ. The liver is supplied, like
                    the other organs, with arterial blood, by the hepatic arteries, which are
                    branches from the aorta. But it likewise receives a still larger quantity of
                    venous blood, which is distributed through its substance by a separate set of
                    vessels derived from the venous system. The veins which collect the blood that
                    has circulated in the usual manner through the abdominal viscera unite together
                    into a large trunk, termed the <hi rend="italic">vena portae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and this vein, on entering the liver, ramifies like an
                    artery, and ultimately terminates in the branches of the hepatic veins, which
                    transmit the blood in the ordinary course of circulation to the venae cavae.</p>
                <p>(523 ) This complex arrangement of the vessels which compose the hepatic system
                    has lately been unravelled with singular felicity by Mr. Kiernan, who in a paper
                    contained in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> gives an
                    account of his valuable discoveries, of which we shall present the following
                    abstract. The hepatic veins, together with the lobules which surround them,
                    resemble in their arrangement the branches and leaves of a tree, the substance
                    of the lobules being disposed around the minute branches of the veins like the
                    parenchyma of a leaf around its fibres. The hepatic veins may be divided into
                    two classes, namely, those contained in the lobules, and those contained in
                    canals formed by the lobules. The first class is composed of interlobular
                    branches, one of which occupies the centre of each lobule, and receives the
                    blood from a plexus formed in the lobule by the portal vein; and the second
                    class of hepatic veins is composed of all those vessels contained in canals
                    formed by the lobules, and including numerous small branches, as well as the
                    large trunks terminating in the inferior cava. The external surface of every
                    lobule is covered by an expansion of Glisson’s capsule, by which it is connected
                    to, as well as separated from, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499550"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9550-0651"/>the contiguous lobules, and in which branches of
                    the hepatic duct, portal veins, and hepatic artery, ramify. The ultimate
                    branchesof the hepatic artery terminate in the branches of the portal vein,
                    where the blood they respectively contain is mixed together, and from which
                    mixed blood the bile is secreted by the lobules, and conveyed away by the
                    hepatic ducts which accompany the portal veins in their principal ramifications.
                    The remaining blood is returned to the heart by the hepatic veins, the
                    beginnings of which occupy the centre of each lobule, and when collected into
                    trunks, pour their contents into the inferior cava. Hence the blood which has
                    circulated through the liver, and has thereby lost its arterial character, is,
                    in common with that which is returning from the other abdominal viscera, poured
                    into the vena portae, and contributes its share in furnishing materials for the
                    biliary secretion.</p>
                <p>(524.) The general conclusion which Mr. Kiernan draws from his anatomical
                    researches is, that the hepatic artery is destined solely for the nutrition of
                    the liver, and has no direct connexions, except with the branches of the vena
                    portae, after its own blood has become venalized.</p>
                <p>(525.) Urea is another substance of a resinous nature, which may be ranked among
                    the secretions, and which constitutes the peculiar or specific ingredient in
                    urine. It is remarkable for containing a very large proportion of nitrogen,
                    which is by this channel discharged from the system. This substance has been
                    found in the blood of animals from whom the kidneys had been removed.</p>
                <p>. (526.) The peculiar proximate animal principle, termed by Thenard <hi
                    rend="italic">osmazomx,</hi> is referred by Dr. Bostock to the class of resinous
                    secretions. It was procured originally from the muscular fibre, of which it
                    forms one of the component parts; and it appears to be the ingredient in which
                    the peculiar flavour and odour of the flcsh of animals principally depends. It
                    is found, however, in most of the component parts of the body, as well solids as
                    fluids. The <hi rend="italic">cerumen,</hi> or ear-wax, appears also from the
                    analysis of Vauquelin, to have a relation to the resinous secretions.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">The Saline Secretions.</hi></p>
                <p>(527.) This class comprehends all those fluids in which saline ingredients
                    predominate; they are very numerous, are dispersed over every part of the
                    system, and arc more or less mixed with its constituents. They consist of acids,
                    alkalies, and neutral and earthy salts. The following are the acids entering
                    into the composition of animal substances, and which are, for the most part,
                    united with alkaline or earthy bases; namely, the phosphoric, muriatic,
                    sulphuric, fluoric, lithic, lactic, benzoic, carbonic, and oxalic acids; and
                    perhaps also the rosacic and the amniotic. Soda, potass, and ammonia, are found
                    in almost all animal fluids; but only the first of these is met with in an
                    uncombined state. Of the earths, lime is by far the most abundant; magnesia is
                    found in small quantity, and also silex.</p>
                <p>(428.) With reference to their saline qualities, Dr. Bostock proposes a division
                    of the secretions into four classes. 1. Those which are nearly without any
                    admixture of salts. 2. Those which possess a definite quantity of salts, and
                    these salts different from those which exist in the blood. 3. Those containing
                    salts similar both in their nature and quantity to those of the blood. And, 4.
                    Such as contain salts different from those in the blood, and which are also
                    variable in quantity. The fat, the saliva, the liquor of surfaces, and the
                    urine, may be given as examples of each of these divisions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">Theory of
                    Secretion.</hi></p>
                <p>(529∙) The nature of the powers and processes by which the products of secretion
                    are prepared, is a subject involved in the greatest obscurity. There is scarcely
                    any question in physiology, indeed, the investigation of which presents greater
                    difficulties. At the very outset of the inquiry we are embarrassed by the very
                    imperfect state in which the science of organized chemistry still remains; and
                    it follows as a necessary consequence, that the precise nature of the chemical
                    changes effected during secretion cannot be properly understood. That the
                    operations themselves are of a chemical nature, must be inferred from their
                    results, consisting of substances which differ in most instances very
                    considerably from the constituents of the blood, whence their elements are
                    obtained. The blood is evidently the great reservoir of nutriment, and the
                    fountain whence all the materials of the secretions are derived. In a few
                    instances, as we have seen, the process of secretion appears to consist simply
                    of the separation of some of the proximate principles of the blood. The
                    operation is, in that case, more of a mechanical than of a chemical nature, and
                    is analogous to mere transudation or filtration, subject, however, to a certain
                    power of selection exercised by the secreting organ. In the greater number of
                    instances, however, the product of secretion appears to be a new formation,
                    differing entirely from any of the proximate principles contained in the blood,
                    and resulting therefore from a new combination of its elements.</p>
                <p>(530.) Scarcely any light has been thrown on this mysterious subject by the
                    anatomical investigation of the or <hi rend="subscript">;</hi> gans of
                    secretion. Their intimate structure is generally so minute and complicated, as
                    to elude the severest scrutiny of the anatomist, even when assisted by the best
                    optical instruments. What increases the difficulty of finding any clue to the
                    labyrinth, is, that we often see parts having apparently very different
                    structures giving rise to secretions which are nearly identical in their
                    qualities; and conversely, we see substances having very different properties
                    produced by organs very closely resembling each other in their structure.</p>
                <p>(531.) Sometimes we find no distinct secretory apparatus, the whole process
                    appearing to be conducted in the capillary vessels, out of the sides of which
                    the product seems to transude. In other instances, the secreted fluid exudes
                    from the smooth surface of a membrane, as is the case with the serous secretions
                    in all the closed cavities of the body, such as those of the peritoneum, pleura,
                    pericardium, and pia mater. The matter of perspiration finds its way through the
                    skin and cuticle without any visible ducts or even pores, appearing simply to
                    transude through the bibulous substance of the latter.</p>
                <p>(532.) In other cases we find the secreting membrane furnished with minute
                    processes, or <hi rend="italic">villi,</hi> from the extended surface of which
                    the secretion is produced. At other times, there <hi rend="italic">axe
                    follicles,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">crypts,</hi> as they are called, into which
                    the secreted fluid is poured, and where it is collected previously to its
                    discharge by its appropriate channels. These minute cavities are occasionally
                    grouped together, and covered with a denser investing membrane common to the
                    whole assemblage, constituting the masses which are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >glands.</hi> But no practical advantage has arisen from the technical or
                    anatomical classification of glands, neither has any information of value been
                    gathered from the examination of the mode in which the blood-vessels are
                    distributed in those organs; although this mode of distribution is apparently
                    very different in different cases, each seeming to be intended for the
                    application of some definite but unknown principle of action. Being wholly in
                    the dark with regard to the specific objects intended to be answered, we can
                    form no rational conjecture as to the designs of nature in the contrivances she
                    has adopted. We see, in some instances, the smaller arteries divide suddenly, as
                    soon as they have reached the gland, into very numerous minuter branches, like
                    the fibres of a hair pencil. This has been called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pencillated structure.</hi> The arrangement in other cases is somewhat
                    different, though similar in its principle; the minuter branches spreading out
                    from their origin, like rays <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499563"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9563-0652"/>from a centre, and forming a <hi rend="italic"
                    >stellated structure.</hi> Sometimes we observe the arteries of the secreting
                    organ much twisted and contracted in their course, and collected into spiral
                    coils, before they terminate. All the varieties of secreting organs, as Mr. Mayo
                    observes, appear to be only contrivances for conveniently packing a large extent
                    of vascular surface into a small compass. So intricate, indeed, are those
                    complex arrangements, that it is impossible to attempt to unravel them with any
                    prospect of success. In a word, nothing hitherto known relative to the structure
                    of glands has explained the mode in which they act, or has thrown any light upon
                    the nature of the substances they produce.</p>
                <p>(533.) In this, as in other subjects, where facts are wanting for its
                    elucidation, we find numberless hypotheses proposed in their stead. Secretion
                    was formerly pronounced to be a species of fermentation, by those who could
                    attach no definite idea to the term they employed. Others sought to explain
                    secretion by various mechanical hypotheses, supposing it to be the result of a
                    mere organic filtration of particles already existing in the blood; they racked
                    their imaginations for the invention of forms of apertures and channels capable
                    of admitting particles having corresponding figures, and of refusing a passage
                    to the rest. Leibnitz compared the glands to filters, of which the pores were
                    originally impregnated with a particular fluid, which fluid would therefore be
                    allowed to pass, to the exclusion of all other fluids, in the same manner as a
                    paper impregnated with oil prevents the passage of water, but allows oil to be
                    transmitted. This unchemical theory proceeded on the hypothesis that all the
                    secreted matters pre-exist ready formed in the blood, and require only to be
                    separated by the glands; a supposition of which the later improvements in animal
                    chemistry have sufficiently exposed the falsehood.</p>
                <p>(534.) But even admitting the operation of the secretory organs to be wholly of a
                    chemical nature, we are still completely in the dark as to the means which
                    nature employs in the hidden laboratories of organization; nor do they appear in
                    any way reconcileable to the ordinary laws of chemical affinities to which
                    inorganic substances are obedient. The means employed are superior to mere
                    chemical agency, in the same degree as the operations of chemical affinities
                    transcend those of mechanism. All that we can conceive to be the office of the
                    different series of vessels, which, by ramifying into smaller and smaller tubes,
                    have the effect of subdividing the blood, as by a strainer, to certain degrees
                    of tenuity, is that merely of preparing it for the changes it is to undergo in
                    that stage of the process in which the essential conversion consists. Farther
                    than this we cannot venture to speculate, knowing, as we do, so imperfectly
                    either the changes produced, or the means by which these changes can be
                    effected; unless, indeed, we endeavour to call to our assistance the power of
                    galvanism, which has been, in modern times, proved to be so important and
                    powerful an agent in effecting changes of chemical composition. But the analogy
                    is yet too vague to serve as the basis of any solid theory.</p>
                <p>(535.) There is no doubt that in many cases the process of secretion is
                    considerably influenced by the condition of the nervous powers. Thus the section
                    of the par vagum is invariably followed by the diminution or total suppression
                    of the gastric juice, and by the increase of the secretion of bronchial mucus.
                    Under these circumstances, the secretions of the stomach are restored by
                    directing a stream of galvanic electricity through the nerves that have been
                    divided; a fact which is explicable only in one of two ways, namely, either by
                    supposing that the galvanic influence is the same as the influence derived from
                    the nerves, or that galvanism excites a fresh exertion of the nervous influence,
                    in the portion of the nerve on which its action is directed.</p>
                <p>(536.) On the w hole, as it appears impossible to refer the phenomena of
                    secretion to any of the other known laws of matter, whether chemical or
                    mechanical, it becomes us to acknowledge our ignorance of the real causes that
                    produce them, and to ascribe them to the agency of those powers to which we have
                    given the name of the <hi rend="italic">organic affinities</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> by which term, however, we are far from wishing to imply that these
                    affinities essentially differ in their kind from the ordinary chemical
                    affinities which regulate the combinations of the same elements in unorganized
                    bodies; but only that their operation is modified by the peculiarity of the
                    circumstances in which they are placed. One of the principal causes of this
                    peculiarity appears to be the influence of the <hi rend="italic">nervous
                    power</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a power carefully to be distinguished from
                    the sensorial powers, hereafter to be considered, and wholly of a physical
                    character, exercised by the nervous system, and controlling the actions of the
                    blood-vessels, and more especially of the capillaries, and also those chemical
                    changes which produce the evolution of animal heat, regulating in a particular
                    manner the processes of secretion, and in some instances producing the
                    contractions of the muscles in a way directed to some beneficial purpose, and in
                    cases where the interference of the mind does not take place. But of this latter
                    exercise of the nervous power we shall have to speak more at large when we come
                    to treat of the involuntary motions.</p>
                <p>CHAP. X. ABSORPTION.</p>
                <p>(537.) The objects of the function of absorption are, first, the removal of those
                    materials which have become unserviceable and noxious from the situations where
                    their presence is injurious; and, secondly, their transmission into the general
                    mass of circulating fluids. The lymphatic vessels are appropriated to this
                    office, and form, with the lacteals, which perform a similar service with
                    respect to the chyle, one extensive system of vessels denominated the <hi
                    rend="italic">absorbents.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi
                    rend="italic">Structure of the Absorbent System.</hi></p>
                <p>(538.) The absorbent system, then, is understood to comprehend two sets of
                    vessels, distinguished only by a certain difference in the office which they
                    perform, but agreeing in their structure and general functions. The first are
                    the <hi rend="italic">lacteals,</hi> which, as we have seen, are appropriated to
                    the conveyance of the chyle, or nutritions fluid prepared in the intestines,
                    into the general reservoir of nutriment, the sanguiferous system. The second are
                    the <hi rend="italic">lymphatics,</hi> which perform a similar office with
                    regard to the materials of the body itself, that have become either useless or
                    noxious, or with respect to foreign substances applied to the external surface,
                    or introduced into any part of the body. The same general description, as to
                    structure, will apply to both these systems of vessels.</p>
                <p>(539∙) Absorbent vessels are met with in almost every part of the body. They may
                    be regarded as analogous, or even supplementary in their office, to the veins;
                    and accordingly, their structure and mode of distribution are very similar to
                    that portion of the sanguiferous system. The absorbents arise from the various
                    surfaces of the body, external as well as internal, by very minute branches; but
                    whether these branches commence by open orifices, or imbibe the fluids they
                    receive through the medium of their coats, we have hitherto no certain
                    knowledge. The lesser branches of the lymphatics, like those of the veins, join
                    together to form larger branches; while these again successively unite into
                    larger and larger trunks, till they conduct their contents into the veins, into
                    which they open. They communicate with one another freely in their course; and
                    these connexions are frequently so numerous and intricate, as to form an
                    extensive net-work, or plexus of lymphatic vessels. They are furnished with
                    numerous valves, which, like those of the veins, are of a semilunar or parabolic
                    form, disposed in pairs, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499576"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9576-0653"/>and placed so as to prevent any retrograde motion
                    of the contents of the vessels.</p>
                <p>(540.) Like the veins, the absorbents have thin and transparent coats, which are
                    possessed of considerable strength, so as to admit of being distended much
                    beyond their natural size without being ruptured, by injected fluids urged into
                    them with considerable force. When they are thus enlarged by injection, they
                    resemble a string of beads; an appearance arising from the numerous valves they
                    contain, and which occur at short, but generally unequal intervals.</p>
                <p>(541.) The absorbent vessels are formed of two coats, which in the principal
                    trunks are very distinct from each other. The external coat is the one which
                    constitutes the chief bulk of the vessel, and gives it its general form. It is
                    of a membranous structure, and is connected with the surrounding parts by a
                    loose tissue of cellular substance. It exhibits, where it joins the inner coat,
                    more or less of a fibrous structure; and some anatomists have pretended even to
                    have perceived traces of muscular fibres at this part. The interior membrane
                    which lines the former, is more thin and delicate; and it is by duplicatures of
                    this membrane that the valves are formed. These valves are remarkable for their
                    strength, not being ruptured without the greatest difficulty.</p>
                <p>(542.) The continuity of the course of the absorbents is interrupted in a variety
                    of places, by small rounded bodies, which have been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >lymphatic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">conglobate</hi> glands, and which are
                    situated on the track both of the lacteals and lymphatics. They seem to have a
                    similar relation to the absorbents which the ganglia have to the nerves; and
                    they have, on that account, been sometimes called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >lymphatic gan-lia.</hi> They are of various sizes; the smaller being placed
                    near the origin, and the larger on the more considerable trunks of these
                    vessels. Those of greatest magnitude are situated at the root of the mesentery,
                    in the course of the lacteals, and are denominated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mesenteric glands.</hi> These glands are sometimes detached, and sometimes in
                    groups or clusters, and generally of an oblong rounded shape, and somewhat
                    flattened, bearing some general resemblance to an almond. Their colour is a
                    whitish red, of more or less intensity, according as they are situated more
                    externally. Those of the mesentery arc nearly white; those of the spleen brown;
                    and those belonging to the lungs are of a very dark, or almost black hue. Each
                    gland is enveloped in a thin, fibrous, and very vascular membrane, surrounded
                    with dense cellular tissue, which sends down processes into the substance of the
                    gland, dividing it into numerous compartments.</p>
                <p>(543.) It would appear from the extensive researches of Maseagni, that every
                    absorbent vessel, during its course, passes through one or more of these glands.
                    Previous to their penetrating into the gland, each absorbent trunk branches out
                    suddenly into numerous subdivisions, distinguished by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">vasa inferentia.</hi> These vessels are distributed on the surface
                    of the gland in a radiating form, so as to surround it with a kind of net-work.
                    After they have entered the gland, their course becomes extremely difficult to
                    unravel, from their numerous and minute ramifications, their tortuous course,
                    and their frequent communications. It would appear, however, that while some
                    acquire and retain an extreme degree of tenuity, others become dilated, and form
                    cells, somewhat resembling the erectile tissue formerly described. That portion
                    of the vessels which is destined again to collect the fluid, and conduct it
                    forwards on its course, appears to have a similar structure, presenting a
                    congeries of minute ramifications, and of dilatations or cells.</p>
                <p>(544.) By the successive reunion of these branches, they are all collected into a
                    certain number of trunks which emerge from the gland, under the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">vasa efferentia.</hi> The total capacity of the vasa efferentia
                    is, in general, less than that of the vasa inferentia. Large clusters of
                    lymphatic glands exist in the neck, the groin, the axilla, as well as in the
                    course of the greater trunks, not far from their termination in the thoracic
                    duct.</p>
                <p>(545.) The great trunks of the lymphatics occupy two principal situations; the
                    one near the surface, and the other more deeply seated; and for the most part
                    they follow the course of the veins. The main branches are finally reduced to
                    three or four great trunks, which terminate for the most part in the thoracic
                    duct. This is a vessel of considerable size, passing upwards close to the spine,
                    in a somewhat tortuous course, to about half an inch above the trunk of the left
                    subclavian vein. It then bends downwards, and opens into that vein, nearly at
                    its junction with the jugular vein. Another similar, but shorter trunk, is found
                    on the opposite side, which pours its contents into the right subclavian
                    vein.</p>
                <p>(546.) The nature of the lymph, or fluid contained in the lymphatic vessels, is
                    but imperfectly known, in consequence of the difficulty of collecting it in
                    sufficient quantity for examination. When viewed under the microscope it is seen
                    to contain a number of colourless globules, much smaller and less numerous than
                    the red particles of the blood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Miitler’s Elements of Physiology, by Baly, p.
                    258.</p></note> Mr. Brande separated a small quantity of albumen from it by the
                    application of voltaic electricity: he found that it also contained some muriate
                    of soda. Berzelius states that the lactates are likewise present in it, derived,
                    as he supposes, from the decomposed substance of different parts of the body,
                    which is taken up by the absorbents. Reuss, Emmert, and Lassaigne obtained
                    fibrin from the lymph of the horse, and Nasse and Müller<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. p. 259.</p></note> obtained some also
                    from human lymph. When removed from the body, this fluid fibrin coagulates in
                    less than ten minutes. Besides the above ingredients, Tiedemann and Gmelin state
                    that the lymph contains salivary matter, osmazome, carbonates, sulphates,
                    muriates, and acetates of soda and potass, with phosphate of potass.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Function of the
                    Absorbents.</hi></p>
                <p>(547.) While the office of the lacteals is confined to the absorption of a
                    particular kind of fluid, namely, the chyle, the power of the lymphatics extends
                    to the removal of every species of matter which enters into the composition of
                    the body, as occasion may require, as also various extraneous substances that
                    may happen to be placed in contact with their mouths. Whether the lymphatics
                    have the power of taking up solid materials of the body without their being
                    previously liquified, is a point which is yet far from being determined. We are
                    certain that the hardest and densest structures, such as the bones, are liable
                    to absorption, in various instances, not only during the natural processes of
                    their formation and growth, but also on occasions when they are subjected to
                    extraneous pressure. We find that the bones are modelled by the pressure even of
                    soft living parts, during their natural growth, or morbid enlargement. The rapid
                    disappearance of the red tinge which the use of madder in the food had
                    communicated to the bones, when that food is discontinued, has been supposed to
                    warrant the conclusion that the particles of bones are at all times undergoing a
                    quick periodical renovation. But it appears from more recent inquiries, that
                    this inference has been too hastily drawn: the change of colour being the result
                    of the disappearance of the colouring particles of the madder only, without its
                    being at all necessary to suppose that the earthy particles of the bone are
                    themselves changed, or successively absorbed and deposited along with the
                    madder.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See a paper on
                    this subject by Mr. Gibson, in the Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical

                <p>(548.) The nature of the process by which the particles to be absorbed are
                    prepared for being taken up by the lymphatics ;—the mode in which they arc
                    conveyed to the orifices of these vessels, if indeed they take their rise like
                    the lacteals, by open orifices;—and the power by which they find their way into
                    these vessels, and are conveyed onwards to their termination in the thoracic
                    duct, are all subjects involved in the greatest obscurity. Capillary attraction
                    is the only power to which the rise of the lymph in the lymphatic vessels
                    appears to bear any near resemblance; but the analogy is far too vague and
                    remote to be of much assistance to us in the solution of the difficulty. ĭĭow

                    subject for future investigation. It seems likely, however, to throw some light
                    on the processes both of secretion and absorption; and perhaps may furnish an
                    explanation of the selection evinced by the lymphatics in absorbing certain
                    materials in preference to others. Absorption takes place with great facility
                    from the mucous surfaces, and also from those formed by ulceration. It also
                    takes place from the surface of serous membranes, though with less activity.
                    From the external surface of the skin, absorption takes place with great
                    difficulty, and only under particular circumstances, as when substances are
                    forcibly pressed through the cuticle. Considerable absorption often occurs from
                    the interior of the pulmonary air-cells. Absorption from the surface of the body
                    is diminished, or even suspended, by greatly diminishing the pressure of the
                    atmosphere on the part, as by the application of a cupping-glass.</p>

                    Absorption.</hi></p>
                <p>(549∙) Soon after the discovery of the lymphatic absorbents, a keen controversy
                    arose as to whether absorption was performed exclusively by these vessels: for
                    it was contended by many that the veins assisted in this process, and
                    occasionally acted as absorbing vessels. The arguments and reasonings of Hunter
                    and Monro, founded on numerous experiments, appeared to have completely decided
                    the question, and established the exclusive agency of the lymphatics in the
                    performance of this function. Of late years, however, theancient opinion has
                    been revived by Magendie and others, who seem to have satisfactorily proved that
                    absorption is occasionally carried on by the veins themselves; and that many of
                    the lesser lymphatic vessels terminate in the small veins, instead of proceeding
                    to the thoracic duet. It has been ascertained, for instance, that wdιere the
                    great lymphatic trunks are tied in animals, substances injected into the stomach
                    quickly find their way into the general mass of circulating blood, and may be
                    detected in the urine. Poison introduced into a portion of intestine, completely
                    isolated from the rest of the body, with the exception only of the artery and
                    the vein, produces its effect upon the system nearly in the same time as if the
                    natural connexions had been preserved. The same result takes place when a limb
                    is separated from the body, by dividing every part excepting the artery and the
                    vein, and the poison is introduced under the skin. It proves fatal in the usual
                    time, although the only medium through which its influence can be supposed to be
                    transmitted is the circulating blood, which must therefore, it is concluded,
                    have received the poison by venous absorption.</p>
                <p>(550.) The subject of venous absorption, and of the connexion between the
                    lymphatic and sanguiferous systems, has of late years much occupied the
                    attention of physiologists. Great labour has been bestowed on its investigation
                    by Fohmann, Lauth, and Panizza, on the continent; and recently in this country
                    by Dr. Hodgkin, who was appointed, with others, to form a committee for
                    conducting this inquiry, by the British Association for the advancement of
                    science. A short provisional report by this gentleman is published in the report
                    of the sixth meeting of that association, in vol. v. p. 289, to which we must
                    refer our readers, as containing the latest information on this important branch
                    of physiology. Many faets render it exceedingly probable that the contents, both
                    of the laeteals and of the lymphatics, are intermixed with that of the veins in
                    the lymphatic glands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV <hi rend="italic">Effects of
                    Absorption.</hi></p>
                <p>(551.) The absorbents have a powerful influence in modifying the fluid
                    secretions, as well as the solid materials of the body. Their agency in
                    assisting the arteries and capillaries which effect the growth and nutrition of
                    the body is beautifully exemplified in the processes of ossification and of
                    dentition, where the changes can more easily be followed than in the progressive
                    modifications of softer organs. All these facts lead to the conclusion that the
                    absorbent vessels possess very extensive powers in modelling the organization of
                    the body in all its parts. In the progress of life, various changes are effected
                    in the size and form of different parts, either in the natural course, or from
                    the effects of disease. We see various organs diminish in size, sometimes with
                    great rapidity, from the general absorption of their substance, or, as it has
                    been termed, from <hi rend="italic">interstitial absorption</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and in other instances from causes external to the organ
                    affected, such as pressure or ulecration; in which cases the process is
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">progressive absorption.</hi> In some structures,
                    especially those which are but scantily furnished with vessels, the renewal of
                    particles is much slower than in more vascular parts; but even these are in a
                    certain degree subject to a constant absorption and renewal of their
                    particles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V— <hi rend="italic">Function of the Lymphatic
                    Glands.</hi></p>
                <p>(552.) Of the offices performed by the lymphatic glands, which are so numerously
                    interspersed in the course of the vessels, we are stilhin profound ignorance; an
                    ignorance which is little to be wondered at, when it is considered that we arc
                    but imperfectly acquainted with their structure, and the course which the
                    branches of the absorbents take in the interior of those bodies, and that we are
                    also very much in the dark with regard to the nature of glandular action, and of
                    the changes w4ιich it induces on the fluids subjected to its influence. These
                    glands may either be proper secreting organs, intended to prepare a peculiar
                    substance, which is to be mixed with the chyle and lymph, in order to assimilate
                    them more and more to the nature of the blood with which they are to be united;
                    or they may, by their tortuous passages, offer a mechanical obstruction to the
                    progress of these fluids, and thus occasion in them spontaneous changes in the
                    arrangement of their constituent parts. This latter view of the uses of the
                    glands was taken by Maseagni, and he endeavoured to confirm it by pointing out
                    differences in the nature of the lymph before and after it bad passed through a
                    gland; but this fact, if established, would be equally explicable on either
                    hypothesis. The greater size and vascularity of these glands in youth, when the
                    growth of the organs is most rapid, would lead to the belief that their
                    functions are of importance in the elaboration of nutritive matter to meet the
                    greater demand for the materials of growth at that period of life.</p>
                <p>CHAP. XI EXCRETION.</p>
                <p>(553.) The expulsion from the system of those materials which are useless or
                    noxious, is the office of <hi rend="italic">excretion;</hi> and the organs or
                    channels by which it is performed are called the <hi rend="italic">excretory
                    organs.</hi> They consist of the lungs, the skin, the kidneys, and probably also
                    the liver.</p>

                <p>(554.) Of the office of the lungs in purifying the blood from its redundant
                    carbonaceous matter, we have already fully treated. Besides carbon, or rather
                    carbonic acid, a large quantity of water is also exhaled by means of the lungs.
                    As, however, there is reason to believe that considerable absorption of water
                    also takes place from the same surface, the amount of loss sustained by the
                    united operation of these two functions is only the excess of the exhalation
                    over the absorption.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II— <hi rend="italic">Excretory Function of the
                    Skin.</hi></p>
                <p>(555.) We have already given the results of the chemical analysis of the matter
                    of perspiration, in our account of the aqueous secretions, (§ 514). The chief
                    ingredient is unquestionably water; and the average amount of water which
                    escapes from the body through the channel of the skin, has been very variously
                    estimated by different physiologists; for, indeed, it is hardly possible to
                    arrive at any definite conclusion on this subject, from the great variations
                    that occur even in the same individual at different times, especially according
                    to the variable states of atmospheric temperature and humidity, and also
                    according to differences in the activity of the circulation. The only
                    satisfactory information we can hope to attain is, as to the aggregate loss by
                    exhalation from the skin and the lungs. The daily loss of weight from these two
                    sources taken together is stated by Haller<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>ldernenta Physiologie, xii. 2, 11.</p></note> to vary from
                    thirty ounces in the colder climates of Europe, to sixty in the warmer, and is
                    estimated by Lavoisier and Seguin<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Mémoires de l’Académie des Sciences, pour 1790, p.
                    601.</p></note> at forty-five ounces in the climate of Paris. But this quantity
                    is, of course, from the causes already mentioned, liable to extreme variation.
                    It has been estimated that, of the whole quantity thus exhaled from the skin and
                    from the lungs, about two-thirds are derived from the former source, and
                    one-third from the latter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Excretory Function of the
                    Kidneys.</hi></p>
                <p>(556.) A considerable proportion of fluid is also carried off from the system by
                    the kidneys; the peculiar office of which, however, appears to be to eliminate
                    more especially the saline materials, which are to be thrown off; and, in
                    particular, the peculiar substance termed <hi rend="italic">urea,</hi> which, as
                    we have already remarked, partakes much of the character of resinous bodies. As
                    urea contains a very large proportion of nitrogen, it is probable that the
                    kidneys are the channels provided in the economy for the removal of any excess
                    of this element which takes place in the system.</p>
                <p>(557.) The chemical analysis of the urine has engaged the attention of a great
                    number of physicians and philosophers, not only from its supposed connexion with
                    various states of the body in health and disease, but also from its containing a
                    great multitude of constituents, some of which have very peculiar properties.
                    Above twenty different substances have been detected as entering into its
                    composition; and almost every year is adding to the list of newly discovered
                    ingredients. The existence of phosphorus in this fluid has long been known; and
                    the urine was, till lately, the only source whence this elementary substance
                    couíd be procured in any quantity. Scheele discovered the urie or lithic acid,
                    which is one of the most remarkable of the animal products. The labours of
                    Fourcroy and Vauqnelin led to the knowledge of the exact composition of many of
                    the neutral salts contained in the urine. This analysis was carried still
                    farther by Cruickshank in England, and by Proust in Spain, but has been brought
                    to its present state of perfection chiefly by the labours of Berzelius<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Annals of Physiology, ii.
                    428.</p></note> in Sweden.</p>
                <p>(558.) The daily quantity voided, as well as the sensible qualities of this
                    secretion, is greatly modified by circumstances. The former has been estimated
                    at an average as being about two pounds avoirdupois. Its mean specific gravity
                    has been fixed at l∙03. In a healthy state it generally exhibits acid
                    properties, arising from the presence of uncombined phosphoric, lactic, uric,
                    benzoic, and carbonic acids. These acids, together with the muriatic and fluoric
                    acids, also exist in combination with several earthy and alkaline bases,
                    comprising ammonia, lime, magnesia, potass, and soda; the principal compounds
                    thus formed being the phosphates of lime and magnesia, ammonia and soda, the
                    sulphates of potass and of soda, the lactate of ammonia, the muriate of soda,
                    and the fluate of lime. There exist, besides, a large proportion of urea,
                    (composing nearly one-thirteenth of the whole quantity of urine, and about one
                    half of its solid ingredients), mucus, gelatin, albumen, and a small portion of
                    unacidified sulphur. The presence of a minute quantity of silica has also been
                    detected by Berzelius, amounting to about the 220th part of the solid matter
                    contained in the urine. The weight of the solid ingredients obtained by
                    evaporation, is one-fifteenth of the whole fluid, the rest being water. The
                    several ingredients above mentioned may each be rendered evident by the
                    application of appropriate tests.</p>
                <p>(559∙) Urea is a peculiar animal product, which is procured from urine evaporated
                    to the consistence of a syrup and allowed to crystallize; after which alcohol is
                    added, which dissolves the urea, whence that substance is obtained by
                    evaporation. It then appears in the form of crystalline plates, and has a light
                    yellow colour, a smell resembling garlic, and a strong acrid taste. It is
                    chiefly characterised by the bulky flaky compound which it forms with nitric
                    acid. By distillation it yields about two-thirds of its weight of carbonate of
                    ammonia; and by spontaneous decomposition it is resolved into ammonia and acetic
                    acid. It possesses the very remarkable property of changing the form of the
                    crystals of common salt or muriate of soda, which, as is well known, usually
                    crystallize in cubical crystals; but which, when mixed with a small quantity of
                    urea, assume the form of octohcdrons. What adds to the singularity of this
                    effect is, that its operation is precisely the reverse on muriate of ammonia, or
                    sal ammoniac; the ordinary form of the crystals of this salt are octahedrons,
                    but when urea is present, they take the form of cubes. Urea contains a much
                    larger proportion of nitrogen than any other animal principle. This substance
                    has been found in the blood, after its separation by the kidneys has been
                    prevented, by the extirpation of those glands. Berzelius has advanced an
                    opinion, that urea is furnished by the animal matter of the serosity of the
                    blood, from the similarity of some of its properties, and also from the
                    circumstance, that after the kidneys have been removed, the animal matter of the
                    serosity is first increased in quantity, and afterwards assumes the character of
                    urea. It appears probable that the principal function of the kidney is the
                    separation from the blood of the excess of nitrogen which it may contain, and
                    its excretion in the form of urea; thus performing an operation with respect to
                    this element analogous to that of the lungs with regard to the superfluous
                    carbon of the blood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>(560.) Cholesterine, or the peculiar matter found in the bile, and which composes
                    about eight per cent of that fluid, contains a large proportion of nitrogen.
                    Whatever may be its uses in contributing to the formation of chyle, it is
                    ultimately rejected from the body, and may therefore be classed among the
                    excrementitious substances. We have already noticed the singular circumstance
                    regarding the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499615" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9615-0656"
                    />mode of its preparation, in being formed from venous instead of arterial
                    blood, as is the case with all the other known secretions.</p>
                <p>(561.) It is doubtful how far these two peculiar substances, urea and
                    cholesterine, may be considered as pre-existing in the blood, or as formed by
                    the organs which respectively secrete them. It has been ascertained by the
                    experiments of Prevost and Dumas, that in animals in whom the secretion of urine
                    is suppressed by the removal of the kidneys, urea may, after some time, be
                    detected in the blood; and Dr. Bostock ascertained that a similar substance
                    makes its appearance in the human blood, in cases where the secretion of urine
                    had been much obstructed by disease of the kidneys. The secretion from the liver
                    is not liable to so much variation in its amount, as that from the other
                    excernent organs; it is, however, diminished during febrile excitement and
                    inflammatory conditions of the circulation, and increased by moderate exercise,
                    and by external warmth. Both the liver and the kidneys, accordingly, may be
                    ranked among the compensating organs, or those which have their actions
                    occasionally increased in order to supply deficiencies in the functions of
                    others. The excretion of watery fluid from the skin and lungs is evidently made
                    to alternate with that from the kidneys, each of these organs being capable of
                    occasionally supplying the office of the others. The chemical properties of the
                    urine are very much influenced by the condition of the digestive functions. But
                    the necessity of the excretion of urea is apparent from the rapidly fatal
                    consequences which ensue from its accumla-tion in the system, when the secretion
                    from the kidneys is suppressed, and which would lead to the conclusion, that
                    this substance, when present in sufficient quantity, speedily acts on the
                    nervous system as a virulent poison.</p>
                <p>CHAP. XII.—NUTRITION.</p>
                <p>(562.) Nutrition consists in the appropriation of the materials furnished by the
                    blood in the course of circulation, and modified by the processes of secretion,
                    to the purposes of growth, and to the repair of that waste which is continually
                    experienced by the solid structures of the body, in consequence of the exercise
                    of their respective offices. We understand as little what are the particular
                    processes by which these purposes are accomplished as we do respecting those of
                    secretion. No mechanical or chemical hypothesis which can be devised appears at
                    all adequate to the solution of this mysterious problem. The analogy of
                    crystallization, implied in the celebrated definitions of Linnaeus, in which the
                    three kingdoms of nature are contrasted, is, in a philosophical point of view,
                    utterly fallacious. According to this great naturalist, “minerals grow,
                    vegetables grow and live, animals grow, live, and feel.” It requires no
                    lengthened argument to show that the grow th of an animal, or of a plant, is a
                    phenomenon belonging to a class entirely different from the increase of a
                    mineral body. The latter is effected by the successive accretion of new layers
                    of materials, which merely augment the volume of the body, without adding to it
                    any new property; so that the separation of its parts destroys only the form of
                    the aggregate, and not any of its essential qualities. But organized bodies are
                    nourished from internal resources, and the materials which are incorporated with
                    their substance have undergone a slow and gradual elaboration in the organs
                    themselves, and have been assimilated to the qualities of the body of which they
                    are to form a component part. We may consider them as the result of the
                    operation of the organic affinities, to which we have already referred the
                    phenomena of secretion.</p>
                <p>(563.) The only general fact of importance which has been established with regard
                    to the succession of phenomena in this function, is. that the enlargement of any
                    organ appears to depend essentially on the state of the circulation in that
                    part, and on the supply of blood by its arteries. The increased growth of a part
                    at any period, compared with that of neighbouring parts, is always preceded and
                    accompanied by a marked enlargement of the arteries which furnish it with blood;
                    and this is invariably observed, whether that growth be natural or morbid. A
                    theory has been advanced, that nutrition is effected by the direct union of the
                    red particles of the blood, or of their nuclei, with the tissues. This theory is
                    successfully combated by Müller.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Elements of Physiology, translated by Baly, p.
                    359.</p></note></p>
                <p>(564.) Although we are unable to trace the exact nature of the processes of
                    nutrition, yet much curious information may be collected by observing the
                    succession of phenomena in the case of the formation of particular structures.
                    Those which we shall select for the purpose of illustration are the bones and
                    the teeth, in which the several stages of growth admit of being observed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I— <hi rend="italic">Ossification.</hi></p>
                <p>(565∙) The process of ossification is particularly interesting, from its
                    exhibiting the operations of nature in the completion of an elaborate structure
                    of such great importance in its mechanical relations to the system, as the
                    osseous fabric. In the early periods of the foetal state, we can but just trace
                    the figures of some of the larger bones, which appear to be modelled in a soft
                    gelatinous matter contained in a delicate membrane. This substance, as well as
                    its membrane, acquires greater density, and the former assumes more the
                    appearance of cartilage. In process of time, opaque white spots are perceived on
                    different parts of its surface, which, when examined by the microscope, exhibit
                    a fibrous appearance. These lines increase in number and extent; and after a
                    time, red points are seen dispersed throughout the future bone, in consequence
                    of the enlargement of the vessels which now admit the red globules of the blood.
                    Soon after this, we find the earthy matter deposited in great abundance,
                    imparting hardness and rigidity to the structure. In the long bones of the
                    extremities, the osseous substance forms at first a short hollow cylinder, as if
                    it were deposited from the vessels of the investing membrane, or periosteum. In
                    the flat bones of the cranium, ossification commences from a few central points,
                    and spreads on all sides, the fibres taking a radiating direction. In proportion
                    as the bony material extends, the cartilage is removed by the absorbent vessels,
                    in order to make room for the extension of the bone. After a certain time, in
                    the cylindrical bones, a cavity is formed in the middle, in consequence of the
                    absorption of central portions of cartilage and of bone which had occupied that
                    situation. These two opposite processes of absorption and deposition continue
                    during the whole of the future growth of the bone, the interior parts being
                    removed in proportion as fresh bony layers are added at the exterior surface.
                    Thus, when the outer part of the bone is compact and hard, the interior is
                    either formed into a complete cavity, or into the cancellated structure formerly
                    described.</p>
                <p>(566.) Such are the few well ascertained known facts relative to ossification;
                    but numberless have been the speculations to which they have given rise. Most of
                    the opinions of the ancients on this subject were extremely vague and
                    hypothetical, and have been fully refuted by modern physiologists. Many of the
                    hypotheses of the latter have undergone a similar fate. The one which has
                    acquired most celebrity is that of Duhamel, who, following the analogy of the
                    growth of trees, conceived that the bones were formed of concentric rings, or
                    laminae, deposited from the perios-. teum. II d endeavoured to adduce in support
                    of his theory <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499628" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9628-0657"
                    />the results of experiments in which bones acquired a red tinge, when madder
                    was given with the food. He alleged that when the madder was occasionally
                    intermitted, and again resumed, many times in succession, the bones of the
                    animal exhibited alternate rings of a red and white colour, corresponding to the
                    periods when the animal had taken madder, and had intermitted it. It has since
                    been shown, however, that his imagination in this instance must have misled him;
                    for no such result takes place under the cir- . cumstances he describes.</p>
                <p>(567∙) The reparation of fractured bones by the powers of the constitution is a
                    striking instance of the beautiful provisions of nature for remedying injuries
                    accidentally occurring to the body. The fractured ends are quickly united by a
                    bony substance called <hi rend="italic">callus,</hi> formed in a manner very
                    similar to that by which the bone itself is originally constructed. The arteries
                    near the scat of the injury pour out a kind of lymph, which coagulates, and is
                    either gradually converted into cartilage, or replaced by cartilage after it has
                    itself been absorbed. The deposition of phosphate of lime then takes place
                    within this cartilage, which is either removed or adapted to its reception, and
                    thus the ends of the bone are cemented together, and the limb rendered as firm
                    as before the accident.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Dentition.</hi></p>
                <p>(568.) No less curious and interesting is the process employed in the formation
                    of the teeth. The rudiments of every tooth, when examined in the foetus,
                    consists of a gelatinous pulp, which is extremely vascular, enclosed in a double
                    investment of membrane. The outer membrane is soft and spongy, and is apparently
                    destitute of vessels; while the inner one is firmer, and extremely vascular. The
                    first depositions are those of bony matter, which take place on the exterior
                    surface of the vascular pulp, and chiefly on the upper part, but within the
                    membranous coverings already noticed. The shell of bone thus formed has the
                    shape of the future tooth, and acquires thickness from successive deposits of
                    bone in its inner surface, which are still made by the outer surface of the
                    vascular pulp. When the ossification is sufficiently advanced, the pulp which
                    has thus served as a mould for the tooth, divides itself into two or more parts,
                    corresponding to the intended number of fangs, so that the ossifie matter is now
                    deposited in the form of as many tubes round these portions of the pulp, and
                    growing in a direction towards the jaw, forces the tooth in the contrary
                    direction; thus in the lower jaw the tooth rises, and in the upper jaw it
                    descends. The enamel is deposited after the body of the tooth is considerably
                    advanced in its formation. It is the product of a secretion from the inner
                    surface of the outermost of the two membranes, which form the capsule of the
                    tooth, and the materials deposited from it adhere strongly to the bony crown of
                    the tooth which they surround. This secreting capsule has been called the <hi
                    rend="italic">chorion</hi> by Hérissant, who has given an accurate description
                    of the process of dentition. Layer after layer of enamel is thus deposited, till
                    the growth of that part of the tooth has been completed; then the chorion
                    shrivels and is absorbed, and the tooth still continuing to grow at the root,
                    pierces the gum, the resistance of which has been gradually diminishing by the
                    absorption of its substance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Nutrition of the Softer
                    Textures.</hi></p>
                <p>(569∙) Greater difficulty exists in following the succession of changes which
                    attend the growth and nutrition of the softer textures, than of those we have
                    now considered, because the materials employed in their construction are less
                    distinguishable by the eye from the other animal substances, and their changes
                    are less easily traced, than those exhibited by the calcareous deposits of the
                    osseous fabric.</p>
                <p>A question here presents itself, of great importance with relation to our
                    knowledge of the nature of the vital powers, but of which the solution is
                    attended with the greatest difficulties. It is this: how far, it may be asked,
                    are the powers of secretion exerted in merely separating from the blood those
                    organic products which are already contained as ingredients of that fluid, and
                    how far do they also extend to the actual formation of new proximate elements;
                    and next, what reason is there to believe that the vital powers are capable of
                    producing, from the materials presented to them, originally derived from the
                    food, or the atmosphere, any quantity of those chemical substances, which, never
                    having hitherto been decomposed, must, in the present state of the science, be
                    regarded as elementary?</p>
                <p>The consideration of the chemical analysis of the blood, and of the substances
                    prepared from it will suffice to shew that most, if not all the secretions, may
                    very possibly be produced solely by the operation of ordinary chemical
                    affinities. It has been found, indeed, that we are able by certain chemical
                    processes, to form from the blood, out of the body, substances similar to many
                    of the secretions; and we are therefore warranted in the supposition that
                    operations of the same kind are carried on by the secreting organs within the
                    body. It is interesting, however, to trace the origin of many of the products of
                    secretion, from the ingredients contained in the blood itself. On this subject
                    Müller<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Physiology, ⅛c.
                    p. 361.</p></note> remarks, that some of the proximate elements of the tissues
                    exist in part ready formed in the blood. The albumen which enters into the
                    composition of the brain and glands, and of many other structures, in a more or
                    less modified state, is contained in the blood; the fibrin of the muscles and
                    muscular structures is the coagulable matter dissolved in the lymph and blood;
                    the fatty matter, which contains no nitrogen, exists in a free state in the
                    chyle; the azotised and phosphoretted fatty matter of the brain and nerves
                    exists in the blood combined with the fibrin, albumen, and cruorin. The iron of
                    the hair, pigmentum nigrum, and crystalline lens, is also contained in the
                    blood; the silica and manganese of the hair, and the fluor and calcium of the
                    bones and of the teeth, have not hitherto been detected in the blood, probably
                    from their existing in it in but very small proportion. The matters here
                    enumerated are attracted from the blood by particles of the organs analogous to
                    themselves, partly in the state in which they afterwards exist in the organs; in
                    other instances, their ultimate elements are newly combined in them, so as to
                    form new proximate principles; for the opinion that all the component elements
                    of the organs exist previously in the blood in their perfect state, cannot
                    possibly be adopted; the components of most tissues in fact present, besides
                    many modifications of fibrin, albumen, fat, and osmazome, other perfectly
                    peculiar matters, such as the gelatin of the bones, tendons, and cartilages,
                    nothing analogous to which is contained in the blood. The substance of the
                    vascular tissue, and also the different glandular substances, cannot be referred
                    to any of the simple components of the blood. Even the fibrin of muscle cannot
                    be considered as exactly identical with the fibrin of the liquor sanguinis.
                    Between coagulated fibrin and coagulated albumen, there is scarcely any chemical
                    difference, except in their action on peroxide of hydrogen; the only very
                    important distinction between the fibrin dissolved in the blood and the albumen
                    is, that the former coagulates as soon as it is withdrawn from the animal body,
                    while the latter does not coagulate spontaneously, but requires a heat of from
                    158° to 167° Fahr., or some chemical agents, such as acids, concentrated
                    solutions of fixed alkali, or metallic salts; and the fibrin of muscle in its
                    chemical characters has scarcely a greater analogy with coagulated fibrin, than
                    with coagulated albumen. In its vital properties the fibrin of muscle differs
                    from both. The comparison <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499641"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9641-0658"/>of nervous substance, again, with the fatty matter
                    containing nitrogen and phosphorus, is only justified by the present imperfect
                    state of organic chemistry.</p>
                <p>The blood, as Dr. Bostock<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Elementary System of Physiology, p. 518.</p></note> observes, is a
                    substance, the composition of which is peculiarly well adapted to undergo the
                    changes necessary for the processes both of secretion and of nutrition, as it
                    consists of a number of ingredients, which are held together by a weak affinity,
                    liable to be disturbed by a variety even of what might appear the slightest
                    causes. As examples of the facility with which these changes may be effected, we
                    may cite the numerous reagents which have the power of coagulating albumen; the
                    action upon it and upon fibrin of dilute nitric acid, which converts these
                    substances respectively into adipose matter and jelly, changes which are
                    probably the result of the addition of oxygen to the fibrin and to the albumen;
                    and there is some reason to believe that by applying the same reagent to the red
                    particles, we may obtain a substance nearly resembling bile.</p>

                    substances, the elements of which are not to be found in the blood, or at least
                    not in sufficient quantity to account for the great accumulation that takes
                    place in certain parts of the system, and of which the source is not apparent,
                    we must confess that the present state of the science affords no means of
                    explaining the phenomena. “To suppose,” as Dr. Bostock justly remarks, “that we
                    are affording any real explanation by ascribing it to the operation of the vital
                    principle, or to any vital affinities, which is merely a less simple mode of
                    expressing the fact, is one of those delusive attempts to substitute words for
                    ideas, which have so much tended to retard the progress of physiological
                    science.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">General Phenomena of
                    Nutrition.</hi></p>
                <p>(570.) The instances we have above given of the processes employed in
                    ossification and dentition, together with the varied operations concerned in the
                    formation and nutrition of all the softer textures of the body, forcibly
                    illustrate the beneficent care displayed in the construction of every part of
                    the frame, and the admirable adjustment of the long series of means which have
                    been provided for the attainment of these diversified and frequently remote
                    objects of the animal economy. Every part undergoes a continued and progressive
                    change of the particles which compose it, even though it remain to all outward
                    appearance the same. The materials which had been united together by the powers
                    of nutrition, and fashioned into the several organs, are themselves severally
                    and successively removed and replaced by others, which again are in their turn
                    discarded, and new ones substituted in their place, until, in process of time,
                    scarcely any portion of the substance originally constituting the organs remains
                    as their component part.</p>
                <p>(571.) We see from the examples of the bones, that this continual renovation of
                    the materials of the body takes place in the most solid, as well as in the
                    softest textures; and so great is the total amount of these changes, that doubts
                    may reasonably be entertained as to the identity of any part of the body at
                    different epochs of its existence. The ancients assigned a period of seven years
                    as the time required for the complete renovation of all the materials of the
                    system, but perhaps this entire change may take place during a shorter
                    interval.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Age,</hi> in the Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine,
                    vol. i. p. 34.</p></note></p>
                <p>(572.) The two functions we have been considering, namely, nutrition and
                    absorption, may be regarded as antagonist powers, each continually counteracting
                    the effects of the other. In the early periods of life, though both are in full
                    activity, the former predominates; all the organs enlarging in their dimensions
                    by the addition of fresh materials in greater quantity than the losses by
                    absorption, the whole body is in a state of growth. In the course of time, the
                    frame having attained its prescribed dimensions, these opposite processes of
                    reparation and decay approach nearer to an equality; and at length are exactly
                    balanced. The parts then cease to grow, and the system may be said to have
                    reached its state of maturity. This is the condition of the adult, in which the
                    equilibrium of the functions is maintained for a great number of years. At
                    length, however, the period arrives when the balance, hitherto so evenly kept,
                    begins to incline, the renovating powers of the system are less equal to the
                    demands made upon them, and the waste of the body exceeds the supply. It
                    contracts in its dimensions; it has attained its period of declension, which
                    marks the progress of age, and ultimately leads to decrepitude. The fabric then
                    betrays unequivocal symptoms of decay, the functions are imperfectly performed,
                    the vigour of the circulation flags, the flame flickers in the socket, and is
                    finally extinguished in death. Tims is the whole duration of life, from the
                    first developement of the germ to the period of its dissolution, occupied by a
                    series of actions and reactions, perpetually varying, yet constantly tending to
                    definite and salutary ends.</p>
                <p>(573.) We have now concluded the account we proposed to give of the long series
                    of functions which maintain the various organs of the system in that mechanical
                    condition and chemical composition fitting them for the exercise of their
                    several offices in the economy. We have next to enter into the consideration of
                    the higher order of functions connected with the nervous system.</p>
                <p>CHAP. XIΠ THE SENSORIAL FUNCTIONS.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">General Views.</hi></p>
                <p>(574.) The functions we have hitherto considered, however admirably contrived,
                    and beautifully adjusted, are calculated only for the maintenance of a simply
                    vital existence. All that is obtained by their means is a mass of organized
                    materials, which lives, which is nourished, which grows, which declines, and
                    which perishes in a certain definite period, by its mere internal mechanism. But
                    these can never be the real ends of animal existence. Sensation, voluntary
                    motion, pleasure and pain, together with all the intellectual operations to
                    which they lead, these must be the proper objects of animal life; these the
                    purposes for which the animal was created. In man we find the extension of these
                    latter faculties to an extraordinary degree, and the addition of moral
                    attributes which elevate him so far above the brute creation, and place him one
                    step nearer to that divine essence after whose likeness he was made.</p>
                <p>(575.) The functions of sensation, of voluntary motion, and of thought, are those
                    which establish our mental connexions with the external world; which enable us
                    to acquire a knowledge of the existence and properties of the material objects
                    that surround us; which awaken in us the operations of our own minds; which
                    bring us in communication with other intellectual and sentient beings, and which
                    enables us to react on matter, to exercise over it the dominion of the will, and
                    to influence the condition of those other beings which like us have received the
                    giftoflife, ofsensation, and of intellect.</p>
                <p>(576.) Throughout the whole of the inquiries in which we are about to engage it
                    is important to keep steadily in view the essential and fundamental distinction
                    between mind and matter. Of the existence of our own sensations, ideas,
                    thoughts, and volitions, we have the highest de-gree<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499654" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9654-0659"/> of evidence that human
                    knowledge can admit of, that of our own consciousness. Of the existence of
                    matter, that is, of causes foreign to our own mind, but acting on it, and giving
                    rise to sensations, which are strictly mental affections, we have merely a
                    strong presumption; still, however, the belief in the existence of those causes,
                    however irresistibly it may operate in producing in us convictions, and
                    influencing our actions, is yet but an inference from the regularity in the
                    succession of our sensations. We are not justified in saying that it is
                    impossible we can be deceived in this belief; whereas in the consciousness of
                    our mental existence we cannot possibly be mistaken, because that consciousness
                    implies the very fact of our existence.</p>
                <p>(577.) It is, however, most true, that notwithstanding our ideas of mind and
                    matter are such as wholly to exclude our conceiving any property to belong to
                    both of them in common; yet some inscrutable link of connexion has, in our
                    present state of existence, been established between them, so that each may,
                    under certain circumstances, be affected by the other. External matter acts on
                    our bodily organs, which are still mere matter; but our bodily organs act on our
                    minds; and our minds in turn react on our bodily organs, and occasion movements,
                    which enable us to act on extraneous objects. Moreover, it is impossible for us
                    in our present state to carry on any intellectual operation, but by the
                    instrumentality of our material organs; we can neither feel, nor think, nor
                    will, without the healthy condition of the brain, and all the other physical
                    conditions which such a state implies. Disturbance of the physiological
                    functions of the brain is invariably attended by a disturbance of the mental
                    operations connected with those functions. Both are excited by certain states of
                    the circulation in the brain; both are instantly suspended by pressure upon that
                    organ; both are restored by the removal of the pressure, or other disturbing
                    cause.</p>
                <p>(578.) The <hi rend="italic">nervous system</hi> is the name given to that
                    assemblage of organs which perform the important functions of which we are now
                    speaking. The primary office of the fibres composing that system appears to be
                    to transmit certain affections, which we may call <hi rend="italic"
                    >impressions,</hi> from one part of that system to another; and more
                    particularly to convey them both to and from that particular part of the brain,
                    the affections of which give rise to sensation, and accompany our mental
                    operations. In the one case, the impression made on one extremity of a nervous
                    fibril, adapted to receive such impression, in a part called an <hi
                    rend="italic">organ of sense,</hi> is propagated to the part of the brain above
                    described, and to which the name of <hi rend="italic">sensorium</hi> has been
                    given, and thereby producing a certain physical effect, the nature of which is
                    wholly unknown; <hi rend="italic">sensation,</hi> which is a mental effect,
                    ensues. In another case, the fibres of the brain are by their action
                    instrumental in retracing, in combining, in modifying these impressions, and
                    forming them into ideas, which are linked together by the laws of association.
                    Again, the mental act we term <hi rend="italic">volition,</hi> and of which we
                    are always conscious, affects some particular fibres or portion of the
                    sensorium, the impression made upon which is follow ed by an affection of
                    certain nervous filaments proceeding from those parts of the brain, and
                    conveying an influence, (which for want of a more specific term we may also call
                    <hi rend="italic">irritation'),</hi> to the muscles’ in which these nerves
                    terminate; and this is immediately followed by the contraction of those muscles.
                    This constitutes <hi rend="italic">voluntary motion.</hi></p>
                <p>(579∙) But the office of the nerves extends yet farther. Various muscles
                    subservient to many of the vital functions, such as the heart, the stomach, and
                    the intestines, act without any interference, or even control of the will. They
                    compose the class of <hi rend="italic">involuntary muscles</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> yet these muscles are supplied with nerves, and have a certain
                    dependence on the nervous system, which is of a very peculiar kind, and will be
                    considered afterwards. These nerves supplying the involuntary muscles, appear to
                    have the office of establishing connexions between tlfe actions of these
                    muscles, and of uniting the various organs of the different functions into one
                    connected harmonious whole.</p>
                <p>(580.) Thus the various phenomena which relate to the nervous system in the
                    performance of the functions we are considering, will arrange themselves under
                    the following heads, according to the natural order of their sequence:</p>
                <p>First, the impressions made by external objects on the sentient extremities of
                    the nerves distributed to the organs of sense, through the medium of those
                    organs.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the transmission of the impressions so made to the sensorium, through
                    the medium of the ncrves of sensation.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, the physical changes made on the sensorium.</p>
                <p>Fourthly, the mental change consequent on this physical change in the sensorium;
                    which mental change is termed <hi rend="italic">sensation</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and in experiencing which the mind is wholly passive.</p>
                <p>Fifthly, the recurrence, associations, and combinations of the physical changes
                    originally induced in the sensorium, but probably extended through various parts
                    of the substance of the brain, and simultaneous with various mental operations,
                    in exercising which the mind is partly passive and partly active.</p>
                <p>Sixthly, the mental act denominated <hi rend="italic">volition,</hi> which is
                    accompanied with consciousness, and in which the mind is wholly active.</p>
                <p>Seventhly, the corresponding change induced by volition on the sensorium, or
                    origin of the nerves of voluntary motion.</p>
                <p>Eighthly, the transmission of the impression so received by the nerves of
                    voluntary motion, to the muscles on which they are distributed.</p>
                <p>Ninthly, the contractions of these muscles, constituting voluntary motion.</p>
                <p>Tenthly, the influence of the nerves on the muscles of involuntary motion, and on
                    various functions apparently depending on involuntary actions.<note

                    System.</hi></p>
                <p>(581.) The nervous system comprises organs of a curious and complicated
                    structure, and which are of the highest importance in the animal economy. Their
                    study is exceedingly interesting, whether they be viewed as instruments of
                    sensation, as sources of action, or as the medium of connexion between the body
                    and the mind. This system is composed of a considerable mass of a soft pulpy
                    substance called the <hi rend="italic">brain,</hi> which occupies the cavity of
                    the skull; a prolongation of this substance filling the canal of the spine, and
                    called the <hi rend="italic">spinal cord,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">spinal
                    marrow</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and of various processes in the form of
                    cords, called <hi rend="italic">nerves,</hi> which extend from the brain and
                    spinal cord, to almost all parts of the body. There are found also interspersed
                    in various parts along the course of the nerves, small rounded or flattened
                    bodies, called <hi rend="italic">ganglia,</hi> which also belong to this system
                    of organs. All the parts of this system are intimately related to each other,
                    and although they differ considerably in their general appearance, they possess
                    many charactersin common. In point of structure they present us with three
                    different modifications; the first comprehending the substance of the central
                    masses, which include the brain and spinal cord; the second, the nerves; and the
                    third, the ganglia. We shall proceed to consider each of these in the above
                    order.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Organization of the Erain and Spinal Cord.</hi></p>
                <p>(582.) <hi rend="italic">The brain,</hi> or general mass which fills the cavity
                    of the skull, is composed of a number of parts of various <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499667" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9667-0660"/>shapes, the particular forms
                    and dispositions of which belong properly to descriptive anatomy. It will be
                    sufficient for our present purpose to state, that it is divided into three
                    masses, distinguished by the names of <hi rend="italic">cerebrum,</hi> which is
                    by fiir the largest portion, and which occupies the whole of the upper and fore
                    part of the cavity of the skull; the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum,</hi> or
                    lesser brain, which is situated at the hinder and lower part of the cerebrum;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata,</hi> which lies at the central part
                    of the base, or inner surface of the cerebrum, and connects it with the
                    cerebellum, and with the spinal cord. All these parts, as well as the spinal
                    cord itself, are formed of two kinds of substance; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cineritious,</hi> or ash-coloured substance, which has also been called the <hi
                    rend="italic">cortical</hi> substance; and the white, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >medullary</hi> substance. These two substances are variously intermixed,
                    sometimes forming strata of different thickness, and sometimes the one
                    enveloping separate portions of the other, in different parts of the whole mass.
                    There is a layer of cortical substance placed on the outside of the cerebrum; it
                    does not, however, form a smooth uniform plane, but is moulded into <hi
                    rend="italic">convolutions.</hi> In the cerebellum there is a similar
                    superficial stratum formed into concentrie laminae. The convolutions are of
                    considerable depth; and if any of them be cut through, it is seen to consist of
                    both eortical and medullary substance. The eortical forms a layer of
                    considerable thickness; and on looking attentively on its divided edge, a very
                    narrow lamina of medullary substance will be perceived passing through it, and
                    following it through all its windings. This fact has been particulary noticed by
                    Dr. Baillie. The concentric laminae on the surface of the cerebellum, are
                    composed also of eortical and medullary matter. By this arrangement, the
                    quantity of eortical substance, as well as the extent of its surface on the
                    outer part of the brain, is very much increased.</p>
                <p>(583.) In the interior of the brain we find cavities ofeon-siderable size, termed
                    <hi rend="italic">ventricles,</hi> and bodies of regular·, but various shapes,
                    presenting many different mixtures of two species of matter. Where these bodies
                    appear, from their outside, to be formed of cortical substance only, on cutting
                    into this, there is found a considerable mixture of medullary matter; and where
                    they seem, from their outside, to be formed of medullary matter alone, they are
                    discovered, on dividing them, to contain some cortical substance in the
                    interior. Thus, there is no particular part of the brain composed purely of the
                    one kind of substance or the other; although the proportions of each in the
                    various parts may be very different. A similar intermixture of eortical and
                    medullary matter exists in the spinal cord; but contrary to what takes place in
                    the large mass of the brain, the eortical •part is placed in the interior, and
                    is enveloped by the medullary.</p>
                <p>(584.) The medullary substance has generally been considered as constituting the
                    most perfect state of nervous matter, or that which more especially exercises
                    the functions of the nervous system. Some physiologists, on the contrary,
                    consider· the grey substance as the seat or origin of nervous power; while the
                    fibres of the white substance act merely the part of conductors of nervous
                    influence from one part to another. This medullary portion is obviously of a
                    firmer consistence than the eortical part, and contains fewer blood-vessels
                    interspersed throughout its substance. Both the one and the other are almost
                    perfectly homogeneous in their appearance. Ruysch had fancied that the eortical
                    substance was entirely composed of blood-vessels, connected by cellular
                    membrane; and in this opinion he was for a long time generally followed,
                    although the pulpy consistence it exhibits is scarcely compatible with such a
                    notion. Malpighi supposed that he had detected in it a glandular structure; but
                    this must also be regarded as a mere hypothesis, unsupported by any substantial
                    evidence. The medullary matter presents traces of a fibrous structure; a faet
                    which was first observed by Malpighi, and which is particularly insisted on by
                    Drs. Gall and Spurzheim; and notwithstanding the existence of such a structure
                    is denied by other eminent anatomists, it appears to have been sufficiently
                    established by the elaborate researches of Reil, a detailed account of which has
                    been given by Mr. Mayo.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In bis Anatomical and Physical Commentaries.</p></note></p>
                <p>(585.) Anatomists are far from being agreed as to the minute and ultimate
                    structure of nervous matter. De la Torre asserts that it consists of a mass of
                    innumerable transparent globules immersed in a transparent fluid; and that these
                    globules are larger in the brain than in the spinal marrow. Prochaska describes
                    the same globular structure, which he represents as united by a transparent
                    elastic cellular membrane disposed in fibres. Monro,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the Nervous System.</p></note> in his
                    first inquiries, thought that these fibres were convoluted, but afterwards
                    acknowledged that he had been misled by an op-tical fallacy, incident to the
                    employment of high magnifying powers. The Wenzells<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>De Structura Cerehii.</p></note> also
                    recognised the globular composition of the nervous substance, and considered the
                    globules themselves to be veiclss filled with a material either of a medullary
                    or cineritious appearance, according to the portion examined. Bauer<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Philosophical Transactions
                    for 1818, and 1821 ∙</p></note> states that the globules are of about the same
                    diameter as the central particles of the globules of the blood, some, however,
                    being still smaller; and that they are of a gelatinous consistence, and soluble
                    in water. The eineritious substance, he finds, is composed chiefly of the
                    smallest globules, surrounded by a large proportion of a gelatinous and serous
                    fluid. The medullary substance, on the other hand, is formed principally by the
                    larger and more distinct globules which adhere together in lines, and have a
                    smaller proportion of fluid, that fluid being more viscid than in the
                    eineritious substance. Dr. Edwards<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Sur la Structure élémentaire.</p></note> has confirmed by
                    his observations, these results, as far as the general globular composition of
                    nervous matter is concerned. He asserts the diameter of the globules to be one
                    three-hundredth of a millimetre, which is equivalent to the seven thousand six
                    hundred part of an inch; and that these globules arc arranged in linear series,
                    constituting the primary linear fibres. Beclard states that he has verified
                    these observations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Nerves.</hi></p>
                <p>(586.) The <hi rend="italic">nerves</hi> are white cords extending from different
                    parts of the brain and spinal eord, to different parts of the body, and more
                    especially to the muscles, the integuments, and other organs of sense, and to
                    the visecra and blood-vessels. Their general form is cylindrical; but they
                    divide, in their course, into a great number of branches, many of which again
                    reunite, or are joined with the branches of other nerves, so as to form in many
                    parts a complicated nervous net-work, or <hi rend="italic">plexus,</hi> as it
                    has been termed by anatomists. The nerves are usually spoken of as originating
                    in the brain or spinal cord, and as proceeding from thence to their termination
                    in other, and generally distant parts. As the united branches would form a cord
                    of much larger diameter than the trunk from which they arise, it is evident that
                    the total quantity of nervous matter they contain is augmented as they proceed
                    in their course. When examined with the microscope, their surface presents a
                    number, of transverse lines or wrinkles, which are evidently for the purpose of
                    admitting of flexion; and thus accommodating them to the different movements of
                    the parts with which they are connected.</p>
                <p>(587.) The nerves appear to consist of filaments of medullary substance, enclosed
                    in a tough cellular membrane.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499680" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9680-0661"/>
                <p>At their origin from the central organ, whether it be the brain or the spinal
                    cord, they consist of detached fibrils, sometimes isolated, but in general
                    arranged so as to constitute flat bands. There are two such bands, namely, an
                    anterior and a posterior fasciculus, which unite to form each of the nerves
                    arising from the spinal cord. Some nerves are composed of pure medullary matter,
                    as the optic nerve; but in the greater number this matter is so enveloped in a
                    tough cellular membrane, which has been termed by anatomists the <hi
                    rend="italic">neurilema,</hi> that it cannot distinctly be perceived. In the
                    olfactory nerves there is an evident junction of cortical with medullary matter,
                    but in most others we find nothing but filaments of medullary matter, each of
                    which is contained in a separate envelope of neurilema, that forms tubes for
                    their reception.</p>
                <p>(588.) Many anatomists have attempted the investigation of the minute structure
                    of nervous fibrils by means of the microscope. De la Torre<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Philosophical Transactions for
                    1769.</p></note> perceived in them globules similar to those of which the matter
                    of the brain is composed. Monro<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>On the Nervous System.</p></note> and Fontana describe the
                    nervous filaments as being connected by cellular substance, much in the same way
                    as the muscular fibres, and arranged like them in fasciculi of various sizes.
                    They represent the ultimate fibril as being twelve times greater than the
                    muscular fibre, having a serpentine or tortuous form, and being composed of a
                    cylindrical canal, containing a viscid pulpy matter, evidently different from
                    the substance of the canal itself. Reil has pursued this investigation with
                    still greater care and minuteness, and states that the ultimate filaments differ
                    in thickness from that of a hair to the finest fibre of silk. Their arrangement
                    into larger and larger fasciculi is analogous to what we observe in the
                    structure of muscles, but with this difference, that the nervous fibres in their
                    course along the nerve, frequently divide and subdivide, and are again variously
                    united and conjoined, so as to produce an extensive connexion among all the
                    parts of the same nerve. The membranous neurilema, besides giving support to
                    each individual filament of nerve, and uniting them into fasciculi, furnishes
                    also a general covering to the whole nerve.</p>
                <p>(589∙) What has now been stated must be understood as applicable to nerves in
                    general. Many differences have been pointed out in the structure of different
                    nerves; but it is not necessary to descend into these minute particulars in the
                    general view we are now giving.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Ganglia.</hi></p>
                <p>(590.) <hi rend="italic">Ganglia</hi> are small rounded nodules, which are placed
                    in different situations in the course of nerves, sometimes in the trunk of a
                    single nerve, and sometimes where two nerves unite. They are most numerous on
                    those nerves which are distributed to the viscera, and to the muscles of
                    involuntary motion. Their appearance is very different from that of a mere
                    dilatation of a nerve, being of a reddish-brown colour, having a minute fibrous
                    texture, a firmer consistence, and a greater number of blood-vessels than
                    ordinary nerves. The nerves which pass out from a ganglion are generally of a
                    larger size than those which entered into it, as if they had received, in their
                    passage through it, an additional quantity of matter. It would appear, from
                    numerous observations, that the filaments of the different nerves which join the
                    ganglion proceed through it individually without interruption, but are, at the
                    same time, involved and twisted together in a very complicated manner; the
                    result being, that filaments from many different nerves are united in the
                    formation of a new nerve; so that the parts to which the nerve is distributed
                    receive a supply of filaments from many different sources, and are in very
                    extensive communication with various parts of the brain, spinal cord, and indeed
                    the whole nervous system.</p>
                <p>(591∙) Besides this junction and intertexture of nervous filaments, the ganglia
                    contain a soft semi-fluid matter, which appears to be analogous to the proper
                    substance of the brain, and like the latter, may be distinguished into
                    cincretious and medullary portions. It would appear, therefore, that the ganglia
                    have some peculiar office with regard to the nerves which traverse them, and
                    that they do not serve the purpose only of a plexus of filaments, establishing
                    mere mechanical connexions between them, as some anatomists have alleged.</p>
                <p>CHAP. XIV THE EXTERNAL SENSES.</p>
                <p>(592.) The external senses have usually been reckoned five in number, namely,
                    touch, taste, smell, hearing, and sight; but this arrangement has reference more
                    to the organs by which they are exercised than to the nature of the sensations
                    they excite in the mind. A variety of sensations have been referred to the sense
                    of touch, which are wholly different in their kind, and which are received by
                    means of impressions made on the skin, and also others which are conveyed by
                    nerves in other parts of the body, without any connexion with the skin. These we
                    shall notice after we have considered 'the sensations more peculiarly belonging
                    to the sense of touch.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Touch.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Sensation of Pressure.</hi></p>
                <p>(593.) Every part of the surface of the body is exposed to the contact of foreign
                    bodies; and in most parts of the skin very slight pressure made by those bodies
                    gives occasion to the primary sensation of touch, which is in fact simply that
                    of resistance to the part of the skin on which it presses. This sensation is
                    quite specific, and distinguishable from all other sensations. It may be
                    conveyed, though less perfectly, by several of the internal surfaces of the
                    body, as those of the mouth and pharynx. Certain parts of the skin possess,
                    however, a more peculiar delicacy of nervous sensibility to the impressions of
                    touch, and are therefore to be considered as more especially the organs of this
                    sense. In man the points of the fingers are particularly employed for receiving
                    the finer impressions of touch, and for distinguishing the qualities of external
                    objects, of which this sense is fitted to convey us information. The greater
                    vascularity of the skin of the fingers, and greater developement of its
                    papillary structure, have been assigned as the causes of the apparent increase
                    of sensibility with which they have been endowed. There is no doubt, however,
                    that much depends on the education given to the ends of the fingers, by their
                    constant employment in this office; for we find that the toes and other parts of
                    the body may, by use, be trained to the acquisition of an equal degree of
                    sensibility; of this we sec examples in individuals who have been born without
                    hands. Parts where the epidermis is very thin, such as the lips, arc also
                    endowed with considerable sensibility to the impressions of touch, and with the
                    power of discriminating differences in those impressions which cannot be felt or
                    appreciated by means of the fingers.</p>
                <p>(594) Professor Weber of Lcipsig<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>An account of these researches is contained in the
                    Edinburgh. Medical Journal, xl. p. 83.</p></note> has made a series of very
                    interesting experiments on the relative sensibilities of the skin in different
                    parts of the body, with reference more particularly to its power of conveying to
                    the mind accurate perceptions of mechanical impressions made upon it. He found
                    this power possessed’ in the highest degree by the tip of the tongue and ends of
                    the fingers, the sensibility of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499693"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9693-0662"/>which he estimated at eighty times greater than
                    that of the skin of other parts of the body. He observed, also, that ‘even the
                    skin in different parts of the face, when touched with the points of a pair of
                    compasses opened to a small distance, shewed the greatest diversity in their
                    power of conveying distinct perceptions of touch as to the object in contact
                    being single or double, and as to the distance between the points, when they
                    were perceived to be double.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Sensations of Temperature.</hi></p>
                <p>(595.) The same organs which, when pressed by an external body, convey the
                    impression of resistance, communicate also sensations of heat and cold, and
                    nearly in the same relative proportion. Thus the fingers arc more sensible to
                    variations of temperature in the bodies they touch than other parts of the skin
                    less accustomed to discriminate them. T he lips are still more sensible than the
                    fingers to the differences of temperature in the bodies to which they are
                    applied. This peculiar sensibility affords a ready mode of distinguishing
                    genuine diamonds and other precious stones from such as are counterfeit; for the
                    former, being better conductors of heat, produce a more lasting impression of
                    coldness when applied to the lips or to the tongue.</p>
                <p>The sensations of heat and cold are, however, far from being in exact proportion
                    either to the actual temperatures of the bodies which are in contact with the
                    skin, or even to the differences between their temperature and that of the skin.
                    The actual condition of the sensibility of the skin at the time, which depends
                    on a multitude of causes hereafter to be noticed, has a very considerable
                    influence on the sensations. The difference which is observable in the
                    sensibilities of the same part to the impression of resistance, and to that of
                    heat or cold, suggests a doubt whether a différent set of nerves may not be
                    employed to transmit to the brain these different kinds of impressions. We find
                    in certain states of disease, that the general sensibility of the surface of the
                    body may be much impaired, and yet it may preserve its sensitiveness with regard
                    to heat and cold; and it is also certain, that differences of temperature
                    produce sensations in parts, the stomach for instance, which are wholly
                    disqualified from communicating the feeling of resistance.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Anomalous Sensations.</hi></p>
                <p>(596.) Hunger and thirst are sensations referred to the mouth, throat, and
                    stomach, which are also quite specific in their nature, though generally
                    referred to the sense of touch.</p>
                <p>(597∙) The same observation applies to a variety of peculiar sensations, many of
                    which are common to the whole surface of the body, and may even be felt in some
                    internal parts, but which it would be difficult to class, or even completely
                    enumerate. The sense of tingling and of itching are examples of this species of
                    sensations. The feeling of nausea is an undefinable sensation referred to the
                    stomach.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Sensation of Pain.</hi></p>
                <p>(598.) Every sensation thus referred to the sense of touch, when it rises beyond
                    a certain degree, is accompanied with the additional feeling of pain, which, if
                    considerable, engrosses the whole attention, and effaces all marks of
                    discrimination as to its origin. Pain is generally readily referred to a
                    particular part of the body, as being the origin, or as it is commonly called,
                    the <hi rend="italic">seat</hi> of pain, especially when the part is external.
                    But in internal parts, this specific reference is often extremely vague and
                    imperfect; and there frequently exists a general feeling of uneasiness, often
                    more intolerable than any other, and to which it is impossible to assign any
                    particular locality. It may also be observed, that in general the actual
                    sensibility bears no relation to the capacity for feeling pain.</p>
                <p>(599) A vast number of experiments were made by Haller, with a view to ascertain
                    the comparative sensibilities of the different textures and organs of the body.
                    In general, those which have but a small degree of vascularity, such as the
                    cartilages, tendons, ligaments, fibrous membranes, and bones, and even the
                    simple cellular texture, and serous membranes, in a state of health, have a very
                    obscure degree of sensibility, when cut across, pricked with a pointed
                    instrument, or burned by a hot iron. Yet many of these textures, though
                    deficient in sensibility to these stimuli, are yet extremely sensible to
                    injuries of another kind, namely, forcible stretching, when applied suddenly and
                    in a degree which endangers the integrity of their structure. This is
                    sufficiently illustrated by the acute pain attendant on a sprain. Bones, also,
                    though scarcely communicating any feeling of pain when sawn through in the
                    living body, yet fed acutely the concussion produced by violent blows, as any
                    one may be convinced of who has suffered a blow on the knee. It is also
                    remarkable that all those parts, which are apparently so incapable of sensation
                    under ordinary circumstances, become highly sensible when in a state of
                    inflammation.</p>
                <p>(600.) The internal parts of most of the glands and other solid organs, have but
                    little sensibility; and the chief source of pain, when they are attacked with
                    inflammation, arises from the affection spreading to the membranes which invest
                    them. Inflammation of the mucous membranes does not occasion any proportionate
                    degree of pain. Those parts of the body which receive no blood-vessels, as the
                    cuticle and its appendages, the nails and the hair, are absolutely insensible.
                    The cuticle consequently is well adapted to protect the highly sensitive organ
                    which it covers, and to blunt its sensibility.</p>
                <p>(601.) Pain often arises from internal causes; from pressure, or distension, or
                    other mechanical or chemical irritation applied to nerves; or from some changes
                    taking place in the texture of the nerve itself. It will appear evident, on a
                    general review of the sensibility allotted to the different organs of the body,
                    that each has received from nature that particular kind and degree which is most
                    needed, and which best accords with the relative importance of its functions,
                    and the dangers to which, in the ordinary course of events, it is exposed.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The Muscular Sense.</hi></p>
                <p>(602.) A very important class of sensations has been referred to the sense of
                    touch, which require to be particularly distinguished from the rest; they arc
                    those attending the contractions of the voluntary muscles, which render us
                    sensible of the movements of our limbs, and of other parts which are voluntarily
                    moved. These are the feelings which give rise to the idea of extension, and
                    which, combined with the feeling of resistance, communicate to us a knowledge of
                    the forms, magnitudes, and relative positions of external objects. Thus, by
                    moving the hand over the surfaces of bodies, we gain the ideas of their tangible
                    extension together withmost of their mechanical properties, such as
                    theirrough-ness, hardness, weight, texture, and dimensions. In these
                    examinations we avail ourselves of the admirable properties of the hand, an
                    instrument which, by the number and variety of its parts, and the motions of
                    which they are capable, is exquisitely fitted for procuring us this useful kind
                    of knowledge. By the perceptions we acquire in infancy from the active
                    employment of the limbs in various kinds of progressive motion, our sphere of
                    knowledge of the material world is prodigiously extended; and these perceptions
                    arc an important source of gratification, in consequence of the feelings of
                    pleasure with which, by the beneficent ordination of nature, the active exercise
                    of the voluntary muscles is accompanied.</p>
                <p>(603.) The sense of touch, in the comprehensive view which we have now taken of
                    it, is unquestionably the most important of all our external senses, bringing us
                    more im <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499706" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9706-0663"
                    />mediately acquainted with the essential qualities of the material world, and
                    laying the great foundations of all the knowledge which the other senses supply,
                    by a reference to the ideas derived from touch.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II— <hi rend="italic">Taste.</hi></p>
                <p>(604.) It was the fashion among the French metaphysicians to resolve all the
                    senses into that of touch; so that in speaking of vision, for instance, they
                    would allege that we see by means of the light which touches the retina. But
                    this is a mere refinement not warranted by facts, and in which the real
                    distinctions existing among the sensations themselves are overlooked.</p>
                <p>(605.) If any of the senses could be considered as a finer sense of touch, it
                    would be that of taste, by which we receive impressions of a peculiar kind from
                    the sapid qualities of bodies in contact with the upper surface of the tongue.
                    This sense is manifestly intended to guide us in the choice of our food, and it
                    is accordingly placed at the entrance of the alimentary canal.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Organs of Taste.</hi></p>
                <p>(606.) The principal organ of taste is the <hi rend="italic">tongue,</hi> but
                    several of the neighbouring organs are auxiliaries in the exercise of this
                    sense. The soft parts of the mouth consist of the lips and cheeks, the gums, the
                    soft palate, the velum, uvula, tongue, the membranous lining of the mouth, and
                    the salivary glands. The osseous parts are the upper and lower maxillary bones,
                    the teeth, and the palate bones.</p>
                <p>(607.) The <hi rend="italic">lips</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cheeks</hi> are
                    principally composed of muscles; they are covered on the outside by the common
                    integuments, and lined within by the membrane of the mouth, in which are
                    situated numerous mucous glands. The membrane of the mouth is covered with fine
                    villi, which are most conspicuous on the edges of the lips. A small doubling of
                    this membrane is met with in the middle of both the upper and under lips, which
                    fixes them more closely to the jaws. They have been termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fraena</hi><hi rend="italic">labiorum.</hi> The union of the lips at the
                    corners of the mouth form what has been called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >commissures</hi> of the lips.</p>
                <p>(608.) The <hi rend="italic">gums,</hi> which surround, and firmly adhere to the
                    collar of the teeth, arc very vascular, and composed of a dense and compact
                    celhdar substance.</p>
                <p>(609∙) The <hi rend="italic">palate</hi> is divided into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >palatum durum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">palatum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >molle.</hi> The former is composed of the palate plates of the upper jaw,
                    covered by periosteum, and by the membrane of the mouth, which here forms
                    numerous rugae. The <hi rend="italic">soft palate,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >velum pendulum</hi><hi rend="italic">palati,</hi> is the name of that
                    membranous curtain which hangs from the posterior edge of the ossa palati, and
                    pterygoid processes, and forms a flexible partition between the mouth and
                    throat. It serves to conduct the fluids of the nose downwards, and at the same
                    time acts as a valve in preventing the passage into the nostril i of what is
                    swallowed. In the middle of the edge of the velum, a conical papilla, termed the
                    <hi rend="italic">uvula,</hi> is met with, and in the relaxed state hangs
                    pendulous over the root of the tongue.</p>
                <p>(610.) The <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> is a complex organ, principally
                    consisting of a mass of muscular fibres, irregularly disposed, and crossing each
                    other in a great variety of directions, and being also intermixed with a soft
                    kind of fat. It is invested by a mucous membrane, being a continuation of that
                    which lines the mouth generally, and which here presents large and numerous <hi
                    rend="italic">papillae.</hi> These papillaeare distinguished by anatomists into
                    three kinds, according to their size, form, and situation. The first class of
                    these, <hi rend="italic">edVuA papillae rnaximae,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lenticulares,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">capitatae,</hi> are by much the
                    largest, have a lenticular form, with round heads and short stems. They are
                    placed at the base of the tongue, in superficial fossulae. They have been
                    regarded as auxiliary salivary glands, and have each a perforation in the middle
                    of their convex surface for the excretion of mucus. The second class, or <hi
                    rend="italic">papillae mediae,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">semi-lenticulares,</hi>
                    are much smaller than the former, and are scattered over the upper surface of
                    the tongue, at some distance from each other; their form is cylindric, while
                    some are terminated by a round, but not dilated extremity. Others are more or
                    less tuberculated at the summit. The third class, or <hi rend="italic">papillae
                    minimae,</hi> which have also been termed <hi rend="italic">conicae,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">villosae,</hi> are exceedingly numerous, but of very minute size.
                    They cover almost the whole of the upper surface of the tongue, but are most
                    abundant towards the tip, where the sense of taste is most acute.</p>
                <p>(611.) The membrane covering the root of the tongue abounds with <hi
                    rend="italic">mucous follicles.</hi> At the root of the tongue, and behind the
                    papillae rnaximae, there is a hole or deep depression, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >∖he</hi><hi rend="italic">foramen caecum</hi><hi rend="italic">Morgagni,</hi>
                    which penetrates only a small way into the substance of the tongue, and receives
                    the mouths of several excretory ducts that open into it. A line is also
                    observable running forwards along the middle of the tongue, from the foramen
                    coecum; this is the <hi rend="italic">linea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >linguae</hi><hi rend="italic">mediana.</hi> The tongue is somewhat restrained
                    in its motions by the <hi rend="italic">fraenurn linguae,</hi> which is formed
                    by a duplicature of membrane at its under part, connecting it with the jaw.</p>
                <p>(612.) All sapid substances require, in order to produce an impression of taste,
                    to be applied in a state of solution to the nerves of that sense. Nature has
                    accordingly provided a fluid secretion for the purpose of effecting their
                    solution, and diffusing them over a sufficient extent of the surface of the
                    tongue. This secretion, which is the saliva, is prepared by the <hi
                    rend="italic">salivary glands,</hi> which consist of three large glands on each
                    side of the face, namely, the <hi rend="italic">parotid,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">submaxillary,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">sublingual.</hi> The
                    parotid is the largest of the three, and occupies the whole space between the
                    ear and the angle of the lower jaw; its excretory duct, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stends salivary duct,</hi> passes off from the upper and fore part of the
                    gland, and perforates the buccinator muscle, so as to open in the inside of the
                    cheeks, opposite to the second or third molar tooth of the upper jaw. The <hi
                    rend="italic">submaxillary,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inferior maxillary</hi>
                    gland, is situated on the inside of the angle of the lower jaw; its duct is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">ductus Whartonii,</hi> and it terminates by a small
                    orifice on the surface of a papilla on the side of the fraenurn linguae. <hi
                    rend="italic">The sublingual gland</hi> is still smaller, and is under the
                    anterior portion of the tongue above the duct of Wharton, and its ducts open by
                    several orifices arranged in a line near the gums, a little to the outside of
                    the fraenurn. The smaller salivary glands of the mouth are very numerous, and
                    are named from their situation, <hi rend="italic">buccales, labiales,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">palatinae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">linguales.</hi></p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Function of Taste.</hi></p>
                <p>(613) Attempts have often been made, but with no great success, to establish a
                    classification of tastes. The general characters of the tastes denominated acid,
                    sweet, bitter, saline, alkaline, aromatic, astringent, acrid, and spirituous,
                    are sufficiently known, but their combinations are endless; ∙ and there exists
                    besides these, a greater number of other tastes, which it would be impossible to
                    reduce to any of the above classes.</p>
                <p>(614.) The principle on which sapid bodies act upon the tongue is probably
                    resolvable in all cases into chemical action. It is observed, accordingly, that
                    substances which are in a solid form, and absolutely insoluble in the saliva,
                    are invariably tasteless; just as in chemistry it is an established axiom that
                    bodies do not act chemically unless they are either in a liquid or gascons
                    state. Mr. Mayo observes, that the sensations of taste are not perfect until the
                    mouth is closed, and the tongue pressed against the palate, by which means the
                    sapid liquid is brought into more exact contact with the surface of the tongue,
                    and perhaps forced into the texture of its mucous membrane.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499719" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9719-0664"/>
                <p>(615.) The organ of taste appears to be exclusively the upper and papillated
                    surface of the tongue; for although the impressions of this sense are often
                    referred to the palate, inside of the cheeks and gums, accurate discrimination
                    shows that this reference to the parts against which the sapid body is pressed
                    by the tongue, is deceptive, that the real seat of the sense is confined to the
                    tongue itself, and that its immediate organs are the papillae, and more
                    particularly those denominated <hi rend="italic">conicae</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">villosae,</hi> which are highly vascular and erectile, being
                    observed to rise above the surface of the tongue when any sapid substance is
                    applied to it. On the other hand, no papillae are discoverable on the
                    palate.</p>
                <p>Some substances, such as peppermint, produce a pungent impression on the back of
                    the fauces; and others, again, such as mezereon, excite in the same part a
                    peculiar sense of irritation, which appears to proceed more from a generally
                    acrimonious property, affecting particularly the nervous surfaces, than from any
                    real sapidity; indeed, if the impressions made on the organs of smell be
                    excluded from consideration, it will be found that the extent of the part of the
                    tongue which really receives impressions of taste, is very limited. Mr.
                    Mayo<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Outlines of Human
                    Physiology.</p></note> states that salt, aloes, sugar, or acids, which excite
                    the most acute sensation when applied to the tip or edge of the tongue,*produce
                    none at the fore or upper part of the organ, or on the hard palate. But at the
                    back of the tongue they again excite sensation enough to be distinguishable, and
                    they are still more perfectly tasted on the middle of the soft palate and uvula.
                    The participation of the soft palate in the sense of taste has been recently
                    pointed out by MM. Guyot and Admyranld, and has been carefully verified by Mr.
                    Wheatstone and Mr. Mayo. These latter gentlemen did not find that one taste was
                    perceived more distinctly than another, at any point of the tongue or soft
                    palate.</p>
                <p>There is no circumstance more remarkable, with relation to this sense, than its
                    intimate connexion with that of smell, of which we are next to speak.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III— <hi rend="italic">Smell.</hi></p>
                <p>(616.) The purpose answered by the sense of smell is apparently to guard against
                    the introduction into the lungs of injurious effluvia, as that of taste is to
                    watch over the qualities of the substances introduced into the stomach. Its seat
                    is the Schneiderian membrane lining the cavity of the nostrils; and more
                    particularly the turbinated bones, which are placed so as to catch the odorous
                    effluvia directly as these enter the nostrils, and which, together with the
                    cavities or sinuses in the contiguous bones, contribute to extend considerably
                    the surfaces on which the impression of these effluvia is made.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Organs of Smell.</hi></p>
                <p>(617.) The organ of smell may be divided into the <hi rend="italic">external</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">internal parts.</hi></p>
                <p>The external part, or <hi rend="italic">nose,</hi> properly so called, consists
                    principally of an upper bony portion commonly called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bridge of the nose,</hi> composed of the ossa nasi, supported by a vertical
                    process from the aethmoid bone, together with the vomer, and an inferior
                    cartilaginous portion, of which the middle prominence is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">dorsum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the rounded portions below are
                    the <hi rend="italic">aloe nasi,</hi> or wings; and the cartilage forming the
                    partition between the nostrils is termed the <hi rend="italic">columna</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nasi.</hi> These cartilages have a degree of elasticity which
                    preserves the form of the organ.</p>
                <p>The internal parts are contained in the cavities of the nostrils, which are
                    divided by the <hi rend="italic">septum</hi><hi rend="italic">narium</hi> into
                    two lateral passages. In the upper part of each nostril, a spongy bone of a
                    lengthened but irregular shape, the <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >turbinatum</hi><hi rend="italic">superius,</hi> which belongs to the aethmoid
                    bone. Below this extends the <hi rend="italic">inferior turbinated bone,</hi> so
                    that the general cavity is divided by these bones into three passages for the
                    air, running from before backwards; they have been respectively named by Haller
                    the <hi rend="italic">meatus narium</hi><hi rend="italic">superior,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">medius,</hi><hi rend="italic">and inferior.</hi></p>
                <p>(618.) The extent of the cavities belonging to the nose is much increased by
                    their communicating with various sinuses, or cavities in the neighbouring bones,
                    namely, the <hi rend="italic">frontal, sphenoidal,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >maxillary sinuses.</hi> Posteriorly the nostrils open into the pharynx, by two
                    orifices, termed the <hi rend="italic">posterior nares.</hi> All these cavities,
                    together with the sinuses with which they communicate, are lined with a sensible
                    and delicate mucous membrane, termed the <hi rend="italic">pituitary
                    membrane,</hi> or sometimes, from the anatomist who first accurately described
                    it, the <hi rend="italic">membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">Schneideriana.</hi> The
                    lower part of the lacrymal sac becoming somewhat narrower, but without forming
                    any valve, passes into the nose, under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >lacrymal</hi><hi rend="italic">duct,</hi><hi rend="italic">canalis
                    nasalis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ductus ad nasurn.</hi> At the posterior part
                    of the nares is the opening of the Eus-tachion tube, leading to the tympanic
                    cavity of the ear.*</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Function of Smell.</hi></p>
                <p>(619·) The impressions made on the two senses of taste and smell, have not only a
                    great affinity to each other, but also an intimate connexion; inasmuch as many
                    of those referred to the organ of taste are in reality made on the organ of
                    smell, and are not perceived at all if the nostrils be closed, and the odorous
                    effluvia arising from the substance placed on the tongue be consequently
                    prevented from ascending, and acting on the sentient membrane lining their
                    cavity. When the Schneiderian membrane is inflamed, the taste of all those
                    substances, of which the flavour consists in their scent alone, is altogether
                    lost; and as this is the case with by far the greater number of substances
                    employed as food, the sense of taste appears, under these circumstances, to be
                    very imperfect. Both these senses, but particularly that of smell, are possessed
                    by man in a degree very inferior to that in which they exist in the lower
                    animals.</p>
                <p>(620.) It is essential to the exercise of this sense, that the membrane of the
                    nostrils should be in a moist state; for when it happens to be dry from a
                    deficiency of secretion, the extremities of the olfactory nerves are unfitted
                    for the reception of the impression of odours. It is also necessary for smelling
                    that the air charged with the odorous effluvia should impinge with some degree
                    of force against the Schneiderian membrane.</p>
                <p>The seat of greatest sensibility to odours is the upper part of the nostrils; and
                    the form of the nose and of its apertures are obviously adapted to direct the
                    stream of a.ir towards those parts. It is found, accordingly, that when the nose
                    has been destroyed by disease, the smell is greatly impaired, if not altogether
                    lost.</p>
                <p>(621.) Odours as well as tastes have been attempted to be classed. Linnaeus
                    distributed them into seven classes: 1. <hi rend="italic">ambrosial,</hi> of
                    which the smell of the rose and musk are examples; 2. <hi rend="italic"
                    >fragrant,</hi> as the smell of the lily, of the jasmin, and of saffron; these
                    are more evanescent than the former; 3d. <hi rend="italic">aromatic,</hi> as the
                    smell of the laurel; 4. <hi rend="italic">alliaceous,</hi> partaking of the
                    odour of garlic; 5. <hi rend="italic">faetid,</hi> exemplified in valerian and
                    mushrooms; 6. <hi rend="italic">virous,</hi> or narcotic, as in the smell of
                    opium; 7. <hi rend="italic">nauseous,</hi> as that of the gourd, melon, and
                    cucumber. But this classification is obviously incomplete, as it omits several
                    very distinct classes of odours, such as that of alcohol, of aether, of camphor,
                    of ammonia, of chlorine, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>(622.) Any very acrid or stimulating vapour admitted to the nostrils, instead of
                    producing the sensation of smell, gives <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499732"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9732-0665"/>rise to mere painful irritation, which excites
                    sneezing, and a copious secretion of mueus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV— <hi rend="italic">Hearing.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Acoustic Principles.</hi></p>
                <p>(623.) The object of the sense of hearing is to convey to us certain impressions
                    made on the nerves of the ear by the vibrations of the air; which vibrations are
                    the result of some mechanical impulse communicated to it by the motion of a body
                    at a distance. Other media besides air are also capable of transmitting sonorous
                    vibrations to the organ of hearing; thus water is known to convey sounds to
                    great distances; and solid bodies possess the same power in a degree
                    proportioned to their molecular elasticity. If the body which is the source of
                    sound be insulated from any such medium, its vibrations cannot be communicated,
                    and no sound is heard. Thus if a bell be placed in the receiver of an air-pump,
                    in proportion as the air is exhausted the sound it produces when struck becomes
                    more and more faint, till at length, when the rarefaction has been carried a
                    certain length, it is quite inaudible. If the same bell be placed in a vessel of
                    condensed air, the sound it gives out will be louder than in air of the ordinary
                    density.</p>
                <p>(624.) The velocity with which sound is transmitted in air of the same density is
                    uniform at all distances, and for all sounds whatsoever. As the air of the
                    atmosphere varies in its density, and also in its degrees of humidity, the
                    velocity of sound is not constantly the same. It may be taken at an average as
                    being 1100 feet in a second, or nearly thirteen miles in a minute.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Organ of Hearing.</hi></p>
                <p>(625.) The organ of hearing is divided into the <hi rend="italic">external</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">internal ear.</hi></p>
                <p>(626.) The <hi rend="italic">external ear·,</hi> comprehends the <hi
                    rend="italic">auricula,</hi> or ear, properly so called, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">meatus</hi><hi rend="italic">auditorius externus.</hi></p>
                <p>(627∙) The auricula is chiefly composed of an <hi rend="italic">elastic
                    cartilage</hi> bent into various folds and hollows, and covered with a thin
                    layer of common integuments, the lower fold of which, enlarged by the addition
                    of cellular substance, forms the depending part called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >lobe of the ear.</hi> The cartilaginous portion is termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pinna,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ala.</hi> Its outer circle, or prominent
                    margin, is called, from its winding direction, the <hi rend="italic">helix.</hi>
                    The semicircular ridge within this is the <hi rend="italic">antihelix</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the small protuberance, in which the helix appears to
                    terminate below at its inner edge, is called the <hi rend="italic">tragus,</hi>
                    from its being frequently covered with hair. Another eminence, nearly opposite
                    to this, below the anterior extremity of the antihelix, and projecting outwards
                    over the hollow of the ear, is called the <hi rend="italic">antitragus.</hi>
                    Between the helix and antihelix, is the cavity called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scaphus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >navicularis.</hi></p>
                <p>(628.) The <hi rend="italic">concha</hi> is a large depression under the
                    antihelix, and divided into two parts by the helix. The lower of these leads to
                    the <hi rend="italic">meatus</hi><hi rend="italic">auditorius,</hi> a passage
                    which at its commencement is composed of cartilage, and farther on is joined to
                    the orifice of the same name in the temporal bone. The cartilaginous tube is
                    lined by a soft membrane, giving rise to hairs, and containing small glands, the
                    <hi rend="italic">glandulae ceruminosoe,</hi> which secrete the wax of the ear.
                    This cartilaginous portion of the ear is attached to the temporal bone by
                    several ligaments and muscles; the effects of which in moving the different
                    parts of the external ear are in general very little sensible.</p>
                <p>(629∙) The membrane lining the meatus is continued along the osseous portion of
                    the canal, which is closed by the <hi rend="italic">drum</hi> of the ear, or <hi
                    rend="italic">membrana tympani.</hi> This is a firm, oval, and almost
                    transparent membrane, fixed in an osseous groove at the bottom of the meatus,
                    across which it lies in an oblique position. It is slightly concave on the
                    external side; and is capable of being stretched or relaxed by the action of
                    particular muscles.</p>
                <p>(630.) The membrane of the tympanum divides the external from the internal ear.
                    Behind it we find an irregular cavity, called the <hi rend="italic">tympanic
                    cavity,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cavity of the tympanum,</hi> which is filled
                    with air; it is about seven or eight lines wide, and about half that space in
                    breadth; and is every where lined by a fine membrane. It has four openings; the
                    first is the small orifice of a passage of communication with the back of the
                    cavity of the nostrils, which is called the <hi rend="italic">Eustachian
                    tube,</hi> and is shaped like a trumpet, expanding as it approaches the fauces.
                    The second aperture leads to a number of irregular cells, formed in the mastoid
                    process of the temporal bone, and called the <hi rend="italic">mastoid
                    cells.</hi> At the back part of the tympanum we find an oval opening, called the
                    <hi rend="italic">fenestra</hi><hi rend="italic">ovalis,</hi> and below this a
                    round perforation, termed the <hi rend="italic">fenestra rotunda.</hi> Between
                    these fenestrae, is a bony eminence, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >promontory.</hi></p>
                <p>(631.) Within the cavity of the tympanum are contained four small bones, the <hi
                    rend="italic">ossicula auditus,</hi> placed in a series or chain extending
                    across from the membrana tympani to the fenestra ovalis. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >malleus,</hi> or hammer, is the first of these bones; a long pointed process
                    from which, namely, the <hi rend="italic">processus brevis,</hi> or handle, is
                    fixed to the membrana tympani. It is articulated by its round head with the next
                    bone, the <hi rend="italic">incus,</hi> or anvil, which much resembles in its
                    shape a molar tooth, having a body and two unequal crura. With the longest of
                    these processes is articulated the <hi rend="italic">os orbicularis,</hi> of a
                    rounded figure, and smaller than a grain of mustard seed. It forms the medium of
                    connexion between the ineus and the <hi rend="italic">stapes,</hi> which is the
                    last bone in the series, and is so named from its striking resemblance in form
                    to a stirrup. The base of the stapes is fixed to the margin of the fenestra
                    ovalis, which it accurately closes. The articulations of these minute bones are
                    furnished with capsular ligaments, and all the apparatus of the larger joints;
                    appropriate muscles being also provided for their movements. Between the malleus
                    and the incus, there passes a small nervous cord, which crosses the tympanum,
                    and is accordingly named the <hi rend="italic">cliorda</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tympani.</hi></p>
                <p>(632.) The principal cavity of the organ of hearing is situated still more
                    internally, and from the intricacy of its winding sinuosities it has received
                    the general name of <hi rend="italic">the labyrinth.</hi> All its cavities and
                    passages are lined with a very delicate periosteum, and filled with a watery
                    fluid, and withinthem issuspended a pulpy membrane of a similar shape, on which
                    are distributed various nervous filaments presently to be described.
                    Thissaecular-shaped membrane is termed by Breschet the <hi rend="italic"
                    >membranous labyrinth,</hi> in order to distinguish it from the osseous
                    labyrinth, in which it is contained. It forms one continuous closed sac
                    extending within the vestibule and canals, excepting those of the cochlea; and
                    contains a fluid, perfectly similar to the perilymph, and termed by Blain ville,
                    <hi rend="italic">vitrine</hi><hi rend="italic">auditive,</hi> which,
                    intervening between it and the osseous parietes of the labyrinth, surrounds it
                    on all sides, andprevents its coming in contact with those bones.</p>
                <p>The central cavity, in which all these passages meet, is termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">vestibule;</hi> it is of an oval figure, and is situated nearly in
                    the centre of the os petrosum, and at the inner side of the fenestra ovalis. On
                    the side of the vestibule next to the mastoid process, there are five orifices
                    leading to the three <hi rend="italic">semicircular canals,</hi> as they are
                    called, or passages formed within the substance of the bone. The extremities of
                    two of these canals unite, and terminate by a common opening; hence there appear
                    in the vestibule only five openings, instead of six. These canals are
                    distinguished by the names of the <hi rend="italic">superior,</hi> or vertical,
                    <hi rend="italic">Aw posterior,</hi> or oblique, and tþe <hi rend="italic"
                    >exterior,</hi> or horizontal. They each form a curvature of more than
                    three-fourths of a circle, and have an enlargement, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >ampulla,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cavitas elliptica,</hi> at one end, the
                    other extremity being nearly of the same size as the rest of the canal.</p>

                <p>(633.) The <hi rend="italic">cochlea,</hi> which is the third division of the
                    labyrinth, has a conical shape, and is situated at the anterior part of the os
                    petrosum, and at the fore-part of the vestibule, with its base towards the
                    meatus auditorius internus, and its apex in the opposite direction; that is,
                    facing outwards. It contains a double spiral passage, winding round like the
                    shell of a snail. This passage begins by a round hole from the vestibule, and
                    after forming two turns and a half, becomes suddenly smaller on arriving at the
                    apex, where it communicates with a similar tube which takes its rise at the base
                    of the cochlea from the fenestra rotunda, formerly noticed as one of the
                    apertures of the cavity of the tympanum; but which is closed by a membrane. The
                    partition which divides these two winding passages is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">lamina spiralis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">septum scalae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for the passages themselves are known by the name of the
                    <hi rend="italic">scalae cochleae;</hi> that which communicates with the
                    vestibule being distinguished as the <hi rend="italic">scala vestibuli,</hi> and
                    the other, from its connexion with the tympanum, the <hi rend="italic">scala
                    tympani.</hi> The central bony pillar, around which these turns are made has a
                    horizontal direction, and is called the <hi rend="italic">modiolus.</hi> It has
                    the shape of a cone, at the apex of which is situated another hollow cone in a
                    reverse position termed the <hi rend="italic">infundibulum,</hi> which, however,
                    is an imperfect funnel, having a common apex with the modiolus, and its base
                    being covered by the apex of the cochlea, which is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cupola.</hi></p>
                <p>(634.) It has been supposed that when the fluid in these cavities is in too great
                    a quantity, the superfluous portion is carried off by two minute canals or <hi
                    rend="italic">aqueducts,</hi> discovered by <hi rend="italic">Cotunnius,</hi>
                    and bearing his name. One of these opens into the bottom of the vestibule, and
                    the other into the cochlea, near the fenestra rotunda. They bear the names
                    respectively of <hi rend="italic">aquaeductus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vestibuli</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aquaeductus cochleae.</hi> They both pass
                    through the os petrosum, and communicate with the cavity of the cranium.</p>
                <p>The form of that part of the membranous labyrinth which occupies the cavity of
                    the vestibule, and which has accordingly received the name of the <hi

                    that of the cavity itself, yet differs from it in some degree, being composed of
                    two sacs opening into each other. One of these sacs is termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">utricle;</hi> and the other the <hi rend="italic">sacculus.</hi>
                    Each sac contains in its interior a small mass of white calcareous matter
                    resembling powdered chalk, and which seems to be suspended in the fluid contents
                    of the sac by means of a number of nervous filaments, derived from the acoustic
                    nerves, and of which they appear to be the ultimate ramifications.<note

                <p>(635.) Through an opening at the base of the modiolus, a branch of the auditory
                    nerve, which has entered by the meatus auditorius internus, passes into the
                    funnel-shaped cavity, and is thence extended through the spiral canals; while
                    another branch passes backwards through the vestibule, and dividing into several
                    branches, enters the orifices of the semicircular canals. The minute branches
                    perforate a part of the bone, which has been termed from its appearance, the <hi
                    rend="italic">cribriform plate.</hi></p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Function of Hearing.</hi></p>
                <p>(636.) We thus see that the ear is an organ extremely complicated in its
                    structure, evidently intended to convey the sonorous undulations of the air,
                    after they are collected by the more external parts of the organ, to the
                    branches of the auditory nerve, which are spread over the membranes lining the
                    different cavities of the labyrinth, and the cretaceous bodies suspended within
                    those membranes. We may therefore distinguish the several parts of the apparatus
                    employed for this purpose, according as they are merely -designed to collect the
                    aerial undulations, and increase their intensity by concentrating them into a
                    smaller space; or according as they contain the expanded nerves on which the
                    impression is ultimately made. It appears that the medium by which this last
                    effect is produced, is the perilymph, or fluid filling the cavities of the
                    labyrinth, and containing the exquisitely delicate membrane and cretaceous
                    bodies on which the extreme fibrils of the auditory nerve are expanded. This
                    fluid is put in motion by the air in the cavity of the tympanum, and thrown into
                    corresponding undulations.</p>
                <p>(637.) The accessory parts of the organ of hearing may therefore be divided into
                    three parts. There is, first, the external ear, which is an elastic
                    cartilaginous appendage to the organ, curiously grooved, so as to form a series
                    of parabolic curves, adapted to receive the undulations of the air, and convey
                    them into the passage of the meatus externus, serving apparently an office
                    similar to that of the expanded part of a trumpet. The sonorous undulations are
                    thus made to strike against the membrane of the tympanum, or ear-drum, which is
                    stretched across, and closes the passage. The cavity behind this membrane is
                    filled with air, which is next thrown into undulations by the medium of the
                    eardrum, the vibrations of which have been excited by those of the external air.
                    In order to preserve an equilibrium between the air in the cavity of the
                    tympanum and the external air, so that the membrane may not sustain a greater
                    pressure on one side than on the other, a communication is kept open with the
                    back part of the throat by means of the <hi rend="italic">Eustachian tube.</hi>
                    Hearing is always much impaired, if from any cause the Eustachian tube is
                    obstructed, as it sometimes is by a common cold, which then produces a temporary
                    deafness.</p>
                <p>(638.) The cavity of the tympanum is of a very singular form, extending into the
                    mastoid process of the temporal bone, which has a cellular structure. A chain of
                    minute bones, the ossicula auditus, extends, as’we have seen, across the cavity,
                    terminating at the fenestra ovalis, or aperture leading to the vestibule; while
                    another aperture, the fenestra rotunda, also closed by membrane, leads to one of
                    the spiral turns of the cochlea. Thus, the fluid in the labyrinth receives from
                    the impulses made on these two membranes, which are situated in two different
                    planes, a double undulation; and these two undulations, the one circulating
                    along the semicircular canals, the other through the spiral turns of the
                    cochlea, probably unite at some focal spot, like the meeting of two tidal waves,
                    and increase the effect produced. These undulations must of course be variously
                    modified, according to their frequency, and the order of their succession, and
                    the impressions made on the nerve must undergo corresponding modifications. But
                    we are so completely in the dark as to the real office of the several parts of
                    this elaborately constructed organ, that it is exceedingly difficult to
                    prosecute the physiology of this sense with such imperfect data. We are unable
                    even to form a rational conjecture as to the offices of the delicate muscles
                    provided for directing the movements of those ossicula, which are articulated
                    with such great nicety, and which seem calculated to alter the tension of the
                    membrana tympani, and bring it into a state capable of vibrating in unison with
                    the sonorous undulations that impinge upon it. What adds in no small degree to
                    our embarrassment, is the knowledge we have acquired of the power of hearing
                    being retained, without apparent diminution, when the greater part of this
                    apparatus of bones, with their joints and muscles, and even the ear-drum itself,
                    has been destroyed by accident or disease.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    necessarily produces incurable deafness, by the attendant injury of the
                    labyrinth.</p>
                <p>(639∙) Sir Everard Home imagined that the muscular structure of the membrana
                    tympani, enabling it to contract or relax according to circumstances, so as to
                    vibrate in unison with the musical notes which reached the ear, conferred the
                    power of distinguishing musical tones. But this ingenious hypothesis is
                    completely overturned by the fact above stated, of the integrity of the membrane
                    of the tympanum not being necessary for the perfect accuracy of the sense of
                    hearing, even with relation to the distinction of musical sounds. Dr. Young
                    thinks it probable that the semicircular canals which are disposed in a
                    remarkable manner in three orthogonal planes, corresponding to the three
                    dimensions of space, enable us to estimate the acuteness or pitch of a sound;
                    and that the cochlea serves the office of a micrometer of sound.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Medical Literature, p. 98;
                    and Lectures, vol. i. p. 387.</p></note> But the grounds of these opinions are
                    too vague and conjectural to inspire us with any confidence in their solidity.
                    When the external passages are totally obstructed, sonorous vibrations may still
                    be transmitted to the auditory nerves by means of the bones of the head. Thus,
                    the sound of a tuning fork applied to the teeth, or even to other parts of the
                    head, is perfectly audible under these circumstances. We thus possess a
                    criterion for determining, in cases of deafness, whether the disease consists in
                    the insensibility of the nerves to these impressions, or is seated in the
                    passages leading to the labyrinth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V— <hi rend="italic">Vision.</hi></p>
                <p>(640.) The physiology of the eye is more interesting than that of any of the
                    other organs of the senses; because, from the knowledge we possess of the laws
                    of optics, to which it is so admirably adapted, we can understand the offices of
                    its several parts, and the mode in which they concur in the production of the
                    resulting effect. The study of the eye has been said to be the best cure for
                    atheism; and it furnishes, indeed, the most striking and unequivocal proofs of
                    the existence of design and intelligence in the construction of the animal
                    fabric. These proofs have accordingly been always among those most prominently
                    adduced by philosophers in support of the arguments of natural theology.</p>
                <p>(641.) The organs subservient to vision are lodged securely in the bony cavities
                    of the orbits, where the surrounding bones protect them on every side, excepting
                    in iront. They may be divided into the internal and the external parts; the
                    former consisting of the spherical bodies denominated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >globes of the eye,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">eye-balls</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and the latter comprising parts which give motion to the globe, and
                    otherwise assist it in its functions.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Internal parts of the Eye.</hi></p>
                <p>(642.) The eye-ball is composed of segments of two unequal spheres; one of which,
                    constituting about four-fifths of the whole, forms the portion which is within
                    the orbit; while the other fifth is that part which is seen in front, and which,
                    being a portion of a smaller sphere, is more protuberant. The diameter of the
                    eye· ball, from behind forwards, is accordingly longer than its transverse
                    diameter; the proportion being that of twenty-five to twenty-three.</p>
                <p>(643.) The eye-ball is made up of coats and humors. The former consist of the <hi
                    rend="italic">sclerotica, cornea, choroides,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >retina,</hi> together with the <hi rend="italic">conjunctiva.</hi> Of the
                    latter there are three, viz. the <hi rend="italic">vitreous, crystalline,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">aqueous humors.</hi></p>
                <p>(644.) The <hi rend="italic">sclerotica,</hi> which is the exterior coat, is,
                    from its compact fibrous texture, the densest and strongest, as well as the
                    thickest of the tunics of the eye, and the one from which the other parts of the
                    eye-ball derive their principal support. It covers all that portion of the globe
                    of the eye, which has already been pointed out as constituting its largest
                    segment. At its anterior edge it is joined to the more convex tunic, which
                    completes the figure, and is named the <hi rend="italic">cornea,</hi> from its
                    being composed of a great number of concentric laminae, of a horny elastic
                    texture. Some authors have given it the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cornea</hi><hi rend="italic">lucida,</hi> from its perfect transparency, and by
                    way of contrast to the sclerotica, which they had named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cornea</hi><hi rend="italic">opaca.</hi></p>
                <p>(645.) The <hi rend="italic">choroid coat,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tunica
                    choroides,</hi> lies immediately within the sclerotica, and is composed of a
                    congeries of blood-vessels connected together by membrane. It has been
                    distinguished into two layers, the innermost of which has been termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">tunica Puyschiana.</hi> At the middle of the choroid coat are
                    observed numerous vessels convoluted into a spiral form. These have been termed
                    the <hi rend="italic">venae vor-ticoae.</hi> The internal surface of the tunica
                    Ruyschiana, or <hi rend="italic">tapetum,</hi> as it has been called, seems,
                    from its villous or fleecy appearance, to be a secreting surface. It is
                    everywhere lined with a black or deep-brown mucous substance, included in a fine
                    cellular tissue. This is the <hi rend="italic">pigmentum nigrum,</hi> which
                    forms a layer, separating the choroides from the next coat, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >retina.</hi> This latter tunic is an expansion of the pulpy substance of the
                    optic nerve, spread over a fine membrane. The optic nerve, from which this
                    medullary matter is derived, enters the eye at its back part, at a point nearer
                    to the nose than the centre, or axis of the eye, and perforates the sclerotic
                    and choroid coats.</p>
                <p>(646.) From the inner margin of the junction of the cornea and sclerotica, there
                    extends across the fore part of the globe of the eye a membranous partition,
                    called, from the variety of its colour, the <hi rend="italic">iris;</hi> it is
                    perforated in the centre by an aperture, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pupil,</hi> because, as it is said, it represents objects no larger than a
                    pupilla, or puppet. The structure of the iris is exceedingly peculiar; it
                    appears to be made up of a number of fibres, which pass from the inner to the
                    outer margin in a radiated direction, together with others which run circularly.
                    These fibres have been presumed to be of a muscular structure; but doubts are
                    still entertained with regard to this point. The posterior surface of the iris
                    is lined with a pigment similar to that which is found within the choroid coat.
                    It has been called the <hi rend="italic">uvea,</hi> from its fancied resemblance
                    in colour to the grape.</p>
                <p>(647.) The iris is connected with the choroid coat by an intermediate structure,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">ciliary ligament, ciliary circle,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">orbiculus ciliaris,</hi> which is a circular belt, more than a
                    line in breadth, made up of a soft and pulpy tissue, and of a whitish colour. It
                    is also at this part that the choroides adheres firmly to the sclerotica. From
                    this part, also, there extends inwards a dark coloured ring, which is a
                    continuation of the choroides, and is termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">ciliare.</hi> It is about the sixth part of an
                    inch in breadth towards the temple, but somewhat narrower towards the nose. It
                    is covered in every part by the pigmentum nigrum. It is marked by radiated
                    striae at its inner part, but they are somewhat obscured by the pigmentum
                    nigrum. At the outer part these striae become gradually broader and more
                    elevated, and appear like folds, only the intervals between them being covered
                    with the pigment. These folds are termed the <hi rend="italic">ciliary
                    processes.</hi> Each of these processes is of an irregular triangular figure,
                    with the base outwards, or at the ciliary circle, and its apex inwards, or
                    towards the axis of the eye. Their number is generally about sixty, and they are
                    alternately longer and shorter.</p>
                <p>(648.) About three-fourths of the globe of the eye, within these several tunics,
                    is filled by a very transparent and gelatinous humor, which, from its supposed
                    resemblance to melted glass, has been termed the <hi rend="italic">vitreous
                    humor.</hi> It is nearly of the consistence of the white of an egg, and consists
                    of a fluid substance contained in the cells of a very fine <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499771" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9771-0668"/>and delicate cellular tissue,
                    called the hyaloid membrane. It is invested by a transparent membrane, termed
                    the <hi rend="italic">tunica vitrea,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">capsule</hi> of
                    the vitreous humor. The anterior surface of the vitreous humour is depressed,
                    for the lodgment of the <hi rend="italic">crystalline lens,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">humor,</hi> which is a dense body, perfectly transparent, and has
                    the shape of a double convex lens, of which the posterior surface has a greater
                    convexity than the anterior surface. The lens is composed of a great number of
                    concentric laminae, which become more and more dense towards the centre, and
                    each lamina is made up of very distinct parallel fibres. It is enclosed in its
                    own peculiar <hi rend="italic">capsule,</hi> in which it appears to float
                    loosely, a watery fluid, called the <hi rend="italic">liquor Morgagni,</hi>
                    being interposed.</p>
                <p>(649.) The fore part of the eye-ball, between the crystalline lens and the
                    cornea, is filled by a watery fluid, called the <hi rend="italic">aqueous
                    humor,</hi> in the middle of which the iris is suspended, thus dividing the
                    space into what arc called the <hi rend="italic">anterior</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">posterior chambers</hi> of the aqueous humor. The aqueous humor,
                    like the other humors, is contained within a delicate membrane, which lines the
                    inside of the cornea, and passes over the crystalline lens and the convex margin
                    of the vitreous humor.</p>
                <p>(650.) The capsule of the lens adheres closely to the tunica vitrea. Behind the
                    edge of the former, and between the margin of the ciliary zone and capsule of
                    the vitreous humor, a triangular passage is formed, called from its discoverer,
                    the <hi rend="italic">circle of Petit,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">canalis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Petitianus.</hi> When air is blown into this passage, it passes
                    freely round the edge of the lens.</p>
                <p>(651.) At that part of the retina which is situated in the axis of the eye, there
                    is a small circle, where the retina is transparent, giving rise to the
                    appearance of a hole, as if the retina were deficient in that part. It was
                    discovered by Soemmerring, and bears the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >foramen</hi><hi rend="italic">centrale</hi><hi rend="italic">of
                    Soernmerring.</hi> It is surrounded by a yellow circle, about a line in
                    diameter. The fibres of the optic nerve, in passing to form the retina,
                    perforate a thin plate of membrane which is extended from the sclerotica, and
                    which is termed the <hi rend="italic">lamina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cribrosa.</hi> The centre of the optic nerve is perforated by the <hi
                    rend="italic">arteria</hi><hi rend="italic">centralis retinae,</hi> forming an
                    aperture which has been called the <hi rend="italic">porus opticus.</hi></p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">External parts of the Eye.</hi></p>
                <p>(652.) The orbit is a conical cavity, in the fore part of which the globe of the
                    eye is situated, the remaining space behind the globe being chiefly filled with
                    fat, which surrounds the optic nerve, and intervenes between it and the straight
                    muscles that extend between the margin of the foramen opticum, through which the
                    optic nerve passes out of the skull and the fore part of the sclerotic coat,
                    where they are inserted by broad and flat tendons. These tendinous expansions
                    have been improperly considered as composing one of the tunics of the eye, which
                    being of a white colour, has received the name of <hi rend="italic">tunica
                    albuginea.</hi></p>
                <p>(653.) The globe of the ey e is covered at the fore part by two eye-lids, or <hi
                    rend="italic">palpebrae,</hi> which are composed of muscular fibres, covered by
                    the common integuments, supported at their edge by a cartilage called the <hi
                    rend="italic">tarsus,</hi> and furnished with a row of hairs, termed <hi
                    rend="italic">cilia,</hi> or eye-lashes. At the roots of the eye-lashes are
                    sebaceous follicles, named from the anatomist who first observed them, the <hi
                    rend="italic">glandulae Meibomii,</hi> and which secrete a glutinous liniment.
                    The eye-lids are lined on their interior surface by a very fine and smooth
                    serous membrane, which is reflected over the anterior part of the globe of the
                    eye, and even over the surface of the cornea. This membrane is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">tunica conjunctiva.</hi></p>
                <p>(654.) Between the ball of the eye and the upper vault of the orbit, on the
                    temporal side, lies the <hi rend="italic">lacrymal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gland,</hi> which secretes the tears. It is composed of a number of small,
                    whitish, granular bodies, which are collected together into two lobes. There is
                    also a chain of smaller glands lying between the principal gland and upper
                    eye-lid, and connecting them together. The excretory ducts from all these glands
                    are exceedingly minute, and terminate in the inner surface of the upper eye-lid,
                    near the outer angle of the eye. After moistening the surface of the eye, the
                    tears are again collected by two small orifices, called <hi rend="italic">(∖∖c
                    jfuncta lacryrnalia,</hi> placed on a small eminence in each eye-lid, near the
                    inner angle of the eye, at the extremity of the tarsus. They are the beginnings
                    of two small canals that run in the direction of the edges of the eye-lids,
                    towards the side of the nose, where they approach each other, and terminate
                    together in the <hi rend="italic">lacrymal</hi><hi rend="italic">sac,</hi> which
                    is a membranous bag situated on the os unguis, and leading to a passage into the
                    cavity of the nostrils. The puncta are kept separate by the interposition of a
                    small reddish body, called the <hi rend="italic">caruncula lacrymalis,</hi>
                    situated between the inner angle of the eye-lids and the ball of the eye. Minute
                    hairs are found upon the surface of this body, which serve to entangle small
                    objects which might otherwise get into the eye. There is also a reduplication of
                    the tunica conjunctiva, shaped like a crescent, and hence termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">valvula semilunaris,</hi> the points of which are directed towards
                    the puncta, and which assists the caruncle in directing the tears to the
                    puncta.</p>
                <p>Having thus described the apparatus for vision, we shall now proceed to consider
                    the mode in which that function is performed.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Optical Principles.</hi></p>
                <p>(655.) The object of this sense is to convey to us a knowledge of the existence
                    and visible qualities of distant objects, by means of the light which they send
                    to the eye. This is accomplished by altering the natural direct course of these
                    rays, so that they may form a distinct image of these objects on the retina.
                    That such images are actually formed on the retina may be easily shewn in the
                    eye of an animal recently killed, by carefully removing the opaque sclerotic and
                    choroid coats, together with the black pigment from the back of the eye, so as
                    to expose the retina. The objects on the other side, in front of the cornea,
                    will then be seen beautifully depicted on the retina, their images being
                    inverted; precisely in the same way, and on the same principles as they are seen
                    in a simple camera obscura.</p>
                <p>(656.) In order to understand and trace the operation of the principles concerned
                    in these phenomena, it will be necessary to refer to the laws of optics.</p>
                <p>The rays of light in traversing any medium of uniform density, move always in
                    straight lines; but when the density changes they deviate somewhat from this
                    rectilinear course, according to the direction of the ray with respect to the
                    planes in which the change of density occurs. Thus a ray from the sun, or other
                    celestial body, traversing obliquely through our atmosphere, the different
                    strata of which are of increasing density as they come nearer to the earth, is
                    gradually bent in its course, and arrives at the surface of the earth in a
                    direction somewhat nearer to a perpendicular line than if there had been no
                    atmosphere. This deflexion from a straight line is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >refraction.</hi> Refraction takes place suddenly, if the ray passes abruptly
                    from one medium to another, which sensibly differs from it in its density; the
                    direction of the deflexion being always towards the denser medium; or, to speak
                    more accurately, towards a line drawn perpendicular to the surface common to the
                    two media, and situated in the denser medium.</p>
                <p>(657∙) In the case of the passage of a ray through the surface of a new medium of
                    very different density from the first, another phenomenon takes place; the ray
                    is decomposed, part being transmitted and refracted, while another portion is
                    turned completely back into the medium it was already traversing. This is termed
                    <hi rend="italic">reflexion.</hi> Objectswhich are not luminous in their own
                    nature are rendered visible <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499784"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9784-0669"/>only by the reflexion from their surfaces of the
                    light which they receive from other bodies. The law in this case is, that the
                    angle of reflexion, by which is meant the angle which the course of the
                    reflected ray makes with a line perpendicular to the surface, is equal to the
                    angle of incidence, or the angle which the incident ray makes with that same
                    perpendicular; and also, that it is in the same plane with the incident ray, and
                    the perpendicular line.</p>
                <p>(658.) The law of refraction is, that the course of the refracted ray is
                    deflected towards that part of the perpendicular which is situated in the denser
                    medium, and that the sine of the angle of refraction, (or the angle it makes
                    with the perpendicular) has to the sine of the angle of incidence the same
                    constant ratio. This ratio increases in proportion to the difference there is
                    between the two media in respect of density.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Formation of Images in the Eye.</hi></p>
                <p>(659∙) It follows as a consequence of the above laws, that a pencil of rays
                    proceeding through the air, and falling on the convex spherical surface of a
                    medium of greater density than the air, (as is the case with the cornea of the
                    eye,) is so refracted as to be collected, after proceeding a certain distance,
                    into one and the same point. This will readily appear when we consider that
                    those rays fall with more obliquity on the cornea, according as they are more
                    distant from the central ray of the pencil, or that which may be conceived to
                    fall perpendicularly on its surface. These more oblique rays are consequently
                    more refracted; that is, more bent from their original course; and this law
                    being observed throughout the whole pencil, all the rayswill tend after
                    refraction to the same point, which point is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >focus</hi> of that pencil of rays.</p>
                <p>(660.) The same process taking place with regard to all the other pencils of rays
                    proceeding respectively^ from the several points of the objects viewed, and each
                    being collected into separate points in different parts of the retina which
                    receives them, images of those objects will be delineated on that membrane; for
                    it is evident that all the focal points will have, with respect to one another,
                    the same relative positions as the points of the external objects from which
                    each pencil of rays proceeds, when referred to the sphere of vision. The
                    impression thus made on each respective point of the retina, is transmitted to
                    the sensorium, where it makes a distinct impression, and gives rise to the
                    sensation of light and colour; and in conjunction with the experience gradually
                    gathered from the sense of touch, imparts to us a knowledge of the existence,
                    relative situation, form, magnitude, distance, and colour of the objects before
                    us. This, then, is vision.</p>
                <p>(661.) Such is the general outline of the mode in which vision is accomplished;
                    but there are a thousand beautiful contrivances and adjustments provided for
                    ensuring the accuracy with which this picture of the surrounding scene is
                    portrayed on the retina. The perfection of vision is entirely dependent on the
                    distinctness, the vividness, and the fidelity of this picture; and the whole
                    apparatus of the eye is calculated to obtain these qualities.</p>
                <p>(662.) The purposes served by the apparatus external to the globe of the eye, are
                    sufficiently obvious. The effectual protection given to the eye by the arched
                    form of the bones which compose the orbit,—the provision of a soft cushion in
                    the fat which occupies the bottom of the cavity,—the beautiful contrivance of
                    the eye-lids, which, on the least appearance of danger, are ever ready to close
                    upon the organs they are appointed to guard,—and even the direction of the
                    eyebrows, intended to divert the course of the perspiration from the forehead,
                    are all calculated to call forth our admiration, because the end to be answered
                    being obvious, we can judge of the fitness of the means for the accomplishment
                    of those ends. A still further proof of exquisite design offers itself in the
                    lacrymal apparatus, which provides the means of preserving the surface of the
                    cornea always clean and transparent, and fitted for its office of regularly
                    refracting the rays of light.</p>
                <p>(663.) The humors of the eye, through which the light passes before arriving at
                    the retina, have different degrees of density, and consequently have different
                    degrees of refractive power. The first and greatest refraction of the rays takes
                    place at the outer surface of the cornea; the next is at the inner surface,
                    where the rays meet with the aqueous humor. Now this humor is rather less dense
                    than the cornea, and consequently the rays already refracted, and rendered
                    convergent by the cornea, have their convergence slightly diminished, when they
                    traverse the aqueous humor. These, in fact, are converging towards points at
                    some distance beyond the retina. The iris is interposed in the course of the
                    rays while they are passing through the aqueous humor; the circular aperture of
                    this membrane, the pupil, admitting only the more central portion of each pencil
                    of rays. By intercepting the extreme rays, which, in consequence of a
                    peculiarity in the law of spherical refraction, hereafter to be explained,
                    would, if allowed to reach the retina, somewhat confuse the image, greater
                    clearness of that image is obtained, at the sacrifice, indeed, of a portion of
                    brightness. It serves, accordingly, the same purpose with regard to the eye,
                    which the circular ring, placed in the interior of a telescope, effects in
                    contracting the aperture of the instrument; rendering the image more distinct,
                    though less illuminated than it would otherwise be. But the iris has this great
                    superiority over the circle in the telescope, inasmuch as it is capable by its
                    contractile power· of enlarging or diminishing the aperture of the pupil, as
                    occasion requires. Thus, when the object viewed is but faintly illuminated, the
                    pupil is enlarged, and admits more light, thus giving greater brightness to the
                    picture; an advantage which more than compensates for the slight indistinctness
                    of the fainter images composing that picture. When, on the contrary, an object
                    is too bright, so that its image would produce too vivid an impression on the
                    retina, the pupil immediately contracts, so as to reduce the quantity of light
                    admitted into the interior of the eye, and to prevent any injurious effect upon
                    the retina.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Adjustments for the Correction of Aberration.</hi></p>
                <p>(664.) That part of the converging pencil of rays, which is admitted through the
                    pupil, falls upon the anterior convex surface of the crystalline lens, which
                    being denser than the aqueous humor, occasions a new refraction of the rays, and
                    gives them an increased degree of convergence, so that theynow tend to foci
                    nearer to the retina than before, though still somewhat beyond it.</p>
                <p>(665.) An exquisite provision is found in the peculiar structure of the lens for
                    correcting what is termed the <hi rend="italic">spherical aberration.</hi> It is
                    a necessary consequence of the mathematical law of refraction, that in a pencil
                    of rays falling on the convex spherical surfiice of a denser medium, those rays
                    which are farthest from the central ray, will be bent somewhat more than is
                    requisite to bring them to the same focal point as the rays which are nearer to
                    the centre of the pencil; hence all the rays can never be collected accurately
                    into the same point; although in ordinary optical instruments, such as common
                    telescopes, and camera obscura, the aberration thus resulting is confined within
                    such narrow limits as not to produce any very great inconvenience. But in the
                    eye even this minute defect of ordinary optical instruments is remedied. The
                    lens is composed of successive laminae, increasing in their density and
                    refractive power, in proportion as they approach the centre; that central part
                    being the hardest and densest of the whole. The central rays of each pencil,
                    therefore, are subjected to a greater refractive action than the more exterior
                    rays, and the whole.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499797" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9797-0670"/>
                <p>are brought accurately to convergence at the same focal point.</p>
                <p>(666.) After passing through the crystalline lens, the rays enter the vitreous
                    humor, where, again, there is a change of density in the medium. The density of
                    the vitreous humor is less than that of the lens; and were its surface convex,
                    the convergence of the rays would be diminished by the refraction they would
                    then experience; but the surface being concave, the refraction contributes still
                    farther to increase the convergence of the rays, which now traverse the aqueous
                    humor, and are collected accurately into their respective foci on the retina
                    itself.</p>
                <p>(667.) Rays proceeding from objects at different distances from the eye, will
                    arrive at the cornea with different degrees of divergence, and the same
                    refractive powers of the humors would cause them to converge at different
                    distances; in order, therefore, to obtain distinct images of these objects on
                    the retina, either the distance of that membrane from the cornea must be
                    altered, or the refractive power of the humors must be changed. Thus, if the
                    power of the eye at any one time be suited to distinct vision of distant
                    objects, near objects will appear confused, from the indistinctness of their
                    images on the retina; because the focus of convergence of the rays proceeding
                    from those objects is farther back than the situation of the retina. If, either
                    by elongating the axis of the eye, the retina could be removed to this new focal
                    distance, or else by increasing the refractive power of the humors, the rays
                    could be made more convergent than before, we should again obtain distinct
                    images of those near objects on the retina; but then the images of distant
                    objects would, at the same time, and from the contrary cause, be indistinct; and
                    in order to give distinctness to these, the contrary changes are required to be
                    made in the eye to those already mentioned. Now, it is found that the eye really
                    possesses the power of accommodation here described, adapting itself, by some
                    internal changes, to the vision of both near and remote objects, according as
                    the attention is directed respectively either to the one or to the other.</p>
                <p>(668.) The effort by which the eye changes its internal state, so as to
                    accommodate its powers to the vision of near objects, after having viewed those
                    more distant, is always attended with a contraction of the pupil; and the
                    exclusion of the remoter rays, consequent upon this diminution of aperture, must
                    partly contribute to the greater distinctness of the images, by excluding the
                    rays near the circumference of each pencil. But it is certain that the
                    refractive powers of the eye are also increased; and it is a question of
                    considerable difficulty to determine the manner in which this increase is
                    effected. Sir Everard Home<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Philosophical Transactions for 1794, p. 21; 1795, p. 1; 1796, p. 1;
                    1797, p. 1.</p></note> supposed that it was accomplished by the joint actions of
                    the straight muscles which surround the ball of the eye, and which, by
                    compressing it all round its sides, might elongate its axis and increase the
                    distance of the retina from the cornea, while they at the same time would make
                    the cornea more convex, by drawing back its circumference, and thus rendering
                    its central part more protuberant. This plausible theory is overturned by the
                    fact discovered by Dr. Young,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ibid, for 1793, p. 169; and for 1801, p. 53.</p></note> that
                    when the effect of any change in the curvature of the cornea is removed by
                    placing the eye under water, the eye still retains its power of accommodation to
                    the vision of objects at different distances, by changes which take place in its
                    refractive powers.</p>
                <p>(669∙) The* most probable supposition relative to this operation is, that the
                    ciliary ligament has the power of contracting at the same time with the
                    sphincter of the iris; a change which will be attended with the effect of
                    bringing the lens somewhat forwards, and of increasing the convexity of its
                    surfaces, while the convexity of the cornea will also be increased. Any cause
                    which produces the contraction of the pupil, such as a bright light, enables the
                    eye to adjust itself more rapidly to vision at a shorter distance; and on the
                    contrary, the suspension of this power of contraction of the circular fibres of
                    the iris, occasioned by belladonna, is accompanied by the total but temporary
                    loss of this power of adjustment. Those who, by frequent practice in
                    experimenting on their own eyes, have acquired a considerable voluntary power of
                    changing the refracting condition of the eye, even although there be no object
                    before the field of vision requiring such change, when they exert this power,
                    also contract the pupil, which by this means indirectly acquires the character
                    of a voluntary muscle; although in other respects, and with other persons, it is
                    strictly to be ranked in the class of the involuntary muscles. The writer of
                    this treatise possesses this power, and has given an account of the
                    circumstances attending its exertion in a letter to Mr. Travers.<note

                    the Physiology of the Eye, prefixed to Mr. Travers’ Synopsis of the Diseases of

                <p>(670.) The same gradation of density in the successive laminae of the crystalline
                    lens, and the consequent successive refractions of the rays effected by the
                    several humors of the eye, have also the effect of correcting the dispersion of
                    light, arising from the difference in refrangibility of the differently coloured
                    rays. The eye, in addition to its other perfections, has the properties of an
                    achromatic optical instrument, correcting the confusion of colour in the images
                    it forms on the retina.</p>
                <p>(671.) All extraneous light, which might be reflected from one part of the eye to
                    another, and might be mixed with the rays which should exclusively form the
                    image on the retina, is absorbed by means of <hi rend="italic">∖fe pigmentum
                    nigrum,</hi> which is placed immediately behind the retina, which lines every
                    part of the interior of the eye, and which extends over the ciliary circle, and
                    over the posterior surface of the iris.</p>
                <p>(672.) Different parts of the retina possess different degrees of sensibility;
                    the centre, or that situated in the axis of the eye as it is called, immediately
                    opposite to the pupil, being by far the most sensible part. We accordingly see
                    most distinctly those objects, the images of which are formed on that spot.
                    Hence, whenever we pay attention to an object, we immediately direct both eyes
                    towards it in such a manner as that the centre of both retinae may receive its
                    image. It is very remarkable that there is a minute circular space situated
                    exactly in the axis of the eye, where the retina seems to be deficient, so as to
                    produce the appearance of a perforation at the very point where vision is most
                    distinct. No satisfactory explanation of this curious circumstance has yet been
                    given.</p>
                <p>(673.) When the eye is at rest, the field of distinct vision is very limited; it
                    extends, however, according to Dr. Young, to a space formed by a radius of about
                    60 or 70 degrees; it extends to a greater distance outwards than inwards, being
                    90 degrees in the former direction, and only 60 degrees in the latter. It
                    extends downwards 70 degrees, and only 50 degrees upwards.</p>

                    discovery that there is a part of the retina situated at the termination of the
                    optic nerve which is insensible to light; so that when the image of any object
                    falls upon that precise spot, it is no longer seen. The conclusion which he drew
                    from this fact was, that the scat of vision is not the retina, but the choroid
                    coat; for at this spot the choroid coat is wanting, being perforated to admit of
                    the passage of the optic nerve. But the phenomena is better <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499810" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9810-0671"/>accounted for by the
                    consideration that there is present at that spot the central artery of the
                    retina, which here divides itself into a number of radiating branches, and
                    excludes the presence of nervous matter, in which, judging from the analogy of
                    all the other senses, the power of communicating sensation exclusively resides.
                    This defect in vision, if we may so term it, is seldom perceived when both eyes
                    are used, because the optic nerve enters each eye obliquely, and on different
                    sides of the centre of the retina; so that they can never both receive the image
                    of the same object at the same time.</p>
                <p>(675.) The defects of the eyes of some persons with respect to their refractive
                    powers produce what is called <hi rend="italic">longsightedness,</hi> when these
                    powers are deficient; and <hi rend="italic">shortsightedness,</hi> when too
                    great. The source of former imperfection, which constitutes the <hi
                    rend="italic">presbyopic eye,</hi> may often be traced to the effects of age,
                    which produces a flattening of the cornea; and probably also impairs that
                    voluntary power by which the refractions may be increased when near objects are
                    viewed. The short-sighted, or <hi rend="italic">myopic</hi> eye, has generally
                    an excessive convexity of the cornea, which may be diminished, but is very
                    seldom materially so, by the progress of age. The remedies for these defects are
                    obvious; namely, the use of convex spectacles for the presbyopic, and of concave
                    spectacles for the myopic eye; the former supplying the deficiency in the power
                    of refraction; the latter correcting its excess.</p>
                <p>(676.) Such then arc the means employed for producing certain impressions on each
                    retina, which it is the office of the optic nerves to transmit to the sensorium,
                    where these give rise to corresponding sensations. The inquiry into the
                    perceptions arising in the mind in consequence of these sensations belongs to
                    another branch of the subject hereafter to be considered. It will be sufficient
                    in this place to point out the general fact relating to the physiology of the
                    eye, that the impression made upon each point of the retina, produces in the
                    sensorium a distinct impression, suggesting to the mind a distinct
                    sensation.</p>

                <p>(677.) Having examined the different modes in which impressions are made upon the
                    extremities of the nerves situated in the respective organs of sense, we have
                    next to direct our attention to the physiological phenomena which ensue on those
                    impressions being received.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Specific Endowments of the Nerves of Sensation.</hi></p>
                <p>(678.) The extremities of the nerves intended to receive these impressions appear
                    in general to be expanded over a certain extent of surface, and to be of a
                    softer texture than the nerves themselves. This difference appears to arise from
                    their being divested of the membranous covering which closely binds together the
                    filaments composing the nerves, while they are pursuing their course from one
                    part to another. Such expansions are noticed in the optic, auditory, and
                    olfactory nerves, and probably also in those distributed to the papillae of the
                    tongue, and the cutis. The nerve of each particular sense appears to have
                    different specific endowments. Thus the optic nerve and retina are peculiarly
                    adapted to be affected by the impressions of light; and are not fitted to convey
                    any other impressions. There are experiments recorded which tend to shew that
                    irritation of these nerves do not communicate pain, as is the case with that of
                    nerves sent to other parts of the body. On the other hand no other nerve in the
                    body is capable of exciting,, by any change that can be induced upon it, the
                    sensation of light, as was pretended in the case in the celebrated imposture of
                    Miss M‘Avoy of Liverpool, who endeavoured to persuade people that she could see
                    with the tips of her fingers: or in the more elaborate delusions of animal
                    magnetism, in which persons are stated to be able to read a piece of writing
                    applied to the pit of the stomach, or nape of the neck, by optical impressions
                    made on different parts of the skin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="smallcaps">Magnetism,
                    Animal.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>(679∙) That the optic nerves are incapable of exciting by their action any other
                    sensations than those of light, is farther rendered probable by the circumstance
                    that these sensations may be produced by other causes than those which usually
                    give rise to them; such as impressions of a mechanical nature. A blow in the
                    eye, producing sudden pressure on the retina, excites the sensation of a flash
                    of light. The appearance of brilliant spangles in the field of vision is often
                    the result of too active a state of circulation in the vessels of the retina,
                    which excites in the fibres of the nerves actions similar to those produced by
                    the presence of light. 1he galvanic influence affecting the same, or even
                    neighbouring nerves, produces, in like manner, the sensation of a flash of
                    light. Analogous facts have been noticed with regard to other senses. The
                    well-known sensations of singing in the ears is the consequence of an action of
                    the auditory nerves, excited by the state of the circulation in the organ of
                    hearing, and is probably totally unconnected with any real sonorous vibrations
                    communicated to that organ.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Modifications of Impressions.</hi></p>
                <p>(680.) In order that an impression made upon the sentient extremity of a nerve
                    may excite sensation, it must be applied for a certain time; for if it be of too
                    transient a duration, no effect, as far as regards sensation, is produced. This
                    is well exemplified in the case of vision; we lose sight of an object in very
                    rapid motion, because the impression made by its image on the different points
                    of the retina on which it is successively formed, is of too transient a nature
                    to excite those actions which produce sensation.</p>
                <p>(681.) On the other hand, when a distinct impression has been made on the nerve,
                    that impression has a certain duration, independently of the continuance of the
                    cause which excited it; for the sensation produced is, to a certain extent,
                    permanent. This is also shewn, in the case of vision, by several experiments
                    familiar to all, such as whirling rapidly with a circular motion, an object
                    brightly illuminated, which gives rise, as is well known, to the appearance of a
                    continuous circle of light. Many optical deceptions are founded on the same
                    principle, such as that of the <hi rend="italic">Thawmatrope,</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phantascope,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Phenikisticoe,</hi> and the
                    curved appearance of the spokes of a revolving wheel when viewed through
                    parallel bars, of which last phenomena the theory has been elsewhere given by
                    the writer of this treatise;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ρhilosορliic.αl Transactions for 1815.</p></note> and also
                    the appearance of a similar kind noticed by Mr. Faraday.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Journal of the Royal Institution, vol. i. p.
                    205. See also Dr. Roget’s Bridyewater Treatise, vol. ii∙ p. 524∙</p></note></p>
                <p>(682.) One of the consequences of the law of the permanence of sensations is,
                    that impressions which rapidly succeed one another in the same nerve, arc not
                    distinguishable as separate impressions, but produce a blending together, or
                    coalescence into one sensation. Thus if a circle painted in different parts of
                    the circumference with different colours, be rapidly whirled round its centre,
                    the colours are blended together into one tint; and if the different prismatic
                    colours of the spectrum be properly adjusted as to their relative proportions,
                    the effect of this coalescence of the sensations excited by the whole is that of
                    a white colour. The thaumatrope may also be made to illustrate this principle;
                    for the pictures on the two sides of the card appear, by the rapid revolution of
                    the card, to coalesce into one.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499823" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9823-0672"/>
                <p>(683.) The most remarkable and complete illustration of the same principle is
                    afforded by musical sounds, which, though they appear continuous, are, in fact,
                    composed of separate impulses, repeated at very short, but regular intervals of
                    time.</p>
                <p>(684.) Another law of sensation, is that when a nerve has received a strong
                    impression, that nerve is proportionally weakened for a certain time after, and
                    is less susceptible of a similar impression from the application of the same
                    cause. The eye, after being dazzled by a strong light, has its sensibility
                    diminished to the impressions of a weaker light. Different parts of the retina
                    thus acquire different degrees of susceptibility of being affected by the same
                    quantities of light. Thus, if the eyes be directed steadily to a bright object
                    for a certain length of time, and be then transferred to a white sheet of paper,
                    a dark spot, having the figure of that object will be seen on the paper, in
                    consequence of that portion of the retina, on which the luminous image had been
                    impressed, being fatigued, and rendered less excitable than those parts of the
                    retina which did not receive that image. The light from the paper which arrives
                    at that part of the retina which had received the impressions of the bright
                    object, will produce less effect on that part, than the light of equal intensity
                    from other parts of the paper does on the other parts of the retina. Those parts
                    of the paper which are situated so as to have their image on the exhausted part
                    of the retina appear darker, therefore, than the rest; and hence arises the
                    appearance of a dark image. The experiment may be reversed by fixing the eyes
                    attentively for some time on a dark object on a white ground, and then
                    transferring it to some other part of the white ground; when immediately a
                    brighter spot, corresponding in size and figure to the dark object, will be
                    seen.</p>
                <p>(685.) These appearances, which imitate those of real objects, have been called
                    <hi rend="italic">ocular spectra.</hi> The susceptibility of the retina to
                    receive impressions of particular colours is also found to be affected in the
                    same manner, when any one of them has been strongly impressed. Thus the spectrum
                    of a coloured object, while it has the same dimensions and figures as the
                    object, will at the same time have an opposite colour, when the eye is
                    transferred to a white ground. It will have what is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >complementary colour</hi> to that of the object itself; that is, it will have
                    that tint which results from the admixture of all the colours composing white
                    light, when the latter colour is left out. Thus red and green, yellow and
                    purple, blue and orange, being complementary colours respectively to each other,
                    the ocular spectrum of a red object will be green, that of a green object red,
                    and so with all the others.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>For more ample details on this subject, the reader maybe referred to an
                    Essay on Ocular Spectra, by Dr. Charles Darwin, published in the 76th volume of
                    the Pidlosοnhical Transactions, and reprinted in Dr. Darwin’s
                    Zoonomia.</p></note></p>
                <p>(686.) We may here observe, that the appearances of spectra above described, are
                    merely temporary; for the several parts of the retina soon regain their natural
                    state of equable sensibility.</p>
                <p>(687.) Illustrations of this law readily present themselves when we search for
                    its application with regard to all the other senses. Sounds which are too loud
                    produce temporary deafness, or at least impair for a time the sensibility of the
                    ear to weaker sounds. Similar phenomena are observed as to odours and tastes,
                    with reference to their appropriate senses. The sensibility of the skin to
                    different temperatures varies considerably according to the previous impressions
                    which have been made upon it. Thus the same body may appear either hot or cold,
                    according to the previous temperature of the hand which is applied to it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II— <hi rend="italic">Conditions necessary for
                    Sensation.</hi></p>
                <p>(688.) The sensibility of the sentient extremities of nerves, or their capability
                    of receiving such impressions as lead to their appropriate sensations, is
                    dependent on certain conditions of the organ. These conditions arc principally
                    the following. First, it is necessary that the organ receive a proper supply of
                    arterial blood by the vessels circulating through it, and particularly through
                    that part on which the nerves are distributed. Secondly, it is required that the
                    expansion of the nerve belonging to the organ should be exempt from excessive
                    pressure. Compression of a nerve in any part of its course immediately puts a
                    stop to all its functions; and consequently its power of receiving and conveying
                    impressions is suspended as long as the pressure is continued. On the removal of
                    the pressure, provided it has not been too violent, or too long continued, the
                    nerve after a certain time, generally recovers its powers. Thirdly, a certain
                    temperature is requisite for the maintenance of sensibility in the nerves. The
                    benumbing effect of cold is well known, and extends generally to all the
                    functions of the nervous system. It is very probable that this operation of cold
                    is referable to its retarding or arresting the circulation in the capillary
                    vessels; and it might, therefore, perhaps, be included in the causes which
                    influence the first of the conditions here enumerated. Lastly, the office of
                    every nerve being to transmit impressions from one of their extremities to the
                    other, it is necessary for the due performance of this function, that an
                    uninterrupted continuity of their filaments should be preserved throughout their
                    whole course. The complete division of a nerve in any part, necessarily prevents
                    this transmission, and destroys the function of the nerve.</p>
                <p>(68θ.) Irritations applied to the nerve in any part of its course, produce
                    sensation, provided the communication of that part with the brain be
                    uninterrupted by any of the causes above specified. Thus, if a nerve be tied or
                    divided at any point, irritations applied below the ligature or division will
                    produce no effect as to sensation; but when applied above that point, sensation
                    immediatelyfollows. What is here said applies more particularly to the nerves
                    distributed to various parts of the body, and especially to the integuments; the
                    irritation of which nerves gives rise to a sense of pain. The nerves of the
                    senses of sight, of hearing, of smell, and of taste, are so situated as hardly
                    to admit of being the subjects of experiments which might decide the question as
                    to what kinds of sensation would be excited by irritations directly applied to
                    them; and whether these sensations would be similar to those they usually convey
                    from impressions made upon their extremities. Analogy would undoubtedly be in
                    favour of such similarity. Persons who have lost a limb by amputation,
                    experience sensations not only of pain, but also of touch, and of muscular
                    motion, exactly similar to those which they formerly derived from the parts of
                    the limb which they have lost. These sensations arise from imitations taking
                    place, either in the lower extremities of the nerves which have been divided,
                    and which remain in the stump, or in the brain itself.</p>
                <p>(690.) The most remarkable circumstance attending the communication of
                    irritations along the nerves of sensation, is the celerity of the transmission.
                    It appears, indeed, to be instantaneous, and can be compared only to the
                    rapidity of the electric fluid passing along a conducting body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Theories of
                    Sensation.</hi></p>
                <p>(69L) We are completely ignorant of the nature of that power by which the nerves
                    effect this rapid communication along the lines of their fibres, and even of the
                    changes which take place in the nerve while it is performing this function.
                    Several hypotheses have been proposed with a view to supply this chasm in our
                    knowledge. The oldest of these, and that which maintained its ground for many
                    centuries, is, that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499836"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9836-0673"/>the brain and nerves are furnished with a certain
                    fluid, which was called the <hi rend="italic">animal spirits,</hi> and was the
                    medium of communication between the different parts of the nervous system.
                    Traces of this theory may be found in the writings of Hippocrates; but it
                    derived its principal support from Descartes, who reduced it to a regular form,
                    and powerfully recommended it by the force of his authority. According to the
                    views of those who espouse this theory, the brain is considered as an organ
                    whose principal office it is to secrete the animal spirits, which are of a very
                    subtile and ethereal nature, and to supply them to the nerves, which were
                    considered to be the natural excretory ducts of the brain. The existence of this
                    fluid was, for a very long period, universally admitted by physiologists, and
                    the doctrines founded upon it were more or less mixed up with all the reasonings
                    of physicians respecting the causes and phenomena of diseases, and the effects
                    of remedies. Traces of the influence of this doctrine may be found in the
                    popular language of medicine even in the present day, when the hypothesis from
                    which it is derived is deservedly exploded as perfectly gratuitous, and devoid
                    of any just foundation.</p>
                <p>(692.) Another hypothesis invented to account for the propagation of impressions
                    along the fibres of nerves, was that of their depending on vibrations or
                    periodical oscillations of their particles, analogous to those of the strings of
                    a harpsichord when producing musical notes. The great champion of this doctrine
                    was Hartley,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On Man. A
                    full account of Hartley’s theory is given by Dr. Priestley in a separate work
                    bearing that title·</p></note> who embellished it by his beautiful applications
                    to a great variety of phenomena relating to sensations, and even to the
                    intellectual operations. It afforded a happy explanation of many of the
                    phenomena of ocular spectra, and of those depending on the permanence of
                    sensations. It is needless to remark, that this hypothesis is equally visionary
                    and destitute of any solid basis as the former.</p>
                <p>(693∙) All these mechanical theories are overturned by the fact that no tabular
                    structure can be discovered, on the minutest anatomical scrutiny, to exist in
                    the filaments which compose the nerves; nor can the slightest motion be detected
                    in any of their parts, while they are actively transmitting the impressions of
                    sensation.</p>
                <p>(694.) The latest hypothesis as to the nature of nervous power is, that it is
                    identical with electricity. It is supported principally by the experiments we
                    have already mentioned, in which, after the par vagum was divided, so as
                    entirely to intercept its action in promoting the secretion of the gastric
                    fluid, secretion was restored by transmitting the galvanic fluid along the lower
                    portion of the nerve. The experiment, indeed, applies only to a particular
                    office of the nervous power, namely, that of promoting secretion; but the
                    hypothesis it suggested has been extended to all the ether functions of the
                    nerves, and of course to their power of transmitting those impressions which
                    give rise to sensation.</p>

                <p>(695.) If we except the nerves appropriated to the organs of the special senses
                    of sight, hearing, smell, and taste, and those distributed on the face, and
                    other neighbouring parts, all the nerves subservient to sensation appear to
                    terminate in the spinal cord. We are then, in the first place, to determine
                    whether the impressions which these nerves convey to that organ, are transmitted
                    to any other part of the nervous system, previously to sensation being
                    produced.</p>
                <p>(696·) Experiments in all the animals whose structure, as far as regards this
                    part of the nervous system, is analogous to the human, have established the
                    general fact, that sensation does not take place, unless the part of the spinal
                    cord to which the nerve is connected, communicates by an uninterrupted
                    continuity of substance with the brain. The division of the spinal cord near the
                    foramen magnum, instantly renders the whole body insensible; but it does not
                    appear so immediately to deprive the parts about the face of sensibility, for
                    some degree of it appears to be retained as long as the circulation continues.
                    The injury, indeed, soon becomes fatal, by the circulation ceasing inconsequence
                    of the interruption to the function of respiration. The effects of injuries to
                    the spinal cord occurring to men from accidents of various kinds, afford ample
                    confirmation of the fact that the brain is the general centre to which all
                    impressions made upon the nerves must ultimately be brought before they can
                    excite sensation.</p>
                <p>(697.) Admitting the brain to be the immediate organ of sensation, it next
                    becomes a question, whether any particular part of the brain is more especially
                    appropriated to the exercise of this function. It is to such a part, supposing
                    it to exist, that the name of <hi rend="italic">sensorium</hi> has been applied.
                    There are two modes of conducting this inquiry; the first is by tracing very
                    carefully, the filaments of all the nerves which are immediately connected with
                    the brain, and endeavouring to discover if they unite in any central part of
                    that organ, which may accordingly be supposed to be the seat of sensation; or,
                    in other words, the sensorium. The second mode of investigating the subject, is
                    to ascertain if any one part of the brain can be discovered, on which
                    impressions directly made, are invariably productive of sensation.</p>
                <p>(698.) The fibrous substance of the spinal cord, being directly continuous with
                    the medulla oblongata, may be supposed to terminate in that part of the brain;
                    so that, viewing the spinal cord as a collection of all the fibres of the nerves
                    of sensation continued along its whole length, these nerves themselves may be
                    considered as following this course, and having this termination. These fibres
                    are found more particularly to converge towards the corpora quadrigemina, and
                    crura cerebri. Now, it happens that this is also the very spot with which the
                    nerves of the senses, whose organs are in the head, namely, the fifth, seventh,
                    and eighth pairs, are more particularly connected. It appears also, from the
                    late investigations of the French physiologists, that no part of the brain
                    higher than the corpora quadrigemina, and no part whatever of the cerebellum, is
                    essentially concerned in sensation; for it is found that in animals the power of
                    sensation remains, even after the removal of all the parts of the brain, or of
                    the cerebellum, higher than this spot. The conclusion which has been deduced
                    from these experiments is, that the medulla oblongata, and more particularly
                    that segment of it to which the nerves of the head are united, is the organ most
                    essentially connected with the mental change constituting sensation. But it is
                    not probable that these corporeal changes immediately connected with sensation,
                    are confined to a <hi rend="italic">single point</hi> in the brain, which might
                    emphatically be termed <hi rend="italic">the seat of the soul,</hi> as Descartes
                    expressed it, when he boldly pronounced the pineal gland to be that spot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II— <hi rend="italic">Requisite conditions of
                    the</hi><hi rend="italic">Sensorium.</hi></p>
                <p>(699∙) A multitude of facts tend to confirm the view of the subject which has
                    here been taken. The same conditions as those which are required for the
                    exercise of the functions of the nerves in every part of their course, are
                    equally necessary for the performance of those of the brain. It is indispensable
                    that the circulation in the brain should be in a healthy state, and that
                    arterial blood be supplied by its vessels. It is indispensable that a proper
                    temperature be preserved; and it is likewise indispensable that the brain be not
                    compressed by any considerable force. A failure in any <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499849" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9849-0674"/>one of these conditions,
                    produces total deprivation of the power of sensation, as well as of all the
                    other functions of the brain. Ibis effect is found to result more particularly
                    when pressure is made in the direction of the medulla oblongata; for in that
                    case complete insensibility takes place; and on the removal of the pressure, the
                    faculty of sensation slowly returns; but if any considerable injury has been
                    inflicted on that part, the power of sensation is irrecoverably</p>
                <p>(700.) It is probable that most of the laws which regulate the functions of the
                    nerves with respect to sensation, apply with equal truth to the sensorium
                    itself; but with regard to several of the phenomena, it is difficult to
                    determine whether they depend on affections of the sensorium, or of the
                    extremities of the nerves, situated in the organ of sense. Me must despair of
                    being able to resolve this question, because the changes which take place in
                    both these parts, appear to be simultaneous. The impaired power, for example,
                    which is the result of a strong impression from an object of sense, may arise
                    equally, from the exhaustion of that part of the sensorium to which the
                    impression is communicated, as of that of the sentient extremity of the nerve;
                    and we have no means of discriminating between them.</p>
                <p>(701.) Another point of resemblance is, that irritations applied to the
                    sensorium, from other sources than the nerves themselves, give rise to the same
                    train of sensations as impressions communicated through the nerves. These
                    irritations may be given by the pressure of blood circulating in the arteries of
                    the sensorium; and this is probably the source of many of those sensations
                    generally ascribed to affections of the nerves, or of the organs of sense.
                    Pains, and other sensations in various parts of the body, arise from affections
                    of the brain. The same origin may often be assigned to sensations which arise in
                    dreams, and likewise to various spectral illusions which affect persons who are
                    awake, and aware of their being deceptions of the sense. In delirium and
                    insanity, the sensations from this cause assume a fearful degree of intensity,
                    and are accompanied by a fixed belief in their reality.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III— <hi rend="italic">Laws of Recurrence, and of
                    the Association of Impressions.</hi></p>
                <p>(702.) With regard to all the subsequent changes and operations which take place
                    when sensation has been excited, it is extremely difficult to pronounce how much
                    of the phenomena are purely mental, and how much are strictly the result of
                    corporeal changes connected and associated together by physical laws. In other
                    words, it is difficult to determine what are the operations in which the mind is
                    purely passive, and dependent on the actions of its bodily organs, and what are
                    those in which it exerts a spontaneous power of action, and thereby reacts upon
                    those organs, and produces in them a series of changes which lead to the most
                    important results. The distinction we are attempting to draw, is founded upon
                    this essential difference in the order of sequence of the phenomena, that in the
                    one the organic change precedes the mental change, and in the other succeeds to
                    it.</p>
                <p>(703.) The two principal physiological laws relating to the former of these
                    physical changes, namely, those which precede the mental affections, are, first,
                    the <hi rend="italic">law of spontaneous recurrence.</hi> Whenever an impression
                    of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> certain intensity has been made upon the organs of
                    sense, the sensation which is produced by it, after disappearing for a certain
                    time, recurs without the presence of the cause which originally excited it; and
                    this happens repeatedly, and without any corresponding effort of the mind, and
                    often in opposition to any effort which can be made to counteract the tendency.
                    This spontaneous recurrence of sensations is probably the result of the
                    repetition of those changes in the sensorium which originally gave rise to them.
                    In the language of metaphysics, the corresponding mental affections are termed
                    <hi rend="italic">ideas,</hi> in order to distinguish them from the similar and
                    more vivid affection excited by the primitive impression, and to which the term
                    <hi rend="italic">sensation</hi> is more particularly appropriated.</p>
                <p>(704.) The second law which regulates the unknown affections of the brain
                    connected with the passive phenomena of mind, is that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >association,</hi> or the law by which impressions, and consequently the
                    corresponding ideas, recur in the same order of sequence as that in which they
                    were originally excited. The phenomena of disease, and the operation of
                    different agents which modify the state of circulation in the brain, and the
                    conditions of the nervous powers, afford ample evidence that the modes of
                    association, and of the sequence of impressions and ideas, are dependent on the
                    physical condition of the brain, and result from certain changes taking place in
                    that organ.</p>
                <p>(705.) The views here presented, far from being favourable to the doctrine of
                    materialism, are directly opposed to it; since they necessarily imply the
                    existence of an essential distinction between mind and matter, and aim only at
                    tracing the connexions which have been established between them by the divine
                    Author of our existence.</p>
                <p>(706.) Such, then, being the physiological connexions which exist between the
                    physical changes taking place in the brain, and the passive phenomena of the
                    mind, it is not an unreasonable supposition, that the voluminous mass of
                    cerebral substance which, in the human brain especially, has been superadded to
                    the medulla oblongata, or to the immediate physical seat of sensation, is in
                    some way subservient to that astonishing range of intellect and combination of
                    mental faculties which are found in man. We may conjecture also, with much
                    appearance of probability, that in the lower animals, the intellectual
                    endowments which mark several of the more intelligent races are connected with
                    similar, though inferior, expansions of cerebral substance.</p>
                <p>(707∙) All the mental phenomena in which the mind is passive have been referred
                    by metaphysicians to the principle of association, and consequently may, in as
                    far as this principle is concerned, be connected with the physical changes above
                    noticed. Hence we find the memory, which is the direct result of that law, is
                    more especially liable to be impaired by certain physical states of the brain,
                    such as those induced by severe concussion, by fevers, and by the progress of
                    age.</p>
                <p>(708.) As scarcely any thing is known with regard to the physical changes which
                    take place in the brain in the relations which they bear to mental phenomena,
                    the further consideration of these phenomena belongs properly to psychology
                    rather than to the subject of this treatise. The inquiry must here be taken up
                    by the metaphysician, whose province it becomes not the physiologist to
                    invade.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">Volition and Voluntary
                    Motion.</hi></p>
                <p>(709∙) Leaving, therefore, to the metaphysician the analysis of those mental
                    phenomena, which, however dependent they may be for their existence on the
                    healthy actions of the brain, require modes of investigation different from
                    those of physiology, and lead to results very remote from any conceivable laws
                    of material agency; we may resume the subject at the point when, in consequence
                    of the mental acts of <hi rend="italic">volition,</hi> by which term we here
                    mean to express the endeavour to produce certain specific movements of the body,
                    new changes are again produced in the cerebral organs, and new trains of
                    physical phenomena succeed. That this mental effort of volition constitutes a
                    distinct step in the series of phenomena, is proved by the instances of
                    paralysis, in which the patient is conscious of making the effort to move the
                    palsied limb, yet no motion, or even sensation of motion, ensues. Another
                    illustration of the same distinction is derivable from a different disease
                    affecting the limbs, namely, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499862"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9862-0675"/><hi rend="italic">anaesthesia,</hi> which consists
                    of the loss of sensation only, while the power of voluntary motion remains; and
                    in which the voluntary act so exerted produces the intended muscular
                    contractions, unattended, however, with the feelings which usually accompany
                    them. The same complete ignorance in which we are with regard to the changes
                    which take place in sensation, pervades our notions of those which attend
                    volition, in as far as they occur in the brain. A few facts, indeed, have been
                    collected with regard to those parts of the brain which are impressed, if such a
                    term may be used, antecedently to the voluntary motions of the limbs. They
                    appear to be chiefly the crura of the cerebellum, and the adjacent parts of the
                    medulla oblongata.</p>
                <p>(710.) All the physical conditions which are necessary in order <hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi> that sensations may be felt, are equally necessary for
                    rendering the cerebral organs capable of receiving from the mind those
                    impressions which lead to voluntary motion. The mental stimulus of volition
                    produces a certain effect on the origin of the nerves, leading to the muscles
                    employed in these motions, which impression, being propagated along the course
                    of those nerves, excites these muscles to contraction. The transmission of those
                    impressions is made with the same celerity, and probably by the same agency, as
                    those which produce sensation; but they are made in the contrary direction,
                    namely, <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the brain, instead of <hi rend="italic"
                    >towards</hi> it. The same conditions of perfect continuity of fibres, of
                    freedom from pressure, and of healthy circulation, are essential requisites in
                    both cases; and every thing that has been said with regard to the former, is
                    also applicable to the latter. Mechanical irritations, applied either at those
                    parts of the brain which adjoin the origin of the nerves, or to the nerves
                    themselves, either at their origin, or in any part of their course, whether that
                    portion of the nerve situated between the point to which the irritation is
                    applied be entire or divided, or compressed by a ligature, are found to produce
                    the same muscular contractions as those which are the result of volition.</p>
                <p>(711.) Mr. Mayo<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Outlines
                    of Human Physiology, third edition, p. 39 to 42.</p></note> ascertained, that
                    after any nerve which supplies a voluntary muscle is cut through, either in a
                    living animal, or immediately after death, mechanical irritation of the part of
                    the nerve disconnected with the brain, as for instance the pinching it with a
                    forceps, causes a single sudden action of the muscle or muscles it supplies. On
                    the other hand, a like effect cannot be produced by irritating mechanically the
                    nerves distributed to those muscles over which the will has indisputably no
                    influence. “It must be admitted, however,” he remarks, “that this phenomenon is
                    not exclusively confined to those muscles which are allowed on all hands to be
                    voluntary; nor, indeed, is it shewn in all the muscles which seem at first sight
                    to be directly under the controul of the will.” But it is not easy, in various
                    instances, to determine whether muscular actions are voluntary or not; while the
                    point of distinction proposed by Mr. Mayo has the recommendation of being easily
                    verifiable. Setting aside, therefore, in the first instance, the question of the
                    influence of the will, let us be satisfied with observing what muscles act when
                    a divided nerve that enters their substance is mechanically irritated, and what
                    do not. We may afterwards trace the collateral differences of the two classes of
                    muscles which are thus distinguished.</p>
                <p>(712.) The parts which are susceptible of this mode of excitement, are the
                    muscles of the trunk, head, and limbs, of the tongue, of the soft palate, of the
                    larynx, of the pharynx, and oesophagus, and of the lower outlet of the pelvis.
                    The opposite class comprehends the heart, the stomach, the small and great
                    intestines, and the bladder.</p>
                <p>(713.) The collateral differences which characterize either class are, with
                    exceptions afterwards to be adverted to, the following :—</p>
                <p>Of the muscles which act when anerve distributed through them is mechanically
                    irritated, it may be remarked:</p>
                <p>1. That they admit of being thrown into action by an effort of the will.</p>
                <p>2. That with sufficient attention and resolution, their action may be refrained
                    from.</p>
                <p>3. That their action is attended with a conscious effort, and is guided by
                    sensation.</p>
                <p>4. That if divided, the separate parts retract instantaneously to a certain
                    distance, and subsequently undergo no farther permanent shortening.</p>
                <p>5. That when mechanically irritated, a single and momentary action of their
                    fibres alone ensues.</p>
                <p>6. That they remain relaxed, unless excited by special impressions, both in the
                    living body, and before the loss of irritability after death.</p>
                <p>7. That their action in the living body habitually results from an influence
                    transmitted from the brain or spinal cord through the nerves.</p>
                <p>(714.) The exceptions to be made against this statement, if applied generally,
                    are, that the three first affections arc not easily brought home to the muscular
                    fibres of the oesophagus, or of the lower part of the pharynx; but it deserves
                    at the same time to be considered, that the lower part of the pharynx and the
                    oesophagus are in the peculiar situation of parts employed on one object alone,
                    instinctively and habitually, on the recurrence of one impression; a condition
                    which would soon reduce a strictly voluntary muscle to a state apparently
                    removed from the control of the will.</p>
                <p>(715.) Muscles of the preceding class, if we except the fasciculi belonging to
                    the pharynx, and oesophagus, and urethra, are so disposed as to extend from one
                    piece to another of the solid frame-work of the body; they enlarge or straighten
                    the cavities of the trunk; they produce the phenomena of the voice; they close
                    the excretory passages; the greater number are employed to move the limbs on the
                    trunk and the frame on the ground. Muscles of the second class are used, like
                    the exceptions in the preceding, as tunics to the hollow viscera, the cavities
                    of which they diminish in their action, and thus serve to give motion to their
                    contents. The oesophagus, indeed, appears to partake of the nature of both
                    classes of muscles; when the nervi vagi are pinched, one sudden action ensues in
                    its fibres, and presently after a second of a slower character may be observed
                    to take place.</p>
                <p>(716.) Of the muscles which do not act on the mechanical irritation of any nerve
                    distributed through them, it may be remarked,</p>
                <p>1. That the will cannot instantaneously or directly produce action in them.</p>
                <p>2. That the resolution to abstain from their action is insufficient to repress
                    it.</p>
                <p>3. That their action is not attended with a conscious effort, and seldom has
                    reference to sensation.</p>
                <p>4. That if divided, the retraction which follows is in most instances slow and
                    gradual.</p>
                <p>5. That if they are mechanically irritated, not one, but a series of actions
                    ensues.</p>
                <p>6. That their natural state, in the absence of external impressions, is not
                    continued relaxation. When the heart and bowels arc removed from the body of an
                    animal immediately after death, they continue for a time alternately to contract
                    and to dilate.</p>
                <p>7∙ That an impression transmitted through the nerves does not appear the usual
                    stimulus to their action.</p>
                <p>(717.) From the experiments of the French physiologists it would appear, that in
                    an animal deprived of all the upper portions of the brain, but in which the
                    medulla oblongata is preserved, all indications of the more complex operations
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499875" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9875-0676"/>thought
                    disappear, but the animal still remains capable of executing such voluntary
                    motions as are of an instinctive character, as, for example, swallowing. Animals
                    deprived of the cerebellum, provided the medulla oblongata remains, and is free
                    from compression, not only appear to be capable of sensation, but give all the
                    usual indications of intelligence, and evidently exert volitions, which occasion
                    the action of many voluntary muscles. But they have lost the power of regulating
                    the contractions of those muscles so as to execute any definite voluntary
                    action, excepting those which are instinctive. All the other voluntary movements
                    of the body and limbs are performed in so irregular a manner, that they are
                    generally ineffective for the purposes for which they are intended; and most of
                    the usual complex movements required for progressive motion cannot be performed
                    at all. This has been explained by the supposition that the animal has lost all
                    recollection or association of those trains of muscular sensations which used to
                    accompany and to guide these movements, in consequence of the loss of the
                    cerebral organs which are instrumental in furnishing those associations. One of
                    the inferences drawn from these facts (which themselves require more ample
                    confirmation before they can be regarded as established) is, that the
                    recollection of those associations connected with voluntary motion depends on
                    the cerebellum, in the same way in which the associations of sensations and
                    ideas depend on the hemispheres of the brain.</p>
                <p>(718.) It is a remarkable circumstance that injuries or diseases occurring in the
                    hemispheres either of the cerebrum or cerebellum produce paralysis, that is,
                    destroy the power of voluntary motion, <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> muscles
                    situated on the opposite side of the body. This has been endeavoured to be
                    explained by the alleged decussation or crossing of the nervous fibres of the
                    lower part of the corpora pyramidalia on each side. But in order to account for
                    all the phenomena of this kind, we must suppose the decussation to take place
                    between the fibres which compose the posterior and the anterior columns of the
                    spinal cord.</p>
                <p>(719·) Although the function of the nerves in transmitting impressions from the
                    organs of sense to the brain, which give rise to sensation, and in transmitting
                    impressions of volition from the brain to the muscles of voluntary motion, which
                    give rise to the contraction of those muscles, appear to be of the same kind,
                    and to differ only in the direction in which the impression is transmitted, the
                    question has often been asked, whether thesame nervous filamentswhich transmit
                    the one class of impressions are employed to transmit the other likewise; or
                    whether different portions of the nerve are appropriated to these different
                    offices. The truth of the last of these propositions may now be considered as
                    being firmly established.</p>
                <p>(720.) The observations which first suggested the idea of there being two sets of
                    nervous filaments, the one subservient to sensation, and the other to volition,
                    were those in which a limb was only partially paralysed, the power of motion
                    being retained, while that of feeling was lost. Experiments had also been made
                    in which nerves that had been divided, and had afterwards spontaneously united,
                    were found to have recovered the power <hi rend="italic">of</hi> placing the
                    muscles to which they were distributed under the command of the will, but yet
                    had no power of conveying sensitive impressions. Erasistratus and Herophilus had
                    long ago taught the doctrine of there beingtwo species of nerves respectively
                    appropriated to these opposite functions; and Galen was inclined to the same
                    opinion from observing that both the tongue and the eye are supplied with two
                    separate sets of nerves, the one apparently subservient to sensation, the other
                    to motion. But it is to Sir Charles Bell and to Magendie that the merit belongs
                    of bringing forward decisive proofs of the reality of this distinction between
                    nerves for sensation and nerves for motion, the idea having before been only
                    loosely thrown out by speculative physiologists as a plausible conjecture.</p>
                <p>(721.) It results from this discovery that the transmission of impressions in
                    opposite directions, that is, in the one case from the extremities to the brain,
                    and in the other from the brain to the muscles, is effected by different nerves,
                    or at least by different sets of nervous filaments, and that no filament is
                    capable of transmitting impressions both ways indiscriminately, but always in
                    one particular direction. These two kinds of filaments are, it is true,
                    conjoined together into one nerve; but the object of this union is not community
                    of function, but convenience of distribution, the two kinds of filaments still
                    remaining distinct in their functions as they are likewise distinct in their
                    origins. we know that all the nerves connected with the spinal cord have a
                    double origin; that is, are composed of two nerves, the one proceeding from the
                    anterior, and the other from the posterior columns of the spinal cord. It is
                    found that an injury done to the anterior roots of those nerves excites
                    convulsions in the muscles which they supply, but does not appear to excite any
                    sensation of pain in the animal on which the experiment is made; and the
                    division of those nerves is followed by the immediate paralysis of those
                    muscles, that is, by their incapability of being excited to contract by any
                    voluntary efforts. On the contrary, the irritation of the posterior roots of the
                    same nerve is attended with no contractions of muscles, but calls forth
                    expressions of violent pain. The section of these nerves is followed by
                    insensibility of the parts which those nerves supply, while the power of
                    voluntary muscular contraction remains.</p>
                <p>(∕22.) From the symmetrical situation of these nerves with regard to the spinal
                    cord, Sir Charles Bell has given them the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >original,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">symmetrical nerves.</hi> They comprehend,
                    of course, all the spinal nerves which arise by double roots, the posterior of
                    which has invariably a ganglion near its origin, while the anterior branch has
                    no such appendage. These spinal nerves are distributed laterally to the two
                    halves of the body; those of the one side having no connexion with those of the
                    other. Sir Charles Bell ranks the fifth pair of the cranial nerves in the same
                    class as the spinal nerves; considering its two roots as composed of filaments,
                    appropriated the one to sensation, the other to motion; the former being
                    provided with a ganglion near its origin, and the latter having no ganglion. He
                    regards the third, probably the fourth, the anterior branch of the fifth, the
                    sixth, the portio dura of the seventh, and the ninth, as being exclusively motor
                    nerves, distributed to the muscles of the eye-ball, lower jaw, face, and tongue,
                    and placing these muscles under the control of the will. The ganglionic portion
                    of the fifth pair, on the other hand, he regards as the great sentient nerve of
                    the head; which gives exclusively sensibility to the face, eye-ball, mucous
                    membrane of the nose, mouth, and tongue. This nerve is in communication with the
                    posterior column of the spinal cord; whilst the motor nerves, above enumerated,
                    appear to communicate with the anterior column. An exception to this rule,
                    however, occurs in the case of the fourth pair, which has never been proved to
                    communicate with the anterior column of the spinal cord. It would appear also
                    that the larger portions of the eighth pair, which seem to be more connected
                    with the posterior than with the anterior columns, are nerves both of sensation
                    and of motion; so that the exclusive appropriation of the nervous filaments,
                    orgi-nating from the different surfaces of the spinal cord, to motion or to
                    sensation, is perhaps not yet rigidly demonstrated.</p>
                <p>(723.) It is remarkable that the peculiar sensations conveyed by the optic, the
                    olfactory, and the auditory nerves, have been found by Magendie to be much
                    impaired, or even entirely lost, by injuring the branches of the fifth pair of
                    nerves, which also supply the respective organs to which the above nerves appear
                    to be particularly appropriated. The cause of this anomaly has not yet been
                    satisfactorily explained.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499888" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9888-0677"/>
                <p>(724.) Sir Charles Bell has distinguished another class of nerves, which he
                    conceives to be altogether subservient to the function of respiration, and to be
                    distributed to the muscles concerned in that function. These he terms the <hi
                    rend="italic">irregular,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">superadded,</hi> or the
                    <hi rend="italic">respiratory nerves.</hi> They arise by single roots; they pass
                    from one organ to another in various directions, and pursue a very irregular and
                    intricate course, passing across the nerves belonging to the symmetric system,
                    occasionally uniting with them, and connecting together the two halves of the
                    body. These nerves, according to Sir Charles Bell, are not under the control of
                    the will, and are not capable of exciting sensations; their only office being
                    that of transmitting impressions from one part to the other. The nerves which
                    strictly belong to this class are the eighth pair, the spinial accessory nerves,
                    the phrenic, the external respiratory nerve of Sir Charles Bell, and the great
                    sympathetics.</p>
                <p>(725.) The first pair, or the olfactory nerves, the second, or the optic, and the
                    portio mollis of the seventh pair, are wholly nerves of sensation; and from the
                    special nature of the impression they convey, may be considered as forming a
                    separate class of nerves.</p>
                <p>(726.) Most nerves pass through <hi rend="italic">ganglia,</hi> or are interwoven
                    with others in <hi rend="italic">plexuses</hi> before they reach their
                    destination. The purposes answered by this intermixture of filaments, which, in
                    either ease, appears to take place, is to provide extensive connexions between
                    the parts supplied with nerves and different portions of the spinal eord, or
                    medulla oblongata, from which the several fibres originate. Thus the sensative
                    and the motory filaments are intimately united in the same nervous cord, which
                    is thus rendered capable of performing all the functions of nerves. Many
                    hypothetical uses have been assigned to the ganglia, which appear to be
                    unsupported by facts. Drs. Gall and Spurzheim suppose that they contribute to
                    increase the nervous power in those nerves on which they are placed; but there
                    does not seem to be any solid foundation for this opinion.</p>
                <p>(727∙) Muscular contractions, then, may be distinguished, with reference to the
                    nervous power which excites them, into four classes; namely, 1. The purely
                    voluntary motions; 2. The automatic motions; 3. The instinctive motions; 4. The
                    involuntary motions. We have now fully considered the first of these classes,
                    the purely voluntary motions, which may be defined to be those consequent on an
                    effort of volition of which the mind is conscious, and which is accompanied by a
                    distinct idea of the end intended to be accomplished. No examples or
                    illustrations are necessary of motions belonging to this class, as they are
                    those with which we are most familiar. We pass on then to the other classes in
                    the order in which we have enumerated them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V— <hi rend="italic">Automatic Motions.</hi></p>
                <p>(728.) Automatic motions are those which consist of a series of actions, each of
                    which was originally the object of a distinct volition; but which by habit, that
                    is, by repeated association, have become linked together in such a manner, that
                    a simple act of volition is sufficient, apparently, to renew the whole series,
                    without requiring any separate effort of attention to each. Most of the actions
                    which we daily perform, such as walking, speaking, writing, or playing upon a
                    musical instrument, afford examples of automatic motions, being linked together
                    by associations which, far from requiring any conscious acts of volition, follow
                    one another in a regular order of sequence that cannot be broken unless by the
                    exertion of a separate effort of atttention. All these movements, however, are
                    still voluntary, inasmuch as they remain under the control of the will, which
                    commands their commencement, can regulate their course, and can stop them at
                    pleasure.</p>
                <p>(729.) The muscular actions required for respiration may probably be classed
                    under this head. The immediate ex citing cause of the act of inspiration is a
                    sensation felt in the chest from the presence of venous blood in the capillary
                    vessels of the lungs; and this sensation, if not speedily relieved, increases
                    rapidly to one of extreme distress, and even agony. The influence of this
                    sensation in exciting the very complicated actions which are necessary to
                    relieve it by drawing air into the lungs, and which, indeed, are continued
                    during sleep, and even when sensibility to all other impressions appear
                    suspended, as in the state of apoplexy, is rendered manifest by the increased
                    frequency and energy with which these actions are performed whenever any cause
                    exists obstructing the free acces of air into the lungs, and thus augmenting the
                    intensity of the sensation.</p>
                <p>(730.) Since the actions of respiration are caused, in the first instance, by
                    sensations, they must be dependent on the sentient nerves of the lungs, and
                    especially on those that establish the most direct communication between them
                    and the medulla oblongata, namely, the eighth pair of nerves. We find,
                    accordingly, that after the section of those nerves the actions of respiration
                    are performed more slowly and less perfectly than when entire. They,
                    nevertheless, continue, probably by means of the other communications which the
                    lungs have with the brain, through the branches of the great sympathetic
                    proceeding from the spinal cord. When the part of the medulla oblongata from
                    which these nerves originate is injured, all attempts at inspiration are finally
                    arrested, because a final stop is put to the sensation which prompts them. The
                    section of the phrenic nerves, or an injury to the spinal cord at any part above
                    the origin of those nerves, paralyses all the respiratory movements of the
                    chest, and thus occasions asphyxia and sudden death.</p>
                <p>(731.) when the sensation which prompts inspiration, is intense and long
                    continued, all the muscles performing movements auxiliary to this act, such as
                    those which assist the intereostals in elevating the ribs, which hold the
                    glottis open, which raise the velum pendulum, which open the mouth, and which
                    expand the nostrils, are called into simultaneous action, and the movements
                    themselves are performed in coneert, and with perfect precision. These actions
                    are under the control of the will, as respects their force, their rapidity, and
                    their frequency, and they may even be performed at pleasure, either separately
                    or in conjunction; unless, indeed, the sensation which prompts them be unusually
                    intense; in which ease they cease to be voluntary and automatic, and pass into
                    the class of instinctive motions we are next to describe. Sir Charles Bell
                    supposes that the nerves of all the muscles employed in these auxiliary actions
                    have peculiar connexions among themselves at their origin from the lateral
                    columns of the spinal cord, from which the eighth pair, which is the great
                    sentient nerve of the lungs, also arises; and that these connexions arc the
                    principal cause of their conjunction of action, whenever the sensation
                    imperiously demands that they should act in coneert. Yet, on other occasions, we
                    find that all the muscles concerned in these actions, are strictly voluntary
                    muscles, and are perfectly obedient to the will.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VI.— <hi rend="italic">Instinctive
                    Motions.</hi></p>
                <p>(732.) It is the essential character of motions which are strictly voluntary,
                    that they are accompanied not only by a consciousness of their being performed,
                    but also by a conviction that we may, or may not perform them, as we please; or,
                    to speak more philosophically, according as there exists or not, a sufficient
                    <hi rend="italic">motive</hi> for their performance. But there are also, in the
                    healthy state, many muscles, of the actions of which we are always conscious,
                    and which, under ordinary circumstances, are perfectly obedient to the will, but
                    whose actions we have, on other occasions, no direct power of controlling by any
                    effort of the will. They occasionally seem even to be rebellious to its
                    authority, and as if they were transferred to the agency of some other power.
                    They <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499901" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9901-0678"/>arc
                    always preceded by some sensation, as in the case of coughing, sneezing, and
                    vomiting; or some internal affection of the mind, which has been termed <hi
                    rend="italic">emotion,</hi> as in the case of laughing and weeping; and they
                    take place without any previous conception of the object they are calculated to
                    attain, and therefore without the previous existence or operation of a motive. A
                    very large proportion of the actions of brute animals appear to belong to this
                    class; being characterized by the absence of that train of mental operations,
                    which imply the agency of motives, and the previous knowledge of the
                    consequences resulting from such actions; operations which are comprehended
                    under the term <hi rend="italic">reason,</hi> as contradistinguished from <hi
                    rend="italic">instinct,</hi> or blind and inexplicable impulse derived from
                    other sources.</p>
                <p>(733.) Instinctive motions are distinguished by Dr. Alison into two kinds, the
                    one comprising such as are not only prompted by an act of which we are
                    conscious, but are also directed without our being aware of it at the time, to
                    an end which we desire; the other, those in which our actions are consequent
                    indeed on a sensation, but are prompted by a blind impulse, the consequences
                    which are to flow from the action being either unknown or disregarded; as, for
                    instance, in gratifying the appetites, guarding the eyes from danger by closing
                    the eyelids, or the body from falling by throwing out the hands. Dr. Alison, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Outlines of Physiology,</hi> to which we arc indebted for
                    several of the preceding remarks and illustrations, has very clearly treated of
                    the whole subject of the functions relating to muscular motion. He farther
                    remarks that the instinctive actions are closely connected with the motions
                    which proceed directly from sensations on the one band, and with the strictly
                    voluntary motions on the other. In the adult human being, it is hardly possible
                    to distinguish them from movements which have bccn prompted by reason, and
                    become habitual; but in the infant, and in the lower animals, they are easily
                    recognised, being distinguishable by two marks; first, that they are always
                    performed in the very same way; whereas actions which are strictly voluntary,
                    and prompted by reason, although directed to the same ends, vary considerably in
                    different individuals; and, secondly, that, however complicated the movements
                    may be, the truly instinctive actions are performed equally well the first time
                    as the last; whereas even the simplest of the strictly voluntary movements
                    require education. The complex acts of sucking and deglutition performed by a
                    newborn infant, may be given as examples of strictly instinctive motions.</p>
                <p>(734.) It is important, however, in the consideration of this subject, that we
                    bear in mind, that these actions, although in themselves instinctive, are yet
                    performed by muscles which are at other times voluntary, and whose nervous
                    connexions with the sensorium, render it necessary for the performance of these
                    actions, that the muscles themselves should communicate by their respective
                    nerves with the sensorium. We may fairly presume, therefore, that such actions
                    are immediately dependent on a change taking place in the sensorium, through the
                    medium of which alone the impression which is the occasion of the actions,
                    becomes effective in their production.</p>
                <p>(735.) The same remark applies also to those sensations which arise from <hi
                    rend="italic">sympathy,</hi> as it is termed; that is, which are referred to a
                    part of the body very different to that to which the actual irritation is
                    applied. Of this kind is the pain of the shoulder accompanying inflammation of
                    the liver; pain of the knee from disease of the hip-joint; and itching of the
                    nose from irritations in the bowels. These sympathetic sensations may perhaps be
                    explained by the nerves of those corresponding parts having their origins from
                    the same parts of the brain; but much yet remains to be done towards
                    establishing the truth of this hypothesis.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VII— <hi rend="italic">Involuntary
                    Motions.</hi></p>
                <p>(736.) Under the head of the involuntary motions, we mean to comprehend all those
                    muscular contractions which are performed without the intervention of any change
                    in the sensorium, and consequently without being attended with either sensation,
                    consciousness, or any other mental change. The most unequivocal examples of this
                    class of motions are those in which muscular actions are excited by irritations
                    applied directly to the motor nerves which are sent to the muscles themselves;
                    for although, in the living body, such irritations are usually accompanied with
                    the sensation of pain, that sensation must be regarded as an accidental
                    concomitant, and not a necessary part of the phenomenon; as is proved by the
                    absence of all sensation, when the nerve has been divided between the brain and
                    the part to which the irritation is applied, and yet the muscles in which the
                    nerve terminates, exhibit the same involuntary contractions as before. The same
                    phenomenon, indeed, may be reproduced after the death of the animal, or when the
                    brain or head has been removed.</p>
                <p>(737.) Other cases are met with of a more complex and dubious character; namely,
                    those in which muscles usually under the influence of the will, exhibit
                    contractions in consequence of irritations applied, not to their own nerves, but
                    to some more distant part, which receives other nerves. It is manifest that in
                    these instances, the irritation of these latter nerves produces an impression
                    which is propagated along their course towards the central parts of the nervous
                    system, and is from thence again transmitted along the course of the nerves
                    supplying the muscles, in which they excite contractions of the same kind as
                    those originating in volition. Yet these motions may take place wholly
                    independently of the sensorium, and are found to occur, indeed, when all
                    communication with the brain is intercepted. For if, a few seconds after an
                    animal has been deprived of life, the spinal cord be divided in the middle of
                    the neck, and also in the middle of the back, upon irritating either by a
                    mechanical or chemical stimulus, or by the application of heat, any sensitive
                    portion of the body connected by nerves with either of these isolated segments,
                    the muscles of that portion of the limb, so connected with the spine, are thrown
                    into action. If, for instance, the sole of the foot be pricked, the foot is
                    suddenly retracted, with the same gesture as it would have been during life, and
                    of course with the same apparent indication of suffering.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Μαyο's Outlines of Human Physiology, p.
                    231.</p></note> It is evident that here an irritation applied to a nerve, the
                    usual office of which during life was to transmit impressions to the sensorium
                    productive of sensations of pain, has now produced an impression which is
                    conveyed to the spinal cord only; but which yet is followed by the contractions
                    of those very same muscles, which, during life, obeyed the determinations of the
                    will, and produced a motion of the limb directed to its removal from the cause
                    of injury.</p>
                <p>(738.) Phenomena of this description maybe observed more readily, and are
                    exhibited in a manner still more marked, according as the animal on which the
                    experiment is made, occupies a lower place in the scale. Among vertebrated
                    animals, the motions just described, and others of a similar character,
                    indicative of sensation and volition, are most easily produced in reptiles, as
                    in the turtle, the serpent, and the frog; in which we find that isolated
                    portions of the spinal cord perform functions analogous to those of the brain,
                    as far as relates to the receiving of impressions from a certain set of nervous
                    filaments, and the transmitting<pb break="no" facs="nls:193499914"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9914-0679"/> of impressions to other nervous filaments, which
                    proceed from the same part of the spinal eord, and are distributed to the
                    muscles. These two sets of nerves correspond in their functions to the sensory
                    and motor nerves by which sensorial phenomena are produced, (see § 721.) In
                    articulated animals, whose spinal cord consists of a series of nodules of
                    nervous matter, resembling ganglia, connected by two longitudinal cords, and
                    severally giving origin to their respective bundles of nerves, which radiate on
                    each side from these ganglia, as from so many centres, the capability of each
                    ganglion to perform this double function is still more susceptible of
                    demonstration; and each segment of a worm or an insect, for example, appears, in
                    consequence, to enjoy a separate life, and exhibits the semblance of possessing
                    powers of sensation and voluntary motion independently of the rest.</p>
                <p>(739∙) The question now arises whether these indications of sensorial powers
                    actually proceed from the exercise of those faculties; that is, whether they are
                    accompanied by actual feeling and actual volition, of both of which
                    consciousness is the essence; or whether they exist in appearance only, and
                    without any real consciousness on the part of the individual percipient being.
                    This question, taken in all its generality, it is extremely difficult, perhaps
                    impossible, to decide; and its solution involves that of another problem,
                    equally obseure, which is presently to come under our notice: namely, as to the
                    locality and extent of the sensorium in all the classes of the animal kingdom.
                    The plan of structure, and the vital constitution of articulated animals, are so
                    different from what occurs in the system of animals of the vertebrate type, that
                    whatever may be the conclusions we may form with regard to the sensorial powers
                    and the organs which exercise them in the former class, we are not warranted in
                    extending the same conclusions to the latter class of beings, in all of which we
                    cannot fail to recognise the most decided character of individuality. It is
                    hardly possible to conceive the eo-existence of two separate centres of
                    sensation and volition in any vertebrate animal, because we find it impossible
                    to understand how consciousness can be subdivided into portions corresponding to
                    the different segments into which the spinal eord may be divided. If, therefore,
                    we regard the sensorium as occupying any portion of the brain, or rather of the
                    encephalon, such as the medulla oblongata, we cannot admit the existence of a
                    separate or accessary sensorium, situate in any part of the spinal cord, and
                    capable of exercising the sensorial functions independently, when all nervous
                    communication with the principal sensorium is cut off. If the power of sensation
                    could ever be retained, even for a second, after the head has been severed from
                    the body, we must suppose that the seat of that faculty is still in the head,
                    and not in the trunk, the movements of which, when excited by galvanism, however
                    they may resemble those which were performed during life in obedience to
                    volition, in conformity to the design, and prompted by motives arising from
                    bodily sensations, must be regarded as purely meehanical, or rather as the
                    result of mere nervous irritation, and without the existence of either sensation
                    or volition of any kind. We have decisive proofs that in the human system
                    phenomena of this kind occur without any participation of the mind, that is,
                    without either sensation, perception, or volition, in cases where, from
                    accident, the spinal eord has been divided or compressed in the neck, or back,
                    and where the muscles of the trunk that receive their nerves from that part of
                    the spinal eord, which is situated below the injury, are affected with
                    involuntary movements. We are therefore fairly entitled to extend the analogy to
                    other animals whose construction does not materially differ from that of man,
                    however appearances may seem to countenance the hypothesis of the sensibility of
                    the trunk, after its communication with the brain has been intercepted.</p>
                <p>(740.) Great confusion has been introduced into this subject by the inaccurate
                    language employed by physiologists in theorizing on these phenomena; and in
                    using which language they have lost sight of the essential distinction which
                    should ever be kept in view between psychological and physical phenomena. The
                    term <hi rend="italic">sensibility</hi> should be strictly confined to such
                    properties as are immediately connected with the mental changes which arc
                    denominated sensations, and which are characterized by attendant consciousness:
                    all other corporeal properties or phenomena which do not produce these mental
                    changes, are simply of a physical nature, and belong to another class to which
                    the same appellation ought never to be applied. Bichat has committed this great
                    error in employing the term <hi rend="italic">organic sensibility</hi> to denote
                    phenomena of this latter kind; and the introduction of this term has led to an
                    interminable confusion of ideas among those who have adopted his system, and who
                    have been thereby led, from this misapplication of terms, to some vague notion
                    of a peculiar but obscure kind of actual sensation, which they attributed to
                    portions of the nervous system unconnected with the sensorium, independent of
                    all percipience, and partaking of the mystical doctrines of Stahl and Von

                <p>For the dissipation of these clouds which have too long obseured the ideas and
                    perplexed the reasonings of physiologists, we need only direct on the subject
                    the searching light of philosophical analysis, which will render its outlines
                    clear and distinct, and enable us to follow their various flexures and
                    crossings, and obtain more correct views of the landscape in all its
                    details.</p>
                <p>(741.) The power exercised in the instances we have described by the central
                    parts of the nervous system, independently of all sensorial phenomena, is that
                    power which we have already distinguished by the term <hi rend="italic">nervous
                    power,</hi> in contradistinction to the <hi rend="italic">sensorial power</hi>
                    exercised by the same system. (See § 96, 536, 537∙) To Dr. Wilson Philip belongs
                    the merit of having first clearly pointed out the distinction between these two
                    orders of functions, and of having given them spécific appellations. Dr. Marshal
                    Hall has lately introduced a new term, that of <hi rend="italic">reflex
                    function,</hi> to designate the series of phenomena consisting of the
                    transmission of impressions by certain nerves to the central parts of the
                    nervous system, (which he limits to the spinal eord,) and the consequent
                    transmission of an action by the muscular nerves, which is followed by the
                    contractions of muscles. To the whole system concerned in this function he gives
                    the name of the <hi rend="italic">excito-motory system·,</hi> the nerves
                    receiving the impression he calls the <hi rend="italic">incident</hi> nerves;
                    and those conveying it to the muscles, the <hi rend="italic">reflex
                    nerves.</hi></p>
                <p>(742.) It would appear from what has been already noticed, (§ 711.) that every
                    muscle the action of which is capable of being brought under the dominion of the
                    will, and which is therefore entitled to be classed among the voluntary muscles,
                    may occasionally be made to act by other causes, applied either directly to
                    their own fibres, to the nerves distributed to them, or to other parts connected
                    with them only by the medium of portions of the brain, spinal cord, or the
                    ganglia of the sympathetic: and it has been conjectured that the sets of nervous
                    fibrils which are instrumental in the performance of these latter functions, are
                    different from those which are employed to transmit the impressions of sensation
                    and volition. This latter view is the one adopted by Dr. W. Philip, who observes
                    that, “however blended the organs of the sensorial and nervous powers may appear
                    to be, we are assured that they are distinct organs by the fact, that while the
                    organs of the nervous power evidently reside equally in the brain and spinal
                    marrow, those of the sensorial power appear to be almost wholly in man, and
                    chiefly in all the more perfect animals, confined <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193499927" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9927-0680"/>to the former.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Quarterly Journal of Science,
                    xiv. 93∙</p></note> It does not, however, appear that we as yet possess any
                    direct means of either establishing or disproving the truth of this
                    supposition.</p>
                <p>(743.) There yet exists another class of muscles, comprehending those which
                    never, under any circumstances, become voluntary. To this class belong the heart
                    and blood-vessels; the muscular fibres of the excretory ducts, and other parts
                    of the organs of secretion; and the coats of the stomach and of the intestines.
                    As the influence of the nervous system on those muscles is of a very pecular
                    kind, and as their motions are governed by different laws from those which
                    regulate the voluntary muscles, it will be necessary to bestow on them a
                    separate consideration.</p>
                <p>(744.) Μ. Le Gallois, in a work entitled, <hi rend="italic">Experiences</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sur le Principe de la Vie, notamment sur celui des Mouvemens du
                    Coeur, et sur le Siige de ce Principe,</hi> thought he had proved that the
                    muscular power of the heart is derived altogether from the spinal cord, and not
                    írom the brain. He found that on injuring the spinal cord, the heart is so
                    enfeebled as no longer to be capable of propelling the blood; but that the
                    contractility of the heart may continue unimpaired when the brain, and even the
                    whole head, is removed, provided respiration be kept up by artificial inflation
                    of the lungs. He conceived, therefore, that the use of the cardiac nerves is to
                    establish the connexion between the spinal cord and the heart; and that whenever
                    the heart is affected by passions and emotions of the mind, which produce their
                    first changes on the brain, it is influenced through the medium of the spinal
                    cord, which is itself affected by the brain. Dr. Wilson Philip has shewn the
                    fallacy of this conclusion; and has completely established, by direct
                    experiment, that under similar circumstances, the brain has just as much
                    influence on the motions of the heart as the spinal cord. The motion of the
                    heart is no more affected by the removal of the spinal cord than by that of the
                    brain, if the same precautions be taken in either case, of effecting the removal
                    slowly, and with as little disturbance to the remaining parts of the system as
                    possible. If, on the other band, either the brain or the spinal cord be suddenly
                    crushed by a blow, which at once destroys its texture, the heart is instantly
                    paralysed, and its motions cease. Although the muscular fibres of these organs
                    are not excited to contraction by irritations of any kind applied to their
                    nerves, nor their contractions arrested by the section of those nerves, yet
                    these actions arc immediately accelerated by the application of chemical
                    stimulants, such as alcohol, either to the brain or to the spinal cord; and
                    retarded by the application of opium, tobacco, or other narcotic agents, to the
                    same parts.</p>
                <p>(745.) It would appear, therefore, that although there is no essential difference
                    between the real nature of the irritability of the involuntary, and that of the
                    voluntary muscles, yet that each is influenced by different kinds of stimuli,
                    and by stimuli applied through a different medium. Mechanical stimuli, such as
                    punctures or partial divisions of the fibres of the muscles of voluntary motion,
                    act on them only through the medium of their nerves; and if applied to the parts
                    of the brain whence these nerves originate, will throw those muscles into the
                    most violent spasmodic contractions. The heart, on the contrary, is but slightly
                    disturbed in its movements by the same kind of injury done to the brain or
                    spinal cord, provided the injury be confined to a small portion of those organs.
                    That important organ appears to be affected only in proportion to the extent of
                    the parts that have suffered injury, and to the suddenness with which that
                    injury has been inflicted; as is exemplified by wounding the brain rapidly in
                    many directions. Chemical stimuli, on the contrary, applied to any part of the
                    brain or spinal cord, produce considerable and immediate increase of the action
                    of the heart; while the voluntary muscles continue all the while unaffected; and
                    the animal betrays no sense of pain. Accordingly the heart, having no direct
                    dependence on any part of the neívous system, may continue its action when the
                    brain and spinal cord are destroyed, and even when it is itself removed from the
                    body. The nerves with which it is supplied, however, render it capable of being
                    influenced through those causes, as, for example, by the passions, and by
                    various poisons, which affect a considerable portion of the nervous system.</p>
                <p>(746.) The contractile powers of the other parts of the vascular system, and most
                    of the secreting organs, as well as the irritability of the stomach and
                    intestines, are, like those of the heart, independent of the nervous system, yet
                    capable of receiving an influence through the medium of the nerves; and the same
                    law appears to extend generally to all the involuntary muscles. The extensive
                    nervous communications which are naturally established between the whole system
                    of involuntary muscles, and the organs in which they enter, seem to be necessary
                    in order that any one set of these organs should be subjected to the influence
                    of all the others. This purpose is effected by that complex arrangement of
                    nerves, which has been termed the <hi rend="italic">ganglionic system,</hi> from
                    the great number of ganglia annexed to them. The great sympathetic nerve forms
                    the principal connecting nerve in this system between all the muscles of
                    involuntary motion; which, through the medium of filaments from the extensive
                    chain of ganglia belonging to this nerve, are placed in connexion with every
                    part of the brain and spinal cord. Each ganglion belonging to the sympathetic
                    system has been considered as a secondary centre of nervous influence, receiving
                    supplies from all the latter parts, and conveying to the former organs the
                    united influence of the nervous system in general. The muscles of voluntary
                    motion, on the other hand, are subjected to the influence of only small portions
                    of these central parts of the nervous system, and receive their nerves directly
                    from these parts; and usually without the intervention of ganglia, and with
                    comparatively few intermixtures of nervous filaments; such intermixtures being
                    designed for the purpose of effecting combinations with the nerves of sensation,
                    and especially with those which convey impressions relative to muscular
                    motion.</p>
                <p>(747∙) The ganglia of the sympathetic system have, accordingly, been considered
                    by many physiologists as performingfunctions similar to those of the portions of
                    the spinal cord exercising mere nervous power; that is, in the language of Dr.
                    Marshall Hall, performing reflex functions, and belonging, together with the
                    branches of the sympathetic nerve, to the excito-motory system.<note

                <p>(748.) In treating of the functions of the nervous system which involve
                    operations both of the body and of the mind, it is very difficult to draw the
                    strict line of distinction between them, and avoid treating of subjects which
                    properly belong to metaphysics. We have endeavoured, in the preceding account of
                    the physiology of man, to confine ourselves strictly to the consideration of the
                    corporeal changes which accompany the different mental affections, and to avoid,
                    as much as possible, encroaching upon the province of the metaphysician. That
                    certain physical changes take place in some portion or other of the cerebral
                    mass in connexion with various mental changes, we have the clearest evidence:
                    but of the nature of these physical changes we are wholly ignorant; nor does the
                    present state of our information afford a shadow of hope that we shall ever gain
                    any more precise knowledge of them. The mental changes, on the other hand,
                    constitute a distin ct and separate branch of science; to the knowledge of which
                    we arrive by channels totally <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499940"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9940-0681"/>different from those which instruct us relatively
                    to the former; namelv, by consciousness, and by reflexion on the series of
                    phenomena furnished to us by consciousness. These two subjects of study, the
                    material and the immaterial, however numerous may be the subtle and inscrutable
                    links that connect them, constitute two worlds, which in our conception must for
                    ever remain totally distinct; nor is it even possible for us to conceive how any
                    knowledge which we can obtain with relation to any physical changes in our
                    corporeal frame, or any physiological laws that may regulate the succession of
                    those changes, can in the smallest degree assist us in understanding the
                    phenomena of intellect, and the affections of the soul.</p>
                <p>(749.) The brain has been very justly regarded as the organ of the mind; that is,
                    the corporeal instrument invariably employed in the operations of the mind. This
                    is a necessary corollary from the proposition that no mental operation can take
                    place without the co-existence of some physical change in the brain. But a
                    second proposition, the converse of the former, has been advanced; namely, that
                    the mental operations are the “functions of the brain.” But this latter
                    proposition would be true only on the supposition that the physical change in
                    the brain, and the corresponding mental change of which we are conscious, are
                    one and the same thing. Until this fundamental doctrine of materialism, namely,
                    the identity of matter and mind, be proved, we cannot include under the
                    functions of the brain, both the mental changes and the corporeal changes. The
                    physiological office, or function of the brain is the production of certain
                    corporeal changes, connected in some inexplicable manner with certain mental
                    changes; which two classes of changes are in their nature, as far as we are
                    capable of forming any conceptions of them, radically and essentially different
                    from each other.</p>
                <p>(750.) The ambiguity of ordinary language is, indeed, a frequent source of
                    confusion of ideas on this subject. We speak correctly when we say that the eye
                    is the organ of vision, because it is an instrument without which vision could
                    not be exercised; but were we to regard vision as the function of the eye alone,
                    we should evidently be guilty of inaccuracy in extending too far the purpose of
                    that instrument. The function of the eye is to produce certain impressions upon
                    the retina, which impressions are but links in the series of changes, of which
                    only the last constitutes vision. These impressions made on the retina are
                    followed by changes in the course of the optic nerves, and these again by
                    changes in the sensorium. The function of the optic nerves, and of that part of
                    the sensorium in which they terminate, is the production of these physical
                    changes. Vision, an affection of the mind, is undoubtedly the effect of these
                    physical changes, but is not properly the function of any of these organs,
                    except the term function be used in that loose and popular sense, in which it is
                    made to embrace all the remote consequences of the phenomena, in the production
                    of which the organ in question is concerned. In this sense, indeed, vision, and
                    all the mental affections consequent upon vision, might certainly be said to be
                    functions of the eye; but in the strict philosophical sense, the function of the
                    eye is limited to the formation of images on the retina, and the impressions
                    thereby received by the retina; and, in like manner, the proper function of the
                    brain is the production of certain physical changes in the fabric of the brain,
                    consequent upon certain impressions made on the nerves by external causes, and
                    consequent also upon certain internal affections of the mind, which are capable
                    of exerting on it this influence.</p>
                <p>(751) The affections of the mind are very various and complicated; a great
                    multitude of ideas and associations are treasured up in it, and constitute a
                    variety of powers, of faculties, of propensities, of instincts, and of passions.
                    The conformation of the brain, which is the organ of the mind, is also very
                    complex, and appears to consist of an assemblage of different parts, constructed
                    evidently with extreme refinement, and arranged with great care, and with very
                    elaborate design. The idea naturally suggests itself, that these different
                    portions recognised by the anatomist may, perhaps, have some correspondence with
                    the several faculties into which the phenomena of the mind have been analyzed by
                    the metaphysician. This question has indeed been often started, and is quite
                    distinct from that of the materiality or immateriality of the soul; for it is
                    perfectly conceivable that if the immaterial soul acts by means of material
                    organs, and receives impressions from those organs, its different operations may
                    require different organs. But this subject, together with the theories to which
                    it has given rise, having been already amply discussed under the Treatise on <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Phrenology,</hi> we need pursue the subject no farther in this
                    place.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IX— <hi rend="italic">Sleep.</hi></p>
                <p>(752.) Whilst the functions which have for their object the reparation of the
                    state of the body, and which include assimilation, absorption, circulation,
                    respiration, secretion and nutrition, continue in constant activity, all those
                    connected with sensation and volition require intervals of repose, and cannot be
                    maintained beyond a certain time without great exhaustion of the nervous power.
                    These periodical intermissions in the activity of the animal functions, so
                    necessary for the renovation of the power on which the}' are dependent,
                    constitute <hi rend="italic">sleep.</hi> The eye-lids close to protect the eye
                    from injury, and the eye-ball is turned upwards; the external senses and all the
                    active intellectual operations are suspended; the voluntary muscles are relaxed;
                    and we become insensible to all external impressions. The movement of the
                    involuntary muscles continue, though with somewhat less energy than during our
                    waking hours. The heart beats with diminished force and frequency, and the
                    muscles of respiration act more slowly; but the inspirations are more full and
                    deep, and the secretions are in general less abundant; but digestion and
                    absorption are carried on with great activity. The power of sensation, though
                    blunted, is not altogether lost during sleep, as is proved by the continuance of
                    that part of the movements of the muscles of respiration, which depend on
                    sensation. Instinctive movements of the limbs, producing a change of posture,
                    frequently take place from an obscure sensation of constraint at their
                    continuing long in the same position. Any unusual impressions made on the organs
                    of the senses are felt during sleep, and even remembered; and, if the impression
                    be sufficiently vivid, will interrupt sleep.</p>
                <p>753. Neither is the mind wholly inactive during sleep; it is still occupied with
                    a succession of ideas, which is often more rapid than when we are awake; the
                    imagination is even more vividly exerted, and the images that pass before the
                    mindare considered as realities. This constitutes <hi rend="italic"
                    >dreaming,</hi> a state which is characterized also by the peculiar circumstance
                    of the want of all voluntary power of directing the succession of ideas. Trains
                    of ideas and images commence and follow one another, being indissolubly linked
                    together by those laws of association which are independent of volition.</p>
                <p>(754.) An extraordinary modification of dreaming occurs in what is called <hi
                    rend="italic">somnambulism,</hi> or sleep-walking; where the will recovers a
                    certain degree of power over the mental operations, and over the voluntary
                    muscles both of speech and of motion, while the body is still less capable of
                    receiving external impressions than in ordinary sleep. In this peculiar kind of
                    sleep, the insensibility to most external impressions is so profound, that it is
                    scarcely possible to awaken the person without employing a considerable degree
                    of violence. When at length he does awake, which often happens as suddenly as
                    from natural sleep, he usually retains <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499953"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-9953-0682"/>little or no recollection of what happened to him,
                    or of what he did while in this singular state.</p>
                <p>(755.) A state very similar to that of natural somnambulism, is induced in some
                    ncrvons constitutions, especially those of young females, by certain
                    manipulations which produce a long-continued reiteration of impressions made on
                    the senses, and which probably act through the medium of the mind. These have
                    been ascribed to a special agency, termed <hi rend="italic">animal
                    magnetism,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mesmerism.</hi> For an account of these
                    effects, we must refer our readers to the article <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>CΠAΓ. XVII THE VOICE.</p>
                <p>(756.) The function of the voice, and of its modulation into articulated sounds,
                    by which it is rendered subservient to speech, has been already pointed out as
                    an important part of the animal economy of a being designed, as man evidently
                    is, to hold extensive communion with his fellow creatures, and effect the rapid
                    interchange of ideas and feelings, through the medium of the sense of hearing,
                    (§ 24.)</p>
                <p>(757.) In order to understand the mode in which articulate sounds are produced,
                    it will be necessary again to advert to the principles of acoustics, of which a
                    brief account was given in introducing the subject of the physiology of hearing,
                    (§ 623.) The object to be accomplished in the function of the voice is the
                    production, not so much of single sounds, (such as those which result from
                    single impulses given to the air,) but of continued sounds, composed of
                    reiterated vibrations, repeated at short and equal intervals, and constituting a
                    <hi rend="italic">musical note.</hi> There are two principal modes in which such
                    sounds are produced; the one, that which is practised in stringed musical
                    instruments, in which the impulses are given to the air by the vibrations of
                    solid bodies, which are generally chords having different degrees of tension;
                    and the other, such as is adopted in wind instruments, where the air is thrown
                    into undulations at regular intervals, by alternations of expansion and
                    condensation, generally taking placing during the passage of a stream of air
                    through a cavity in which it suffers certain reflexions and reverberations,
                    alternately impeding and promoting its progress. In many eases the effect is
                    obtained by a combination of both these means, as in a hautboy, where an elastic
                    plate, or <hi rend="italic">reed,</hi> is placed in the course of the air which
                    is passing along a tube, capable by its form of producing <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> musical note, independently of such addition.</p>
                <p>(758.) In the construction of the vocal organs of man, nature has resorted to
                    combinations of this kind. Advantage is taken of the function of respiration to
                    convert the passages through which the air is admitted to, and expelled from the
                    lungs, into a sounding instrument; by adapting to the upper part of the trachea,
                    a curious mechanism, consisting of a frame-work of elastic cartilages, with an
                    apparatus of ligaments, muscles, membranes, and mucous glands, the assemblage of
                    which is termed the <hi rend="italic">larynx.</hi> The aperture through which
                    the air passes is denominated the <hi rend="italic">glottis.</hi> Here it is
                    that the breath is <hi rend="italic">vocalised</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that
                    is, rendered not only sonorous, but also modulated in its pitch, so as to give
                    rise to a musical sound. Modifications are subsequently impressed on these
                    sounds, by the changes which the undulations are made to undergo in the cavities
                    of the pharynx, of the nostrils, and of the mouth, according to the various
                    forms and dimensions given to those cavities by the motions of the muscles of
                    the pharynx, the velum pendulum, the uvula, the tongue, the cheeks, and the
                    lips; and according to the obstacles placed in the way of the passage of the air
                    by the movements of these parts, and the application, in particular, of the
                    tongue and of the lips to the palate and to the teeth.</p>
                <p>(759.) The cartilages of the larynx are five in number, namely, the <hi
                    rend="italic">thyroid,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">cricod,</hi> the two <hi
                    rend="italic">artenoid,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">epiglottis.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">thyroid,</hi> which is also called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scutiforrn,</hi> or shield-like cartilage, is placed at the upper and fore-part
                    of the larynx, and is the largest of the whole. It consists of two lateral wings
                    of a quadrangular form, uniting in front in a longitudinal angle, which is felt
                    projecting in the forepart of the throat, and has obtained the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">pomum&gt; adami.</hi> From the posterior corners, four processes
                    project, called its <hi rend="italic">cornua,</hi> distinguished into two <hi
                    rend="italic">superior,</hi> and two <hi rend="italic">inferior.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">cricod, annular,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ring-like</hi>
                    cartilage, is placed below and behind the former; and it has four articular
                    surfaces, two below, for its connexion with the inferior cornua of the thyroid
                    cartilage, and two above, for the articulation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >arytenoid</hi> cartilages, which are bodies of a pyramidal shape, much smaller
                    than the rest, and placed one on each side, upon the upper posterior and lateral
                    parts of the cricod cartilages. They give attachment to ligaments, and compose a
                    part of the sides of the opening called the <hi rend="italic">glottis.</hi> The
                    whole passage is lined internally by a delicate mucous membrane.</p>
                <p>(760.) The <hi rend="italic">epiglottis</hi> is a cartilaginous lid, which has a
                    pointed shape, resembling the leaf of an artichoke. It is fixed at its base to
                    the os hyoides, to the thyroid cartilage, and to the root of the tongue; and
                    hangs obliquely backwards over the opening of the glottis, which extends in a
                    line from behind forwards, and is formed by the approximation of the vocal
                    ligaments, or <hi rend="italic">chordae</hi><hi rend="italic">vocales.</hi>
                    These ligaments, which consist of fibres endowed with a high degree of
                    elasticity, are covered with the fine membrane which invests the whole of this
                    delicate apparatus, and extends down the trachea into the lungs, and above to
                    the posterior fauces. These are attached together in front to the thyroid
                    cartilage, and behind to the arytenoid cartilages, where, in the relaxed
                    condition of the organ, they are at some distance from each other, so as to
                    leave a triangular opening for the passage of the air. The effort to speak, or
                    to utter a vocal sound, commences with the action of certain muscles, more
                    particularly the <hi rend="italic">cricothyroidaei,</hi> which stretch the vocal
                    ligaments, and the <hi rend="italic">cricoarytaenoidei</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >laterales,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">arytaenoidei</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >transversi</hi><hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi rend="italic">obliqui,</hi> which
                    conspire to make the arytenoid cartilages approximate. By these combined
                    actions, the vocal ligaments are brought near to each other, in parallel
                    directions, so that the interval between them or <hi rend="italic">rima</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">glottidis,</hi> as it is called, is reduced to a mere narrow
                    linear fissure.</p>
                <p>(761.) When, therefore, the air is forcibly propelled from the lungs through the
                    glottis, while the vocal chords are in this approximated position, different
                    vocal sounds will be produced, according to the degree of tension which is given
                    to the chordae vocales. The greater the tension of these ligaments, the more
                    frequent will be their vibrations, and the higher the pitch of the note they
                    produce. The loudness of the sound emitted is proportioned, not to the frequency
                    of the vibrations, but to their extent, or the magnitude of the excursions made
                    by the vocal chords in vibrating. The varied degrees of tension which can be
                    imparted at will, and instantaneously, to the vibrating ligament of the larynx,
                    by the finely regulated actions of their different muscles, constitute the chief
                    source of superiority in the vocal organ to any instrument of human
                    invention.</p>
                <p>(762.) The muscles above enumerated as giving tension to the vocal ligaments, and
                    dossing the glottis by the approximation of the arytenoid cartilages, are
                    opposed by their antagonists the <hi rend="italic">thyreo-arytaenoidei,</hi>
                    which relax the vocal ligaments, and place them in the vocalizing position, and
                    by the <hi rend="italic">cricoarytaenoidei</hi><hi rend="italic">postici,</hi>
                    which separate the arytaenoid cartilages, and thereby open the glottis. Thus the
                    instrument we are considering is capable of an infinite number of changes of
                    form, and susceptible of the finest modulation.</p>
                <p>(763.) It should be stated, however, that many physiologists have maintained that
                    the musical tones of the voice depend, not merely on the tension of the vocal
                    ligaments, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499966" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9966-0683"/>but
                    also on the size and form of the aperture through which the stream of air is
                    propelled, and that the larynx partakes as much of the properties of a wind as
                    of a stringed instrument. The principal advocate of this opinion was Dodart,
                    whose first paper<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Mémoires de l’Acadlmie, pour 1700, ρ. 244; 1707, p. 66.</p></note> contains
                    a historical account of the views on this subject taken by the earlier
                    physiologists. His chief antagonist in this controversy was Ferrein,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. pour 1741, pp. 409,
                    416, 422.</p></note> who compares the larynx to a violin, or harpsichord, and
                    conceives that the voice is produced by the vibrations of the edges of the
                    ligaments of the glottis; and compares the action of the air to that of a bow
                    setting these parts into vibration. The hypothesis ofDodart has been adopted by
                    Blumenbach, who conceives the action of the larynx to be analogous to that of
                    the flute. But the generality of physiologists consider the action of the
                    ligaments of the glottis to be vibration, and similar to that of strings
                    resounding by their tension alone. Such is the view taken of the subject by Dr.
                    Young,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lectures, p. 400,

                    chords; the frequency of which must, according to all acoustic principles, be
                    regulated solely by the tension of the chords.</p>
                <p>(764.) Dr. Willis observes that, for the production of laryngeal sounds,
                    something more is requisite than a definite tension of the vocal ligaments. He
                    has shown, by experiment, that in order that the edges of two membranes, such as
                    those made of leather or of Indian rubber, opposed to each other with a narrow
                    interval, may vibrate, the parts of the membrane near their edges must be
                    brought parallel to each other. Comparing this disposition of membrane in his
                    experiment with the parts of the larynx, he supposes that the latter will not
                    vocalize, unless some change, independent of, and superadded to, the tension of
                    the ligaments, be produced in their relative position.</p>
                <p>(765.) The experimental proof on which Mr. Willis founds his conclusion that some
                    change in the relative position of the vocal chords is necessary to produce an
                    audible vocal sound, is the following. If the finger be placed upon the membrane
                    which intervenes between the thyroid and cricod cartilages, their approximation
                    or increased remoteness may readily be felt. Now their approximation being
                    produced by the action of the cricothyroid muscles, involves an increased
                    tension of the ligaments. But it is possible by an effort to keep these
                    cartilages approximated, while something is still wanting in the internal
                    arrangement of the larynx, to fit it for the production of sound. When the
                    thyroid and cricod cartilages are thus approximated, and the ligaments thus
                    shewn to be in a state of tension, if air be impelled through the larynx, sound
                    does not necessarily follow; the ligaments have still, Mr. Willis concludes, to
                    be placed in the vocalizing position.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Mayo’s Outlines of Human Physiology, 3d edition, p. 350,

                <p>(766.) There are still other parts of the vocal apparatus connected with the
                    sounds produced at the larynx, which require to be adverted to. Among these the
                    varying conditions of the trachea appear to have the greatest influence on those
                    sounds, and of this influence Mr. Wheatstone proposes the following theory:<note

                <p>“Such a vibrating apparatus as we have described the ligaments of the glottis to

                    producing all those sounds of which we find the voice to be susceptible. But the
                    intervention of a tube between the lungs and the larynx, must necessarily
                    exercise an important influence on the voice, though it has never yet been taken
                    into consideration. For, if we unite such an apparatus, or a free reed, which
                    may serve as a substitute for it, with a tube (supposing it for the moment fixed
                    to a determinate degree of pitch), it is found, that, unless the column of air
                    in the tube is of such a length as to be separately capable of producing the
                    same number of vibrations, the sound cannot be obtained in its greatest force
                    and purity, and that when the tube is half this length, the discordance between
                    the tube and the reed is so great, as to prevent the production of the sound:
                    between these limits the sound is intermediate in intensity and quality. This
                    influence of the tube is by experiment found to be the same, whether the tube be
                    placed after the reed, as in several wind instruments, or before it, as in the
                    vocal organ. We will now suppose the tube to be unalterable in its length, and
                    the reed necessarily to undergo all its varying modifications of pitch; the
                    sounds, instead of being of even quality, will be irregular in intensity, and
                    require different degrees of effort to produce them, while, in some parts of the
                    scale, they will be totally extinguished. All this may be prevented, and the
                    utmost regularity obtained, by shortening the tube, in proportion as the
                    vibrations of the rced increase in frequency. The trachea is obviously incapable
                    of changing its length within limits sufficiently considerable to serve this
                    purpose; but Savart’s experiments have shown, that a tube of constant length may
                    be made to produce a great range of sounds, by making it of elastic sides
                    susceptible of variable tension. The analogy between such a tube and the trachea
                    is perfect.”</p>
                <p>(767∙) One mode of giving increased tension to the windpipe is the action of the
                    transverse muscular fibres which bind the ends of its cartilages together.
                    Another is the elevation of the larynx, which follows in so remarkable a degree
                    the elevation of the pitch of the voice. Practice in singing improves the voice,
                    partly by giving us a more ready command over the tension of the trachea, and
                    partly by enabling us to regulate and vary the opening of the glottis while we
                    preserve the tension of the vocal chords.</p>
                <p>(768.) Such being the mode in which vocal sounds arc produced in the larynx, the
                    next step in the inquiry will relate to modifications they receive from the
                    shape of the cavities of the pharynx and mouth, through which the expired air
                    has yet to pass. When thus modified they become not merely vocal, but <hi
                    rend="italic">articulate</hi> sounds, and constitute the elements of speech.</p>
                <p>(769∙) This branch of the subject has been ably investigated by Sir Charles
                    Bell,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Philosophical
                    Transactions for 1832, p. 299∙</p></note> who has traced the influence which the
                    changes produced by the muscular actions of the tongue and fauces, on the shape
                    of the cavities of the mouth and pharynx, have on the resulting articulate
                    sounds. He has examined the succession of actions which must be performed before
                    a word can be uttered, and which he finds to consist in the compression of the
                    thorax, as well as the adjustment of the glottis, the elevation and depression
                    of the larynx, and the contraction of the pharynx.</p>
                <p>(770.) The elementary articulate sounds of a language consist of vowels and
                    consonants. Vowels are continued ’ sounds, produced when the passage of the air
                    through the fauces is uninterrupted, the fauces being only more or less
                    narrowed. Each vowel requires a different elevation of the tongue or contraction
                    of the lips. Thus the sound of the broadest pronunciation of the letter α, which
                    occurs in the word <hi rend="italic">awe,</hi> results from the lowest position
                    of the tongue, giving its greatest depth to the cavity of the mouth. The
                    ordinary sound of <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> as in the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >age,</hi> is produced by a certain elevation of the tongue, reducing
                    considerably the capacity of the mouth. The vowel <hi rend="italic">c,</hi>
                    pronounced as in <hi rend="italic">eve,</hi> is sounded by raising the tongue
                    still more, so as to leave a more contracted channel for the exit of the air.
                    The positions for <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and oo. are obtained by placing the
                    fauces <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499979" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9979-0684"/>in the
                    position first described, namery, that for <hi rend="italic">au,</hi> and then
                    approximating the lips.</p>
                <p>(771.) The pronunciation of consonants is effected by interruptions to the
                    passage of the air in some part of the cavity of the mouth, by various motions
                    of the tongue and lips, which, when applied to the palate or the teeth, narrow
                    or close the channel for its exit.</p>
                <p>(772.) The following experiment is mentioned by Mr. Mayo<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Outlines of Human Physiology, p.
                    354.</p></note> as having been made by Μ. Deleau, demonstrating that the
                    articulation of vocal sounds takes place in the fauces. He introduced through
                    the nostrils into the pharynx a flexible tube, and, by means of a gum bottle,
                    impelled air through it into the fauces; then, closing the larynx, he threw the
                    fauces into the different positions requisite for producing articulate sounds,
                    when the air impelled from the gum bottle became an audible whisper. Dr. Bennati
                    repeated this experiment, allowing at the same time laryngeal sounds to pass
                    into the fauces, when each articulated letter was heard double, in a voice at
                    once, and in a whisper.</p>
                <p>(773.) Consonantal sounds may be divided, first, into <hi rend="italic"
                    >aspirates</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sonants,</hi> or, secondly, into <hi
                    rend="italic">continuous</hi> and <hi rend="italic">explosive.</hi></p>
                <p>(774.) The aspirates are those which may be rendered audible without a vocal
                    sound, as is the case with <hi rend="italic">p, t, k, h, f, th, s,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">sh.</hi> The sonants are those which, without any appreciable
                    difference in the shape of the fauces from the form required for the
                    pronunciation of the preceding to which they are allied, are not heard without a
                    vowel sound, either previously uttered, as in <hi rend="italic">b, d, g, v,
                    z,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> or subsequently, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >g,</hi> or in conjunction with it, as in <hi rend="italic">r.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(775.)</hi> Continuous consonants are pronounced when the
                    vocalized air passes through some part of the organ, previously rendered very
                    narrow. Explosive consonants are those which are produced by the interruption to
                    the current of air occasioned by the entire closing of the passage, and its
                    being allowed to burst out with some force by the sudden opening of the same
                    passage.</p>
                <p>(776∙) The nasal consonants, <hi rend="italic">m, n,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >g,</hi> are distinguished from the rest by the peculiar character of their
                    articulation arising from the breath being allowed to pass through the nostrils;
                    while in the pronunciation of the others, the soft palate being raised closes
                    the posterior nostrils, and prevents the sound from diffusing itself in that
                    direction.</p>
                <p>(777.) We refrain from entering into any further details with regard to the
                    position of the fauces, tongue, and lips, in the pronunciation of the different
                    consonants, having already treated of this subject at some length, in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Deaf and Dumb,</hi> to which we shall therefore

                <p>(778.) The low pitch of the voices of men compared with those of women and boys,
                    arises both from the greater general size of the larynx, and also the greater
                    length of the chordae vocales, which has been found to measure nearly double
                    that of the latter. In attempting to utter high notes, voices, naturally grave,
                    assume the character of the <hi rend="italic">falsetto.</hi> This, Mr. Willis
                    supposes, may result from the shortening of the vocal chords; but Mr. Wheatstone
                    is disposed to ascribe it to the tension given to the windpipe being such as to
                    reinforce the laryngeal sounds by subdivisions.</p>
                <p>(779∙) Some curious observations on the mechanism of the voice during singing
                    have lately been given by Dr. Bennati,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Annules des Sciénces Naturelles, xxiii. 32.</p></note> who
                    states, that the compass of his own voice extends to three octaves. He concludes
                    from his inquiries, that it is not merely the muscles of the larynx which
                    modulate the sounds, but those also of the os hyoides, and the other
                    neighbouring parts. He mentions that, on removing part of the tonsils, the
                    operation was followed by the raising of the voice half an octave, without
                    altering its compass. Mr. Mayo supposes this effect to result from the cicatrix
                    stretching the mucous membrane of the larynx, and thus giving increased tension
                    to its inner surface.</p>

                <p>(780.) As far as we are permitted to scan the designs of the Almighty Creator in
                    the formation of organized beings, they appear destined to a mode of existence
                    characterized by perpetual mutation. Their living state is made to consist of a
                    perpetual series of actions and reactions, in which nothing is intended to be
                    permanent, not even the materials of which the combinations constitute the
                    substance and organs of the body. All is subject to displacement, alteration,
                    renewal, and renovation, during a certain definite period, which varies in each
                    species, according to the primordial law of its constitution; and all must bend,
                    when that period is exceeded, to the imperative law of mortality, to which every
                    individual endowed with life is subjected.</p>
                <p>(781.) But the same counsels which prescribed these limits, and decreed the
                    extinction of life, and the dissolution of the frame in which it had resided,
                    have providently ordained most ample means for the continuance of the race, and
                    the indefinite multiplication of its numbers. Individuals perish, but the
                    species is preserved in endless perpetuity by means of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Generation</hi>; a function of paramount importance in the economy of nature,
                    and for which the most ample provision has been made, and the greatest
                    solicitude manifested to secure the accomplishment of its purposes. Nutrition
                    and generation, indeed, constitute the only functions which can be said to be
                    universally exercised by all organized beings, whether belonging to the
                    vegetable or the animal kingdom, or whatever rank, from the lowest to the
                    highest, they may occupy in the scale of nature.</p>
                <p>(782.) But although the purpose is thus manifest, and the provisions for its
                    execution thus effective and even exuberant, the immediate agency by which one
                    living being is rendered capable of giving rise to another similar to itself, is
                    enveloped in the most profound and most hopeless obscurity. No means within the
                    compass of our understanding, no combination of the powers of matter which we
                    can possibly conceive, no process of which the utmost stretch of human
                    imagination can give us the most remote idea, has ever made the least approach
                    towards the solution of this most inexplicable of all enigmas,—the production,
                    nay, the apparent creation, of a living plant or animal by powers inherent in
                    the organization of a similar being. We must content ourselves, in studying this
                    inscrutable mystery, to observe and generalize the phenomena, in silent
                    astonishment at the marvellous manifestation of design and of power exhibited in
                    this department of the wonderful works of the Almighty.</p>
                <p>(783.) Various plans of reproduction are exhibited in the different classes of
                    animals, but they are all reducible to three general heads, which may be
                    designated by the titles of <hi rend="italic">fissiparous, gemmiparous,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">sexual</hi> reproduction. Many physiologists, however, have
                    been disposed to admit the existence of a fourth mode of reproduction, which
                    they have termed <hi rend="italic">spontaneous,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >equivocal generation.</hi> It is contended by the advocates of this hypothesis,
                    that in many of the lower tribes, instances occur of the formation of animals
                    without the intervention of any parents, and produced by the spontaneous union
                    of certain elements, which might fortuitously be found in juxtaposition, in
                    collections of the decomposing materials of other organized structures, after
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193499992" xml:id="kp-eb0717-9992-0685"/>extinction
                    of their life. Although this opinion was at one period the generally prevailing
                    doctrine, it is now, in consequence of the more extensive knowledge which has
                    been obtained of the procedure of nature in the multiplication of animals, very
                    generally exploded. The principal arguments in its favour were, in the first
                    place, those drawn from the existence of intestinal worms, and other parasitic
                    entozoa, in the bodies of animals, the gcrms of which appear neither to be
                    introduced into the system from without, nor to have any assignable origin from
                    within; secondly, those derived from the rapid appearance of infusory
                    animalcules in all infusions of decaying animal or vegetable matter that are
                    exposed for a short time to the air. But the analogy of every other department
                    of the animal and vegetable kingdoms is directly opposed to the supposition that
                    any living being can arise, unless it has originally sprung from an individual
                    of the same species as itself, and of which it once formed a part. The
                    difficulty which the hypothesis of the spontaneous production of infusory
                    animalcules professes to remove, consists m our inability to trace the
                    pre-existence of the germs in the fluid where these animalcules are found to
                    arise, and to follow the operations of nature in these regions of infinite
                    minuteness. But the recent discoveries of Ehrenberg relative to the complete
                    organization of these beings, in which he in many instances detected the
                    presence of generative organs, has very much diminished the difficulty of
                    conceiving the possibility of their ova, so minute as to be wholly
                    imperceptible, existing in great numbers in the fluid, or even in the
                    atmosphere, and giving rise to all the observed phenomena.<note anchored="true"

                <p>(784.) <hi rend="italic">Fissiparous generation,</hi> the simplest of all
                    possible modes in which the species can be multiplied, consists in the
                    spontaneous and gradual division of the body of an individual animal into two or
                    more parts, which, when the division is completed, separate, and each soon
                    assumes the form, and grows to the size of the parent, and becomes capable of
                    performing all the functions which originally belonged to the undivided animal.
                    The most common form of this mode of generation is met with in some of the
                    simpler of the infusoria, as the monas, the gonium, the cyclidium, the
                    vorticellae, and the volvox. In the instance of the volvox, however, we find an
                    approach to the next order; for the young are seen forming within the body of
                    the parent, which is, in course of time, reduced to a mere membranous vesicle,
                    and then bursts, and is tom into shreds, setting free the enclosed young, each
                    of which immediately begins to execute its independent movements in the
                    fluid.</p>
                <p>(785.) <hi rend="italic">Gemmiparous generation</hi> occurs when a new individual
                    grows from the parent as a bud or sprout; at first exhibiting but little
                    resemblance in shape or structure to the parent animal, but gradually assuming
                    that form while still adhering to it, and being afterwards detached to commence
                    an independent existence. Numerous examples occur of this mode of reproduction
                    among the lower orders of zoophytes, such as animals belonging to the tribe of
                    polypi, of which the hydra viridis, rendered celebrated by the researches of
                    Trembley, may be taken as the type. Sometimes, as happens in the sponge, the
                    actinia, and some of the lower orders of mollusea, the young are formed from
                    small detached masses after they are separated from tΓιe body of the parent.
                    These bodies, which are called <hi rend="italic">spores,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >spondes,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gemmules,</hi> are generally of a rounded
                    form and homogeneous structure; and the whole substance of which they are
                    composed is converted during their developement into the new animal. Hence they
                    may be regarded as buds formed in the parent body, but detached from it before
                    the evolution of the new animal begins. In some species these gemmules are
                    formed in all parts of the body indiscriminately; but in most others there is a
                    particular generative organ provided for their formation.</p>
                <p>(78G.) In by far the greater number of organized beings no reproduction takes
                    place except by the co-operation of two kinds of generative organs; laying the
                    foundation of the distinctions of sex, and constituting <hi rend="italic">sexual
                    generation.</hi> As characterising the female, there is, in the first place, an
                    organ, termed the <hi rend="italic">ovary,</hi> of which the office is to form
                    the <hi rend="italic">ova,</hi> or eggs. These are organized bodies of a
                    determinate shape, within which we first find the earliest rudiments, or <hi
                    rend="italic">germ,</hi> of the future animal contained in a fluid, which is
                    itself enclosed in a vesicle. But the ovum, or, more properly speaking, the <hi
                    rend="italic">ovulum,</hi> thus formed exclusively by the female organs, never
                    advances in its developement beyond this stage, and can never give rise to a new
                    animal, unless it receive a certain vivifying impression given to it by the
                    contact of a peculiar fluid, denominated the <hi rend="italic">semen,</hi> which
                    has been prepared by a totally distinct apparatus, constituting the male
                    organs.</p>
                <p>(787.) The nature of the impression thus made by the seminal fluid on the ovulum,
                    or immature ovum, and which constitutes its <hi rend="italic">fecundation,</hi>
                    and awakening in it a power of reproduction, which had before remained dormant,
                    is wholly unknown; nor is it accompanied with any immediate al teration in its
                    appearance or structure. None of the parts of the new animal can yet be
                    discerned in the fluid contents of the ovulum, the great mass of which consists
                    of a fluid holding in suspension granules of albuminous or oily matter; and a
                    certain time must elapse, even in the most favourable circumstances, before the
                    formative process exhibits its effects. The form of the egg is given by the
                    external coverings, and there is in every egg a determinate part, at which the
                    minute rudimental germ of the embryo is first visible. It is to this germ that
                    the power of independent life and developement appears more immediately to
                    belong, the granular fluid serving only as nutriment laid up in store for the
                    supply of materials for growth.</p>
                <p>(788.) Thus the processes essential to sexual reproduction consist, first, in the
                    formation of an ovulum by the fe-1 male organs; second, in the secretion of the
                    seminal fluid by the male apparatus; third, in the application of the seminal
                    fluid to the ovulum so as to confer on it fecundity.</p>
                <p>(789∙) The mode in which this application is made differs according as the male
                    and female organs are both contained in the system of the same individual, (as
                    occurs in <hi rend="italic">monoecious</hi> plants and hermaphrodite animals,)
                    or exist separately in different individuals, (as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >dicecious</hi> plants, and all the higher classes of animals.) In the former
                    case, self-impregnation may take place, either by the required seminal access
                    being effected internally in each individual independently of any other; or, in
                    other cases, by the concurrence of two individuals in sexual union which
                    reciprocally impregnate one another, (as is exemplified in the leech, the
                    earth-worm, and the snail.) In the second division, where the male, or
                    fertilizing organs, are possessed exclusively by one individual, and the female
                    organs, or those producing the germ, by another, impregnation of the ova may
                    take place either after their exclusion from the body of the female parent, by
                    their contact with the male semen ejected on them when thus excluded, (as
                    happens in the case of fishes and batrachian reptiles,) or within the body of
                    the female; for which latter purpose, a new function, that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >copulation,</hi> becomes necessary. This last mode of procedure is had recourse
                    to by nature in by far the largest portion of the animal kingdom, including all
                    the tribes of insects, nearly all the mollusea, and all warm-blooded vertebrated
                    animals.</p>
                <p>(790.) All the subsequent phenomena relate to thedeve-lopement of the embryo thus
                    brought into existence; to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500005"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0005-0686"/>supply of nourishment for its growth; and to the
                    advantages of situation, of warmth, and of protection, which are necessary for
                    the favourable procedure of the vital powers in the progress of this
                    developement.</p>
                <p>(791.) Various plans are resorted to for conducting these processes of
                    developement of the fecundated ovum In that which is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >oviparous generation,</hi> the ovum, during its passage through the oviduct,
                    receives the addition of a considerable quantity of nutritious matter,
                    sufficient for the supply of all the materials requisite for its growth, until
                    the period when it is capable of procuring food for itself; and it also acquires
                    a capsnle, or substantial covering, frequently of a calcareous nature, fitted
                    for its protection under the circumstances in which it is to be placed. When
                    thus formed it constitutes an <hi rend="italic">egg,</hi> or complete ovum; and
                    in this form it is either excluded from the body of the female parent, and
                    hatched, if already fecundated, by the influence of external warmth; or if not
                    previously fecundated, this change is accomplished by the seminal fluid of the
                    male being shed upon it. The former ease, which implies sexual congress, is
                    exemplified in all insects and birds: the latter, which requires no such
                    congress, obtains in fishes, and many of the reptilia. Both are comprehended
                    under the term <hi rend="italic">oviparous animals.</hi></p>
                <p>(792.) In a few instances the eggs, previously fecundated within the body of the
                    female, instead of being expelled, remain in the oviducts until they are
                    spontaneously hatched, and the young are then brought forth alive. This
                    phenomenon, which is exhibited by many cartilaginous, and a few osseous fishes,
                    by several reptiles, and by some gasteropodons mollusea, insects, annelida, and
                    entozoa, has been called <hi rend="italic">ovo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >viviparous</hi><hi rend="italic">generation.</hi></p>
                <p>(793.) In <hi rend="italic">rncirnmiferous</hi><hi rend="italic">generation,</hi>
                    on the other hand, the ovum, which is not perfected in the same degree as in the
                    two former cases, remains within the female, and is attached, by the medium of a
                    substance called <hi rend="italic">the placenta,</hi> to the inner surface of an
                    organ termed the <hi rend="italic">uterus,</hi> where it receives nourishment
                    from the maternal system, and where it remains until it is capable of
                    independent life, and it is then brought forth. This retention during growth in
                    the uterus is termed <hi rend="italic">utero-gestation,</hi> and its subsequent
                    exclusion is termed <hi rend="italic">parturition.</hi> The young of mammalia
                    after birth, although they cease to be organically connected with the mother,
                    continue to derive from her a certain quantity of sustenance in the form of
                    milk, which is a secretion from certain glands termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >mammae,</hi> the possession of which is the characteristic feature of this
                    class of animals. An exception occurs in the ease of marsupiate animals, in whom
                    the young leaves the uterus at a very early period of its formation, while it is
                    yet of a very small size, and its organs are comparatively imperfectly formed.
                    On being born it is introduced by the mother into a pouch, termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">mar</hi><hi rend="italic">supium,</hi> formed by a folding of the
                    integuments of the lower part of the belly; and a short time after it has been
                    deposited there, it is found attached by its mouth to one of the nipples of the
                    mammae, which are concealed within the marsupium, and there receives its
                    nourishment until it has acquired sufficient size and strength to quit its
                    habitation. <hi rend="italic">Monotrematous</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >generation,</hi> which is peculiar to the ornitho-rynehus and echidna, is not
                    yet perfectly understood. The generative organs, and the ova within the ovaries,
                    in these animals, partake in a great degree of the oviparous type; but they are
                    also combined with the presence of mammary glands, which perform the office of
                    lactation, as in the strictly viviparous class of animals.</p>

                <p>(795.) A wide range of inquiry is here opened to us, comprehending, if we were to
                    include in its field the whole of the animal kingdom, an immense multitude of
                    facts, to the complete study of which the labours of a whole life would be
                    inadequate. We are, however, to confine ourselves, at present, to the view of
                    human physiology; but even here the great extent of the subject obliges us to
                    reduce within a narrow compass the account we have to give of this important and
                    interesting department of the science. For this purpose, after a short
                    description of the circumstances relating to the unimpregnated ovum, we shall
                    proceed to the physiology of the male and female systems respectively, bringing
                    its history to the period of the fecundation of the ovum. Tiiis latter subject
                    will lead us to consider some of the most celebrated theories of generation;
                    after which we shall briefly consider the phenomena of utero-gestation and
                    parturition, which are functions belonging exclusively to the female parent, but
                    which accompany and are accommodated to the successive changes attending the
                    developement of the foetus. Of these latter changes, relating to the system of
                    the new individual, it will be more convenient to give the history
                    separately.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II— <hi rend="italic">Vnimpregnated
                    Ovum.</hi></p>
                <p>(79β∙) Much difficulty is necessarily experienced in obtaining direct evidence of
                    the early changes occurring in the process of human generation, from the scanty
                    opportunities allowed as of direct observation of those changes, and from our
                    being precluded from resorting to the most instructive fountain of knowledge,
                    namely, experimental research. While, therefore, we obtain occasional views of
                    the actual phenomena which occur in man, we must content ourselves with filling
                    up the chasms in the continuous history of his generation, by the observation of
                    those which are presented in the lower animals that most resemble him in the
                    mode in which this function is conducted, and by remoter analogies derived from
                    other classes.</p>
                <p>(797∙) It is well established, from these combined sources of information, that
                    the essential part of the female system concerned in generation is the <hi
                    rend="italic">oviary,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ovarium,</hi> of which there is
                    one, situated on each side, in the cavity of the pelvis. The ovaries are small
                    capsular bodies, of an oblong, or oval, and somewhat flattened shape, which are
                    enveloped in the fold of the peritoneum, forming the broad ligaments of the
                    uterus. They are composed of a white and loose <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193500018" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0018-0687"/>cellular texture, in which we
                    discover several minute vesicles, or cysts, filled with a transparent fluid, and
                    termed, from the name of De Graaf, who first observed them, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Graafian vesicles.</hi> Their number is generally from fifteen to
                    twenty in each ovarium, and they vary in size, the largest being about one-third
                    of an inch in its longest diameter. The fluid which is contained in these
                    vesicles is slightly viscid and albuminous, inclining to a yellow colour in the
                    most turgid vesicles, containing numerous granules of an irregular shape, and a
                    few globules of oil, but being otherwise pellucid.</p>
                <p>(7*J9∙) Besides the peritoneal covering already described, the ovarium has a
                    cellular coat proper to itself. Each of the Graafian vesicles has a double
                    investment; the outer coat consisting of a close filamentous texture; and the
                    internal layer being thicker, softer, and more opaque than the outer, from which
                    it is readily separable after maceration, and having a slightly villous inner
                    surface. The membrane immediately containing the granular fluid above described,
                    also exhibits the appearance of being studded with granules, and is on that
                    account styled the <hi rend="italic">membrana</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >graìiulosa.</hi> Within the granular fluid is found a body, composed of closely
                    coherent granules, which has been denominated by its discoverer, Baer, the <hi
                    rend="italic">discus proligerus,</hi> and which he represented as having a
                    flattened or discoid form, and as forming the bed in which is placed the minute
                    vesicle of the <hi rend="italic">ovulum,</hi> or germ of the unimpregnated <hi
                    rend="italic">ovum.</hi> The later researches of Dr. Martin Barry, of which he
                    has given an account in a paper communicated’to the Royal Society of London,
                    have thrown further light on this branch of Zoology. The following is a summary
                    of the principal conclusions at which he has arrived on this subject.</p>
                <p>( 800.) The ovulum of all vertebrated animals, and of many of the invertebrata
                    also, is contained in a vesicle, called by some authors the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chorion,</hi> but which Dr. Barry thinks it desirable, wherever found, to call
                    an <hi rend="italic">ovisac.</hi> He considers the Graafian vesicle of the
                    mammalia, and also the capsule, or <hi rend="italic">calyx</hi> of oviparous
                    vertebrata, as an ovisac which has acquired a covering; which covering is the
                    “<hi rend="italic">couche externe"</hi> of th-e “<hi rend="italic">capsule de la
                    vésicule</hi><hi rend="italic">de Graaf"</hi> of Baer. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >perfect</hi> Graafian vesicle of the mammalia has been shewn by preceding
                    physiologists to be analogous to the perfect capsula, or calyx of the bird; but
                    the analogy is found by Dr. Barry to be much more remarkable between the ovisacs
                    of these two classes of animals, before these additional coverings have been
                    acquired; and this analogy may also be extended to those of amphibia and fishes,
                    so that, in fact, the surfaces of all the vertebrata are in their original
                    structure essentially the same; a conclusion which Dr. Barry is disposed to
                    extend also to the ovisacs of many of the inverte-brata.</p>
                <p>(801.) The ovisac, being originally an independent structure, can be better
                    studied in this state than at a later period, when it has become the lining
                    membrane of the Graafian vesicle or calyx. Thus, while the perfect Graafian
                    vesicle of the mammal, and the perfect capsule of the bird, are obviously
                    corresponding structures, there yet exists this difference, that there is a
                    space, tilled with a large quantity of fluid in the former, not present in the
                    latter; a difference which does not exist in the early stages of formation, when
                    ovisacs in general appear in this respect to be essentially the same. The
                    structure of the ovisac may be examined, in some mammalia, when it does not
                    exceed in length the 600th, or even 1200th part of an inch; so that in the
                    latter case, a cubic inch would contain 1728,000,0'J0.</p>
                <p>(802.) The ovisac of the vertebrata, and perhaps of other animals, is at first of
                    an elliptical form. In the mammalia and birds, myriads of ovisacs and ovula are
                    formed, which never reach maturity. Many of these are formed in the substance of
                    the proper membrane of larger ovisacs, and are therefore termed by Dr. Barry <hi
                    rend="italic">parasitic ovisacs.</hi></p>
                <p>(803.) The ovisac is formed in a cavity proper to itself, with which it does not
                    appear to have any organic connexion. The granules found in the fluid of the
                    ovisac are very characteristic in their appearance, and imply the presence of
                    albumen in a concentrated form. A stratum of these granules, found on the
                    internal surface of the proper membrane of the ovisac, constitutes, as Baer
                    remarks, a distinct membrane. But the mass of granules described by that
                    anatomist as being discoid, is believed by Dr. Barry to be of a spherical form.
                    This latter observer finds that the ovulum of vertebrated animals is, when first
                    formed, situated in the centre of the fluid of the ovisac, and more or less
                    obviously held there by a flake of granules; and has at first no proper envelope
                    of granules. In the mammalia, there forms around the ovulum a granulous covering
                    of a spherical form, which Dr. Barry terms the <hi rend="italic">tunica
                    granulosa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it has no discoid mass of granules
                    proper to it. At a certain period, the ovulum of the mammalia passes from the
                    centre of the ovum to the periphery; and there, while invested by its granulous
                    tunic, it penetrates the membrana granulosa, leaving behind it a flake of
                    granules. Here it lies quite in contact with the proper membrane of the ovisac,
                    is more or less imbedded in the membrana granulosa, and is supported behind by a
                    mass of granules, sometimes presenting the appearance denominated by Baer the
                    <hi rend="italic">cumulus.</hi> But this cumulus does not belong to the proper
                    granulous covering, or tunica granulosa, of the ovulum; for it may in some
                    animals be separated from this covering, in the form of what Dr Barry calls the
                    <hi rend="italic">ρetasiolus granulosus.</hi></p>
                <p>(804.) After the ovulum has reached the periphery, its tunica granulosa may, at
                    least in some animals, by contact with the membrane of the ovisac, become
                    attenuated, or may even disappear at one side; which circumstance, together with
                    the great transparency of this tunic, may have been the cause of Baer’s
                    assigning to it a discoid form. This approximation of the ovulum to the exterior
                    surface of the ovisac, is doubtless for the purpose of exposing it to the action
                    of the fecundating seminal fluid, which reaches it while it is in this
                    situation, and still in the ovary. The next step being now the application of
                    this fluid, we are brought to the next stage of our inquiry, namely, into the
                    series of apparatus and of functions provided for the preparation of the semen,
                    its introduction into the female organs, and its transmission to the surface of
                    the ovulum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">The Male System.</hi></p>
                <p>(805.) The preparation of the seminal fluid is the office of the two glandular
                    bodies called the testicles, or <hi rend="italic">testes.</hi> They are
                    suspended in a portion of common integument having the form of a sac, termed the
                    <hi rend="italic">scrotum,</hi> by a round band, called the spermatic cord,
                    which pursues a very serpentine course; a plexus of veins, the assemblage of
                    which has received the name of <hi rend="italic">corpus ρampyriforme</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> consisting of the spermatic artery, a plexus of absorbents,
                    a plexus of nerves; and lastly, the <hi rend="italic">vas defereris,</hi> or
                    excretory duct; and they are farther supported by a sub-cutaneous layer of
                    muscular fibres, termed the <hi rend="italic">dartos.</hi> The scrotum is
                    divided into two chambers, one testis being lodged in each, by a membranous
                    partition, or <hi rend="italic">septum.</hi> Each testicle is loosely contained
                    in a sac, formed by an external serous membrane, the <hi rend="italic">tunica
                    vaginalis,</hi> derived from the peritoneum, which forms a cavity for its
                    reception similar to that of other serous membranes. This tunic is reflected,
                    like those of other cavities, over the body of the organ; and the reflected
                    portion, which is called, from its white colour, the <hi rend="italic">tunica
                    albuginea,</hi> forms the proper capsule of the testis. When this latter tunic
                    is divided, the testis is found to consist of a flattened oval substance, to the
                    upper, outer, and back part of which a narrow and flat slip of substance, called
                    the <hi rend="italic">epididymis,</hi> is found adherent.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500031" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0031-0688"/>
                <p>(806.) The substance of the testicle is extremely vascular, and the ultimate
                    branches of its spermatic arteries are collected into small bundles of fine
                    convoluted vessels, separated from one another by <hi rend="italic"
                    >septulae,</hi> or membranous partitions. From these the <hi rend="italic">vasa
                    seminifera,</hi> orbeginnings of the excretory ducts, take their rise, and
                    gradually unite to form a smaller number of canals of larger diameter, but
                    exceedingly tortuous in their course. On arriving at the surface and back part
                    of the testicle, they suddenly become straight, assuming the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">vasa recta</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> they, however, again
                    subdivide, and their branches have very numerous communications with one
                    another, composing the net-work of tubes called the <hi rend="italic">corpus
                    highmoriarium,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">rete testis.</hi> From the rete
                    testis arise the ducts denominated the <hi rend="italic">vasa efferentia,</hi>
                    which, after being again contorted into numerous convolutions, form the conical
                    bodies called <hi rend="italic">coni</hi><hi rend="italic">vasculosi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> these again, alternately join to form the epididymis,
                    already mentioned, and which consists of one slender tube, of enormous length,

                    On tracing these ducts into the pelvis, we find them passing up by a circuitous
                    route through the spermatic passage, and on reaching the pelvis, again
                    descending by the lower side of the bladder, to the under part of its cervix.
                    Each duct is here connected with an oblong membranous bag, called the <hi

                    blind sac, folded many times upon itself; its open extremity entering the vas
                    deferens at an acute angle. These sacs are supposed to be receptacles for the
                    retention and accumulation of semen, until the time when it is required to be
                    expelled. But Hunter remarked that the fluid contained in them is somewhat
                    different from that obtained from the seminal ducts of the testicle itself; and
                    he therefore supposed that these vesicles secrete a peculiaι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> fluid which may perhaps dilute and add to the bulk of
                    the semen. He even contended that the proper office of these cavities is not
                    that of reservoirs of semen; supporting his opinion by arguments derived from
                    comparative anatomy, which furnishes many examples where no direct communication
                    exists between them and the vas deferens, and others where these vesicles are
                    entirely absent. Notwithstanding these analogies, the prevailing opinion is in
                    favour of the vesienlae seminales in man being reservoirs of the seminal
                    secretion.</p>
                <p>(807.) From the vesiculae seminales and the vas deferens, the semen is
                    occasionally discharged through a duct common to both, and about half an inch in
                    length, which perforates a body called the <hi rend="italic">prostate
                    gland,</hi> and then opens on each side into a canal, termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">urethra,</hi> which is continued from the urinary bladder, close
                    to a small eminence in that canal, termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >verumontanum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">caput gallinaginis.</hi> The prostate
                    gland is of the size of a small chesnut; in shape it resembles a heart, with the
                    apex directed forwards. Its texture is firm and tough; it is divided into two
                    lateral lobes, and one anterior lobe, and contains a great number of follicles,
                    into which a white opaque viscid fluid is secreted. This secretion is discharged
                    by ten or twelve excretory ducts opening obliquely into the urethra, in a furrow
                    at the side of the verumontanum.</p>
                <p>(808.) The urethra is a canal, lined by a mucous membrane, serving the double
                    purpose of discharging the urine and the semen. As it proceeds forwards from the
                    neck of the bladder, it passes through the prostate gland, on emerging from
                    which it becomes more contracted in its diameter, and passes under the symphysis
                    pubis. At this part, for the length of about an inch, it is supported only by
                    firm cellular and ligamentous membranes; this part of the canal is termed the
                    <hi rend="italic">membranous portion</hi> of the urethra. It is then dilated
                    into what is called the <hi rend="italic">bulb,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >sinus</hi> of the urethra; and it afterwards receives the ducts of several
                    mucous glands, which have been denominated the <hi rend="italic">glands of
                    Cowper,</hi> and which are generally very minute, but sometimes have the size of
                    peas. One of these is placed on each side of the membranous portion of the
                    urethra, below which they are united by an isthmus; and the duct of each, about
                    three inches in length, opens by perforating the mucous membrane lining the
                    spongy body of the penis. Mucus is also furnished to various parts of the canal
                    by <hi rend="italic">lacunae</hi> provided for that purpose. At its bulbous
                    part, the urethra takes a considerable curve forwards, and is surrounded in the
                    rest of its course by a peculiar erectile texture, denominated the <hi
                    rend="italic">corpus spongiosum urethra.</hi> This substance is expanded, at the
                    extremity of the penis, into what is termed the <hi rend="italic">glans,</hi>
                    which is covered by a fold of the skin called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >prepuce.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">corpora cavernosae</hi> are the cylindrical
                    bodies which compose the chief bulk of the penis. They arise by two <hi
                    rend="italic">crura,</hi> one from each ascending ramus of the os ischii, and
                    are chiefly composed of the peculiar structure, termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >erectile tissue,</hi> (see § 434.) At its extremity, the urethra is
                    considerably narrower than where it passes along the corpus spongiosum.</p>
                <p>(809∙) These parts, namely, the glans and corpora cavernosa penis, and the corpus
                    spongiosum urethrae, consist principally of large convoluted veins, which in the
                    last named part are particularly dilated and branched, and are bound together
                    and crossed in various directions by ligamentous bands and fibres. This
                    arrangement, by obscuring the connexions which the veins have with one another,
                    as well as their tortuous course, has led to the mistake that has so long
                    prevailed among anatomists, of ascribing to these bodies a cellular structure.
                    These bands appear to be provided for the purpose of limiting the distention of
                    the vessels, and adding to the rigidity occasioned by the accumulation of blood
                    in the venous convolutions during erection. The means by which the blood is made
                    to pass from the small arteries into these convoluted veins, is not clearly
                    understood. Professer Müller<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Archiv, fur Physiol-íçc- 1635. pp. 27 and 220.</p></note>
                    has lately discovered a remarkable set of minute dilated and ramified branches,
                    which he terms <hi rend="italic">arteriachelicinae,</hi> and which are appended
                    to the terminal twigs of the arteries distributed on the sides and interspaces
                    of the venous cavities in the penis of man and several animals, and which he
                    represents as projecting into the interior of the veins, and pouring their blood
                    into them; a mechanism which must doubtless have some direct relation with the
                    process of erection. Dr. Houston<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Duhlin Hospital Reports, vol. v∙</p></note> has described
                    some muscles, under the name of <hi rend="italic">compressores</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">venae dorsalis penis,</hi> to the contraction of which, and the
                    consequent impediment to the return of the blood from the penis, he attributes
                    the erection of that organ. It is more probable, however, that this effect is
                    produced principally by an altered action of the blood-vessels themselves, and
                    is analogous to the turgid state of the vessels which occurs in blushing, than
                    is owing to any mechanical cause. The purpose served by the dilatation,
                    elongation, and rigidity of the male organ, effected by this vascular action, is
                    obviously that of enabling it to penetrate to a sufficient distance into the
                    female organs during coition, for the conveyance of the semen to those parts of
                    the latter whose office it is to carry it on to the ovulum which it is intended
                    to fecundate. With this view, the secretions from the testes, vesiculae
                    seminales, prostate gland, and the glands of Cowper, are poured together into
                    the bulb of the ure <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500044"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0044-0689"/>thra, and thence expelled with force by the action
                    of the muscles called the <hi rend="italic">ejaculatores</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >seminis.</hi></p>
                <p>(810.) The seminal fluid, which acts so important a part in the process of
                    generation, has at all times attracted much attention. It is found to be
                    considerably heavier than water, to have a peculiar odour, which increases on
                    keeping; to exhibit alkaline properties, and to give off ammonia when heated.
                    From the analysis of Vauquelin, it appears that human semen contains six per
                    cent, of animal mucus, three of phosphate of lime, and one of uncombined soda;
                    the rest being water. The phosphate of lime is deposited in crystals when the
                    fluid is at rest. But the most remarkable circumstance in its composition is,
                    the constant presence of an immense number of microscopic animalcules, the form,
                    appearances, and size of which are different in almost every different animal;
                    but in each species of the more perfect animals, the kind of animalcules, like
                    that of the entozoa, is constant and determinate. Lecuwenhoek claims the merit
                    of having first discovered them; but the priority of this discovery is assigned
                    by Haller to Ludwig Hamm, who, when a student at Leyden, is said to have
                    observed them in the year 1677. Another claimant of the discovery is
                    Hartsocker,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Essai de
                    Diορtrique, art. 88, p. 227∙</p></note> but apparently on no good grounds. An
                    account of the controversy that arose on this subject, is given by Dr.
                    Bostock.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Elementary
                    System of Physiology, p. 642, note.</p></note> Doubts were at one time
                    entertained of the fidelity of the representations of these singular beings
                    given by Lecuwenhoek; but they have been wholly removed by the later researches
                    of Spallanzani, and the still more recent inquiries of Prevost and Dumas. These
                    animalcules have a definite figure, consisting of a flattish rounded head, from
                    which proceeds a long tail, exhibiting constant un dulator y movements.
                    Theyareaccordingly classed by naturalists under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >spermatozoa,</hi> as a species of the genus <hi rend="italic">cercaria,</hi>
                    among the infusoria.</p>
                <p>(811.) It would appear from the elaborate researches of Prevost and Dumas, that
                    these spermatic animalcules are found, at one time or other, in the semen of
                    almostall the animals in which they have been sought for; but at that period of
                    their life, and in that season of the year only, when the animals in which they
                    exist are fit for procreation. They are almost always present in the fluid
                    secreted by the testicles, and very often in that of the vesiculae seminales,
                    into which they have doubtless been introduced along with the fluid derived from
                    the testicles. Hence it has been concluded, that their presence is intimately
                    connected with the power of propagation; and may even be essential to that
                    process. Wagner infers from his observations, that these animalcules are subject
                    to remarkable changes of form at different periods, and that they even go
                    through a regular gradation of developement; and phenomena leading to the same
                    conclusion have been observed by Dr. Allen Thomson.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology, art.

                <p>(812.) It is not until the period of puberty that the generative organs are fully
                    developed, and become capable in either sex, of exercising their proper
                    functions. Prior to this period, the physical character of the two sexes is
                    nearly the same: there is the same delicacy of complexion, the same high pitch
                    of the voice, and the same slightness of figure. But the developement of the
                    sexual organs appears to exercise a peculiar and specific influence over the
                    system at large, affecting the growth of the rest of the frame, and modifying
                    both its physical and mental powers. The attainment of this condition is more
                    tardy, by two or three years, in the male than in the female; and the age at
                    which it takes place, differs in different climates, and in persons of different
                    temperaments, modes of life, and circumstances of physical and moral education.
                    It occurs at an earlier age in southern than in northern climates; in this
                    country generally appearing in the male between the ages of fifteen and eighteen
                    years; and in the female from that of thirteen to sixteen; but in the hottest
                    regions of the great continents, girls are said to arrive at puberty at ten, or
                    even at nine years of age; and in the northernmost parts of Europe, not till
                    that of from fifteen to eighteen. The arrival of this period is retarded by
                    habits of active bodily exertion.</p>
                <p>(813.) The characteristic changes induced by puberty in the male besides the
                    developement of the genitals, and the secretion of the seminal fluid, are the
                    enlargement of the larynx, which changes the quality of the voice; the growth of
                    the beard on the chin, upper lip, and cheek, and of an increased quantity of
                    hair on the rest of the body, and especially on the pubes; the enlargement of
                    the chest and shoulders; an increase of physical activity and power; a greater
                    capability of enduring fatigue; an exaltation of the active powers of the mind,
                    and of the qualities of courage and resolution.</p>
                <p>(814.) The act of sexual union is prompted by instinctive feelings, experienced
                    by both sexes, and which generally depend on the condition of the body, and of
                    the genital organs in particular, which are then in a state of high excitement.
                    This mental feeling, and the local affection appear to be intimately associated
                    together, and mutually produce one another. According to the doctrines of
                    phrenology, the cerebellum is supposed to be that particular part of the
                    encephalon which presides over the sexual function; and to be, in a word, the
                    sensorium commune of the feelings relating to it; that is, the part to which
                    impressions of a sexual kind proceed, and from which all sexual desire emanates;
                    and to be the source of that power by which the generative organs execute their
                    appropriate functions. Dr. Allen Thomson, after enumerating the proofs alleged
                    in favour of this hypothesis,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Cyclopaedia, &amp;c. p. 444.</p></note> observes, that he is
                    not inclined to adopt it as established on sufficiently accurate and extensive
                    data; and remarks, that the comparative anatomy of the brain, (in which, rather
                    than in experiments on animals, he would be disposed to place much reliance,
                    from the acknowledged difficulty of making correct deductions as to function,
                    from the effects of morbid alteration or artificial injury of the encephalon,)
                    affords very few arguments in favour of the phrenological doctrine, and
                    furnishes several facts which militate strongly against it. (See the article <hi

                    rend="italic">The Female System.</hi></p>
                <p>(815.) The female generative system of organs, having to perform the offices of
                    receiving, conducting, and applying to the ovulum the seminal fluid, of
                    conveying the ovum into a situation where it can be evolved and properly
                    nourished, and of bringing it forth at the appointed period into the world, is
                    necessarily much more complicated and elaborate than the male system. The part
                    performed by the male is quickly accomplished, while the female has to execute a
                    long series of processes, which require a considerable time, and are connected
                    with important changes in the economy.</p>
                <p>(816.) The ovaria, of which we have already described the structure and offices,
                    are connected with a hollow muscular organ, termed the <hi rend="italic">uterus,

                    enclosed in the folds of the peritoneum which form the broad ligaments of the

                <p>(817.) The uterus itself is a compact, dense, membranous, and fleshy organ,
                    provided with a copious supply of bloodvessels, lymphatics, and nerves. It has
                    the shape of a flattened pear, and is situated in the pelvis, between the rectum
                    and the urinary bladder. The outer surface of the uterus is covered with a
                    reflected portion of the peritoneum, which, in passing from the sides of the

                    have been called. It is also provided with round ligaments, connecting it with
                    the external parts of the pnbes. The inner surface of the uterus is lined with a
                    mucous membrane. The existence of muscular fibres in its substance has been
                    called in question by many anatomists, and it is certainly difficult to
                    demonstrate their presence; yet the extraordinary mechanical force which this
                    organ exerts during parturition can scarcely be ascribed to any power but a
                    muscular one.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr∙

                    >vagina,</hi> which is an elastic membranous canal, opening externally, and
                    surrounding at its upper part the cervix uteri, which forms a protuberance in

                <p>The membrane which lines the vaginal cavity is continued from the mucous membrane
                    of the uterus, but is thrown into numerous folds and wrinkles, admitting of
                    occasional dilatation of the canal. This is surrounded by a tissue, of an
                    erectile structure, termed <hi rend="italic">plexus</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    round, and spongy organ, which is analogous to the penis in its erectile
                    structure, being composed of two <hi rend="italic">corpora cavernosa,</hi>
                    arising from the tuberosities of the os ischii, and terminating in an impervious
                    glans, furnished with a prepuce. The <hi rend="italic">meatus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">urinarius,</hi> or orifice of the urethra, which in the female is
                    very short, opens immediately below the clitoris. From this part, on each side
                    of the fossa, extends the <hi rend="italic">nymphae,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >labia minora,</hi> which are membranous and spongy folds. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >vulva,</hi> or orifice of the os externum, is in part closed by a transverse
                    membrane, of a crescentic form, called the <hi rend="italic">hymen,</hi> the
                    remains of which, after it has been lacerated, compose the folds called <hi
                    rend="italic">carunculae myrtiformes.</hi></p>
                <p>(819·) The changes which the female system undergoes at the period of puberty are
                    on the whole as considerable as those of the male, although many of the external
                    characteristics of the state of childhood are still retained, such as the
                    delicate texture and inferior developement of the general frame, the large
                    proportion of subcutaneous fat, smooth skin, and want of prominence in the
                    muscles of the trunk and limbs. But the genital system undergoes a considerable
                    and rapid developement at this period, the breasts enlarge, the pelvis becomes
                    more capacious, and a peculiar periodical secretion, from the inner surface of
                    the uterus, consisting of a certain quantity of sanguineous fluid, is
                    established. This process, which is termed <hi rend="italic">menstruation,</hi>
                    recurs at periods nearly equal to a lunar month, and continues, with certain
                    intermissions, determined by the occurrence of pregnancy, and the performance of
                    the function of lactation, as long as the organs are capable of bearing progeny,
                    which is, on an average, a term of thirty years. The fluid thus discharged is
                    generally believed to contain less fibrin than blood, and to be less prone to
                    putrefaction; it evidently contains a large proportion of the colouring
                    particles of the blood, and is very seldom found to coagulate. The secretion
                    amounts, on an average, to six or eight ounces, and usually continues for about
                    four or five days, beginning and leaving oft* gradually, and being most abundant
                    towards the middle of the period. The discharge in general takes place slowly,
                    or drop by drop.</p>
                <p>(820.) The effectual fecundation of the <hi rend="italic">ovulum,</hi> which is
                    by this change converted into an <hi rend="italic">ovum,</hi> and its removal to
                    a situation where the <hi rend="italic">embryo,</hi> then first brought into
                    existence, can be perfectly developed, constitute the process of <hi
                    rend="italic">conceptionς</hi> but the exact nature of this process, as well as
                    the precise circumstances which must concur for its successful accomplishment,
                    have been but very imperfectly ascertained. The investigatioh of these phenomena
                    in the lower animals, however, has rendered it extremely probable that Graafian
                    vesicles are continually being produced in the ovarium, and come forwards at
                    intervals, during the whole period of female fertility, and that they burst in
                    succession, and shed the contained ovula, whether sexual intercourse take place
                    or not, although there is reason to believe that their maturity is hastened by
                    this act. The consequence of the bursting of one of these vesicles is the escape
                    of the ovulum or ovum, as the case may be, and its passage down the Fallopian
                    tube into the cavity of the uterus. The lacerated membrane of the vesicle
                    closes, leaving a scar; the internal coat becomes thickened, and a yellow
                    substance is deposited in its cavity, giving rise to the appearance which has
                    been termed a <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">luteum.</hi> The
                    presence of this substance is a certain indication of the previous bursting of a
                    Graafian vesicle.</p>
                <p>(821.) Much discussion has arisen on the question as to the precise time when,
                    and place where, theovulum is impregnated. There seems now, however, little
                    reason to doubt that the semen, immediately on its reception into the uterus, is
                    conveyed by the Fallopian tubes to the ovarium itself, and then comes in contact
                    with the exposed ovulum, which is ready for fecundation. On the bursting of the
                    vesicle, the ovum is conveyed down the Fallopian tube, and arrives at the
                    uterus, where the changes it next undergoes will be the subject of future
                    inquiry.</p>

                    Generation.</hi></p>
                <p>(822.) Having thus stated the provisions which have been made by nature for the
                    fecundation of the ovulum, by the concurrent offices of the two sexes, we may
                    here examine various speculations and opinions which, from time to time, have
                    been entertained relative to the nature of this marvellous and mysterious
                    process; speculations which, although for the most part exceedingly
                    hypothetical, and often completely visionary, have been dignified with the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">theories of generation.</hi> This it is our
                    intention to do very briefly, and to notice only the more important of these
                    theories; for the total number of hypotheses which have been advanced on this
                    subject is so great, that their mere enumeration might occupy many pages.
                    Drelincourt, who lived in the latter part of the seventeenth century, collected
                    from the writings of his predecessors as many as two hundred and sixty-two
                    “groundless hypotheses” concerning generation; and “nothing is more certain,”
                    observes Blumenbach, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500070"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0070-0691"/>“that Drelincourt’s own theory formed the two
                    hundred and sixty-third”</p>
                <p>(823.) These theories may be arranged according as they relate to the action of
                    the parent organs, or to the changes in the egg occurring during the formation
                    of the new animal; and Haller divided the first of these classes into three
                    divisions, according as the offspring is supposed to proceed; first, exclusively
                    from the organs of the male parent, which is the theory of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spermatists;</hi> or, secondly, entirely from those of the female, which is
                    that of the <hi rend="italic">Ovists</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or, thirdly,
                    from the union of the male and female products, which is the theory of <hi
                    rend="italic">Syngenesis.</hi> The second class, again, may be arranged under
                    two heads, according as the new animal is supposed, first, to have its parts
                    rendered visible, by their being expanded, unfolded, or evolved from a
                    previously existing though imperceptible condition of the germ, which is the
                    theory of <hi rend="italic">evolution</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or sècondly,
                    to be newly formed from amorphous materials at the time when it makes its
                    appearance in the ovum, which constitutes the theory of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epigenesis.</hi></p>
                <p>(824.) The theory of the <hi rend="italic">Spermatists</hi> regarded the male
                    semen as furnishing all the vital parts of the new animal, the female organs
                    merely affording the offspring a fit receptacle and suitable materials for its
                    nourishment, until it could exist by the independent exercise of its own
                    functions. One of the earliest supporters of this hypothesis was Galen; but its
                    modern revival dates from the period of the discovery of the seminal
                    animalcules, which were regarded by Leewenhoek as the proper rudiments of the
                    foetus. They were even considered by some to be miniature representations of
                    men, and were styled <hi rend="italic">homunculi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    one author going so far as to delineate in each, the body, limbs, features, and
                    all the parts of the grown human body. Even Leewenhoek describes minutely the
                    manner in which they gain the interior of the ovum, and are retained after their
                    entrance by a valvular apparatus.</p>
                <p>(825.) The Ovists, comprising some of the older philosophers, such as Pythagoras
                    and Aristotle, maintained that the female parent affords all the materials
                    necessary for the formation of the offspring, the office of the male being
                    merely to awaken the dormant formative powers residing in the female products.
                    Malpighi and Harvey asserted that the rudiments of the foetus are derived
                    principally from the female ovum; an opinion which was also elaborately defended
                    by Vallisneri.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Della
                    Generazione, part 2.</p></note></p>
                <p>(826.) The theory of <hi rend="italic">Syngenesis,</hi> or of the simultaneous
                    combination of products derived from both sexes, which after sexual intercourse,
                    are supposed to unite together to form the germ, is also of very ancient date.
                    In connexion with this theory may be mentioned that modification of it which may
                    be termed the theory of <hi rend="italic">metamorphosis,</hi> according to which
                    a formative substance is held to exist, but is allowed to change its form, in
                    order to be converted into the new being; as also the hypothesis of Buffon,
                    which was eagerly adopted by Needham, who conceived that certain molecules which
                    they termed <hi rend="italic">organic,</hi> and which they believed universally
                    to pervade plants and animals, were all endowed with productive powers, which
                    enabled them, when placed in suitable situations, to attract one another, and to
                    compose by their union living organized bodies. They imagined, that in the
                    process of generation the superabundant portion of these organic molecules were
                    accumulated in the generative organs, and there constituted the rudiments of the
                    offspring.</p>
                <p>(827∙) The hypothesis of <hi rend="italic">evolution,</hi> or of pre-existing
                    germs, coincides with that of the Ovists, in considering the foetus as solely
                    the production of the female; but it farther assumes that it already exists,
                    with all its organs, in some part of the female system, previous to the sexual
                    intercourse; and that it receives no proper addition from the male semen, the
                    action of which is merely that of exciting the powers of the foetus, and of
                    endowing it with vitality. The observations of Haller with respect to the
                    gradual enlargement or evolution of the chick during the process of incubation,
                    were conceived to lend great support to the advocates of this theory, of whom
                    the most strenuous and enthusiastic was Bonnet. This naturalist, so celebrated
                    for the boldness of his speculations, contended, not only that the whole of the
                    parts of the foetus pre-cxist in the ovum, before they actually make their
                    appearance, but that the germs of all the animals which are in future to be
                    born, also pre-exist in the female parent; so that the ovaries of the first
                    parents of any species of animal, contained the germs of all their posterity,
                    included the one within the other, like a nest of boxes; from which comparison
                    he termed his theory that of “<hi rend="italic">emboitement?</hi> This
                    extravagant notion was adopted by many physiologists, principally from its
                    affording.some kind of explanation of what no other theory seemed in the least
                    adequate to solve. Spallanzani, in particular, was a zealous defender of the
                    hypothesis of pre-existing germs. It appears, however, to be totally
                    irreconcileable with the phenomena of hybrid productions, and of the resemblance
                    which, in so many instances, the offspring bears to its male parent.</p>
                <p>(828.) We have already mentioned that Harvey and Malpighi ascribed the formation
                    of the foetus principally to the powers of the female. This opinion gave origin
                    to the modern theory of <hi rend="italic">Epigenesis,</hi> first clearly
                    promulgated by Caspar Frederick Wolff,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In his inaugural dissertation, entitled Theoria
                    Generationis, published at Berlin in 1759.</p></note> who not only described a
                    successive production of organs, of the previous formation of which there
                    existed no trace; but showed also, that after parts are first formed, they
                    undergo many important changes in their shape and structure, before arriving at
                    their finished state. The more recent researches, aided by delicate
                    microscopical observation, of Meckel, Pander, Baer, Rathke, Oken, Purkinje, and
                    Valentin; Serres, Rolando, Dutrochet, Prevost and Dumas, Coste, and others, have
                    demonstrated that the theory of Epigenesis, or superformation of parts, is much
                    more consistent with the observed phenomena than that of evolution. The facts
                    which have thus been brought to light, are of peculiar interest with reference
                    to the plans of nature, into which they give us a more extended insight, by
                    exhibiting new and unexpected affinities between remote families and classes of
                    animals; by showing that at one period the type of their formation is nearly the
                    same, and by explaining the seeming caprice of nature in instances of monstrous
                    and defective formation. But to attempt adducing the proofs and illustrations of
                    these positions, would engage us into details requiring an extensive survey of
                    the whole animal creation, to enter into which would occupy more space than is
                    compatible with the limits of the present treatise. We must, therefore, content

                    have traced it in a preceding chapter, the first object of nature is to effect
                    its attachment to a portion of the inner surface of that organ. A provision for
                    this purpose has already been made, even while the ovum was contained in the
                    ovarium. A vesicle, first noticed and described by Dr. Barry, is formed around
                    the ovum; the granules of the <hi rend="italic">tunica granulosa</hi> become
                    less densely aggregated<pb break="no" facs="nls:193500083"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0083-0692"/> together, and gradually pass into the state of
                    fluid albumen; oil globules appearing for the first time to take their place on
                    the surface of the ovum. This fluid he supposes to correspond to the yolk of the
                    eggs of birds; and the membranous vesicle above mentioned, in which it is
                    enclosed, and which thus forms after impregnation, he considers as the
                    rudimental chorion, by which the ovum is afterwards attached to the uterus.</p>
                <p>(830.) It results from these views, that mammalia differ from oviparous animals
                    in the circumstance, that those parts of their ovum which are last formed, have
                    a more internal origin; thus, the first portion of the albumen and the chorion
                    of the ovum in mammalia, originate, not in the oviduct, but in the ovary; for
                    which purpose, chiefly, there is provided the very large quantity of albuminous
                    fluid in the Graafian vesicle; a provision which may be presumed to have
                    especial reference to the developement of the embryo within the body of the
                    mother. The chorion, being formed in the ovary, it is an <hi rend="italic"
                    >ovum,</hi> and not an <hi rend="italic">ovulum,</hi> that is expelled from that
                    organ in mammalia. On the other hand, in birds it is an <hi rend="italic"
                    >ovulum,</hi> and not an <hi rend="italic">ovum,</hi> that leaves their ovary;
                    and it becomes an ovum, and receives an addition of the albumen, or yolk, and
                    the shell membrane in their oviduct, and then becomes analagous in all its parts
                    to the ovum of the mammal when the latter leaves the ovarium. The albumen, in
                    the form of granules, lines the ovisac, constituting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">granulosa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in
                    the form of the <hi rend="italic">flake</hi> it supports the ovulum in the
                    centre of the fluid of the ovisac, and afterwards supports it at the periphery
                    of the latter, sometimes in the form of the <hi rend="italic">perasiolus
                    granulosus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cumulus</hi> of Baer. It closely invests
                    the ovulum in the form of the <hi rend="italic">tunica granulosa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> it forms, in the rabbit at least, and probably in other
                    mammalia, two bands or ligaments, termed the <hi rend="italic">chalazae,</hi>
                    which are conspicuous in birds; and finally, it also provides the granulous
                    bands by which, in some instances, too sudden a discharge of the ovum of the
                    Graafian vesicle is prevented.</p>
                <p>(831.) Dr. Barry finds that the ova of the rabbit of five or six days, when in
                    the uterus, are in bulk about eight thousand times that of the ovulum in the
                    ovary, and have three concentric membranes; namely, first, an outer vesicle,
                    (the villous chorion,) originating in the ovary; secondly, the primitive
                    membrane of the yolk, distended so as to fill the chorion; and, thirdly, an
                    inner vesicle, or membrane, which has been called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >blastoderma,</hi> or germinal membrane, presenting in its substance a central
                    spot, which is the germinal spot, or <hi rend="italic">embryo.</hi> Dr. Allen
                    Thomson has seen this spot very evident in the ova of a rabbit, on the sixth day
                    after impregnation. It corresponds exactly with the part called the <hi
                    rend="italic">cicatricula</hi> in the egg of a bird, which there lies
                    immediately on the surface of the yolk, imbedded in a disc of granules. In the
                    centre of the cicatricula, a dark round spot is seen, termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">colliquamentum,</hi> which contains a minute vesicle, discovered
                    by Purkinje, and which bears his name. This vesicle, which is seen in the
                    ovulum, afterwards bursts, and leaves in its place a thin and tender transparent
                    membrane. In the centre of this transparent spot, may be perceived, seven or
                    eight hours after the commencement of incubation, with’ the aid of a magnifying
                    glass, a small dark line. This line, or <hi rend="italic">primitive trace,</hi>
                    as it has been termed, is swollen at one extremity, and is placed in the
                    direction of the transverse axis of the egg. The rounded end is towards the
                    left, when the small end of the egg is turned from us.</p>
                <p>(832.) Having traced thus far the changes occurring in the ovum before it becomes
                    attached to the uterus, we shall defer the consideration of the subsequent
                    stages of its evolution to a future section, and here attend to the changes
                    which have in the mean time taken place in the uterus, with a view to prepare it
                    for the office it has now to perform.</p>
                <p>(833.) A change has already taken place in the uterus, preparatory to the
                    reception of the ovum, and before its arrival in that cavity. An increased flow
                    of blood is directed towards that organ. A substance consisting of lymph, or
                    organizable fibrin, exudes from its interior surface, furnishing it with a soft
                    flaky lining, which, when the ovum is received, is reflected over that body, so
                    as to give it a double covering. These two folds, the one being in contact with
                    the uterus, and the other with the ovum, constitute the two layers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">decidua</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the former portion being termed the <hi rend="italic">decidua vera,</hi>
                    and the latter, the <hi rend="italic">decidua</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >reflexa.</hi> This membrane soon becomes organized, and highly vascular. The
                    vessels in the progress of growth, are in some parts much dilated, so as to form
                    sinuses, which are ultimately intermingled, though by no means continuous, with
                    the blood-vessels of the foetus. These latter bloodvessels, consisting of the
                    umbilical arteries and veins, of which the trunks are collected in the umbilical
                    cord, have passed to the chorion, which by the end of the first, and during the
                    second month of pregnancy, has acquired a villous external surface. At the end
                    of this period, the branches of these vessels penetrate and ramify in these
                    villi, which become thoroughly vascular; and this thickening and vascularity is
                    concentrated on one side of the chorion, generally on that which is adjacent to
                    the fundus of the uterus, forming the body called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >placenta.</hi> This body is of a flattened oval shape, from six to eight inches
                    in breadth, and from an inch to an inch and a quarter in thickness at the middle
                    part, becoming thinner towards the edges. It occupies about a fourth part of the
                    chorion, and at birth is about a pound in weight. In ruminant quadrupeds, the
                    substance corresponding to the human placenta, is confined to a number of
                    circular and spongy elevations, varying in number from thirty to one hundred,
                    which are termed <hi rend="italic">cotyledons.</hi> The human placenta is
                    evidently formed of a structure essentially the same, composed of many lobes
                    consolidated by contact into one organ. It has been very generally supposed that
                    the placenta is of a cellular structure, and that the artcries and veins of the
                    uterus communicate with its cells; but the late researches of Dr. Robert
                    Lee,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Philosophical
                    Transactions for 1832.</p></note> renders it very doubtful if these
                    inter-placental cells really exist.</p>
                <p>(834.) In proportion as the foetus grows, the uterus enlarges, and about the
                    fifth month it rises out of the pelvis, and rests against the front of the
                    abdomen. As it enlarges, the distinction between the body and the cervix is
                    lost; the os tincae is flattened, and forms only a small rugous hole, not easily
                    discernible; and it is closed by a tough glutinous matter, which is fixed in the
                    irregularities of the surface.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VII.— <hi rend="italic">Parturition.</hi></p>
                <p>(835.) The ordinary period of utero-gestation is forty weeks; on the expiration
                    of which the uterus takes on itself a new kind of action; its contractility,
                    which had lain dormant for so long a time, is now suddenly and powerfully
                    excited. A mucous discharge takes place from the vagina, the external passage is
                    relaxed, and slight pains are felt in the back and loins, which usher in the
                    real pains of labour. These are occasioned by powerful contraction of the
                    uterus, accompanied by a strong action of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles;
                    and they are repeated at short intervals. Impelled by this pressure, the
                    membranes of the foetus project into the vagina, and dilate the os tincae; on
                    their bursting, the liquor amnii escapes, and at the next pain the pressure of
                    the uterus falls directly on the foetus. The head of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193500096" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0096-0693"/>foetus gradually descends,
                    urged on by succeeding spasms, the occiput foremost, the long axis of the head
                    being disposed obliquely across the lesser basin of the pelvis. The occiput, as
                    the external parts yield, glides off the inclined surface of the ischium,
                    presenting at the orifice of the vulva, and bringing at the same time the long
                    diameter of the shoulders to correspond with the greatest breadth of the pelvis,
                    and the head being thus disengaged, the trunk follows. After a short time, fresh
                    pains return, and the placenta and membranes being detached from the uterus,
                    comes away. In the majority of natural births, labour is completed in from four
                    to six hours. The uterus then very slowly and insensibly contracts, so as to
                    diminish the ample cavity which has been rendered vacant, and at the same time
                    its volume is reduced by absorption. During the return of the uterus to its
                    former state, a discharge, at first tinged with blood, and afterwards of a
                    whitish colour, termed the <hi rend="italic">lochia,</hi> ensues, which lasts
                    for several days.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    above account of parturition is for the most part extracted from Mr. Mayo’s
                    Outlines of Human Physiology, as presenting a very clear and compendious account
                    of the phenomena.</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VI∏— <hi

                <p>(836.) The function by which nourishment is prepared, of a nature suited to the
                    early periods of infant life, belongs to the reproductive class of functions.
                    The fluid provided for this purpose is the <hi rend="italic">Milk,</hi> of which
                    we have already examined the chemical properties, and noticed the qualities
                    which peculiarly fit it for the purpose it is intended to serve. The organs
                    which prepare it are the <hi rend="italic">mammae,</hi> which are glands
                    consisting of the union of a great number of lobes, intermixed with adipose
                    substance, and remarkable for the whiteness and fineness of their texture. The
                    numerous excretory tubes from these lobules unite in forming ducts, which open
                    separately in the folds of the integuments of the nipple. A remarkable sympathy
                    is observed between this gland and the uterus; for it often enlarges and becomes
                    tender for a few days before each monthly period. It enlarges during the latter
                    months of pregnancy, and the brown circle surrounding the nipple, or <hi
                    rend="italic">areola,</hi> as it is called, assumes a darker colour. The
                    secretion of milk would naturally continue until the middle of the second year,
                    if the child were retained at the breast as long as it was supplied. During the
                    period of suckling, the menstrual discharge is not renewed, but pregnancy may,
                    however, again take place, before its recurrence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IX.— <hi rend="italic">Fatal Evolution.</hi></p>
                <p>(837.) In judging of the changes which take place in the human embryo from the
                    period when its evolution commences, we must be guided principally by those
                    which, occurring in the developement of that of the chick, furnish the best
                    means of following the whole succession of pheno-ena. Commencing the inquiry,
                    then, from the appearance of the primitive trace in the blastoderma, or
                    cicatricula, already described, (§ 831,) we find this part gradually dilating in
                    bulk, and occupying a situation between the two layers, namely, the outer and
                    the inner, into which, towards the twelfth or fourteenth hour of incubation,
                    this cicatricula has divided itself. The outer of these layers is called by
                    Pander the <hi rend="italic">serous layer</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it
                    subsequently gives rise to the nervous, the muscular, the osseous,
                    cartilaginous, and tegumentary systems of the body. The innermost, which is
                    situated in contact with the yolk, is the <hi rend="italic">mucous lay er,</hi>
                    whence are derived the alimentary canal, and the glandular and pulmonary
                    systems. A third layer, (the <hi rend="italic">vascular layer,}</hi> is
                    afterwards formed in the interval between the two former, and is the origin of
                    the sanguiferous system of the foetus, including the heart and all the
                    blood-vessels. The respiratory system is the product of the combined changes
                    which this, together with the last mentioned layer, undergoes.</p>
                <p>(838.) Theseries of phenomena which present themselves in following the
                    succession of changes occurring during the formation of the vital organs, are
                    highly curious, and afford the most splendid instances of that refined
                    intelligence and that provident adjustment of a long series of means for the
                    effectual accomplishment of future and lar distant ends, which strike us with
                    profound astonishment when we penetrate'into the remoter regions of physiology,
                    removed from ordinary observation. It would far exceed the limits within which
                    we must confine ourselves in the present treatise, to give the detailed history
                    of these organic changes. We must content ourselves, therefore, with a brief
                    outline of the principal phenomena, and with referring to works professedly
                    treating on this subject, for more copious information on this highly curious
                    department of physiology.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Outlines of Human Physiology, chap, xv∙ sect. ii. We would also beg to refer to

                    Physiology, vol. ii. p. 599. The greater part of the summary given in the
                    present article is abridged from Mr. Mayo’s work.</p></note></p>
                <p>(839∙) On the outer surface of the serous layer, or that most distant from the
                    yolk, there are raised two parallel ridges, which, joining along theirupper
                    margins,form acanal; in this canal, according to Baer and Serres, a semi-fluid
                    matter is deposited; this matter, acquiring consistence, becomes the spinal
                    chord, with a pyriform extremity, which last is the rudiment of the future head.
                    Roland, Prevost, and Dumas, on the other hand, suppose that the primitive trace
                    is itself the spinal cord and brain, in their rndimental state.</p>
                <p>(840.) When the layers of the germinal membrane have so far expanded as to cover
                    nearly one-third of the yolk, they no longer retain their flat and uniform
                    appearance, but begin to exhibit various folds, which afterwards become the
                    different cavities of the body. Those of the mucous layer turn downwards, and
                    whilst its remote expansion includes within it the yolk, as in a sac, the inner
                    folds close inwards, and by the union of their margins form two tubular
                    cavities, one at each end of the embryo, communicating in the middle with each
                    other, and also, by a common opening, with the cavity of the yolk. This tube is
                    the nascent alimentary canal.</p>
                <p>(841.) The first rudiment of the heart is perceptible at the anterior part of the
                    vascular layer, which, as we have already stated, is developed between the
                    serous and mucous layers. In the mean time, the surrounding disc of the
                    cicatricula, which continues to expand, exhibits, in the circumference of the
                    transparent area, which now becomes thicker and more spongy, numerous irregular
                    points and lines of a dark yellow colour. These lines gradually extend, unite
                    together, first into small groups, and then into one net-work, which composes
                    the <hi rend="italic">vascular area.</hi> The space they occupy is terminated,
                    on each side, by a circular vessel, of larger size than the rest, the <hi
                    rend="italic">sinus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >terminalis,</hi> into which the smaller ramifications of the vessels open at
                    the circumference, whilst towards the central part they unite into a vessel on
                    each side, the two <hi rend="italic">omphalo-museraic arteries,</hi> which
                    penetrate into the vascular layer of the embryo.</p>
                <p>(842.) Simultaneously with these changes, all the important organs of the body
                    are formed in rapid succession. The spinal cord and brain, of which we have
                    noticed the first traces, are quickly developed; the former, appearing first as
                    a membranous tube, the latter, as three vesicular bodies; and both being
                    gradually filled with opaque nervous substances of two kinds, the one being
                    uniform, the other filamentous. The nerves next appear, but whether they are
                    generally formed in their entire length at once, or are <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193500109" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0109-0694"/>growths from the brain or
                    spinal cord, or are first produced at their farthest extremity, and afterwards
                    extended towards the central organ, are points not yet determined. Some,
                    however, as the optic, auditory, and olfactory nerves, are certainly productions
                    from the cerebrum. The muscles become visible in the human embryo at the third
                    month; they are then soft and gelatinous, transparent, of a light yellow tint,
                    and not distinguishable from their tendons. Each muscle is formed at once in its
                    whole length, with its attachments perfect. The eyes are formed at a very early
                    period, and their growth is rapid; they are situated at first at the sides of
                    the head, as in quadrupeds, and subsequently move forwards. The iris has no
                    central aperture, the place of the pupil being occupied by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >membrana pupillaris,</hi> which disappears completely before birth. The organ
                    of hearing is formed soon after the eye. The substance of the bones is at first
                    an homogeneous jelly, enclosed in a membrane, and exhibiting no divisions into
                    joints. This jelly gradually becomes cartilaginous, the conversion taking place
                    from the surface inwards. It is gradually replaced by ossifié matter, which
                    grows from the interior, resembling a process of crystallization. Ossification
                    begins in the human embryo in the seventh week.</p>
                <p>(843.) The integument is the outermost foetal product of the serous layer, which
                    gradually spreads like a mantle over all the other structures, and does not
                    acquire proper strength till the middle of the foetal period. At the end of the
                    fifth month the body is covered with short, whitish, and silky down, which,
                    however, disappears in the seventh month. The hair of the head and of the
                    eye-brows, and the nails, are formed in the sixth month. About the fifth month
                    there appears on the body a yellowish-white greasy substance, at first thinly,
                    and afterwards more thickly spread, and termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vernix</hi><hi rend="italic">caseosa.</hi> The limbs are formed originally
                    below the skin, which they reach, pushing out like little globular shoots, in
                    the sixth week. They originally grow straight out from the trunk. The upper arm
                    is next laid against the breast, the fore-arm drawn upwards; the thigh is bent
                    up to the belly, the leg drawn backwards towards the thigh, and the feet turned
                    in, and crossed, with the soles turned inwards. When the fingers are first
                    formed, they are contained in a common mitten of skin, which, gradually becoming
                    thinner between them, forms a web, which is finally absorbed.</p>
                <p>(844.) Another product of the serous layer is one still more external than the
                    integument of the foetus, and consisting of a sac formed by a membrane reflected
                    from the sides and from either extremity of the embryo, so as to enclose a space
                    behind its body, This is the <hi rend="italic">amnios,</hi> which forms a loose
                    bag filled with a liquid <hi rend="italic">(the liquor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >amnii)</hi> in which the foetus floats, suspended by the umbilical cord. As the
                    walls of the trunk close in front, the circular edge by which the amnios is
                    attached to the body of the embryo becomes proportionably contracted; and it is
                    finally limited to the umbilical opening, hereafter to be noticed.</p>
                <p>T he communication which we described as being left between the intestinal tube
                    and the cavity of the yolk bag, or <hi rend="italic">vitelline sac,</hi> and
                    which in birds continues open, soon becomes closed in mammalia, the sac assuming
                    the form of the <hi rend="italic">intestinal vesicle,</hi> discovered as such by
                    Bojanus in the ovum of the sheep; though it had been before seen and known by
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">vesicula</hi><hi rend="italic">alba</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> it disappears by the third month.</p>
                <p>(845.) The glandular organs which communicate with the alimentary canal are
                    formed by the extension of its mucous membrane in the form of tubular
                    productions, shooting into small masses of matter lodged in its neighbourhood;
                    the blind ends of the tubes being often dilated into spherical pouches. The gall
                    bladder is, in like manner, formed by the extension of a tube, which not being
                    received into a mass of elementary matter, enlarges into a simple sac.</p>
                <p>(846.) The lungs are regarded as another expansion of the mucous layer of the
                    germinal membrane, growing from the back part of the oesophagus, and gradually
                    advancing on either side of the aorta, so as at length to surround it.</p>
                <p>(847.) The kidneys are preceded in the embryo by a substance first noticed by
                    Wolff, and called after him the <hi rend="italic">Wolffian bodies,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">false kidneys,</hi> which originally extend the whole length of
                    the spine, from the heart to the end of the intestines; but they become
                    afterwards shorter, and, after a time, diminishing by absorption, wholly
                    disappear. They appear to be subservient to the developement both of the true
                    kidneys and of the testes and ovaria. The bladder and urethra, on the other
                    hand, together with the external genitals, are formed partly out of a
                    developement of the extremity of the intestine, and partly by fissure and
                    folding of the integument, in the following manner.</p>
                <p>(848.) There is first the production of a bag of considerable length, called the
                    <hi rend="italic">allantois,</hi> from the intestine, or that part of it which
                    may be considered as the <hi rend="italic">cloaca</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    subsequent contractions of the sides of this sac, at different parts, next
                    divides it into two cavities, the proper allantois and the urinary bladder; and
                    the lower contraction is elongated into the canal of the urethra. The separation
                    between the two former afterwards closes, and the coalesced membrane forms the
                    ligament termed the <hi rend="italic">urachus.</hi> The urethral tube never
                    closes.</p>
                <p>(849∙) The testes and ovaries appear in mammalia about the same time at the inner
                    and fore part of the Wolffian bodies, attached to them by a fold of the
                    peritoneum. From each testis or ovary there descends to the internal ring a
                    membranous process, which in the male is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gubernaculum,</hi> and in the female constitutes the <hi rend="italic">round
                    ligament.</hi> It passes, in either sex, along the spermatic passage to the
                    filamentous tissue of the scrotum or labium. The ovaries descend to the brim of
                    the pelvis; the testes pass through the ring into the scrotum.</p>
                <p>(850.) Every organ begins to be formed without either blood, or blood-vessels;
                    the circulation in them being established solely for the purpose of subsequent
                    growth and perfection. Even the heart is formed and shaped, and its texture has
                    acquired some degree of consistency, and it displays an undulatory motion,
                    before the blood has reached it. We have already described the formation of
                    vessels and of blood in the vascular area; but the blood is at first motionless.
                    It afterwards finds its way from thence by the omphalo-mesenteric veins to the
                    heart, whence it is expelled along the aorta, and thence again carried into the
                    vascular area; thus establishing a simple circulation. In a few days arterial
                    branches extend from the aorta, and venae cavae are formed, establishing the
                    systematic circulation. Five pair of branchial vessels are formed from the aorta
                    in the neck, the oesophagus being between the branches on each side, and there
                    are also four openings in the neck of the embryo on each side. This single
                    heart, branchial arches, and openings, are permanent parts of the structure in
                    fishes. In the mammalia, these branchial clefts soon close; the heart becomes
                    separated by the growth of partitions in each ventricle and auricle, into two
                    separate cavities, and the artery is divided, in like manner, into an aorta and
                    pulmonary artery. Some of the arches then disappear; others become permanent
                    aortic, and others permanent pulmonary branches; and the foetus is becoming
                    prepared for pulmonary respiration.</p>
                <p>(851.) The amnios, closing upon the shrunk urachus, forms with the umbilical
                    artery and veins, and a connecting gelatinous tissue, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >umbilical cord,</hi> or navel-string; connecting the foetus with the placenta,
                    which, as we have before seen, is formed by a thickened portion of the chorion.
                    The umbilical vein distributes part of its blood to the liver, and then, under
                    the name of the <hi rend="italic">ductus</hi><hi rend="italic">venosus,</hi>
                    joins the inferior cava, through which the mixed blood of the placenta<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193500122" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0122-0695"/> and of the
                    inferior part of the body is carried into the right auricle of the heart. Part
                    of this blood passes directly from the right to the left auricle through the <hi
                    rend="italic">foramen ovale,</hi> which is an aperture in the yet imperfect
                    septum of the auricles; the remainder, with the exception of the small quantity
                    transmitted to the yet imperfectly developed lungs, passes from the pulmonary
                    artery, through the <hi rend="italic">ductus arteriosus</hi> directly into the
                    aorta. The offices of the placenta are supposed to be those <hi rend="subscript"
                    > i</hi> first, of introducing nourishment, transmitted by imbibition from the
                    maternal to the foetal blood, through the membranes of the interjacent vessels
                    of the mother and the foetus; and, secondly, of oxygenating the blood of the
                    foetus by imparting to it oxygen from the same source. It has been supposed by
                    many that the foetus derives sustenance from the liquor amnii which surrounds
                    it, and which might be introduced through the mouth into the stomach; but this
                    opinion is now very generally abandoned. It is true, however, that the stomach
                    of the foetus usually contains a considerable quantity of ropy mucus, but
                    without albumen. This last substance is found in the contents of the
                    duodenum,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See a paper by
                    Dr. Robert Lee, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1829.</p></note> and the
                    great intestines contain a green matter termed <hi rend="italic">meconium,</hi>
                    which has the appearance of being the refuse of a kind of digestion. It has been
                    conjectured that the <hi rend="italic">thymus gland</hi> has some relation to
                    the function of foetal assimilation.</p>
                <p>CHAP. XIX. PROGRESSIVE CHANGES IN THE ANIMAL ECONOMY.</p>
                <p>(852.) We have now traced the history of the changes i which the human system
                    undergoes, from the earliest rudimental state in which it exists in the embryo,
                    through the period of its foetal life, to the epoch of its birth; when it is
                    ushered into the world, with organs fitted for maintaining a comparatively
                    independent existence, yet still requiring the most tender offices and most
                    fostering care of that parent, of whose system it had so long formed a part, and
                    from which it has been so recently dissevered. To follow the narrative of the
                    successive alterations which take place during the growth of the system, the
                    proportional developement of its several organs, and the acquisition of its
                    various powers, both corporeal and mental, during all the subsequent epochs,
                    filling up the interval between the cradle and the grave, composes a long
                    chapter in human physiology, and would occupy too large a space for the present
                    treatise. All that we can pretend to attempt must be a faint sketch of the
                    outlines of this “strange eventful history.”</p>
                <p>(853.) The greatest of all the changes which occur in the animal existence of
                    every human being, is its emergence from the state in which it was dependent for
                    its immediate supply of nourishment and of oxygen on the blood which is
                    circulating in the vessels of its parent. On its birth, which cuts off the
                    placental circulation, all these ties are at once dissevered. A new element
                    surrounds it, from which it is in future to derive the principle that maintains
                    its vital energies. The placental supply is superseded by respiration; and the
                    first gasp of air received by an instinctive effort into its lungs alters at
                    once the whole character of its organic constitution. It is now a breathing
                    animal; and all the channels and passages, which had till then been adaptôd to a
                    different mode of being, have now become useless, or rather worse than useless,
                    and they must give way to a new order of processes, and a new mechanism of the
                    hydraulic functions. The ductus venosus, the foramen ovale, and the ductus
                    arteriosus are superseded in their functions, and must be speedily closed and
                    obliterated, in order to give place to new courses of circulation and a new
                    order of functions.</p>
                <p>(854.) Besides these changes, which, being consequent on the sudden exercise of
                    the new function of respiration, are immediate, the whole organization rapidly
                    conforms itself to the great alteration of the circumstances in which it is now
                    placed. As the growth of the foetus had been progressively becoming more and
                    more rapid in proportion as the term approached when it was to be ushered into
                    the world; so, on the other hand, the growth of the body is greatest in the
                    earliest periods of its extra-uterine life, and becomes more and more slow in
                    proportion as it advances to the full dimensions it is destined to attain. The
                    principal anatomical changes which follow birth, besides those already stated,
                    are the gradual obliteration of the thymus gland, and of the renal capsules.</p>
                <p>(855.) The natural term of lactation is succeeded by that of teething; the first
                    set of teeth, or the <hi rend="italic">milk teeth,</hi> being furnished by
                    nature as temporary structures, until instruments of greater dimensions can be
                    constructed in the enlarged jaws. The appearance of the teeth is an intimation
                    that the organs of assimilation are prepared for the digestion of solid food;
                    and that the proper period for weaning is arrived.</p>
                <p>(856.) From this period an accurate observer may perceive that the intellectual
                    education keeps pace with the physical; whilst the active exercise of the limbs
                    consolidates the bones, and gives firmness to the muscles, that of the senses is
                    continually adding to the store of ideas, and calling forth the latent powers of
                    the understanding. The moral faculties are developed much earlier than is
                    generally imagined; and the future character of the individual often receives a
                    permanent impress from the events of infancy. No one can have watched its
                    varying aspect at this tender age, without recognising how early its affections
                    are called forth towards its protector and fosterer; how quick is the
                    distinction it makes between kind and unkind treatment, and how keen is its
                    sense of the least injustice which it may have either to bear or to witness.</p>
                <p>(857.) To the periods of infancy and childhood succeeds that of puberty, which we
                    have seen is attended in either sex with remarkable changes, both physical and
                    moral. During the period of increase the powers of assimilation are in full
                    activity in furnishing a sufficiency of materials for growth; the circulation is
                    vigorously employed in applying them to that purpose; and the supply is even
                    more abundant than the consumption. When, however, the fabric has attained its
                    prescribed dimensions, the total quantity of nourishment furnished and expended
                    being nearly balanced, the vital powers are chiefly exerted in consolidating and
                    perfecting the organization of every part, and qualifying them for the continued
                    exercise, during a long succession of years, of those functions of which we have
                    given the history in the preceding part of this treatise.</p>
                <p>(858.) But, in the mean time, the process of consolidation, begun from the
                    earliest period of developement, is still advancing, and is producing in the
                    fluids both greater thickness, and a diminution of’ their total quantity. By the
                    gradual conversion of their gelatin into albumen, all the textures acquire
                    increasing solidity; the cellular substance becomes firmer and more condensed,
                    and the solid structures more rigid and inelastic. The contractile power of the
                    muscles is also impaired; and the limbs no longer retain the elastic spring of
                    youth. All these progressive modifications of structure tend slowly, but
                    inevitably, to disqualify the organs for the due performance of their functions.
                    Their vascularity gradually diminishes; for a large proportion of the arteries
                    which had been actively employed in building the fabric, being now thrown out of
                    employment, contract, and, becoming impervious, disappear. The parts of the
                    body, having acquired greater rigidity, oppose a gradually increasing resistance
                    to the propelling force of the heart, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500135"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0135-0696"/>which is itself, in common with all the other
                    vital powers, slowly diminishing. The absorbents are now active in removing the
                    parts which have become useless or superfluous. Old age steals on by slow and
                    imperceptible degrees, which, even when obvious to others, are unknown to
                    ourselves. But nature kindly smooths the path along which we descend the vale of
                    years, and conducts us by easy stages to our destined place of repose. When
                    death is the simple consequence of old age, we may perceive that the extinction
                    of the powers of life observe an order the reverse of that which was followed in
                    their evolution. The sensorial functions, which were the last perfected, are the
                    first which decay; and their decline is found to commence with those mental
                    faculties more immediately dependent on the physical conditions of the
                    sensorium, and more especially with the memory, which is often much impaired
                    whilst the judgment remains in vigour. The heart, the pulsations of which gave
                    the first indications of life in the embryo, generally retains its vitality
                    longer than any other organ; but its powers being dependent on the constant
                    oxidation of the blood in the lungs, cannot survive the interruption of this
                    function, and on the heart ceasing to throb, the death of every part of the
                    system may then be considered as complete.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>CHAP. XX. TEMPERAMENTS.</p>
                <p>(859∙) In the natural and healthy condition of the system, all its functions are
                    nicely adjusted and proportioned to each other, so as to produce the most
                    perfect harmony. Yet within the limits of health variations are admissible in
                    this balance of functions, according as some predominate over others in regard
                    to energy and activity; or rather, according as there prevails a tendency to
                    such predominance, which, though it does not actually overset, may yet endanger
                    the preservation of that balance which constitutes health, and may thus give at
                    least a proneness to disease. This peculiar state of the system, depending on
                    the relation between its different capacities and functions, by which it
                    acquires a tendency to certain modes of action, is called its <hi rend="italic"
                    >Temperament.</hi></p>
                <p>(860.) Much attention was paid by the ancients to the subject of temperaments;
                    and the nomenclature they established to express the various combinations of
                    peculiarities in the constitution, corresponding with the definition above
                    given, has continued in general use even to the present day. They described four
                    temperaments, corresponding to the four qualities of hot, cold, moist, and dry,
                    ascribed to the human frame by Hippocrates, and which were supposed to confer
                    the specific characters to the four ingredients of which the blood was thought
                    to be composed; namely, the red part, the phlegm, the yellow, and the black bile
                    respectively; and hence were derived the names of the sanguine, the phlegmatic,
                    the choleric, and the melancholic temperaments, as indicating an excess of each
                    of these principles.</p>
                <p>(861.) In modern times the ancient doctrine of temperaments was adapted to the
                    humoral pathology, by which all the deviations from the standard of health were
                    attempted to be explained. Boerhaave, reasoning on these pinciples, and
                    considering the several temperaments as being formed by different combinations
                    of the four cardinal qualities, increased their number to the eight following:
                    namely, the warm, cold, moist, dry, bilious, sanguine, phlegmatic, and
                    atrabilious. Darwin, endeavouring to found his doctrine of temperaments on
                    varieties, in the vital actions of the system, which he had classified as
                    referring to the four heads of irritation, sensation, volition, and association,
                    formed four temperaments in conformity with this arrangement, in which these
                    functions were conceived respectively to predominate.</p>
                <p>(862.) Most of the modern physiologists, however, following the example of
                    Cullen, have adopted the four temperaments of Hippocrates, which are
                    characterized by the following peculiarities:</p>
                <p>(863.) The <hi rend="italic">Sanguine</hi> temperament is distinguished by a full
                    habit and relaxed frame of body; by a greater vascularity, softness and delicacy
                    of skin, in which the veins are of considerable size, and are particularly
                    conspicuous by their blue colour, as seen through the thin layers of the skin.
                    The surface of the body generally, and more especially the face, exhibits a
                    florid and ruddy colour. The hair is generally of a light brown; but has often a
                    yellow, and sometimes a reddish hue. Persons endowed with a sanguine temperament
                    are acutely sensitive, and highly irritable: their pulse is frequent, indicating
                    the general rapidity and energy of the circulation. Both the secretions and
                    excretions are abundant, and little liable to obstruction. The disposition is
                    free and open; the temper cheerful, and rather disposed to levity.</p>
                <p>(864.) A remarkable contrast to the temperament just described is presented by
                    the <hi rend="italic">melancholic</hi> temperament, which is marked by a firm
                    and robust frame, and a spare habit of body; by an integument of greater
                    thickness, and of a brown and swarthy hue; and by an abundance of dark or black
                    hair, which being particularly conspicuous in the eye-brows and beard, and being
                    conjoined with a black colour of the iris, imparts to the countenance a stern
                    and sombre aspect. In persons endowed with this temperament the pulse is
                    habitually slower than the average condition; the blood is thicker and more
                    sluggish; the secretions and the excretions are less copious, and more apt to be
                    morbidly deficient than with the generality of men. The nervous system is, on
                    the whole, less sensitive and excitable; but the mind, although not readily
                    moved, when once set in motion, is remarkably retentive of its impressions, and
                    tenacious of its purposes; persevering and indefatigable in action, ardent and
                    constant in its affections; possessing great capacity of understanding, with a
                    fondness for contemplation, and for speculative inquiries demanding profound
                    thought. The temper is naturally grave, and often gloomy; the fancy imaginative,
                    and of a poetic turn, but tinctured with melancholy, and betraying a proclivity
                    to madness; when happily tempered, it exhibits that fortunate combination of
                    genius and industry from which have resulted the noblest achievements of the
                    human intellect.</p>
                <p>(865.) The <hi rend="italic">Choleric</hi> temperament would seem to occupy a
                    place intermediate between the two former, as partaking of some of the qualities
                    of both. The frame is more relaxed, the senses more excitable, and the mind more
                    irras-cible than in the melancholic temperament. The complexion is less ruddy
                    than in the sanguine temperament, and the pulse stronger and more frequent; the
                    secretions arc more copious, and the skin fairer and less hairy than in the
                    melancholic temperament.</p>
                <p>(866.) The <hi rend="italic">Phlegmatic</hi> temperament is denoted by a relaxed
                    and feeble frame, prone to obesity; a pallid complexion, a smooth integument,
                    with but few hairs, that on the head being of a light colour. The circulation
                    generally is languid, the pulse slow and weak, the blood-vessels less capacious,
                    the fluids more bland and watery. The functions of digestion, secretion and
                    excretion, are performed slowly, and are liable to frequent impediments. The
                    mind is dull, sluggish, disposed to indulge in sleep; not easily moved, timid,
                    inclined to fear, and prone to avarice.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500148" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0148-0697"/>
                <p>(867.) Dr. Gregory has added to these four temperaments a fifth, which he
                    denominates the <hi rend="italic">nervous</hi> temperament, and which owes its
                    peculiarities to the sensibility of the nervous system existing in an undue
                    proportion to the contractility of the muscles; conjoining the qualities of
                    excitability and of debility. Such an union of qualities, however, is compatible
                    with the characteristics of other temperaments, but occurs more commonly in the
                    sanguine, whether existing in its purest form, or blended with the phlegmatic;
                    and it is found exemplified chiefly among those whose occupations are sedentary,
                    and who lead a life of ease and luxury.</p>
                <p>(868.) These several temperaments are found variously modified by occasional
                    intermixture in different degrees with one another. Thus, the phlegmatic is
                    often conjoined with the sanguine, and sometimes with the melancholic
                    temperaments; and observation will readily suggest examples of other similar
                    combinations. The predominance of each of these temperaments varies at different
                    periods of life. At an early age the system inclines more to the sanguine; in
                    middle life, to the choleric; and at a more advanced age, to the melancholic
                    temperament. They admit also of being variously influenced and modified by
                    climate, habits, and education; and accordingly each is found to prevail amongst
                    particular tribes and nations, and in particular regions of the globe.</p>
                <p>CHAP. XXI. VARIETIES OF THE HUMAN SPECIES.</p>
                <p>(869∙) It has been a question much agitated amongst naturalists, whether the
                    differences observable in the complexion, features, and the intellectual and
                    moral endowments of different tribes and nations which are found scattered over
                    the surface of the globe, are sufficiently great to mark an original diversity
                    of species, or whether they correspond merely to the character of varieties
                    taking place in a single original race, analogous to those we behold in many
                    domesticated animals, such as the dog, the horse, and the sheep, and therefore
                    affording no objection to the hypothesis that every individual composing the
                    human race belongs really to one and the same species. To Blumcnbach belongs the
                    merit of being the first who entered with a philosophical spirit into the
                    investigation of this great problem. The generally prevailing opinion at present
                    is, that all mankind are the descendants of the same original stock; and are
                    therefore to be considered as members of the same family.</p>
                <p>(870.) It is a matter of considerable difficulty to establish an accurate
                    classification of the different varieties into which the human race should be
                    divided. Blumenbach, who, from having devoted to it much labour and attention,
                    is justly considered as the highest authority on this subject, has fixed the
                    number of these varieties at five; though, as Mr. Lawrence observes, these five
                    races ought perhaps rather to be considered as principal divisions, each of them
                    including several subordinate varieties. Μ. Bory de St. Vincent, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise on Man,</hi> extends the number of primitive varieties to
                    fifteen. Cuvier, on the other hand, is inclined to refer all the varieties in
                    the race to three principal heads, considering the others as merely
                    modifications of these.</p>
                <p>(871.) The five varieties which Blumenbach has pointed out, are designated by the
                    terms <hi rend="italic">Caucasian, Mongolian, Ethiopian, American,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Malay.</hi> He regards the Caucasian race as the primitive stock,
                    or as the standard and type of the rest. It appears, indeed, to occupy an
                    intermediate place between the Mongolian race, on the one side, and the
                    Ethiopian on the other, which latter races are the most widely different from
                    each other. The American variety has been considered as intermediate between the
                    Caucasian and the Mongolian; and the Malay race as intermediate between the
                    Caucasian and the Ethiopian. The various intermixtures which have taken place
                    between these several races, in different parts of the world, render it very
                    difficult, at the present day, to draw those precise lines of distinction which
                    have probably, in remoter times, characterized the primitive races now
                    enumerated. Thus, in Asia, we find considerable mixtures of the Caucasian with
                    the Mongolian races; whilst in Africa, the Caucasian race has in various
                    instances been blended with the Ethiopian.</p>
                <p>(872.) The following are the circumstances by which these several varieties arc
                    characterized:—1. The <hi rend="italic">Caucasian races</hi> are distinguished
                    by the general whiteness of the skin; the fairer complexions exhibiting a
                    roseate tint, particularly conspicuous in the cheeks, and derived from the
                    abundance of blood circulating in the vessels, and the darker races inclining to
                    a brown, and by the abundance and softness of the hair, which is either black,
                    or of a lighter chesnut colour, occasionally inclining to red. The cranium is
                    large and oval, and developed especially about the forehead; the face
                    comparatively small, and falling perpendi-cularly underneath the forehead. The
                    features are distinct from each other; the nose narrow, and frequently aquiline;
                    the mouth small; the front teeth in both jaws have a perpendicular direction;
                    the lips, particularly the lower one, are gently turned outwards; the chin is
                    full and rounded, and the general contour of the face has an oval form, and is
                    broader in the upper than in the lower portion. This is the race in which the
                    moral and intellectual energies of man have risen to a higher degree of
                    excellence than in any other; and it is the race which has at all times been the
                    most susceptible of cultivation and improvement. The hope may indeed be
                    entertained that it is yet far from having arrived at the highest point in these
                    respects which it is destined to attain.</p>
                <p>(873.) 2. The <hi rend="italic">Mongolian</hi> races are characterized by a
                    complexion approaching to an olive colour; the eyes being black; the hair also
                    black, strong, and straight; the beard thin and scanty; and the head of a form
                    somewhat square; the check bones large and prominent; the forehead low; the face
                    broad; the features flattened, and running together; the nose small and flat;
                    the aperture of the eyelids narrow, and the orbits situated obliquely; the lips
                    thick; the chin slightly projecting; the ears large. The stature of most of the
                    nations belonging to this race is, in general, inferior to that of
                    Europeans.</p>
                <p>(874.) 3. The <hi rend="italic">Ethiopian</hi> or <hi rend="italic">negro
                    race</hi> is marked by the lateral compression of the skull, which is elongated
                    forwards; by the prominence of the cheek bones, the narrowness and projection of
                    the jaws, and the recession of the chin. The forehead is low, and very slanting;
                    the eyes prominent; the nose broad, thick, and flat; the lips, the upper one
                    especially, thick; the upper front teeth are oblique; the hair black and woolly;
                    the legs are long and slender; the calf especially is small, and the knees are
                    bent inwards; the arms are longer than in the other races.</p>
                <p>(875.) 4. The <hi rend="italic">Aboriginal American race</hi> is remarkable for
                    the red colour of the skin, the strong and straight black hair, the scanty
                    beard, and low forehead, the deeply sunk eyes, and the round and prominent cheek
                    bones. The mouth is large, the lips thick, and the face in general broad and
                    square; characters which assimilate this race with the Mongolian, from which,
                    however, it is sufficiently distinguished by the colour of the skin, and the
                    projection of the features, especially of the nose.</p>
                <p>(876.) 5. The <hi rend="italic">Malay variety</hi> of the human species varies
                    considerably in the colour of the skin, from a light tawny brown, to one
                    approaching to black. The head is narrow; the bones of the face are large and
                    prominent; the mouth large; the nose full and broad at the point. The hair is
                    black, and more or less curling.</p>
                <p>The following account of the filiation of the different races, and of their
                    distribution over the globe, is given by Cuvier.</p>
                <p>(877·) The Caucasian race has been so named from its <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193500161" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0161-0698"/>presumed origin in the
                    western part of Asia, in the neighbourhood of the Caucasian chain of mountains,
                    which are situated between the Caspian and the Black Seas; whence it has spread
                    as from a centre to the adjacent parts of the Asiatic, European, and African
                    continents. The present inhabitants of these regions, namely, the Circassians
                    and the Georgians, are reputed to be still the handsomest race on earth. The
                    principal ramifications from the primitive stock, may be most satisfactorily
                    traced by following the analogies of the languages of the nations which have
                    proceeded from it. Thus, the Armenian, or Syrian branch, proceeded southwards,
                    and gave rise to the Assyrian and Chaldean nations; and also to the Arabians,
                    who, after the era of Mahomet, aspired to the empire of the world. The
                    Phoenicians, Jews, and Abyssinians may be regarded as Arab colonies, to which
                    class also the Egyptians may probably be referred.</p>
                <p>(878.) The branch giving origin to the <hi rend="italic">Indian, Germanic,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Pelasgic</hi> tribes was far more widely spread, and
                    became subdivided at a much remoter period of antiquity. Among the four
                    principal languages which prevailed among the nations composing these races,
                    namely, the Sanscrit, the ancient Pelasgic, the Gothic or Teutonic, and the
                    Sclavonic, we may trace the most multiplied affinities. The primitive Sanscrit
                    is still preserved as the sacred language of the Hindoos, and is the model on
                    which all the existing languages of Hindostan have been formed. The Pelasgic is
                    the primitive source of the Greek, of the Latin, and of many other tongues now
                    extinct, but from which most of the present languages of the south of Europe
                    have been derived. The Teutonic has given rise to the languages of the northern
                    and the western nations of Europe, such as the German, the Dutch, the English,
                    the Danish, the Swedish, together with their various dialects. From the
                    Sclavonic tongue are derived those of the north-east of Europe, namely, the
                    Russ, Polish, the Bohemian, and the Vendean·</p>
                <p>(879∙) It is amongst this latter extensive race that philosophy, sciences, and
                    the arts, have been most assiduously cherished, and have been carried to their
                    highest states of perfection. This race had, in Europe, been preceded by the
                    Celtic tribes, which originally came from the north, and were formerly widely
                    spread, but which are now confined to very narrow spaces in the west of Europe
                    and Africa, and are nearly effaced by continued intermixture with the numerous
                    races which have supplanted them.</p>
                <p>(880.) The ancient <hi rend="italic">Persians</hi> have a similar origin with the
                    Indians; and their descendants at the present time, bear the strongest marks of
                    affinity to the modern European nations.</p>
                <p>(881.) The <hi rend="italic">Scythian</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tartaric</hi>
                    branch, first directed itself towards the north and north-east, and composed the
                    wandering tribes which traversed the immense plains of Tartary. In later times,
                    become more numerous, they returned to spread devastation amongst the
                    flourishing establishments of their more civilized brethren. The irruptions of
                    the Scy thians in Upper Asia, of the Parthians, who overthrew the domination of
                    the Greeks and Romans in those regions; of the Turks, who destroyed that of the
                    Arabs, and reduced to subjection the miserable remnant of the Greek nations in
                    Europe; all proceeded from the overflowings of the northern swarms from this
                    common race. The Finlanders and the Hungarians, which belong to this race, may
                    be regarded as stragglers from these swarms, amidst Sclavonic and Teutonic
                    tribes. On the northern and eastern coasts of the Caspian Sea, the original
                    cradle of these races, there are still found tribes which have the same common
                    origin with the former, and which speak <hi rend="italic">a</hi> similar
                    language; but they are variously intermixed with a great number of other smaller
                    tribes, differing from them both in language and in origin.</p>
                <p>(882.) The <hi rend="italic">Tartarian</hi> tribes have remained more free from
                    mixture, along the whole of that extensive tract whence they long defied the
                    power of Russia, but to which they have at length been forced to submit; namely,
                    from the mouths of the Danube, to the countries beyond those of the Irtish. But
                    the conquests of the Mongols have led to considerable blending of the two races
                    among the Tartarian nations.</p>
                <p>(883.) The <hi rend="italic">Mongolian</hi> race inhabits the remoter regions of
                    Asia, extending from the eastern parts of the continent, where the Tartar branch
                    of the Caucasian race terminates, to the Eastern Ocean. The different branches
                    of this Mongolian race, such as the Calmuc Tartars, and the Kalkas, have no
                    settled residence, but are wandering tribes over the extensive deserts of
                    Eastern Asia. Thrice have their ancestors carried far and wide the terror of
                    their arms; first, under Attila; next under Genghis Khan; and, lastly, under
                    Tamerlane. The Chinese are an ancient branch of this family, which was very
                    early trained to a high degree of civilization; at a period, indeed, apparently
                    more remote than that to which our most ancient histories extend. The Manchew
                    Tartars, who have recently achieved the conquest of China, are a third branch of
                    the same Mongolian race. The Japanese, the Coreans, and almost all the hordes
                    which extend to the north-east of Siberia, under the dominion of Russia, belong
                    also to the same division of the human species.</p>
                <p>The original seat of this widely-spread race appears to be the chain of the Altai
                    mountains, the central ridge of Asia; in. the same way that the race to which we
                    belong was derived from the inhabitants of mount Caucasus; but it is quite
                    impossible to unravel the complicated filiation of these various tribes. The
                    history of these wandering people is as evanescent as their establishments; and
                    even that of the Chinese, confined as it is to the limits of their empire,
                    supplies only brief and unconnected notices of the surrounding nations. The
                    affinities of their languages are too imperfectly known to afford any clue for
                    our guidance in this mighty labyrinth.</p>
                <p>(884.) The languages of the north of the Indian peninsula, beyond the Ganges, as
                    well as that of Thibet, have some relations with the Chinese language; at least
                    they resemble it in their monosyllabic structure. There is also a general
                    resemblance of features among all these Mongolian tribes. But the southern
                    division of the same peninsula is inhabited by a different race, namely, <hi
                    rend="italic">Malays,</hi> distinguished from the former by their greater
                    symmetry of form, and by a peculiar language. This race is spread over the
                    coasts and islands of the Indian Archipelago, as well as those of the Southern
                    Pacific. In the largest of the Indian Islands, however, we meet with a much more
                    barbarous race of men, with dark woolly hair, with black skins, and with the
                    negro features, and savage and ferocious in their dispositions. They are known
                    by the name of <hi rend="italic">Papuans,</hi> and are principally met with in
                    the Islands of New Guinea, and the New Hebrides. It has been conjectured that
                    this singular tribe was descended from negroes accidentally cast on the shores
                    of these remote islands.</p>
                <p>(885.) The inhabitants of the northernmost regions both of the old and new
                    continent, comprising the Samoides, the Laplanders, and the Esquimaux, possess
                    many peculiar features, and have been classed by some naturalists under the
                    Mongolian races, but are considered by others as degenerated scions from the
                    Scythian and Tartaric branches of the Caucasian race.</p>
                <p>(886.) The aboriginal American Indians have never been satisfactorily assimilated
                    to any one of the races of the ancient continent; yet they scarcely possess any
                    precise or well marked distinctive characters, which may entitle them to be
                    regarded as one of the primitive races of mankind. The copper hue of their skin
                    is certainly not of itself sufficient to establish such a distinction. Their
                    dark hair and scanty <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500174"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0174-0699"/>beard would incline us to refer them to the
                    Mongolian race, were it not that their well defined features, and prominent
                    nose, arc opposed to such a classification. Their languages are as diversified
                    as their tribes are numerous; and no analogy has yet been traced either amongst
                    one another, or with any of those of the old world.</p>
                <p>(887.) The analogy of what we observe in the inferior animals, affords the
                    strongest grounds for believing that natural causes are perfectly adequate to
                    explain the diversities which occur in the several varictics of the human race,
                    on the supposition of their having originated from a common stock. The
                    variations in size, colour, and even forms, which take place amongst different
                    kinds of dogs, characters which are transmitted from the parent to the offspring
                    with as much constancy as those of the human race, are no less considerable than
                    the differences observable between the European and the negro, and yet are
                    admitted by naturalists to be perfectly compatible with the unity of the
                    species, and with a community of source. Of the causes which originally produced
                    the peculiarities in the several varieties of the race, and which have become
                    permanent, we can have no certain knowledge; nor can we even supply the want of
                    precise information by any rational conjecture. The common hypothesis which
                    ascribes the black colour of the negro to the more powerful influence of the
                    solar rays in tropical climates, will not bear the test of close examination; no
                    permanent effect of that kind having ever been produced by the same cause
                    operating for any length of time on the complexion of Europeans. Different
                    opinions have been entertained with regard to the natural and original
                    complexion of the human race. Dr. Prichard contends that it was black, and that
                    the Ethiopian form was the primitive type of the race; the successive changes
                    produced being that from the imperfect to the more perfect form, and from
                    barbarism to refinement; terminating at length in the Caucasian race, in which
                    it has attained the greatest state of improvement compatible with its nature,
                    accompanied by the highest degree of capability of civilization, and of
                    intellectual and moral excellence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>(888.) In opposition to the doctrine of the unity of species in all human races,
                    it has been contended by Rudolphi, Vircy, Desmoulins, Bory St. Vincent, and
                    others, in the most positive manner, that these races were originally different.
                    The arguments on each side of the question are fully discussed in the work of
                    Dr. Prichard referred to.</p>
                <p>CHAP. XXII COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY.</p>
                <p>(889∙) We purpose, in giving an account of the most important facts relating to
                    the physiology of the animal creation, to take as the standard of comparison the
                    mode in which the functions of the human body arc conducted. The history we have
                    given of the animal economy in man will easily enable us to refer all the facts
                    relating to comparative physiology to this standard type; and this view of the
                    subject, besides the interest which naturally attaches to it, will have the
                    further advantage of reflecting light on various subjects of human physiology,
                    which, as we formerly remarked, must ever receive important elucidation from a
                    comparison with that of the lower animals.</p>
                <p>(890.) Conformably with this design we shall take a review of the different
                    divisions of the animal kingdom; first pointing out the general characters of
                    organization and of function which are common to each class and order; and
                    noticing, in the next place, the peculiarities that are most worthy of remark in
                    the several species included in those divisions. By thus following the logical
                    order of descending from generals to particulars, we shall avoid the numerous
                    re-pititions that would otherwise be requisite, and comprise in the smallest
                    space the greater number of particular facts relating to the science.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I— <hi rend="italic">Comparative Physiologu of
                    Mammalia.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Peculiarities in the Human Conformation.</hi></p>
                <p>(89L) Since man, in his zoological relations, must be comprehended in the class
                    of mammalia, it is evident that the general characters of this class must
                    consist of those possessed by the human species in common with quadrupeds, and
                    even with the other families of mammalia still farther removed from man in their
                    external conformation. While the points of resemblance are so numerous, the
                    easiest mode of instituting a comparison between them will evidently be by
                    pointing out, not the features which they possess in common, but those in which
                    they differ. We shall begin then with an account of the peculiarities which
                    distinguish the human structure from that of the lower animals, and more
                    especially from that of the quadrumanous tribes, which approach the nearest to
                    him in their conformation.</p>
                <p>(892.) The great distinctive features which characterize the human conformation,
                    as compared with that of all other mammalia, have reference to the superiority
                    of his intellectual powers, and to his maintenance of the erect position. In the
                    number and excellence of his mental faculties, and in his capabilities of
                    improvement, he leaves all other animals behind by an immeasurable distance. The
                    faculty of speech is a consequence of this developement of intellectual power,
                    which is favoured, indeed, by the conformation of the larynx; but the
                    organization requisite for the uttering of articulate sounds would have been in
                    vain conferred unless it had been placed under the guidance of the mental
                    faculties; thus to the parrot the gift of the organs of articulation, without
                    the mind which is to use them as expressions of thought, becomes a comparatively
                    unprofitable boon.</p>
                <p>(893.) The superiority of the human intellect is accompanied by a much greater
                    developement of the cerebral hemispheres than is found in any other animal.
                    Hence also the great magnitude of the cavity in which it is contained, together
                    with that part of the skull which protects it, when compared with the face,
                    which is composed of the organs of the principal senses, and oftheapparatusfor
                    mastication. The mass of the brain bears also a large proportion to the size of
                    the cerebral nerves. The cerebellum is entirely covered by the hemispheres of
                    the brain. The forehead in man is particularly distinguished by its elevation,
                    and the beauty of its convex arch. The shortness of the lower jaw, and the
                    prominence of its mental portion, are particularly remarkable. The elephant is
                    the only quadruped in which the lower jaw is equally short in proportion to the
                    size of the head; but this animal is still deficient in the projection of its
                    lowest point, so that the possession of a chin seems to be peculiar to the human
                    race.</p>
                <p>(894.) In every particular connected with the mechanism of the fabric, man enjoys
                    the most decided advantage over those mammalia which are most nearly allied to
                    him in their physical conformation. Man is the only species amongst the mammalia
                    whose body can maintain itself for any length of time in an erect position, and
                    in whom the office of supporting the trunk is entrusted solely to the lower
                    extremities. We find that every part of the osseous fabric, as well as the
                    disposition of the principal organs of sense, are in obvious conformity with
                    this design. The lower limbs, being the great instruments of support and
                    progression, are larger, and of greater strength, compared with the body, than
                    in most quadrupeds, the only exceptions being met with among those which are
                    formed expressly for leaping, as the hare, the jerboa, and the kangaroo. In the
                    monkey tribes the lower limbs are comparatively much weaker than in man; <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193500187" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0187-0700"/> and in other
                    quadrupeds the disproportion is still greater, the thigh bone being short, and
                    almost concealed by the muscles which connect it with the trunk of the body,
                    while the rest of the limb is very slender, and not covered by any considerable
                    mass of muscle. In man the articular surfaces of the knee-joint are very broad,
                    and admit of greater extent of motion than in quadrupeds, and the two portions
                    of the limb can be brought into the same straight line, thus constituting firm
                    perpendicular columns of support for the body. The long neck of the thigh bone
                    allows of more complete rotation of the limb at the hip-joint; and this,
                    together with the greater breadth of the pelvis, which affords an ample basis
                    for sustaining the trunk, are circumstances peculiar to the human frame. The
                    heel in man forms a greater projection than in other animals; and by its being
                    extended so as to touch the ground, it forms, as we have seen, one of the points
                    of support, by which, in conjunction with the toes, a much larger base is
                    comprehended. The muscles which raise the heel, and which compose the calf of
                    the leg, are of greater size and strength than in monkeys, besides acting with
                    the mechanical advantage arising from the long lever which the heel affords for
                    the insertion of their united tendons; and by the direction of the foot, which
                    forms a right angle with the leg.</p>
                <p>(895.) The form of the chest exhibits similar differences. In quadrupeds the
                    thorax is compressed laterally, and is deepest from the spine to the sternum; a
                    structure which allows the front legs to come nearer together, and to support
                    with more effect the front part of the trunk. But in man the thorax is flattened
                    anteriorly and extends more in width, that is, from side to side, thus throwing
                    out the shoulders, and giving a more extensive range to the motions of the
                    arms.</p>
                <p>(896.) That the erect posture is natural to man is strongly indicated by' the
                    position of the head with respect to its articulation with the spine, which
                    takes place at the middle of its basis; and thus, by the great extension of the
                    occiput, its weight is more nearly balanced than it is in the monkey. The
                    cervical vertebrae of the monkey have very long and prominent spinous processes,
                    evidently adapted to give greater purchase to the muscles sustaining the head,
                    of which the front part considerably preponderates, in consequence of the
                    elongation of the jaws, and the backward position of the centre of motion.</p>
                <p>(897∙) The same design may be traced in the position of the eyes, the mouth, and
                    the face in general; and is so obvious as to have been noticed by Ovid, while
                    describing the formation of man, in the following celebrated lines:</p>
                <p>“Pronaque cum spectant animalia caetera terram, Os homini sublime dedit:
                    coeluinque tueri Jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus.”</p>
                <p>(898.) All the internal organs have been regulated by the same intention. The
                    human heart is placed obliquely in the chest, and rests by a flat surface on the
                    diaphragm, to which its investing membrane, the pericardium, is firmly attached.
                    In quadrupeds, no such attachment exists; but the heart is situated more
                    perpendicularly with the apex directly downwards, and cannot be felt, as in man,
                    striking on the left side of the ribs at each contraction of the ventricles.</p>
                <p>(899∙) The fore legs of quadrupeds are in general appropriated solely to the
                    support and progressive motion of the body. In some instances, indeed, they are
                    employed, besides, in other actions; such as seizing and securing their prey,
                    raking and digging up the earth, or climbing and laying hold of the branches of
                    trees; but it is only in a few species, and chiefly among the monkey tribes,
                    which resemble man in their form, that they are instrumental in carrying food to
                    the mouth, or even in grasping weapons of offence. But in man the superior
                    extremity being entirely released from the office of maintaining any portion of
                    the weight of the trunk, is at liberty to be employed for a great variety of
                    purposes; and the exquisite structure of the human hand, which has already been
                    noticed, renders this exemption of still greater value, and constitutes
                    unquestionably one of the great perfections which mark the human structure, as
                    compared with that of the brute creation. The arm and head are thus rendered an
                    organ at once of prehension and of touch, for both of which purposes it is
                    admirably adapted by the great latitude and variety of movements it is capable
                    of executing. One of the chief sources of perfection in the hands is the
                    structure of the thumb, which is furnished with muscles of so great a power,
                    compared with those of the fingers, as to enable it to oppose and balance their
                    united strength. Hence it is enabled to grasp a spherical body, and to retain
                    firm hold of many objects, which otherwise could not have been held without the
                    united efforts of both hands. This conformation is peculiar to man; for the paw
                    of a monkey cannot exercise the same force and readiness of prehension, in
                    consequence of the thumb being inferior in strength to the other fingers.</p>
                <p>(900.) The great perfection of the organs which modulate the voice and produce so
                    great a variety of articulate sounds, is another striking instance of the high
                    destination to which the human structure has been adapted. In those tribes of
                    monkeys which come nearest to the human conformation, the power of uttering
                    articulate sounds is prevented by the interposition of two sacs connected with
                    the larynx, which receive part of the air when the animal uses any effort to
                    expel it from the lungs.</p>
                <p>(901.) The structure of the digestive organs in the human species is similar to
                    that of many quadrupeds, and has generally been regarded as intermediate between
                    that of the carnivorous tribes, and of those that live altogether on vegetable
                    food. Man may very justly, and almost exclusively be entitled to the appellation
                    of an omnivorous animal; being equally capable of subsisting on different kinds
                    of aliment; and also of using at the same time a great mixture of different
                    sorts of food. No other animal is capable of so great a versatility of powers in
                    this respect. It has also been remarked, amongst the characteristic
                    circumstances of the human race, that whilst other animals are contented with
                    food in the state in which nature offers it, man alone employs artificial
                    processes for improving its flavour, and rendering it more fit for digestion.
                    Man is the only animal that is known to practise the art of cookery; an art
                    which indeed appears necessary to enable the stomach to extract from his usual
                    food all the nutriment it is capable of yielding.</p>
                <p>(902.) The teeth of man are distinguished from those of all the other mammalia by
                    their being arranged in either jaw, in a uniform unbroken series; and also by
                    the circumstance of their being all of the same length. The cuspidati, or
                    eye-teeth, as they are called, which correspond to the canine teeth in
                    quadrupeds, are, perhaps, at first a little longer than the others, but their
                    sharp points are soon worn down to a level with the rest. In all the monkey
                    tribes, these teeth are long and prominent, and are separated by an interval
                    from the neighbouring teeth. The cutting teeth in the lower jaws slant backwards
                    in the monkey, and the jaw itself has the same direction; but in man these teeth
                    are perpendicular, and in a line with the front of the jaw, which descends to
                    form the prominence of the chin, a part of the face which does not exist even in
                    the orang utan. The tubercles on the surface of the grinders are different in
                    their shape, both from the ridges of enamel on the crowns of the teeth of
                    herbivorous animals, and from the sharp-pointed eminences on the grinders of
                    carnivorous animals.</p>
                <p>(903.) The human brain is not only larger in its relative proportion to the body
                    than in any other of the mammalia, but its absolute size is greater, if we
                    except only that of the elephant, and of the whale. With these few exceptions,
                    all the larger animals with which we are more commonly acquainted, have brains
                    absolutely, and even considerably smaller <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500200"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0200-0701"/>than that of man. Besides the prodigious expansion
                    of the hemispheres, we may remark in the human brain a more elaborate structure,
                    and a more complete developement of all its minuter parts. There is no part of
                    the brain found in any animal, which does not exist also in man; whilst several
                    of those which are found in man are either extremely small, or altogether absent
                    in the brains of the lower animals. Soemmerring has enumerated no less than
                    fifteen visible and material anatomical differences between the human brain and
                    that of the ape. The proportion of medullary to cortical substance is greater in
                    the human brain than in that of other animals.</p>
                <p>(904.) Although the negro race is a branch of the great family of man, and
                    although the peculiarities which distinguish the conformation of that race rank
                    only as varieties in the species, it yet cannot be denied, that in almost every
                    one of the circumstances in which it differs from the type of the Caucasian
                    race, it exhibits an approach to the structure of the monkey or quadrumanous
                    tribe of animals. In nothing is this approximation more remarkable, than in the
                    proportion between the size of the face as compared with that of the brain. One
                    of the most convenient methods of roughly estimating this proportion is that
                    invented by Professor Camper. Drawing a line from the most prominent part of the
                    frontal bone, to the anterior point of the upper jaw bone, just at the roots of
                    the incisor teeth, which is called the facial line, it is to be intersected by
                    another line, drawn from the external orifice of the ear to the inferior edge of
                    the aperture of the nostrils. The angle formed by these two lines is <hi
                    rend="italic">Úie facial angle</hi> of Camper, which determines by its magnitude
                    the degree of preponderance of the bones of the cranium, in which the brain is
                    contained, over those of the face, which contain the organs of sense.</p>
                <p>(905.) In man the facial angle is greater than in other animals; it differs,
                    however, in different varieties of the human race, and appears to indicate with
                    tolerable exactness the comparative degree of intellectual excellence
                    appertaining to each variety. In the Caucasian variety the facial angle is
                    between 80° and 90°; in the Mongolian, 75°; in the American Indian, 73½°; in the
                    Negro it is only 70°. Pursuing the application of this test to the lower
                    mammalia, we find it in the orang utan reduced to 65°; in the baboon, 45°; in
                    the mandrill, one of the most ferocious of that tribe, only 30°. The mastiff has
                    a facial angle of 41°, the bulldog of 35°. In the feline tribe it is still
                    farther diminished; being only 28° in the leopard. In the sheep and hare it is
                    30, in the horse it is only 23°.</p>
                <p>(906.) The varieties in the magnitude of the facial angle have thus been traced
                    through a number of gradations amongst different tribes of mammalia and also of
                    birds, till we arrive at its almost total obliteration in the snipe and the
                    woodcock, animals which are reputed to be extremely deficient in
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>(907.) The projection of the bones of the face, which tends to diminish the
                    facial angle, is universally considered as expressive of stupidity or ferocity.
                    An ample and projecting forehead, on the contrary, is associated in our minds
                    with the idea of superior intelligence. It was probably for that reason that the
                    owl was selected by the Athenians as the emblem of wisdom. In the statues of
                    their divinities, the Greek sculptors have exaggerated the facial angle, making
                    it as much as 100°, which is considerably greater than it is ever found in the
                    human form. The Italian painters, also, in their representation of saints, have
                    often given them a facial angle of <hi rend="italic">95°.</hi></p>
                <p>(908.) But in applying this method to some of the most sagacious species of
                    animals, such as the horse, which, as we have seen, has <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    very small facial angle, we meet with great and striking exceptions. We arrive
                    at more correct determination of the proportional developement of the face and
                    brain, by comparing, as proposed by Cuvier, the areas respectively occupied by
                    each in a longitudinal vertical section of the head. But in the elephant all
                    these criteria, but especially the admeasurement by the facial angle, fail, in
                    consequence of the great projection of the frontal bones, which are raised to a
                    considerable distance from the brain by the interposition of large cells, or
                    frontal sinuses, and which give an undue proportion to the size of the
                    forehead.</p>
                <p>(909∙) Daubenton proposed, for the comparison of different skulls with one
                    another, what he called his <hi rend="italic">occipital lines</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the one passing from the posterior margin of the great
                    occipital foramen through the lower edge of the orbit; the other, taking the
                    direction of the opening itself, beginning at its posterior edge, and touching
                    the articular surface of the condyles. The angle formed by the intersection of
                    these lines is his <hi rend="italic">occipital angle.</hi> But the variations of
                    this angle are too inconsiderable to furnish sufficient criteria of the
                    character of the head.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Peculiarities in the Conformation of other
                    Mammalia.</hi></p>
                <p>(910.) The bones of quadrupeds appear, as Blumenbach observes, to possess a less
                    fine and delicate texture than those of man. Their fibres are more easily
                    loosened by maceration, and are of a coarser grain; this is more particularly
                    observable in the jaw-bones and the ribs.</p>
                <p>(911.) The spine is formed of the same classes of vertebrae as in man, namely the
                    cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and sacral. In all quadrupeds belonging to the class
                    of mammalia, the number of cervical vertebrae is constantly seven, as in man.
                    The length or shortness of the neck has no influence on their number, though it
                    has a material one, of course, on the comparative length of each individual
                    vertebrae. The cameleopard, whose neck is extended to so great a length, and the
                    mole, in which it is so short, have each of them seven cervical vertebrae. An
                    apparent exception to this general rule occurs in the three-toed sloth, in which
                    Cuvier found nine vertebrae of the neck instead of seven; but it has since been
                    found that the two last of the cervical vertebrae, which appeared to be
                    supernumerary, ought properly to be classed amongst the dorsal vertebrae, of
                    which they possess the distinctive characters.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See a paper by Mr. Thomas Bell, Philosophical
                    Magazine, third series, iii. 376.</p></note></p>
                <p>(912.) The number of dorsal vertebrae depends principally upon that of the ribs,
                    which differ in different quadrupeds, and are usually more numerous than in man.
                    Their transverse and spinous processes are generally longer than in man, for the
                    purpose of affording a broader surface of attachment to the powerful muscles
                    which support the head and neck.</p>
                <p>The number of the lumbar vertebrae is various in different quadrupeds. There are
                    only three in the elephant; five in the ass; six in the horse; and seven in the
                    camel. Still greater differences are met with in the number of component parts
                    of the sacrum.</p>
                <p>(913.) Most quadrupeds have a prolongation of that part of the skeleton which
                    corresponds to the os coccygis of man, and which in them composes the tail, and
                    consists of a great number of imperfectly formed vertebrae.</p>
                <p>(914.) The thorax of quadrupeds is, as we have already noticed, more compressed
                    laterally, but deeper from the spine to the sternum, than it is in the human
                    skeleton. The scapula is constantly found; but in most tribes there is no
                    clavicle whatever, and in others only a short rudiment of that bone, connected
                    merely with the muscles. In other respects the number and connexions of the
                    bones of the extremities are generally very similar to the human conformation;
                    we may observe, however, that the os femoris is usually much shorter than the
                    tibia, and being covered by the large muscles which attach it to the trunk,
                    appears to belong to that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500213"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0213-0702"/>division of the body. The bones of the carpus and
                    tarsus, together with those of the fingers, are in many cases exceedingly
                    compressed, and some of them are so consolidated together, as not to be
                    distinguishable as separate bones.</p>
                <p>(915.) In all the mammalia we find a peculiar bone, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >intermaxillary bone,</hi> interposed between the two <hi rend="superscript">
                    υ</hi> PP <hi rend="superscript"> er</hi> jaw-bones, and locked in between them;
                    its office appears to be to contain the upper incisor teeth, when these teeth
                    exist; but it is also met with when there are no incisor teeth.</p>
                <p>(916.) The number, form, and internal structure of the teeth is exceedingly
                    diversified in the different tribes; and afford excellent characters for the
                    distinction of orders and genera of the class mammalia. As these characters have
                    a strict relation to zoological classification, we shall abstain from entering
                    here into the details of this subject.</p>
                <p>(917.) In proceeding to notice the peculiarities of structure in the mammalia, we
                    shall next examine the organs of the functions of assimilation, to which that
                    part of the skeleton we have just adverted to, namely, the jaws and teeth, are
                    subservient.</p>
                <p>(918.) The tongue of quadrupeds is, for the most part, more narrow, long, and
                    slender than that of man. Except in the genus simia, we do not meet with any
                    structure corresponding to the uvula. The oesophagus has two layers of muscular
                    fibres, which have a spiral course, and cross one another. This structure gives
                    it greater power of propelling its contents into the stomach; a power which is
                    the more required, inasmuch as the food has often to ascend considerably in
                    passing along this canal.</p>
                <p>(919.) The conformation of the stomach presents very considerable diversities,
                    apparently determined by the habit of the animal and the nature of its food.
                    From the simple structure it exhibits in the purely carnivorous tribes, we may
                    observe a gradually increasing complication as we pass to those that feed on
                    fish, and on vegetable aliment. In the latter orders of mammalia, and especially
                    in the ruminants, we meet with a very complicated apparatus for digestion. But
                    these diversities will come more properly to be noticed in the examination of
                    the orders and families to which they relate. It will be sufficient here to
                    remark, that the stomach is often divided into several distinct portions, such
                    as the cardiac and pyloric; and often presents several intermediate
                    subdivisions, and expansions into separate pouches, so as to exhibit the
                    appearance of a multiplicity of cavities or stomachs. They differ also
                    considerably as to the degree in which the glandular structures attached to
                    their coats are developed in different parts.</p>
                <p>(920.) Similar varieties are met with in the structure of the intestines of
                    different mammalia. As a general rule, to which, however, there are several
                    exceptions, it may be remarked, that the intestinal canal is much shorter, and
                    more contracted in its diameter, in carnivorous animals than in those which feed
                    on vegetables. This probably depends on the more rapid assimilation of animal
                    than of vegetable materials; the latter requiring a more complicated apparatus,
                    more capacious cavities, and a more extensive surface both for secretion and
                    absorption. It has been observed that the canal of the intestines is longer in
                    the domesticated breed than in the wild animal of the same species. Thus, in the
                    wild boar, the length of the intestines is to that of the body in the proportion
                    of nine to one; but in the tame animal the proportion is as thirteen to one. In
                    the domestic cat it is as five to one; in the wild cat as three to one. It may
                    also be remarked that in the class mammalia, the comparative length of the
                    intestinal canal is greater than in any of the other vertebrated classes; and
                    diminishes successively as we compare it in birds, reptiles, and fishes.</p>
                <p>(921.) The liver in the mammalia generally, is divided into a greater number of
                    lobes, and the divisions penetrate deeper into its substance, than in man. In a
                    great many instances, as in the horse and the goat, there is no gallbladder, the
                    bile being carried at once by the hepatic ducts into the intestine. Occasionally
                    when the gall-bladder is present, there exist also hepato-cystic ducts which
                    convey the bile directly from the liver into the gall-bladder, and not by a
                    retrograde course, as in man.</p>
                <p>The mammalia is the only class of animals provided with omentum, which, in some,
                    as in the racoon, is particularly large and stored with fat.</p>
                <p>The kidney generally presents a lobulated appearance; sometimes to such a
                    remarkable degree, as to bear a resemblance to a bunch of grapes, being composed
                    of numerous small and distinct portions, connected together by their
                    blood-vessels and excretory ducts. The urinary bladder is more capacious in
                    herbivorous than in carnivorous quadrupeds.</p>
                <p>The heart of the mammalia corresponds in every essential particular of its
                    structure with the human conformation; but it differs in its position with
                    regard to the other organs, being situated more longitudinally, and resting on
                    the sternum, which is below it, and not on the diaphragm, as in man. Hence,
                    also, the direction of its axis is not so oblique, and it is placed more in the
                    centre of the chest; and the pericardium is scarcely at all connected with the
                    diaphragm.</p>
                <p>(922.) In many quadrupeds the thoracic duct is double, and forms more distinctly
                    than in man the enlargement which has been termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >receptaculum chyli.</hi> The mesenteric glands are frequently collected into a
                    considerable mass, called the <hi rend="italic">pancreas of Asellius.</hi></p>
                <p>(923.) From the consideration of the organs of nutrition we pass on to those of
                    the sensorial functions, and shall for this purpose revert to the osteology, in
                    as far as relates to the bones which protect the brain and principal organs of
                    the senses.</p>
                <p>(924.) The divisions of the cranium of quadrupeds into separate bones, differs
                    but little from that of the human skull. The os frontis is frequently found
                    divided into two lateral portions by the prolongation of the sagittal suture
                    forwards to the root of the nose. Sometimes, again, the sagittal suture is
                    obliterated by the consolidation of the two parietals into a single bone; in
                    other cases, these bones are united with the occipital. We often find, also, a
                    bone, distinct from the temporal, termed the <hi rend="italic">tympanic
                    bone,</hi> provided for containing the tympanum of the ear. But it may be
                    observed, in general, that the sutures present fewer indentations, and less
                    irregularity in their course in the skulls of quadrupeds than in man, a
                    circumstance which is naturally explicable by the smaller devclopement of the
                    brain, and consequent diminution of the general size of the cranium. From the
                    position of the head in the quadruped the occipital foramen is situated less
                    anteriorly in the basis of the skull than in man, and is for the most part
                    nearly vertical in its position. The tentorium sometimes contains within the
                    laminae of the dura mater which compose it, several strong plates of bone, and
                    the same thing has also been observed in the falx.</p>
                <p>(925.) The brain of quadrupeds is considerably smaller, when compared with the
                    size either of the spinal cord or the cranial nerves, than in man. The cerebral
                    hemispheres are also much smaller compared with the cerebellum. This arises in a
                    great measure from the absence of the posterior lobes of the brain, which, in
                    man, when viewed from above, conceals the cerebellum; whereas in quadrupeds the
                    cerebellum is brought immediately into view in removing the upper bones of the
                    skull. In the proper quadrupeds the anterior lobes of the brain extend forwards
                    into two large processes, called the processus mamillares, which give origin to
                    the olfactory nerves, and which contains a cavity on each side, communicating
                    with the lateral ventricle, being in fact its anterior prolongation. On the
                    other hand, this <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500226"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0226-0703"/>ventricle has no posterior prolongation, there
                    being no posterior lobe.</p>
                <p>(926.) Every part of the organ of smell is developed in quadrupeds in a degree
                    corresponding to the greater extent and acuteness in which they enjoy this
                    sense, compared with man. The aethmoid bone is much more complicated m its
                    structure, as well as larger in its dimensions; the turbinated bones are
                    considerably larger, more intricate in their formation, and present a much more
                    extensive surface, being composed either of a great multitude of arborescent
                    laminae, or of numerous spiral convolutions. The internal nasal cavities are
                    also generally enlarged, and particularly the frontal sinuses.</p>
                <p>(927∙) The organ of hearing also frequently presents a greater complication of
                    structure than in man. A cavity, called by Soemmerring, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bulla</hi><hi rend="italic">ossea,</hi> communicates with that of the tympanum,
                    and corresponds with the mastoid cells in the human subject. In the aquatic
                    mammalia the external meatus is furnished with a valve for the purpose of
                    excluding water from the passage. In these animals, also, as well as in those
                    that live under ground, the external ear is altogether wanting. The structure of
                    the internal parts of the organ agree in all essential points with those of the
                    human ear. The cochlea sometimes makes an additional turn in its spiral
                    convolution.</p>
                <p>(928.) The eyes of mammalia exhibit considerable variety as to the position of
                    their axes with respect to the general direction of the head. They are generally
                    separated to a greater distance, and directed laterally. The figure of the globe
                    is nearly spherical, as in man; but in several quadrupeds the sclerotic coat is
                    much thicker and firmer at its posterior than at its anterior part. The choroid
                    coat is distinctly divisible into two layers, of which the internal bears the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">tunica Puyschiana,</hi> and which often exhibits
                    at the back of the eye the most brilliant colours. This coloured portion of the
                    choroid is known by the name of the <hi rend="italic">tapetum.</hi></p>
                <p>(929∙) Several quadrupeds have an additional lacrymal gland, besides that which
                    corresponds to the one in man; and also another gland, situated near the nose,
                    and termed the <hi rend="italic">glandula</hi><hi rend="italic">Harderi.</hi>
                    The globe of the eye in quadrupeds is also provided with an additional muscle,
                    the <hi rend="italic">suspensorius oculi,</hi> for the purpose of supporting its
                    weight. Many quadrupeds also possess a third, or internal eye-lid, called the
                    <hi rend="italic">nictitating membrane,</hi> which is very large and moveable in
                    the cat, and all the animals belonging to the same genus.</p>
                <p>(930.) The panniculus carnosus is a muscular expansion, situated immediately
                    under the skin, and subservient to the movements of the integuments, which it
                    suddenly corrugates and throws into wrinkles, thereby driving off insects, or
                    shaking away any other offensive matter, is peculiar to quadrupeds, not being
                    found in man; unless the platysma myoides of the neck be considered as a muscle
                    having an analogous function with relation to the skin of the neck.</p>
                <p>(931.) In many quadrupeds some of the sebaceous glands of the integuments are
                    very much developed. In some predacious animals, a gland exists in the orbit,
                    described by Nuck, and of which the excretory duct opens near the last tooth of
                    the upper jaw. It appears referable to the class of salivary glands. Another
                    gland, particularly noticed by Professor Jacobson, and of which the use is
                    wholly unknown, is generally met with in the anterior and lower part of the
                    cavity of the nostrils: this he has called <hi rend="italic">the nasal gland
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">Steno.</hi></p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Quadrumana.</hi></p>
                <p>(932.) We have already had occasion, when describing the distinctive marks by
                    which the human structure is characterized, when compared with that of the
                    monkey, to point out several circumstances which are deserving of notice in the
                    anatomy of this tribe of mammalia. Of all the animals of the family of the
                    quadrumana, the orang-utan <hi rend="italic">(simia satyrus,</hi> Geoff.) is
                    that species which makes the nearest approach to the human conformation. This
                    approximation is observable in the position of the great occipital foramen of
                    the skull, which is placed farther forwards than in other kinds of apes; in the
                    distinctness and serrated form of the sutures of the cranial bones; in the
                    absence of the intermaxillary bone; in the eyes being directed forwards; in the
                    smallness of the os coccygis, composed, as in man, of five imperforated bones;
                    in the possession both of a coecum and an appendix vermiformis; and in the
                    oblique position of the heart with respect to the cavity of the thorax.</p>
                <p>(933.) A still more remarkable peculiarity of structure in the orang-utan is that
                    discovered and described by Camper; namely, two membranous sacs, which
                    communicate with the glottis, and deprives the animal of the power of giving
                    utterance to sounds.</p>
                <p>(934.) In other species of this order we trace still further deviations from the
                    human structure. The laryngeal sacs are found in many species of baboons; these
                    are either single or double, and communicate with the larynx by openings between
                    the os hyoides and the thyroid cartilage. The simia seniculus, and the simia
                    beelzebub, have a large dilatation of the middle of the body of the os hyoides,
                    which is expanded into a spherica! bony cavity. This cavity, instead of
                    interfering with the sonorous vibrations, adds to their strength, and gives the
                    power of producing those loud intonations which are peculiar to this tribe, and
                    from which they have obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">hoicling
                    apes.</hi></p>
                <p>(935.) The mandrill baboon has seven instead of five lumbar vertebrae. The
                    appendix vermiformis bf the coecum is not met with in many species of apes. The
                    crest of the occipital bone, though very large in the baboon of Borneo, is
                    scarcely perceptible in most monkeys. The central foramen of the retina
                    discovered in the human eye by Soemmerring, has been seen in the eyes of many
                    animals of this order.</p>
                <p>(936.) In the lemur tardigradus, and in the sloth, a singular structure has been
                    observed by Sir Anthony Carlisle, with regard to the distribution of the
                    arteries of the limbs. The trunks of these arteries suddenly subdivide as they
                    enter the limb into a great number of parallel branches, which are again
                    re-united when they arrive at the remote end of the first division of the limb;
                    that is, about the joints corresponding to the elbow and the knee in man. After
                    their re-union into single trunks, these arteries proceed to ramify in the usual
                    manner.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera.</hi></p>
                <p>(937.) In the bat tribe we have to notice the strictly &lt; hinge-like nature of
                    the articulation of the lower jaw with the skull, which limits its motion to
                    mere opening and shutting, and excludes all lateral movements. The zygomatic
                    arches are expanded and raised, so as to allow room for the large and powerful
                    muscles which close the jaw. The parietal bones are united into a single bone.
                    The sacrum is composed of four bones consolidated together. Four clavicles are
                    met with, and they are of extraordinary length. The ulna is deficient in the
                    fore-arm, or exists only in a rudimental state, as a slender sharp-pointed
                    process of the radius. The phalanges of the anterior extremities are enormously
                    lengthened for the purpose of supporting the thin membrane which is stretched
                    between them, and which serves the office of wings. The tongue of the bat is
                    covered with sharp-pointed horny papillae.</p>
                <p>(938.) The vespertilio noctula is remarkable for the shortness of the intestinal
                    canal, which is only twice the length of the animal’s body. In the vampire bat,
                    on the contrary, and in the vespertilio caninus it is seven times as long. In
                    all bats, not only is the appendix coeci vermiformis want <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193500239" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0239-0704"/>ing, but also the coecum
                    itself. The epiglottis is also wanting in most of the animals of this tribe. In
                    many the tongue is slender, and prolonged into an organ of suction. The pectoral
                    muscles are of enormous size; and the sternum has a prominent crest for the
                    purpose of affording an extensive surface for their attachment. The eye is
                    remarkably small; but the imperfections which probably exist in the sense of
                    sight are amply compensated by the singular acuteness of that of hearing, the
                    organ of which is exceedingly developed; and also by the extreme sensibility of
                    the expanded membranes of the wings, which is such as to enable the bat to
                    direct its flight through the most intricate passages without the aid of the
                    sight, and without striking against obstacles purposely placed in its way.</p>

                    >(939∙)</hi> Among the animals arranged by Cuvier in this family, the mole
                    presents the most remarkable peculiarities of conformation, both as regards the
                    skeleton and the internal organs. The sternum has the same crested process as in
                    the bat, and apparently with the same design of enlarging the surface of
                    attachment to the powerful muscles employed in digging. But the anterior
                    extremity of this crest is still farther prolonged into a sharp process, having
                    the figure of a plough-share, which is situated under the cervical vertebrae,
                    and resembles the keel-like projection we shall have occasion to notice in the
                    sternum in birds. The cervical vertebrae are remarkable for having no spinous
                    processes. The ligamentum nuchae is particularly strong, and is almost wholly
                    ossified. The clavicle is of a singular shape, being nearly cubical. The humerus
                    is very slender in the middle, and remarkably expanded at both its extremities.
                    The fore-paw is provided with a bone of a peculiar shape, called the falciform
                    bone, placed at the end of the radius. The phalanges have numerous processes,
                    and arc furnished with sesamoid bones; structures which, by giving considerable
                    mechanical advantage to the muscles that move them, contribute greatly to
                    increase their power. The great muscles of the trunk, the pectoralis major, the
                    latissimus dorsi, and the teres major, are of great size, and give the animal
                    great facility in digging the ground, and throwing up the earth as it
                    proceeds.</p>
                <p>(940.) The aethmoid bone is of very complicated formation in the mole, especially
                    in the numerous convolutions of its turbinated processes, by which a very large
                    surface is given to the Schneiderian membrane which lines every portion. This
                    structure indicates the possession of a very acute sense of smell. The
                    remarkable developement of the internal parts of the ears, is also conclusive
                    evidence of the delicacy of the sense of hearing in this animal, although it has
                    no external ear whatever. The eye is so minute, that even the existence of that
                    organ has been denied by some naturalists; it is, in fact, not larger than the
                    head of a pin. The cavities in which they are placed are so very superficial, as
                    scarcely to deserve the name of orbits. The zygoma is not arched, but straight,
                    and as slender as a thread.</p>
                <p>6; <hi rend="italic">Plantigrada.</hi></p>
                <p>(941.) Animals of the plantigrade family have a long but narrow intestinal canal,
                    unprovided with any coecum or appendix, and consequently not presenting any
                    marked distinction between the small and the large intestines.</p>
                <p>(942.) To this family belongs the bear, remarkable for possessing supernumerary
                    canine teeth, which are small, and situated behind the principal ones. The
                    stomach is divided into two portions by a slight contraction in the middle; the
                    intestines are furnished with remarkably long and numerous villi; the kidneys
                    are conglomerated; the tentorium is bony; the nasal cartilages are extremely
                    mobile.</p>
                <p>(943.) In the racoon, another animal of this tribe, the valve of the colon is
                    wanting, and the omentum is very large, consisting of innumerable lines of fat,
                    disposed in a reticular form, and connected by an extremely delicate membrane
                    having the appearance of a spider’s web. The skin of the neck is very loosely
                    connected by cellular substance with the subjacent muscles.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Digitigrada.</hi></p>
                <p>(944.) The coecum is wanting in the greater number of the animals of this tribe.
                    It is met with, however, in the ichneumon. Many have anal glands and follicles,
                    which prepare a strongly odoriferous secretion. This is the case with the skunk,
                    pole-cat, and several others. When these animals are pursued, they pour out this
                    fetid matter, the odour of which is so offensive as to deter their pursuers from
                    approaching them. The civet has also similar glands that secrete the peculiar
                    perfume which derives its name from that animal.</p>
                <p>(945.) The stomach, in the weasel tribe, is a simple cylindrical canal, having no
                    expanded extremity to the left of the cardia; but the oesophagus enters at one
                    end, and the intestine proceeds from the other, so that the food may pass
                    quickly through it. In the stomach of the sea otter, Sir Edward Home describes a
                    remarkable glandular structure near the pylorus. The receptaculum chyli, in this
                    animal, sends two trunks to form the thoracic duct, which have frequent
                    communications, so that there are sometimes three, frequently four, and never
                    fewer than two branches of this duct, running parallel to one another. In two
                    instances the foramen ovale of the heart was found open, but the ductus
                    arteriosus was closed.</p>
                <p>(946.) In the dog a row of mucous glands, corresponding to the labiales and
                    buccales in man, is found opposite to the molar teeth, having several small
                    openings into the mouth. A large salivary gland also exists under the arch of
                    the zygoma, covered by the masseter muscle. Its duct is nearly equal in size to
                    that of the parotid, and opens at the posterior extremity of the alveolar margin
                    of the upper jaw. What is called the <hi rend="italic">worm</hi> in the dog’s
                    tongue, is merely a packet of tendinous fibres, passing longitudinally the whole
                    length of its tongue, and lying loose in a membranous sheath, unconnected with
                    any of the muscles. It has been supposed to assist in lapping up fluids in the
                    peculiar way in which dogs are observed to drink. There is a popular, but wholly
                    unfounded idea, that the extirpation of this pretended worm, is a preservation
                    against hydrophobia. The anal glands are of considerable size.</p>
                <p>(947.) The thoracic duct is double in the dog, and forms a large receptaculum
                    chyli. The crista occipitalis varies considerably in its degree of prominence in
                    the different breeds of dogs. In all, the tympanic bone is distinct from the
                    temporal bone, being separated from it by a suture. The urethra passes along a
                    groove in a cylindrical bone. In the hyaena, however, which in other respects is
                    very similar to the dog, this bone is not found. The extremities of the rings of
                    the trachea, in the hyaena, overlap one another, and admit of being much
                    compressed; a circumstance which has been considered as connected with the
                    shrill and peirc-ing cry which this animal is capable of uttering.</p>
                <p>(948.) The genus felis, of which the lion affords the most remarkable example,
                    resembles the dog in many circumstances of conformation. We find the same set of
                    mucous glands about the mouth, and at the extremity of the rectum. The tongue is
                    beset with sharp prickles, the points of which are directed backwards; they are
                    of such strength as to tear off the skin from any part which the lion may lick.
                    The stomach is divided by a slight middle contraction, into a cardiac and a
                    pyloric portion. The ductus choledochus forms a pouch between the coats of the
                    intestine for receiving the pancreatic duct. In all animals of this genus the
                    tentorium is bony. The zygoma is arched, and very large and prominent. The long
                    bristly hairs which constitute the whiskers, receive very considerable nervous
                    filaments, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500252" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0252-0705"
                    />appear subservient to the sense of touch in a very remarkable degree. Two
                    delicate membranes are met with lying under the ligaments of the glottis, and
                    are probably the cause of the piercing sound peculiar to animals of this tribe.
                    The retraction of the claws into a sheath is matter of familiar observation in
                    the cat. The pupil of the lion is circular, but that of the cat has the form of
                    a vertical slit when closed; and the motions of the iris appear to be partly
                    voluntary.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Amphibia.</hi></p>
                <p>(949∙) Whiskers having the same properties are likewise found in the seal, an
                    animal of aquatic habits, and whose conformation is modified with reference to
                    the element it is intended to inhabit. The feet act as fins, adapted for
                    swimming; the radius and ulna are flattened; the spine is very flexible; the
                    pelvis very narrow. The bones have no medullary cavities. Neither the parotid
                    nor the sublingual glands are met with in this or any other animal of the order
                    of amphibia, belonging to the class mammalia; and the teeth are adapted chiefly
                    to the seizing and detention of objects, and are scarcely capable of serving the
                    purpose of mastication. The stomach is a straight cylinder, having no cardiac
                    expansion. The intestinal canal is of great length, thus forming an exception to
                    the general rule of its being comparatively short in carnivorous animals. The
                    renal veins form a kind of net-work, the reticulations of which intersect the
                    furrows between the mammary processes onthcouter surface of the kidneys. The
                    proportional size of the brain of the seal is greater than in most mammalia.</p>
                <p>(950.) The eye of the Greenland seal is peculiarly formed, having, according to
                    Blumenbach, the anterior segment of the sclerotica, or that immediately behind
                    its junction with the cornea, thick and firm; its middle circle thin and
                    flexible; and its posterior part very thick and almost cartilaginous, while the
                    cornea itself is thin and yielding. The whole eye-ball is surrounded by very
                    strong muscles capable of shortening the axis of the eye, and of adapting it,
                    according to circumstances, to distinct vision in air; while in their ordinary
                    state of relaxation, the axis of the eye being lengthened, the animal when under
                    water is still enabled to see objects distinctly.</p>
                <p>(951.) The walrus, another animal of this order, is remarkable for the form of
                    its teeth and tusks, part being external ;but these fall more within the
                    province of the naturalist. The zootomist may notice in this animal the
                    smallness of the intermaxillary bone, and the total absence of the gall
                    bladder.</p>
                <p>9∙ <hi rend="italic">Mαrsupialia.</hi></p>
                <p>(952.) The marsupial family of mammalia compose an interesting group of animals,
                    which present many remarkable singularities in their internal conformation and
                    economy. The principal of these is the apparently premature birth of their
                    young, which come into the world at a period of their developement corresponding
                    to that to which the foetuses of mammalia have arrived only a few days after
                    conception. Nearly the whole extent of the integument of the fore part of the
                    abdomen forms a kind of sac or pouch for the reception of the íoetuses in their
                    early state, and whilst they present only a shapeless mass, destitute of
                    external members, and totally incapable oflocomotion. They become attached to
                    the nipples of the mammary glands, situated under the integument of the pouch
                    next to the abdomen of the mother; and they remain in this situation for a long
                    time, imbibing nourishment from these glands, until they acquire a growth equal
                    to that which the young of other animals attain in the uterus before birth. Two
                    bones, peculiar to these animals, and therefore called the marsupial bones, are
                    expressly provided for the protection of the abdominal viscera, lying in the
                    horizontal position of the trunk above this extraordinary pouch, which performs
                    the function of a supplementary uterus. It is farther remarkable, that the same
                    bones occur in the skeleton of the males, where, of course, there are no
                    pouches; and also in those species where the fold forming the pouch is scarcely
                    perceptible. The uterus communicates with the vagina, not by a single opening,
                    but by two curved lateral tubes. This has been called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >uterus</hi><hi rend="italic">anfractuosus,</hi> to distinguish it from the
                    ordinary form, which is the <hi rend="italic">uterus simplex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">uterus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >biconis,</hi> which has two horns, either straight or convoluted; and the
                    double uterus, or <hi rend="italic">uterus duplex,</hi> which has the appearance
                    of two horns opening laterally into the vagina, as in the mole, the hare, and
                    the rabbit. The Fallopian tubes, in marsupial animals, are much enlarged at
                    their extremities.</p>
                <p>(953.) In the oppossum, the cardiac and the pyloric openings of the stomach are
                    placed very near one another. The anal glands are large. The tongue is covered
                    with pointed processes.</p>
                <p>(954.) The kangaroo has a stomach composed of three pouches, but in consequence
                    of the power which different portions of it possess of contracting separately,
                    it is occasionally divided into a much greater number of portions.</p>
                <p>(955.) The pbascolome, a species of rat from Australia, which possesses an
                    abdominal pouch, is remarkable for possessing, in common only with man, and the
                    orang-utan, both a coecum and an appendix vermiformis.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Fodentia.</hi></p>
                <p>(956.) In this order of mammalia, we find the incisor teeth furnished with enamel
                    only in front; the frontal sinuses are absent; the os frontis is divided into
                    two bones by a middle longitudinal suture, and the tympanic bone is distinct
                    from the temporal. The brain presents no appearance of convolutions on its
                    surface; the eyes are placed on the side of the head, so that the direction of
                    their axes is completely lateral; and the orbits are not separated from the
                    temporal fossae; the coecum, in particular, is exceedingly voluminous, so as
                    often to exceed the stomach in size. The dormouse, indeed, presents an exception
                    to this rule, being destitute of any coecum.</p>
                <p>(957.) The beaver has a remarkably strong and prominent zygoma. A peculiar
                    glandular body is found near the upper orifice of the stomach, full of cavities,
                    apparently for the purpose of secreting mucus. The urethra terminates in the
                    rectum, thus constituting a kind of <hi rend="italic">cloaca</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> a structure which, as we shall find, prevails universally
                    in birds. The direction of the axes of the orbits is upwards.</p>
                <p>(958.) The common rat has no coecum; its zygoma has its convexity turned
                    downwards; the testes arc capable of being retracted within the abdomen. A
                    similar circumstance occurs in the hamster, the squirrel, and the
                    guinea-pig.</p>
                <p>(959∙) The mus typhlns is remarkable for having its eye covered over with the
                    common integument of the face, which, together with the hair growing on it,
                    completely intercept light, and must destroy the use of the eye as an organ of
                    vision.</p>
                <p>(960.) Cheek pouches are met with in many species of this genus; as in the case
                    of the hamster and marmot. In the ear of the latter of these animals, a portion
                    of bone is described by Cuvier as passing between the crura of the stapes, from
                    one side of the fenestra ovalis to the other, the use of which conformation is
                    entirely unknown.</p>
                <p>(961.) In the hare, the following peculiarities are met with. The. coronoid
                    process of the lower jaw is almost entirely wanting. The transverse processes of
                    the lumbar vertebrae are remarkably large. The stomach may be distinguished into
                    two portions, differing in the structure of their coats; the cardiac portion
                    being lined with cuticle, and the pyloric division having the usual villous and
                    secreting surface. The former may be regarded as a reservoir for the food, while
                    the latter is the part which performs the function of digestion. The undigested
                    state in which the contents of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500265"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0265-0706"/>the stomach is found in the former, and its
                    altered appearance in the latter, corroborate this view of the different offices
                    of these two portions of the stomach. The rabbit agrees with the bare in this
                    conformation. The coecum is of enormous size; it extends to a length which is
                    greater than that of the whole animal; it is curiously convoluted, and is lined
                    internally with a peculiar spiral fold or valve. The urinary bladder is
                    peculiarly large in the hare</p>
                <p>(962.) The retina exhibits very distinct and beautiful medullary striae, which
                    pass, for the most part, in a transverse direction. The glandula Harderi is
                    found in these animals, and unites itself with the proper lacrymal gland, but is
                    distinguishable by its whiter colour. Both the hare and the rabbit have a slit,
                    opening into the lacrymal canal, which serves as a substitute for the puncta
                    lacrymalia. Sebaceous sinuses exist on the outer side of the upper jaw, near the
                    nasal bones; whence a large quantity of a viscid adipose substance is secreted.
                    Cavities are also formed in the groins, called by Pallas, <hi rend="italic"
                    >antra</hi><hi rend="italic">inguinalia,</hi> which contain a strongly odorous
                    substance prepared by the neighbouring subcutaneous glands.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Tardigrada.</hi></p>
                <p>(963.) The tardigrade mammalia are distinguished by having the same peculiar
                    distribution of the arteries of the limbs which we have already noticed in the
                    lemur tardigradus. They possess neither coecumnor gall-bladder. The stomach of
                    the sloth is complicated in its structure, being divided into several pouches;
                    the intestinal canal is very short; there is also at its extremity an approach
                    to the structure of the cloaca of birds, inasmuch as the rectum and urethra have
                    a common termination. The zygoma is furnished with a large descending process,
                    which comes from the os malae.</p>
                <p>(964.) The two-toed sloth <hi rend="italic">(bradypus didactylus)</hi> has
                    twenty-three ribs on each side. We have already noticed the apparent anomaly
                    presented by the three-toed sloth, (the <hi rend="italic">bradypus
                    tridactyhis)</hi> in its seeming to possess nine instead of seven cervical
                    vertebrae; this appearance being given to the two last of these vertebrae, which
                    are, in fact, dorsal, by the ribs which are attached to them being very short,
                    and rudimental in their conformation, (see§91L) In the anteater and manis, which
                    belong to Cuvier’s family of the edentata, the six last vertebrae of the neck
                    are anchylosed cr united so as to form only one bone.</p>
                <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Monotremata.</hi></p>
                <p>(965.) The singular animals which compose this family of mammalia, instituted by
                    Μ. Geoffroy, arc all inhabitants of the continent of Australia, so fertile in
                    extraordinary productions in every department of natural history. They are
                    included in the genus ornithorhyncus, and are distinguished into the three
                    species of paradoxus, histrix. and setosus.</p>
                <p>(966.) Although they arc not furnished with abdominal pouches like the kangaroo
                    and other marsupial animals, yet they are provided with two bones corresponding
                    in their position to the marsupia] bones, already described (§ 952), as attached
                    to the bones of the pubis, and supporting the abdominal viscera. The number of
                    ribs in the ornithorhyncus is seventeen. Pouches exist in the cheek of the
                    animal. The bill, shaped like that of the duck, is abundantly furnished with
                    nerves, chiefly from the second branch of the fifth pair. Its teeth have no
                    fangs which sink into the jaw, as in most quadrupeds, but are merely imbedded in
                    the gum, and are very peculiar in their shape. In the ornithorhyncus paradoxus,
                    there is one on each side of either jaw; it consists of a horny substance of an
                    oblong shape, flattened at the surface, and adhering to the gum. There are
                    likewise two horny processes at the back of the tongue, which are directed
                    forwards, and prevent the food from passing into the throat before it has been
                    sufficiently masticated. The tongue is very short, not an inch long, and the
                    moveable portion not half an inch; its surface is beset with long conical
                    papillae. The ornithorhyncus hystrix has six transverse rows of pointed horny
                    processes at the back of the palate, and about twenty similar teeth on the
                    corresponding part of the tongue. The intermaxillary bones are of a very
                    singular shape, consisting of two hooked pieces joined together at their
                    bases.</p>
                <p>The stomach of the ornithorhyncus hystrix is lined with cuticle, furnished at the
                    pyloric extremity with sharp horny papillae. There is no valve of the colon, nor
                    is there any coecum, although we find an appendix vermiformis. They possess a
                    cloaca at the termination of the rectum, as in birds.</p>
                <p>(967∙) Sir Everard Home denied the existence of mammae in the female
                    ornithorhyncus; but these glands have been distinctly delineated by Meckel, and
                    described by him as being largely developed. In a paper since read to the Royal
                    Society, Sir Evcrard Home again asserted that further inquiry had convinced him
                    of the non-existence of these glands; but in a paper subsequently read to that
                    learned body,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>December
                    15, 1831.</p></note> Mr. Griffin describes the mammae of the ornithorhyncus
                    paradoxus as considerable glands, which occupy the greater part of the under
                    surface of the animal, and have numerous excretory ducts perforating the skin in
                    two circumscribed places, but not forming any elevations analogous to nipples.
                    This subject has, since that period, been investigated with great care by Mr.
                    Owen,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Philosophical
                    Transactions for 1832, p. 517. See also his paper in the Transactions for 1834,

                    account given by Meckel, and he is accordingly led to regard them as real
                    mammae. The falx, as well as the tentorium, contains a plate of bone. The
                    external auditory passage is very long and tortuous, and there are only two
                    ossicula in the internal ear. A singular kind of clavicle is found in the
                    skeleton of these animals, common to both the fore extremities, and situated in
                    front of the ordinary clavicles, bearing some analogy to the furcular bone of
                    birds. The conformation of the ribs also exhibits an approach to that of birds.
                    Each rib consists of two pieces of bone; a longer one joined to the spine, and a
                    shorter connected with the sternum; the two being united by an intermediate
                    cartilage.</p>

                <p>(968.) In this natural family of animals, which was established by Storr, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Prodromus Methodi Animalium,</hi> the elephant first claims
                    our notice. In addition to the thick integument common to all the animals of
                    this tribe, we find that remarkable organ, the <hi rend="italic">proboscis,</hi>
                    which is a prolongation of the nose, formed of a double cylindrical tube,
                    extremely flexible in all directions, endowed with exquisite sensibility,and
                    terminating in an appendix very much resembling a finger, all the functions of
                    which it is capable of performing. The motions of this admirable organ are
                    executed by an infinite number of muscular fibres, collected into small bundles,
                    which pass in a great variety of directions, and are continually interlaced with
                    one another, so as to be adapted to the performance of every kind of movement.
                    The enormous tusks which are given to the animal as formidable weapons of
                    offence, are merely developements of incisor teeth, proceeding from the
                    inter-maxillary bones in the upper jaw, and which on issuing from the mouth are
                    incurvated upwards.</p>
                <p>(969·) That part of the cranium which corresponds to the frontal sinuses is
                    enormously enlarged; the two tables of the skull being separated to a
                    considerable distance from one another, the intermediate space being occupied by
                    a vast number of cells, which are full of air, and communicating with the throat
                    by means of the Eustachian tube. Camper has very ably pointed out the advantages
                    resulting from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500278" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0278-0707"
                    />this structure, by the increase of surface it affords for the attachment of
                    the great muscles of the lower jaw, neck, and proboscis, and for the
                    augmentation of their mechanical power. The frontal and parietal bones become
                    united at a very early period with all the other parts of the cranium, so as to
                    form a bony cavity in which no trace of sutures can be discerned. The tympanic
                    bone, however, is distinct from the temporal. The optic foramina commence from a
                    single canal, which receives the two optic nerves. A rudiment only of the nasal
                    bones is observable; and the same remark is also applicable to the ossa unguis,
                    or lacrymal bones; neither can we trace the existence of any lacrymal gland, or
                    lacrymal sac, or any passage for the tears into the nose. The foramen ovale in
                    the base of the cranium is very large. Between the arched sides of the upper
                    part of the cranium, a broad and deep depression is met with, having a small
                    longitudinal crest in the bottom.</p>
                <p>(970∙) Between the eye and the orifice of the external ear, a gland of large size
                    is situated, occasionally secreting a brown fluid, which oozes out through an
                    opening in the skin. There are twenty ribs on each side; and there appear to be
                    only three lumbar vertebrae. The ligamentum nuchae is of great size and
                    strength, for it has to support the enormous weight of the head with its
                    ponderous tusks and proboscis. The articulation of the thigh bone with the
                    pelvis, is destitute of the ligamentum teres, which is found in almost all other
                    quadrupeds. The toes are five in number, but they are almost concealed by the
                    thickness of the skin of the foot in which they are encased. The condyles of the
                    lower jaw are simply rounded eminences. The form and structure of the teeth are
                    very peculiar, and afford distinctive characters of the different species of
                    elephants, which belong more properly to natural history. In addition to the
                    usual component parts of bones and of enamel, a third is superadded, called the
                    <hi rend="italic">crusta</hi><hi rend="italic">petrosa,</hi> which fills up the
                    interstices left by the duplications of the enamel. The ivory which composes the
                    tusks is exceedingly dense, and differs considerably in its structure from the
                    ordinary bone of other teeth. It is distinguished by the curved lines which pass
                    in different directions from the centre of the tusk, forming by their
                    decussation, a regular arrangement of curvilinear lozenges. The tusk is
                    constructed by the successive deposition of osseous matter from within, being
                    secreted from the outer surface of the vascular pulp, which occupies the central
                    part of the growing tusk. Hence, iron balls, fired at the animal, have been
                    known to penetrate the latter soft portion, and to remain fixed in the interior
                    of the tusk, till they were completely covered over, and imbedded in the
                    successive depositions of ivory.</p>
                <p>(971.) The stomach is simple in its structure; the intestines are voluminous, the
                    coecum of great size, and the colon large, long, and divided into cellular
                    compartments. There is no gall-bladder. The ductus choledochus forms a pouch
                    between the coats of the intestine, as it does in the cat, for the reception of
                    the pancreatic duct.</p>
                <p>(972.) The snout of the tapir bears a slight resemblance to the proboscis of the
                    elephant; being, although much shorter, extremely mobile, and provided with a
                    very complex arrangement of muscles.</p>
                <p>s (973.) The rhinoceros is furnished with a rough and slightly elevated surface
                    of the large nasal bones, consolidated into one bone, for the attachment of the
                    horn which is supported upon it. Such, at least, is the structure in the
                    one-horned rhinoceros; in the two-horned spccics it is the front horn to which
                    this description applies; for the posterior horn rests on a similar process of
                    the os frontis. Like the elephant, the rhinoceros has no gall-bladder.</p>
                <p>(974.) In the hog we also meet with a considerable developement of the frontal
                    sinuses. The molar glands are large, and their openings very conspicuous. There
                    are two considerable membranous bags in the throat, situated above and in front
                    of the ligaments of the glottis. Two small flat bones are found at the base of
                    the heart, at the origin of the aorta from the left ventricle. Their use has
                    been supposed to be that of giving support to the valves of the aorta.</p>
                <p>(975.) The peccari, or Mexican musk-hog, has a remarkable gland situated in the
                    back, near the sacrum; it is composed of several lobules, the ducts of which
                    unite into one canal, which passes through the skin, and pours out a secretion
                    having a scent similar to musk. A singular dilatation is often met with in the
                    aorta of this animal, as if it were affected with aneurism.</p>
                <p>14. <hi rend="italic">Solipeda.</hi></p>
                <p>(976.) This family comprehends the horse, ass, zebra, and quagga. The great
                    interest attached to all that relates to the horse, from its utility to man, has
                    occasioned its anatomy, the study of which is the foundation of the veterinary
                    art, to be cultivated with peculiar zeal. The principal circumstances worthy of
                    notice in the osteology of this animal are the following. As is the case with
                    most quadrupeds whose necks are very long, the cervical vertebrae have very
                    short spinous processes. The dorsal vertebrae, the number of which of course
                    corresponds with that of the ribs, being eighteen, and sometimes nineteen, have,
                    on the contrary, very large and broad spinous processes. The space from the
                    first to the eighth vertebra, is called the <hi rend="italic">withers,</hi>
                    against which the <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> PP <hi rend="superscript">
                    er</hi> P <hi rend="superscript"> art</hi> °f the shoulder rests. There are six
                    lumbar vertebrae, having strong spinous, and also broad and long transverse
                    processes. Large lateral processes also extend from the sacrum, which is
                    composed of five consolidated portions; and the united spinous processes of
                    these are likewise exceedingly prominent. The tail is formed of eighteen
                    cylindrical pieces, which, towards the extremity, have nearly the softness of
                    cartilage.</p>
                <p>(977.) The true ribs are, on each side, eight in number, the remaining ten or
                    eleven being joined to the sternum by cartilage. The sternum is composed
                    originally of seven pieces of bone united into one. Its anterior extremity is
                    sharp-pointed, like the prow or keel of a ship. In the pelvis of the horse,
                    denominated the <hi rend="italic">haunch,</hi> we find the ilium, or hip-bone,
                    extended in three directions, above, below, and behind, forming three large
                    processes, for the attachment of the strong muscles which surround the hip
                    joint. The ischium is much extended, forming a strong process posteriorly for a
                    similar purpose. This elongation of the ischium has been termed, from its
                    figure, the <hi rend="italic">processus</hi><hi rend="italic">triquetrus
                    ischii.</hi> By removing the point of attachment of the muscles to a greater
                    distance from the axis of motion, it gives them the mechanical advantage of
                    acting by a long lever. The symphysis of the pubis (or the junction of the bones
                    of that name) is remarkable for its depth, thus affording an extensive surface
                    for the attachment of muscles.</p>
                <p>(978.) The bones of the extremities of the horse are constructed on the same
                    general model as the human, though varying much in the details of their form and
                    relative proportions; and some parts only appearing in an imperfect or
                    rudimental state. The scapula is of an oblong triangular shape, considerably
                    narrower and longer than the same bone in the human skeleton, and exhibiting
                    only faint traces of the acromion and coracoid processes. Its axis is nearly in
                    the same line with the os humeri, which latter bone is very short, and scarcely
                    descends below the line of the chest, and possesses scarcely any rotatory motion
                    on the scapula. The radius and ulna are consolidated together; the olecranon is
                    much elongated. The carpus, or as it is vulgarly called, the knee, of the horse,
                    is composed of seven, or sometimes eight, small bones, disposed as in the human
                    carpus, in two rows; though with respect to their individual form, they have but
                    little resemblance to the latter.</p>
                <p>(979∙) That part of the skeleton which corresponds to the metacarpus is, in the
                    horse, consolidated into a single bone <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500291"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0291-0708"/>termed the <hi rend="italic">shank,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">canon bone,</hi> to which are united behind, and on the side, two
                    much shorter and very slender bones, called the <hi rend="italic">styloid,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">splint bones,</hi> frequently found consolidated with the
                    canon bone by ossific union. It is only the latter, or principal bone, that is
                    articulated with the next, <hi rend="italic">or pastern bone,</hi> which
                    corresponds with the first phalanges of the fingers, and may be regarded as the
                    consolidation of these five bones into one. In like manner, the second phalanges
                    are consolidated in the horse into the next bone of the foot, which is termed
                    the <hi rend="italic">coronet bone,</hi> and which is articulated by a divided
                    condyle with the <hi rend="italic">coffin bone,</hi> of which we shall presently
                    speak. Before proceeding, however, we must notice two or three small rounded
                    bones placed at the back of the pastern joint, (between that and the shank bone)
                    which correspond in their office to sesamoid bones, and which have accordingly
                    received that appellation.</p>
                <p>(980.) The coffin bone corresponds in situation to the third phalanx of the
                    fingers. It supports the single hoof; from which this family of mammalia derive
                    their characteristic name. Connected with this is a small bone, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">shuttle bone.</hi></p>
                <p>(981.) In the posterior extremity we find a very similar arrangement of bones.
                    The thigh bone is unusually short, scarcely extending beyond the trunk of the
                    body, when surrounded by its muscles. The glutaei muscles, and especially the
                    glutaeus medius, are particularly powerful in their action for extending the
                    thigh backwards, and performing the motion necessary for kicking. There is a
                    process in this bone of the horse which is not observed at all in the human os
                    femoris; it is a strong curved spine, situated on the outside, opposite to the
                    lesser trochanter. It has been termed the <hi rend="italic">processus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">recurvatus femoris.</hi></p>
                <p>(982.) The <hi rend="italic">patella</hi> of the horse is large, thick, and very
                    prominent. From the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> there arises a small spinous
                    process, which may be considered as the rudiment of a fibula. The tarsus, or <hi
                    rend="italic">hock,</hi> is composed of six or seven bones, and forms a very
                    obtuse angle with the tibia, when the horse has his foot to the ground. The
                    astragalus differs from the human bone of that name, by having two very large
                    and prominent condyles. The metatarsal bo⅞es correspond in every respect with
                    those of the carpus already described.</p>
                <p>(983.) In the skull of the horse we may observe that the temporal bone is divided
                    by a suture into the squamous and tympanic portions. The occipital bone has a
                    deep depression in the middle, where the cervical ligament is attached. The
                    antrum maxillare and turbinated bones arc of great size. The lower jaw-bone is
                    also very large, and presents a very extended surface for the attachment of
                    muscles.</p>
                <p>The horse is provided with a large salivary apparatus of glands. Its stomach is
                    divided into two portions; the first of which, next to the oesophagus, is lined
                    with a cuticular membrane which terminates in a loose expansion, supposed to
                    have the office of a valve, and to prevent the possibility of the animal’s
                    vomiting. There are generally found adhering to its coats a great number of the
                    larvae of the oestrus cqni, and the oestrus haemorrhoiclalis, called in common
                    language, <hi rend="italic">botts.</hi> The intestinal canal is of great length,
                    the large intestine alone being twenty-four feet in length. The colon is very
                    capacious, and divided into cellular compartments. The liver is large, divided
                    by deep indentations into lobes, and unprovided with a gall-bladder.</p>
                <p>(984.) The peculiar sound produced in neighing is ascribed to the presence in the
                    trachea of a delicate membrane, attached by its middle to the thyroid cartilage,
                    and of which the two extremities pass along the external margins of the rima
                    glottidis. The Eustachian tube opens, not immediately over the larynx, but into
                    a sac peculiar to this tribe of animals, situated on the lateral parts of the
                    lower jaw; and these cavities then open by a long fissure, furnished with a
                    cartilaginous valve, into the pharynx.</p>
                <p>(985.) The eye of the horse presents a remarkably beautiful and delicate
                    structure in the folds of the internal membrane of the corpus ciliare. The pupil
                    is oblong, the superior margin of the iris having a fringed appearance.</p>
                <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Puminantia.</hi></p>
                <p>(986.) The anatomy of the ruminant family of quadrupeds, which comprises so many
                    of those animals that man has domesticated and rendered subservient to his most
                    urgent wants, has also very strong claims on our attention.</p>
                <p>(987.) In their skeleton they correspond very closely with the horse, of which we
                    have already given so detailed a description. The principal differences arc
                    observable in the terminal bones of the extremities, each limb presenting us
                    with two hoofs, instead of one, and a corresponding division of the metatarsal
                    bones and phalanges into two. On the other hand, the slender traces of a fibula
                    met with in the horse, disappear in the ox and other animals of this tribe.</p>
                <p>(988.) The whole track of the alimentary canal in these animals presents us with
                    objects of interest. The tongue is covered with a thick cuticle, provided with
                    pointed papillas, which, being directed backwards, arc fitted for laying firm
                    hold of the grass, and tearing it up from the roots. The salivary glands are
                    extremely large; the coats of the oesophagus particularly strong and muscular,
                    in subservience to the function of rumination peculiar to this tribe. The organs
                    provided for digestion are more complicated than in any of the animals we have
                    yet considered. There are no less than four cavities which have been regarded as
                    performing the office of stomachs. The first is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >paunch,</hi> which is a capacious reservoir, abundantly supplied with secretion
                    from its coats, which are beset with numerous flattened papillae. The second
                    is,the <hi rend="italic">honey-comb</hi> stomach, so named from the reticulated
                    appearance of its inner membrane, the folds of which are disposed in polygonal
                    lines, somewhat resembling the hexagonal margins of the cells of the honey-comb.
                    The third stomach, which is the smallest, is termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >manyplies,</hi> and contains a great number of broad folds, or duplicatures of
                    its inner membrane, which have been compared to the leaves of a book. The
                    fourth, or the <hi rend="italic">reed,</hi> has a pyriform shape, an internal
                    villous coat, and a structure altogether analogous to that of the simple
                    stomachs of carnivorous animals. It terminates in the beginning of the
                    intestinal canal. A groove extends from the termination of the oesophagus along
                    the edge of the three first stomachs, at the part where they communicate
                    together; the edges of this groove are thick, so as to admit, when brought into
                    close contact, <hi rend="italic">oh</hi> forming a canal for the direct
                    communication of fne oesophagus with any one of these four stomachs.</p>
                <p>(989∙) The grass which the animal takes into the mouth undergoes but a small
                    degree of mastication, and passes, on being swallowed, into the paunch, where it
                    undergoes maceration, and is transferred, by small portions at a time, into the
                    honey-comb, or second stomach, which serves to perform an auxiliary office to
                    the first. Thence it is sent up again directly through the oesophagus into the
                    mouth, for the purpose of undergoing a second and more deliberate mastication,
                    which the animal performs when reposing, and from which it appears to enjoy
                    considerable pleasure. After being thus ruminated it is again swallowed, and the
                    sides of the groove being brought into contact, so as to constitute a canal, and
                    exclude all passage into the first or second stomachs, it passes directly into
                    the third stomach; whence, after having been subjected to the further action of
                    the secretions of that organ, it is transferred to the fourth or last stomach,
                    where the process of digestion is completed. Liquids drunk by the animal pass at
                    once into the second stomach, and assist in the maceration of its contents. But
                    the milk taken by the calf, requiring to be neither macerated nor ruminated, is
                    conveyed directly from the oesophagus into the fourth stomach.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500304" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0304-0709"/>
                <p>(990.) The biliary organs present us, in horned cattle, with numerous
                    hepato-cystic ducts, conveying the bile immediately from the liver to the
                    gall-bladder, which cyst is found in all the animals of this order, though it is
                    absent in the horse. The urinary bladder is particularly large. In like manner,
                    as we found in the pig, two small bones arc met with also in ruminants, at the
                    origin of the aorta; and the same purpose has been assigned to them as in the
                    former instance. In the stag, these have been called the <hi rend="italic">bones
                    of the heart.</hi></p>
                <p>(99L) The internal carotid artery, at its entrance into the cranium, is suddenly
                    subdivided into numerous branches, which are variously contorted, and afterwards
                    re-united at the basis of the brain. The intention of this curious structure,
                    which has been termed the <hi rend="italic">rete mirabile,</hi> appears to be to
                    diminish the impetus with which the blood would otherwise be forced into the
                    arteries distributed to the brain; a force which would be increased by the
                    effect of gravity when the animal stooped in grazing. The frontal sinus, and
                    other parts connected with the sense of smell, are much developed. The lacrymal
                    bones and ossa nasi are of considerable size. The tapetum is particularly
                    conspicuous in the eyes of ruminants. One or two additional small bones are
                    found among the ossicula auditus. The mastoid cells are numerous, and in the
                    arrangement of their compartments somewhat resemble a ripe poppy head. In the ox
                    and the sheep, the superior ligament of the glottis, as well as the ventricles
                    of the larynx, are absent.</p>
                <p>(992.) Ruminant animals are distinguished into two tribes, the first consisting
                    of those which are without horns; the second, of those provided with horns. Of
                    the former, the camel is remarkable for the great expansion of the hoof, which
                    adapts it for treading upon sand. It has seven lumbar vertebrae. A peculiar
                    moveable bag, glandular in its structure, exists behind the palate, probably
                    designed for the lubrication of the throat: it has received the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">bursa</hi><hi rend="italic">faucium.</hi> Connected with the
                    paunch is a large receptacle divided into numerous cells, for the purpose of
                    holding water, as in a natural reservoir. Hence, when a camel dies in the
                    desert, the Arabs open the stomach, and quench their thirst with the water it
                    contains, which is found to be pure and wholesome. Like the horse, it has no
                    gallbladder. It has no fibula; but this latter bone is met with in the musk,
                    which is also a hornless ruminant.</p>
                <p>(993.) The horned ruminants have an eminence on the os frontis for supporting the
                    horn. This process is in the stag a real bone, remarkable for the rapidity of
                    its growth, which is annual, and for its death and separation from the skull at
                    certain periodic intervals. The osseous bases of the horns of the ox, the sheep,
                    the goat, and the antelope, on the contrary, are permanent, and are invested
                    with a horny covering, which has a structure very different from bone. The
                    cameleopard, or giraffe, on the other hand, has two osseous prominences, which
                    remain permanently covered with the integuments, and are even surmounted by a
                    tuft of hair. But the details relating to organs so external as the horns fall
                    more properly within the province of natural history.</p>
                <p>(994.) The rein deer has, like several of the baboon tribe, large laryngeal sacs
                    on the front of the neck, communicating with the larynx.</p>
                <p>(995.) In the ox and sheep the spleen is remarkable for being of a distinctly
                    cellular structure. In these animals we find a great developement of the
                    salivary glands, and more particularly of the submaxillary gland, which extends
                    along the side of the larynx quite to the back of the pharynx.</p>
                <p>16. <hi rend="italic">Cetacea.</hi></p>
                <p>(996.) From the consideration of the quadrupeds of the class mammalia, we pass
                    now to that of a tribe of animals which, although warm-blooded and mammiferous,
                    are formed on a model adapting them for inhabiting the water; nature having
                    bereft them even of the rudiments of hinder extremities. The bones of the spine
                    are continued, without being interrupted by an interposed pelvis, into the
                    vertebrae of the tail, which terminates in a horizontal fin. The head and trunk
                    are united by a neck, so short as to exhibit scarcely any diminution of
                    diameter, and containing cervical vertebrae, which are extremely compressed, and
                    the greater number of which are consolidated together by a bony union. The
                    superior extremities are supported by bones, which have no medullary cavities,
                    and which, compared with the analogous bones of quadrupeds, are much shortened
                    and compressed. They do not admit of motion amongst themselves, and being
                    enveloped by a tendinous membrane, are reduced to the office of fins. The
                    internal organs correspond, however, with that of other mammalia. Cetacea
                    breathe by means of lungs, their circulation is double, and they are
                    warm-blooded. The females are viviparous, and are provided with mammae for the
                    nourishment of their young.</p>
                <p>(997.) The necessity of occasionally receiving air into the lungs, whilst the
                    animal is generally immersed in water, renders it requisite that a provision
                    should be made for their readily rising to the surface in order to breathe.
                    Hence the movements of the tail are from above downwards; hence in the cachalot
                    and other kinds of whale, a large quantity of oil is accumulated round the head,
                    which gives greater buoyancy to this part of the body. Hence, also, when the
                    animal, in seizing its prey, takes into the mouth a large quantity of water,
                    there is a necessity of getting rid of it, which is effected by its transmission
                    into a sac placed at the external orifice of the nasal cavity, whence it is
                    expelled with great force, by the contraction of powerful muscles, through a
                    passage which conducts it to the top of the head. In this way are produced the
                    enormous spouts of water that mark the track of the whalc on the surface of the
                    sea.</p>
                <p>(998.) The olfactory organs are not adapted to the possession of any accurate
                    sense of smell, being furnished neither with turbinated bones nor with any
                    considerable nerves. The larynx rises in a pyramidal form into the posterior
                    part of the nostrils, in order to receive the air from those passages, and
                    convey it to the lungs, without its being necessary for the animal to extend
                    more than the end of the snout above the surface of the water. The glottis is
                    simple, and is not interrupted by any projecting membranes.</p>
                <p>(999∙) The stomach is composed of as many as five, or sometimes even of seven
                    distinct pouches. There is no coecum or appendix vermiformis; and the
                    gall-bladder is absent in the greater number. The spleen is divided into a
                    number of small globular lobes. The kidneys are conglomerate. The brain is
                    large, and its hemispheres much developed. The tympanic bone is separated from
                    the rest of the cranium, adhering to it only by ligamentous connexions. There is
                    no external ear; the stapes is nearly solid; in the walrus it exhibits no
                    perforation. The ossicula, semicircular canals, and other parts of the labyrinth
                    of the internal ear are remarkably small. The external meatus is cartilaginous,
                    and so small, that its external orifice in the dolphin will only just admit a
                    pin. It pursues a winding course through the fat, which is of great thickness,
                    until it reaches the tympanum. The Eustachian tube opens at the blowing hole,
                    and is furnished with a valve preventing the admission of the water which the
                    animal expels through that passage. The lacrymal organs are entirely wanting;
                    the sclerotic coat of the eye is very thick at its posterior part, so that
                    although the eye-ball has exteriorly a spherical form, the figure of the
                    vitreous humor is very different; its structure at the back of the eye has the
                    hardness of cartilage.</p>
                <p>(1000.) In many parts of the arterial system of the cetacea, we find reticular
                    plexuses, or convolutions of the vessels, the purpose of which is probably to
                    serve as reser»</p>

                <p>voirs of arterial blood, for the use of the system, when the animal is long under
                    water.</p>
                <p>(1001.) In the trichecus manatus borealis, or manati, a gland of the size of the
                    human head is found between the coats of the stomach, near the oesophagus,
                    discharging, on pressure, a fluid resembling the pancreatic juice.</p>
                <p>(1002.) The whale is remarkable for having, in place of teeth, an apparatus
                    apparently intended for filtration, and consisting of plates of the substance
                    called <hi rend="italic">whalebone,</hi> descending vertically into the mouth
                    from the lower surface of the upper jaw, into which they are fixed by a
                    ligamentous substance. On each side their number amounts to three or four
                    hundred. The inner edge of each plate has its fibres detached so as to form a
                    kind of fringe, which retains the small fishes and mollusea on which the animal
                    feeds. The lower jaw is unprovided with any similar appendages. Although there
                    are no teeth in the upper jaw, yet an intermaxillary bone is still present.
                    Rudiments of teeth exist in the interior of the lower jaw before birth, lodged
                    in deep sockets, and forming a row on each side. The developement of these
                    imperfect tecth, however, proceeds no farther,’and they disappear at an early
                    period. The tongue, which is supported by an os hyoides of singular shape, is
                    very thick and fleshy. The oesophagus is exceedingly narrow. The stomach is
                    complicated in its structure. The intestinal canal is of considerable length,
                    and contains a great number of longitudinal folds. There is a short coecum. The
                    mesenteric glands contain large spherical cavities, into which the trunks of the
                    lacteals open, and where the chyle is probably blended with secretions proper to
                    those cavities. The eye is extremely small in comparison with the size of the
                    animal; and it occupies but a small portion of the orbit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Comparative Physiology of
                    Birds.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">General Description.</hi></p>
                <p>(1003.) The whole of this class of animals exhibits great uniformity in its
                    comparative anatomy; insomuch that the whole may easily be comprised in one
                    general description. The structure of every part of the frame of birds is
                    adapted to facilitate rapid progression through the air; for which purpose the
                    anterior extremities are converted into wings, and are not employed in any other
                    action. The support of the body when the animal is not flying, is entrusted
                    solely to the posterior extremities; so that birds are, strictly speaking, <hi
                    rend="italic">bipeds.</hi> Hence we may trace some degree of approximation to
                    the human structure in the conformation of the skeleton.</p>
                <p>(1004.) The bones are dense in their texture, but are at the same time rendered
                    light by having large cavities, occupied, not with marrow, as in the mammalia,
                    but with air. There is a smaller proportion of cartilaginous to osseous
                    structure in the skeleton of birds than in that of quadrupeds.</p>
                <p>(1005.) The neck of birds being required to be very flexible, we find the
                    cervical vertebrae very numerous, and freely moveable upon one another. The swan
                    has twenty-three cervical vertebrae. Those of the back, on the other hand, are
                    perfectly fixed and immoveable, their spinous processes being large and often
                    united by osseous substance, so as to preclude the possibility of any relative
                    motion. As the ribs occupy the whole of the sides of the trunk, there are
                    properly no lumbar vertebrae. The os coccygis is short and compressed; and can
                    scarcely be regarded as a proper tail, although it affords support to the long
                    feathers which constitute what is usually called the tail of birds. The pelvis
                    consists almost entirely of a broad os innominatum, the lateral portions of
                    which are widely separated, in order to admit of space for the developement of
                    the eggs; and for the same reason the two ossa pubis do not join to form a
                    symphysis, but are at a considerable distance from one another. The exceptions
                    to this general rule will be noticed afterwards.</p>
                <p>(1005.) The number of true ribs never exceeds ten pair; the false ribs are
                    numerous, and directed forwards. Those which occupy the middle of the body are
                    distinguished by a flat process, directed upwards and backwards. The sternum is
                    composed of five pieces, and is of great size and strength. From the middle of
                    its lower surface there rises a sharp process, or spine, resembling the keel of
                    a ship, and evidently adapted to accommodate the large and powerful pectoral
                    muscles, which take their rise from this part of the chest, and which act in
                    depressing the wings.. The bones which connect the wings to the trunk are
                    apparently three in number; the coracoid process of each scapula being distinct
                    and largely developed bones, having the semblance of ordinary clavicles, whilst
                    the real clavicles are consolidated into a single bone, denominated the <hi
                    rend="italic">furcular bone,</hi> from its resemblance to a fork, and which in
                    the fowl is better known by the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >merry-thought.</hi> Its extremities rest on two strong processes of the
                    scapula. Many anatomists, considering the coracoid as the true clavicles, have
                    regarded the furcular bone as an additional, or supplementary clavicle,
                    corresponding to the coracoid apophysis.</p>
                <p>(1006.) The bones of the wing are analogous in their divisions and distribution
                    to those of the upper extremity in man: there being a humerus, radius, and ulna;
                    two carpal bones; and two metacarpal bones, generally consolidated into one; one
                    bone corresponding to that of the thumb and two fingers; that next to the thumb
                    consisting of two phalanges, and the outer one, of a single bone.</p>
                <p>(1007.) In the legs we find a femur and a tibia, to which there adheres a very
                    slender fibula, (which is, indeed, often wanting ;) one metatarsal bone, and the
                    phalanges of the toes. The patella is often supplied by a process from the
                    tibia.</p>
                <p>(1008.) The muscles possess a high degree of irritability, and contract with
                    great quickness and force. Many of the tendons become ossified in the progress
                    of age. A remarkable arrangement exists in the tendons of the flexor muscles of
                    the toes, by which the flexion of the knee and heel puts them on the stretch,
                    and thus mechanically bending the toes, enables the bird to lay firm hold of the
                    branch of a tree or perch whilst roosting. This is effected by the flexor
                    tendons passing round over the outer side of the angle formed by each of these
                    joints. Thus a bird, while roosting, supports itself on one leg only, by the
                    mere effect of the weight of the body producing the necessary flexion of the
                    toes, to enable it to preserve its hold. This remarkable provision of nature was
                    long ago observed, and well explained by Borelli; and though the fact has been
                    controverted by Vicq. D’Azyr, it appears to be well established. In order to
                    give great latitude of motion to the head, the articulation of the os occipitis
                    with the atlas is performed by a single condyle only, which procures it the
                    advantages of a ball and socket joint. This condyle is situated at the anterior
                    margin of the great occipital foramen. The proper bones of the cranium are not
                    joined by sutures, but are consolidated into a single piece. The orbits for the
                    eyes are very large, and are frequently found to communicate laterally in the
                    skeleton, being separated, in the living animal, only by a thin membranous
                    partition. The ossa unguis are generally very large. The upper jaw is almost
                    always moveable upon the other bones of the head. To this bone is joined the
                    bill, the structure of which is horny, and thus supplies the place of teeth,
                    occupying the situation of the palate. The functions of the teeth, indeed, are
                    not wanted, for the animal swallows its food without any mastication. The lower
                    jaw is connected with the skull by the intermedium of a peculiar bone of
                    irregular form, called the <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quadratum.</hi> Another small bone resting against the palate is connected with
                    it.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500330" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0330-0711"/>
                <p>(1009∙) The energy of the digestive functions in birds* corresponds with that of
                    respiration, and muscular irritability. The stomach may be considered as
                    consisting of three cavities; the first of which, termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >crop,</hi> is rather a dilatation of the oesophagus, furnished with numerous
                    glands disposed in a regular arrangement of rows; the second is the <hi
                    rend="italic">ventriculus succenturiatus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pro-ventriculus,</hi> situated lower down, and just at the entrance of the
                    proper stomach. It is furnished with a still more complex glandular apparatus;
                    and hence has been termed the <hi rend="italic">bulbus glandulosus.</hi> Its
                    form and structure vary much in different genera of birds. The third is the
                    proper stomach, which resembles in the structure of its coats the simple
                    stomachs of the mammalia, being thin and membranous in those birds which feed on
                    insects and flesh. But in all granivorous birds the coats of this stomach are
                    farther armed with a thick cuticular lining, of nearly the density of horn,
                    which is surrounded by four immensely thick and powerful muscles, capable of
                    exerting a strong compression on the contents of the stomach, and a slight
                    degree of lateral motion, and thus performing the office of trituration. Such is
                    the structure of what is called a <hi rend="italic">gizzard.</hi> Between these
                    opposite structures there exists, in different species of birds, a great number
                    of intermediate gradations, corresponding to the peculiar nature of the food to
                    which nature has adapted their organization. The trituration of the grain is
                    assisted by small stones voluntarily swallowed by the animal, and in the
                    selection of which the animal is directed by a principle of instinct.</p>
                <p>(1010.) The intestinal canal of birds is much shorter than in most of the
                    mammalia; but a similar disparity is also noticed in the former, with regard to
                    the greater length of the canal in birds consuming vegetable food, when compared
                    with that of the carnivorous tribes. There is scarcely any distinction in point
                    of size between the small and large intestines; though the division between them
                    is generally marked by the presence of two coeca. The rectum terminates in an
                    expansion, termed the <hi rend="italic">cloaca,</hi> in which the ureter
                    terminates, and which therefore performs the function of the urinary bladder.
                    Connected with the cloaca, there is an oval glandular bag termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">bursa fabricii,</hi> and opening into it by a narrow longitudinal
                    aperture. The oviduct in the female also opens into the same cavity. Two blind
                    pouches, opening into the rectum, are found near to its termination.</p>
                <p>(1011.) The liver of birds is usually divided into two lobes; but in some birds
                    there is in addition a third smaller lobe. Two ducts proceed from the liver; the
                    one is the hepato-cystic duct, the other the hepatic duct. The former conveys
                    the bile into the gall bladder, the latter into the duodenum. Thus the bile is
                    conducted into the duodenum by one hepatic duct distinct from the cystic duct,
                    and these two alternately with two or three ducts from the pancreas, which is
                    large, and generally consists of two distinct glands; the spleen, on the other
                    hand, is usually round, and of small size. The gall-bladder is situated under
                    the right lobe of the liver; but some birds have no gall-bladder. There is no
                    omentum. The chyle is transparent; there are no glands in the mesentery; the
                    thoracic duct is double. Magendie has denied the existence of lymphatic vessels
                    in birds; but they have been distinctly seen by others. ' The kidneys form a
                    double row of conglobate glands, connected together, and situated on the sides
                    of the lumbar vertebrae, in the hollows of the ossa innominata. There is no
                    cavity corresponding to the pelvis of the kidneys of the mammalia; but renal
                    capsules, similar to those of mammalia, are found also in birds.</p>
                <p>(1012.) The heart of birds is furnished, as in the mammalia, with a double set of
                    cavities; the one subservient to the general or systemic, and the other to the
                    pulmonary circulation. The valves of the right ventricle are supplied by a
                    strong triangular muscle, which gives additional impetus to the blood propelled
                    into the pulmonary artery. Jacobson has discovered a singular distribution in
                    the abdominal veins; those returning the blood from the hinder extremities being
                    ramified through the kidneys and liver, previously to their termination in the
                    vena cava.</p>
                <p>(1013.) The lungs are not divided into lobes, and are fixed in their situation,
                    being tightly braced in the cavity formed by the ribs, on each side, by a
                    membrane, which is perforated by a number of holes. These apertures are the
                    terminations of collateral branches of the bronchiae, through which the air
                    received into the chest passes out, and circulates through a multitude of cells
                    interspersed through various parts of the body, and communicating ultimately
                    with the central cavities of the bones. An immense surface is thus exposed to
                    the influence of the air, which, having access to every part of the body, acts
                    very extensively on the blood circulating in the vessels lining these air-cells
                    and cavities. Hence the energy of the function of respiration is greater, and
                    the temperature higher, than in any of the mammalia. There is properly no
                    diaphragm in birds; a few muscular fibres only surround the larger air-cells,
                    and assist in expelling the air from them back again into the lungs. The trachea
                    is supported by a series of cartilages, which form entire rings, and overlap
                    each other at their upper and lower margins, so as to preserve the tube open
                    amidst the violent bendings and twistings of the neck. It is provided, at its
                    bifurcation, with a peculiar set of muscles, which, aided by a second rima
                    glottidis, enable this part to perform the functions of a second larynx, and to
                    give rise to sounds; and, indeed, to be apparently the principal organ of the
                    voice. In many aquatic birds, as in the male swan, the trachea makes a large
                    circumvolution, which is contained in the hollow of the sternum. In other birds
                    it is not enclosed in this bone; but there is a bony structure surrounding the
                    inferior larynx, which tends to strengthen the voice. These convolutions and
                    bony cells of the trachea, have been compared in their office to the turns of
                    the French-horn, or the divisions of a basoon. This great developement of the
                    vocal organs is peculiar to the male bird.</p>
                <p>(1014.) The brain of birds is characterized by the smallness of the hemispheres,
                    which are not united by any corpus callosum. There is no appearance of
                    convolutions on its surface. The optic thalami are voluminous, and are situated
                    behind and below the hemispheres; a cavity is found in each. The crura of the
                    cerebellum do not form any eminence at their junction with the medulla
                    oblongata, corresponding to the pons varolii. The cerebellum is comparatively
                    large, but has no lateral lobes, being almost wholly constituted by the
                    processus vermiformis. The total bulk of the brain, compared with the size or
                    weight of the body, is generally greater than in the mammalia.</p>
                <p>(1015.) The eyes of birds are very large, in proportion to the size of the head,
                    and appear to be adapted to a great range of vision. The adjustment of the
                    position of the lens appears to be effected by means of a vascular and plicated
                    membrane, called the <hi rend="italic">marsupium,</hi> extending obliquely from
                    the bottom of the retina, through the vitreous humor, to the edge of the
                    crystalline. Its figure is trapezoidal; its surface is covered with the
                    pigmentum nigrum, which of course absorbs all the rays of light that fall upon
                    it. The anterior part of the eye-ball is, in many carnivorous birds,
                    strengthened by a circle of bony plates, lying close upon the sclerotica, and
                    overlapping each other. Besides the two external eye-lids, birds are always
                    provided with a strong nictitating membrane, proceeding from the internal corner
                    of the eye, and drawn over the cornea by a special muscular apparatus. In some
                    birds the lower eye-lid is the most moveable, and in others it is the upper.</p>
                <p>(1016.) There is no cartilaginous external ear; what has this appearance in the
                    owl is formed only by the feathers; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500343"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0343-0712"/>the cavity of the tympanum contains only one
                    ossiculum auditus, and communicates with the air-cells of the skull. The
                    Eustachian tubes have a common opening over the arch of the palate. The part
                    corresponding to the cochlea has the figure of a cone, with scarcely any
                    curvature, but with two scalae. The semicircular canals are large, and project
                    from the bone.</p>
                <p>(1017.) The nasal organs are unprovided with an aethmoid bone; the olfactory
                    nerves passing to them through the orbits, and being distributed upon the <hi
                    rend="italic">bullae turbinatae,</hi> which are oftener cartilaginous than
                    osseous in their structure.</p>
                <p>(1018.) The tongue is thick and fleshy, covered with a thick cuticle, and
                    therefore not adapted to be an organ of taste. It is supported by an os hyoides
                    of a singular shape, having besides the anterior and posterior processes, and
                    the cornua, with their appendices, another bone jointed to it anteriorly, and
                    moveable on it. This last bone, which supports the tongue, is called <hi
                    rend="italic">the lingual bone</hi><hi rend="italic">&gt;-</hi></p>
                <p>(1019.) The evolution of the chicκ from the egg being a subject of great
                    interest, has long engaged the attention of physiologists. The following is an
                    outline of the history of these changes in the common fowl. The ovulum, or first
                    rudiment of the egg, is formed in the ovary, and consists simply of a bag
                    containing the yolk; this afterwards becomes covered in its progress along the
                    oviduct, by successive layers of albuminous substance, which composes the white
                    of the egg, so called from the colour it assumes when coagulated. The white of
                    the egg is invested with a firm membrane, which is easily divisible into two
                    layers; and there are also other membranes dividing the mass of albumen into
                    concentric layers. The membrane of the yolk, the <hi rend="italic">membrana
                    vitelli,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">yolk-bag,</hi> is connected with that of the
                    white, or the <hi rend="italic">membrana albuminis,</hi> by a kind of ligament,
                    which extends from the two ends or sides of the yolk, to those of the white;
                    these, when partially stretched and torn by the motion of the yolk, have a
                    flocculent appearance, and form what are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chalazae.</hi> They appear to act as ligaments to the yolk, keeping that
                    surface uppermost in which the chick is situated, so that it may receive warmth
                    from the hen during incubation. In the lower part of the oviduct the egg
                    acquires a calcareous covering or shell, which is secreted by the inner membrane
                    of that canal, and which is composed of nine-tenths carbonate of lime, the
                    remaining portion being phosphate of lime and animal matter. Between the two
                    membranes which line the shell, a small quantity of air is contained at the
                    larger end of the egg.</p>
                <p>(1020.) A small, round, milk-white spot, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cicatricula,</hi> is formed on the surface of the yolk-bag during incubation.
                    It is surrounded by two or three concentric circles, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">halones.</hi> Previously to the appearance of the embryo, a small
                    shining spot of an elongated form, with rounded ends, but contracted in the
                    middle, is seen within the cicatricula. This is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >areola</hi><hi rend="italic">pellucida.</hi> In the centre of this may be
                    discerned, on the second day, a gelatinous filament, bent into a curve. This is
                    the <hi rend="italic">primitive trace,</hi> or earliest perceptible rudiment of
                    the chick, in which the first organs that can be discovered are the two lobes of
                    the brain, and the primitive filaments of the spinal cord, with the caudal
                    dilatation. Vessels begin to appear on the surface of the yolk-bag, being spread
                    on a separate membrane, and presenting what has been called <hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> ∖)λq</hi><hi rend="italic">figura venosa,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >area</hi><hi rend="italic">vasculosa,</hi> the marginal vessel at the remotest
                    part being termed the <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >terminalis.</hi> These veins correspond to the mesenteric veins; they are
                    collected together, and form the vena portae, whilst the arteries are derived
                    from the mesenteric artery of the chick. The heart may next be perceived, as
                    three red pulsating points, constituting the <hi rend="italic">punctum
                    saliens.</hi> These points are the rudiments of the auricle, ventricle, and
                    aorta. Next, the separate vertebrae may be distinguished, then the eyes, and
                    afterwards the stomach, liver, and intestines. Then a vascular membrane, the <hi
                    rend="italic">allantois,</hi> is rapidly formed, having the form of a bladder
                    communicating with the cloaca. It soon extends over nearly the whole of the
                    internal membrane of the shell, and is covered with numerous ramifications of
                    arterial and venous vessels, derived from the internal iliacs of the chick; the
                    former contain carbonized blood, and are therefore dark coloured; the latter,
                    which conduct back the same blood after it has received the influence of the air
                    at the surface, have a bright scarlet hue, and unite in forming the umbilical
                    vein of the chick. Hence it is evident that this membrane performs a function
                    analogous to that of the placenta in mammalia, and to that of the future
                    air-cells of the lungs, or, in other words, that it is the organ of embryonic
                    respiration. The chick is nourished by the matter of the yolk, which is partly
                    absorbed by yellow vessels <hi rend="italic">(vasa vitelli lutea)</hi> having a
                    fringed appearance, and flocculent extremities, floating in the yolk, and partly
                    by the direct passage of this matter into the intestine by means of a canal of
                    communication, called the <hi rend="italic">ductus vitello-intestinalis.</hi>
                    The white of the cgg also gradually disappears, being absorbed into, and mixed
                    with the yolk. Towards the latter periods of incubation, the whole of the
                    yolk-bag is taken into the abdomen, and soon disappears. On the twenty-first day
                    of incubation, the chick, being fully formed, breaks the shell which confines
                    it, and enters into the world; for which temporary purpose it is provided with a
                    hard beak, which is afterwards lost.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">PĞculiarities in particular Families and Genera of
                    Birds.</hi></p>
                <p>(1021.) The shades of difference in the anatomy of each organ in individual
                    genera and species of birds, are exceedingly numerous, and to enter into their
                    detail would far exceed the limits within which we are obliged to confine
                    ourselves in this treatise. We must not, however, pass over some of the most
                    remarkable differences which offer themselves to our notice in a few families of
                    birds. Amongst these none are more singular than those presented by the tribe of
                    the brevipennes of Cuvier, comprehending the ostrich and the cassowary. These
                    birds not being intended for flight, have very imperfectly formed wings; the
                    sternum exhibits no carinated figure, but presents a plane and uniform surface,
                    being destitute of an inferior spine; the pectoral muscles of the hinder
                    extremity, on the contrary, are very large and powerful. The furcular bone
                    exists only in a rudimental state. The pelvis of the ostrich differs from that
                    of all other birds in being closed below by the complete junction of the ossa
                    pubis. The coeca in this bird are furnished with a remarkable spiral valve. The
                    feathers are also exceedingly peculiar; but as this subject belongs rather to
                    the external characters, we cannot dwell upon it here.</p>
                <p>(1022.) The same consideration prevents us from dilating on the varieties in the
                    structure of the bill, and of the toes, which offer to the naturalist abundant
                    topics of interesting inquiry. We shall only remark that the cellular bills,
                    which are of such enormous size in the levirostres, have free communications
                    with the air cells subservient to respiration, and may therefore be auxiliary to
                    that function.</p>
                <p>(1023.) The tongue of the woodpecker is provided with a singular apparatus for
                    darting it forwards with great rapidity; this is effected by a long
                    cartilaginous band, which passes completely over the top of the cranium, and is
                    fixed to a groove on the right side of the upper jaw.</p>

                    Reptiles.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Reptiles in General.</hi></p>
                <p>(1024.) The class of reptiles comprehends all those vertebrated animals which
                    breathe atmospheric air by means of lungs, but which are cold-blooded. This
                    latter quality <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500356" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0356-0713"
                    />is a consequence of the partial extent of their respiration, the heart being
                    so constructed as to transmit to the lungs only a portion of the circulating
                    blood, and the remaining part being again sent into the arterial system of the
                    body without having been exposed to the action of the air. Reptiles arc
                    distinguished by the negative characters of being destitute of either hair or
                    feathers, and having no mammae, organs for which there appears to be no
                    occasion, in consequence of these animals being oviparous. The limited degree in
                    which their blood is oxygenated appears to have a considerable influence on the
                    whole condition of their vital functions. Not only is the temperature of the
                    blood scarcely different from that of the surrounding medium,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The temperature of animals of

                    Czerm&lt;∙jck, and Wilford, to be in general two or three degrees higher than
                    that of the surrounding medium. It partakes, however, of the vicissitudes in the
                    temperature of that medium.</p></note> the actions of life seem to be more
                    sluggish and torpid, and the muscular powers less energetic; their sensations
                    are more obtuse, and in cold climates they pass the winter in a state of torpor.
                    The comparative smallness of the pulmonary system of vessels, and the less
                    extent of the surfaces of the air-cells of the lungs, render them less dependent
                    on respiration than warm-blooded animals; hence they bear submersion under water
                    for a considcrablc time with impunity, although, if the interruption to
                    respiration be too long continued, they ultimately perish, with as much
                    certainty as any of the mammalia would do under similar circumstances.</p>
                <p>There is ground for believing, according to Geoffroi St. Hilaire, that crocodiles
                    and turtles possess, in addition to the ordinary pulmonary respiration, a
                    partial aquatic abdominal respiration, effected by means of two channels of
                    communication which have been found to exist between the cavity of the abdomen
                    and the external surface of the body, and also that some analogy may be traced
                    between this aquatic respiration in reptiles, by these <hi rend="italic"
                    >peritoneal canals,</hi> and the supposed function of the swimming bladder of
                    fishes, hereafter to be described, in subserviency to a species of aerial
                    respiration.</p>
                <p>(1025.) As their vital functions do not require for their performance any
                    elevated temperature, so we findreptiles destitute of those appendages to the
                    integuments, such as hair, wool, or feathers, which in the other classes retain
                    the warmth of the body. Their brain is very small compared with the rest of the
                    nervous system, being less necessary for the exercise of the vital actions. The
                    parts immediately instrumental in sensation are less concentrated in a
                    particular spot, but would appear to be more diffused over the spinal cord and
                    ganglia. Thus they not only continue to live, but even exhibit motions which
                    have the semblance of being voluntary, though probably not so in reality, long
                    after the loss of the brain, or even of the entire head. In like manner the
                    irritability of their mnsclcs is retained for a much longer time, after they
                    have been separated from the body, than in the case of warm -blooded animals.
                    The heart, when removed from the body, still continues to beat for several
                    hours; and the body, thus deprived of its heart, may still possess the power of
                    voluntary motion, in consequence of the continuance of a species of obscure
                    circulation, which is carried on in the capillary system of vessels.</p>
                <p>(1026.) Reptiles present a much greater variety of forms and of structures than
                    is met with in any other class of vertebrata. The characters of the orders are
                    derived principally from the form of their organs of progressive motion. These
                    orders are four in number, namely, <hi rend="italic">chelonia,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sauria,</hi><hi rend="italic">ophidia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >batrachia.</hi></p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Chelonia.</hi></p>
                <p>(1027.) This order comprehends turtles and tortoises, animals whose skeleton
                    presents a trunk composed of two large plates of bone, the one derived from an
                    expansion of the dorsal vertebrae and ribs, the other from a corresponding
                    expansion of the sternum; these are united at the edges, and form a complete
                    case for the thoracic and abdominal viscera, leaving apertures in front for the
                    head and neck, together with the fore legs, and behind for the hind legs and
                    tail. This arrangement produces a singular reversal of the positions of the
                    scapula, the pelvis, and the muscles attached to these bones, all of which,
                    instead of being placed externally, are situated in the interior of the ribs.
                    The humerus is remarkably curved, especially in the tortoise, where it has
                    nearly the form of a semicircle. The radius and ulna are distinct from each
                    other; the carpus and phalanges are short and stunted, forming a compressed sort
                    of hand. The vertebrae of the neck and tail are the only parts of the spinal
                    column which are moveable upon one another.</p>
                <p>(1028.) The cavity in which the brain is contained is very small compared with
                    the size of the skull, the greater part of which consists of the bones
                    surrounding the orbit, and giving attachment to the large muscles that move the
                    jaw. There are no teeth, and the horny coverings of the jaws has some
                    resemblance to a horse’s hoof in the mode of its connexion with the bones. The
                    tongue is short, and covered with villi, which extend also down the oesophagus;
                    their points are all directed towards the stomach, so as to prevent the return
                    of the food when it is once swallowed. The stomach is simple in its structure;
                    the intestinal canal of moderate length; its inner membrane presenting only
                    longitudinal folds, together with innumerable villi, which are more thickly set
                    in the upper part of the canal than in the lower; there is no coecum, but
                    occasionally small processes, or appendices epiploicae, are attached to the
                    outer membrane. The urinary bladder is exceedingly capacious. The lungs are
                    voluminous, and are contained in the same cavity as the abdominal viscera. The
                    air-cells are very large, and the general texture of the lungs is loose.
                    Respiration is performed entirely by the muscles of deglutition; the animal in
                    fact closes its mouth, and swallows the air received from the nostrils, which is
                    thus poured down into the trachea, the os hyoides being alternately raised and
                    depressed. The liver is divided into two round irregularly-shaped masses.</p>
                <p>(I029.) The heart has two auricles, separated by a complete septum, the one
                    receiving the blood from the venae cavae, the other from the pulmonary veins.
                    The ventricle into which these veins pour their contents is single, but has two
                    chambers of unequal size, which communicate together, so that the blood received
                    from the lungs is more or less mixed with that returning from the body in the
                    systemic circulation; and it is this mixed blood which is sent through the
                    aorta. The pulmonary artery is merely a branch of the aortic system.</p>
                <p>(1030.) In the internal ear, we find a tympanum, Eustachian tube, and
                    semicircular canals, together with ossicula, and also stony concretions in the
                    vestibule. The eye has a bony ring at the anterior part of the sclerotica, as in
                    birds. There are large lacrymal glands, and a very moveable membrana
                    nictitans.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Sauria.</hi></p>
                <p>(1031.) The various animals included in this order, or the tribc of lizards, have
                    a heart with two auricles, with generally four feet, and a sealyintegument. They
                    are always provided with teeth, and with nails; there is invariably a tail. The
                    ribs are very moveable, and their motions are subservient to respiration. The
                    lungs are long and vesicular, extending far into the abdominal cavity.</p>
                <p>(1032.) The crocodile may be taken as an example of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193500369" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0369-0714"/>this order. Its jaws are of
                    immense size. The upper jaw consists of a large intermaxillary bone, which is
                    immoveably joined with the skull,although the animal, in opening the mouth,
                    appears to raise it independently, a circumstance which misled the older
                    naturalists into the belief, that it was really moveable. There is an os
                    quadratum as in birds. The sternum extends to the abdomen, and consists of seven
                    pair of cartilaginous arches, to which ten ribs, not however reaching to the
                    spine, are attached. There are no clavicles. The tongue is thick and flat, and
                    attached very near its edges to the jaws, so as not to be easily perceived.</p>
                <p>The teeth are of the simple conical kind chiefly adapted to the prehension and
                    retention of the food; and each tooth when worn, is replaced by a fresh one,
                    which grows underneath it; a succession which takes place several times during
                    the life of the animal.</p>
                <p>The oesophagus has the shape of a funnel, and leads to a stomach which resembles
                    thatofgranivorousbirds,in the thickness of its coats, and the approximation of
                    its two apertures. The liver has two distinct lobes. There is no urinary
                    bladder. The single ventricle of the heart is divided into three compartments,
                    which communicate together; there is one cavity belonging to each auricle, and
                    an intermediate cavity, into which the blood from the two others is poured, and
                    where the intermixture of the carbonized and oxygenated portions is made. There
                    is an external meatus of the ear, which may be voluntarily closed by a species
                    of lips. Ossicula auditus are found, as well as stony concretions in the
                    vestibule. In the other kinds of lizards, the tympanum is on a level with the
                    integuments, and there is no external meatus. A membrana nictitans is found in
                    the eye. The area of the section of the cavity containing the brain does not
                    occupy the one-twentieth part of that of the whole head.</p>
                <p>(1033.) The chameleon has comparatively a large head; but its brain is only of
                    the size of a pea. Its lungs have numerous projecting processes. The tongue is
                    constructed in a manner which bears some analogy to that of the woodpecker in
                    the mechanism by which it is darted forwards to a considerable distance from the
                    head, and suddenly retracted. It terminates in a sort of club, which is
                    moistened with a glutinous secretion, for seizing flics and other insects, and
                    its upper surface is hollowed. The eyes project considerably from the head, and
                    admit of being turned very freely in their orbits. The most singular
                    circumstance in the constitution of this animal, is the change of colour of its
                    skin under various circumstances of temperature or excitement. These changes
                    appear to be connected with the variable activity of respiration, which quickly
                    influences the colour of the blood circulating under the very transparent skin;
                    and which is visible to a greater depth, in consequence of the ample extension
                    of the lungs along the sides of the abdomen: when the lungs are inflated,
                    indeed, the whole body appears as if it were semi-transparent.</p>
                <p>(1034.) The draeo volans is a remarkable instance, in this tribe, of the
                    subserviency of the ribs, which are expanded on each side so as to support a
                    thin membrane resembling a wing, to the purposes of progressive motion.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Ophidia.</hi></p>
                <p>(1035.) Serpents, being wholly without feet, are constrained to crawl upon the
                    surface of the earth, and are, therefore, more especially entitled to the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">reptiles.</hi></p>
                <p>(103G.) Their skeleton presents us with the simplest possible condition of the
                    vertebral type; for it consists merely of a simple spinal column descending from
                    the head, and furnished only with ribs. There appears, at first sight, to be no
                    vestige either of sternum, of scapula, or of pelvis; the body of each vertebra
                    is articulated by a convex surface, which is received into a concave surface of
                    the next. The number of vertebrae is often exceedingly great; being sometimes as
                    many as three hundred. The number of the ribs corresponds with that of the
                    vertebrae, and when acted upon by their muscles, they assist in the progressive
                    motion of the animal, by pressing on the ground, in succession, like imperfect
                    feet. In the rattle-snake, the last vertebrae of the tail are broad and covered
                    with the hollow pieces which compose the rattle. Obscure rudiments of pelvie
                    boncs were found by Mayer to exist in the anguis fragilis, the anguis ventralis,
                    and the typhlops crocotatus; and it is probable that they may be discovered in
                    most reptiles of this order. Some serpents have external claws, which may be
                    considered as rudiments of feet. In others they exist concealed under the skin;
                    and in others, again, there are cartilaginous filaments which Mayer regards as
                    rudimental claws, connected with a series of small bones, which appear to be the
                    rudiments of the bones of the lower extremities.</p>
                <p>(1037·) The upper jaw -bone is detached from the rest of the skull, and admits of
                    great latitude of motion. In most species of serpents, the jaws are so
                    constructed as to render the mouth capable of great dilatation, and to enable it
                    to receive objects even larger than the animal itself, and a corresponding power
                    of dilatation exists also in the oesophagus.</p>
                <p>(1038.) Serpents that are not venomous have usually four maxillary bones in the
                    upper jaw, beset with small tecth, placed in two rows, widely separated from one
                    another. The external row is not found in venomous serpents, but in their place
                    large tubular fangs are met with, which are the terminations of the ducts from
                    the poison bags, and which convey the venom into the wound inflicted by the
                    tooth. This poison is secreted by glands, situated below the eyes, and
                    surrounded by very strong muscles.</p>
                <p>(1039.) The stomach of serpents can scarcely be distinguished from the lower
                    extremity of the oesophagus, and is very short, compared with the great length
                    of that canal. There is no urinary bladder, the ureters opening at once into the
                    cloaca.</p>
                <p>(1040.) The heart has generally two auricles, though in some genera only one is
                    met with; the ventricle is always single. The lungs consist of a membranous
                    cavity, on the sides of which there are cells; their form is exceedingly
                    elongated. The lung on one side is often much smaller than the other. The tongue
                    is long and slender, and forked at the extremity; its root is contained in a
                    kind of sheath, whence it can be protruded and retracted at pleasure. There is
                    properly no tympanum belonging to the ear; but the long process of an ossiculum
                    is found under the skin, and is connected with a tympanic bone.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Batrachia.</hi></p>
                <p>(1041.) The batrachia, (so termed from the Greek name of the frog, which may be
                    assumed as a type of this order,) have a heart consisting of only a single
                    auricle and ventricle; when arrived at maturity, they are possessed of two
                    lungs; but in the earlier stages of their growth, they are wholly aquatic
                    animals, and breathe like fishes by means of gills, which are affixed to the
                    sides of the neck, by cartilaginous arches connected with the os hyoides. Such
                    is the condition of the tadpole, which is the young of the frog. The aorta, on
                    its exit from the heart, sends branches to each of the gills; whence the blood
                    is collected by corresponding veins, that unite near the back to form a single
                    arterial trunk, which again ramifies and distributes the blood to every part of
                    the body, including the rudimental lungs, which are not yet developed In the
                    process of the transformation of the tadpole into the frog, though these
                    branchial arteries become obliterated, yet the vessels which supply the lungs
                    remain, and are afterwards the channels of pulmonary respiration.</p>
                <p>(1042.) In the skeleton of the frog, in place of ribs, small slender cartilages
                    affixed to the extremities of the transverse<pb break="no" facs="nls:193500382"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0382-0715"/> processes of some of the vertebrae, which in the
                    dorsal vertebrae are very broad. The spine is short, and terminates behind in a
                    straight sacrum, which is impacted into the fork-shaped or innominatum. The
                    scapula is thin and flat; and, together with the clavicles, are united to the
                    sternum; but as there are no ribs, these, with the bones of the anterior
                    extremities, are detached from the rest of the skeleton. There are properly no
                    teeth; but the margin of the jaws is serrated. The urinary bladder exists, and
                    is even sometimes double.</p>
                <p>(1042.) The lungs do not collapse on opening the chest; this arises from the
                    power which the frog possesses of distending them by the muscles of the mouth;
                    the respiration being conducted on a plan similar to the one which has been
                    already described in the tortoise, (§ 1027). Many species, as the pipa, have the
                    vocal organs much developed. The tongue is of great length, and doubled back in
                    the mouth; jt is thrust forwards to a considerable distance in seizing its prey,
                    and retracted with great rapidity. There is no external meatus to the ear; but
                    the membrana tympani is external, and appears as part of the integument. The
                    Eustachian tube opens at the fauces by an expanded mouth. There are two ossicula
                    auditus; and the vestibulum contains rudiments of the calcareous bodies met with
                    in other reptiles, and still more remarkably in fishes. The eye has two fleshy
                    eye-lids, and also an internal nictitating membrane, which is transparent and
                    horizontal in its direction.</p>
                <p>(1043.) The salamander is constructed on the same model as the frog, with regard
                    to all its internal organs; but it is provided with a. tail. Its ear has no
                    tympanum; but there is merely a cartilaginous plate laid over the fenestra
                    ovale; there is no third eye-lid. The skeleton presents small rudimental ribs,
                    but no sternum. This animal is remarkable for the power it possesses of
                    reproducing the parts which have been mutilated, such as entire limbs; and even
                    the eyes. In the newt, or aquatic salamander, the lungs have numerous processes,
                    as in the chameleon, which terminate behind in an elongated bladder.</p>
                <p>Müller has lately discovered that the frog, and several other animals of the same
                    family, are provided with large receptacles for the lymph, situated immediately
                    under the skin, and exhibiting distinct and regular pulsations, like the heart.
                    The use of these <hi rend="italic">lymphatic hearts</hi> is evidently to propel
                    the lymph in its proper course along the lymphatic vessels. Their pulsations do
                    not correspond in time with those of the sanguiferous heart; nor do those of the
                    right and left sides take place at the same moment; but they often alternate in
                    an irregular manner.</p>
                <p>(1044.) The proteus anguinus, the siren, and the amphiuma, are remarkable for
                    possessing both gills, like the tadpole, and lungs like the frog. They are,
                    accordingly, adapted for living both in water and in air; and are the only
                    animals that can strictly be said to be amphibious. The eye of the protcus is
                    completely covered by the integuments, as it is in the mus typhlus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV— <hi rend="italic">Comparative Physiology of
                    Fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>(1045.) Fishes are vertebrated animals with red blood, breathing by means of
                    water applied to thegills, or <hi rend="italic">branchiae,</hi> which in them
                    supply the office of respiratory organs. Their powers of motion are adapted to
                    progression through the medium they inhabit. This design is conspicuous in the
                    form of their bodies, the great muscularity of the tail, the shortness of their
                    members, which are expanded into fins, and the coverings of the body, which are
                    smooth and scaly. The oxygenation of the blood, being effected solely by means
                    of the atmospheric air contained in the water they respire, takes place only to
                    a small extent; hence the temperature of the body in fishes is not sensibly
                    raised above that of the surrounding medium, and these animals display little
                    energy either in their vital or their sensitive powers. The brain, accordingly,
                    is of small size, and the organs of the external senses but little developed;
                    they scarcely possess any organs calculated to convey accurate impressions of
                    touch. Nature has denied them any vocal organs. The circumstances in which they
                    are placed would appear to give little exercise to the sense of hearing; and the
                    deep recesses of the ocean, where darkness eternally reigns, afford as little to
                    that of sight. No lacrymal organs are wanted by animals immersed in a liquid
                    medium. The voracity with which fishes devour their prey, leaves them scarcely
                    any opportunity of discriminating its taste; and their tongue is not adapted by
                    its structure for receiving the impressions of this sense. Neither can the sense
                    of smell be exercised in the same degree as in animals respiring atmospheric
                    air, through which odorous emanations are so extensively and so rapidly
                    diffused. Exclusively occupied in the two great objects of animal desire, that
                    of food and of progeny, all their movements appear exclusively directed to these
                    ends; they appear insusceptible of attachment, and incapable of any but the
                    lowest degree of intellectual developement.</p>
                <p>(1046.) The osteology of fishes presents a very complicated subject of study, not
                    only from the great number of peices of which their skeleton is composed; but
                    also from the great variety of forms exhibited in the different genera and
                    species of this class. Fishes, with regard to their skeleton, admit of a great
                    primary division into the cartilaginous and osseous. The former, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">chondropterygii,</hi> possess no real bones, but merely <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> cartilages, having the form of bones, of a
                    homogeneous and semitransparent substance, sometimes, however, as in the rays
                    and sharks, presenting on its surface small calcareous granules, very closely
                    compacted together. In a few fishes arranged under this division, as the
                    sturgeon, and the chimera, we meet with several true bones in the head and
                    shoulder, while the rest of the skeleton is cartilaginous. Even among the
                    strictly osseous fishes, the density of the bones of some species is inferior to
                    that of others, the calcareous substance, or phosphate of lime, being deposited
                    in fibres, or layers, in the cartilage which serves as the basis of the bone.
                    The truly osseous fishes have bones as hard and as dense as other vertebrated
                    animals; they are even more homogeneous in their texture, and present no
                    appearance of pores or of fibres, as are seen in the bones of the mammalia. We
                    never find in them any medullary cavities.</p>
                <p>(1047.) The spinal column consists of dorsal and caudal vertebrae only, those of
                    the neck and sacrum being absent. The bodies of vertebrae have always a conical
                    depression on both their surfaces; the double cone thus left by the junction of
                    their margins being filled with a gelatinous fluid. These cavities generally,
                    indeed, communicate together throughout the whole spinal column by apertures in
                    the centre of each vertebra, at the apices of the cones. In the lamprey this
                    opening is so wide, as to reduce the vertebral column to a mere series of rings,
                    traversed from one end to the other by a ligament. The spinous processes are
                    usually very long, and their roots form a canal for the passage of the spinal
                    cord. Spinous processes are also frequently found on the opposite or abdominal
                    side of the vertebrae; and these also form a canal for the protection of the
                    aorta, which is admitted through it. The ribs are attached each to a single
                    vertebra, and are frequently furnished with appendices adhering to them at one
                    end, whilst the other end is imbedded in the muscles.</p>
                <p>(1048.) The fins of fishes do not present much analogy with the bones of the
                    extremities of quadrupeds, although such analogies have been sought with much
                    eagerness. The fins are composed of parallel bones called rays, which are
                    connected with others, called by Cuvier, <hi rend="italic">interspinal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bones,</hi> and by Meckel, <hi rend="italic">accessory spinal
                    apophyses.</hi> The sternum, where it exists, is composed of a series of bones,
                    of various figures in different fishes; but which unite the lower extremities<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193500395" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0395-0716"/> of the ribs. In
                    the pectoral fin, or anterior extremity, are found bones somewhat analogous to
                    the two bones which compose the scapula of reptiles; a styloid bone composed of
                    two pieces, analogous perhaps to the clavicle and coracoid bone. The two bones
                    corresponding to the radius and ulna are connected with a row of ossicula
                    representing the carpus, and which support the rays of the fin itself.</p>
                <p>(1049.) The posterior extremity, or base of the ventral fin, is composed of four
                    bones, which may be considered as a pelvis; but these support the rays, without
                    the interposition of any bones comparable to the femur, tibia, or tarsus.</p>
                <p>(1050.) The bones of the head are exceedingly complex, and the mere enumeration
                    of them would require a more lengthened discussion than can here be afforded.
                    The bones composing the jaws, namely, the maxillary and intermaxillary, are not
                    only moveable on the skull, but also on each other. The palatine, the pterygoid,
                    and the tympanic bones, have also independent motions. A row of sub-orbitar
                    bones also exists, different from what is met with in any other class. To the
                    bones of the skull are joined also the opercular system of bones, 'which protect
                    the gills, and are subservient to the motions which open and close them during
                    respiration. The proper bones of the skull are placed in the midst of these four
                    systems, and are very similar to those of reptiles, containing a receptacle for
                    the brain, another for the labyrinth of the ear, and others for the eyes, and
                    for the nasal cavities'. The os frontis is composed of six pieces; the parietal
                    of three; the occipital of five; each temporal of two; and the sphenoidal of
                    five. Much ingenuity has been lavished in the attempt to discover analogies
                    between these bones and the parts which compose the skeleton in the other
                    classes of animals. Thus the opercular bones have been supposed to correspond to
                    the ossicula auditus of mammalia; a notion which, although ably supported by
                    Geoffroy St. Hilaire, may perhaps at first sight appear extremely fanciful and
                    hypothetical, and which Cuvier represents as utterly unfounded.</p>
                <p>(1051.) The teeth of fishes exhibit almost every possible variety in form,
                    number, and situation. They may be distinguished, according to their position,
                    into intermaxillary, maxillary, mandibular, vomerian, palatine, pterygoid,
                    lingual, branchial, and superior and inferior pharyngean. Some fish have almost
                    all these denominations of teeth; others a smaller number, and a few genera of
                    fishes are entirely destitute of teeth. The teeth are generally of a conical and
                    incurvated form, like so many hooks; sometimes the points are so small and
                    united as to resemble a brush or file; others are round, or club-shaped; others
                    present more flat surfaces, like a mosaic pavement. Their structure is always
                    simple, being formed by a single pulpy membrane, which afterwards ossifies; and
                    is, in process of time, replaced by a new tooth. This successive renewal of the
                    teeth of fishes is continued during the whole period of their lives. The degree
                    of mastication given to the food depends, of course, on the form and situation
                    of the teeth.</p>
                <p>(1052.) Deglutition is assisted by means of a membranous velum placed behind the
                    anterior teeth. There is no appearance of salivary organs; unless we regard as
                    such a soft and highly vascular organ found in the palate of the carp. This
                    organ is highly irritable, and swells in a remarkable manner on the application
                    of any stimulus; it perhaps performs the function of an organ of taste.</p>
                <p>(1053.) The oesophagus is generally very short and capacious; it is continued
                    into the stomach without any marked line of separation; and part of the food is
                    often retained in the oesophagus undigested, until room can be made for it in
                    the stomach. In a few fishes, the parietes of the stomach are muscular, so as to
                    entitle it to be considered as a gizzard. The intestinal canal is generally very
                    short; its internal coat is more or less villous; there is never any coecum; the
                    only distinction between the different portions of the canal is formed by a
                    valve near its extremity; but this is not succeded by any dilatation.</p>
                <p>(1054.) A remarkable structure is met witn in the intestines of rays, sharks, and
                    sturgeons; which present a spiral valve, or duplicature of the inner coat,
                    running nearly the whole length of the canal. A great number of blind pouches,
                    or <hi rend="italic">appendices</hi><hi rend="italic">pylaricae,</hi> as they
                    are called, from their being more numerous in the beginning of the intestine,
                    are generally found; their office appears to be to secrete a quantity of mucous
                    fluid, probably analogous to saliva, or to the pancreatic secretion. In the
                    sturgeon, these are short and united by vessels and cellular substance into one
                    mass, which union becomes more close and compact in the rays and the sharks,
                    constituting a real conglomerate gland, having <hi rend="italic">a</hi> single
                    excretory duct.</p>
                <p>(1055.) In many fishes, namely, in the ray, shark, sturgeon, lamprey, and salmon,
                    there are two passages opening outwards from the general cavity of the abdomen,
                    at the sides of the termination of the intestine. The use of these passages is
                    unknown.</p>
                <p>(1056.) The liveris of considerable size, and placed more on the left side; great
                    variety exists with regard to its shape and the number of its lobes in different
                    fishes; its texture is softer than in quadrupeds and birds, and it contains a
                    large quantity of oil. There is almost always a gall-bladder of greater or
                    smaller size. The hepatic ducts are sometimes very numerous, and are
                    successively joined to the cystic ducts. The mesentery is incomplete; and is
                    often prolonged into folds containing fat, which folds may perhaps be considered
                    as corresponding to an omentum. Although the lacteals are numerous, there are no
                    lymphatic glands in the mesentery.</p>
                <p>(1057.) The lymphatic vessels arc very distinct in other parts of the body.
                    Fohman has succeeded in injecting them in the gills. Several fishes have a
                    urinary bladder, which is situated behind the rectum; in other instances there
                    is merely a common cloaca, into which the ureters terminate. The kidneys are
                    more voluminous than in any of the preceding classes, and are often joined
                    together posteriorly; there are no suprarenal glands. The spleen is constantly
                    present, and occupies various situations in the abdomen.</p>
                <p>(1058.) The circulation in fishes is conducted upon a very diffèrent plan from
                    what it is in reptiles. There is, as in warm-blooded animals, one complete
                    circulation for the body in general, or a systemic circulation; and another for
                    the organs of respiration; and besides this, a partial circulation for the
                    hepatic system of organs; but what more particularly characterizes this mode of
                    accomplishing that function is, that branchial circulation is the only one which
                    is effected by a muscular apparatus, that is, by a heart. The systemic
                    circulation has no such organ for communicating to it a mechanical impulse.</p>
                <p>(1059∙) The muscular apparatus for carrying on the circulation in fishes consists
                    of four cavities, namely, the sinus venosus, the auricle, the ventricle, and the
                    bulbus arteriosus; the three latter are inclosed in the pericardium, and may be
                    said to constitute the heart, which is situated underneath the pharyngeal bones,
                    and between the bronchial arches. The blood returning from the veins of the body
                    and head, is collected in the sinus venosus, which transmits it by a single
                    opening into the auricle, valves being interposed at the entrance. The auricle
                    discharges its contents into the ventricle, which again propels it into the
                    bulbus arteriosus, whence it proceeds along the bronchial arteries to be
                    distributed on the gills. Thence it is returned by the bronchial veins, which
                    unite near the spine to form a single arterial trunk corresponding in its office
                    to the aorta, and distributing the blood, by a succession of ramifications, to
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500408" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0408-0717"/>every part of
                    the body The veins from the digestive organs are collected into the vena portae,
                    which as usual ramifies through the liver; and there appears also, from the
                    observations of Mr. Jacobson, to be in addition a lesser venal circulation,
                    independent of either of the former, and analogous to what has already been
                    observed in birds.</p>
                <p>(1060.) The vivifying influence of the air contained in the water which is
                    applied to the gills of fishes, is quite as necessary for the continuance of
                    their vital functions, as that of atmospheric air is to animals of the preceding
                    classes; and fishes perish with equal rapidity as mammalia, when their natural
                    element is withdrawn. This happens whether the water has been deprived of its
                    air by boiling, or whether the absorption of air from the atmosphere is
                    prevented by a body capable of intercepting it, placed on the surface of the
                    water. It appears from the researches of Mr. Ehrmann, that some fishes, as the
                    cobitis, swallow air, which passes along the intestinal tube, where it loses
                    oxygen and acquires carbonic acid. Fishes taken out of the water are killed not
                    so much from the want of oxygen, as in consequence of the drying of the
                    branchiae, which impedes the circulation of the blood through them. The water is
                    taken in at the month, and after acting on the gills, which are filamentous
                    organs, affixed in rows to the branchial arches, and protected by the operculum,
                    is discharged through the branchial openings below. In the cartilaginous fishes
                    there are several openings provided for the outlet of the water, at the side of
                    the head.</p>
                <p>(1061.) Most fishes possess a large bladder full of air, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">sicimming bladder,</hi> placed immediately underneath the spinal
                    column; it communicates with the oesophagus, and sometimes with the stomach, by
                    a canal, called the <hi rend="italic">ductus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pneumaticus.</hi> In the carp, there are valves in this canal which only allow
                    of the passage of air out of the bladder. In many fishes, especially in flat
                    fish, no such air-bladder exists. Its figure is very various; its cavity is
                    generally simple; but it is sometimes divided by a number of partitions. A
                    glandular body is met with in the coats of this bladder, which probably secretes
                    the air. The obvious intention of this instrument is to give greater buoyancy to
                    the fish when this air is present, and to allow of a sudden increase of specific
                    gravity by its escape. In by far the greater number of fishes, however, the
                    air-bladder has no outlet whatever. In many fishes it is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">sound,</hi> and furnishes the best kind of jelly. Isinglass is the
                    product of the air-bladder of the sturgeon. The air it contains is usually
                    nitrogen gas, with a small proportion of oxygen and carbonic acid gases. The
                    swimming bladder of fishes is regarded by many of the German physiologists as
                    having some relations with the function of respiration; and as being the
                    rudiment of the pulmonary cavity of land animals; the passage of communication
                    with the oesophagus being conceived to represent the trachea. (Sec § 1022.)</p>
                <p>(1062.) The brain of fishes is remarkable for the smallness of its size, not only
                    as compared with the total bulk of the animal, or with that of the nerves
                    connected with it, but also with the cavity of the cranium, which it does not by
                    any means fill, the space left being occupied by an oily secretion, and by loose
                    cellular texture. The disparity is less observable in young fish; for it would
                    appear that the growth of the brain does not keep pace with that of the rest of
                    the body.</p>
                <p>(1063.) The several parts which compose the brain of fishes are more detached
                    from one another than in the higher classes, and are placed in a consecutive
                    series. The foremost lobules give rise to the olfactory nerves, or rather appear
                    as the bulbous enlargements of the origin of these nerves. The next in
                    succession are solid lobes, which give origin to the optic nerves; behind these
                    we find larger lobes containing a ventricle, with a striated eminence, at the
                    back part of which are four smaller tubercles corres ponding to the corposa
                    quadrigemina. Behind these is the single lobule of the cerebellum, and below are
                    two inferior lobes. The optic nerves pass before these lobes, and always
                    decussate in their course to the orbits. Between these nerves, and in front of
                    the inferior lobes, is the pineal gland. Behind the cerebellum are also two
                    lobes, which may be termed the posterior lobes. There is, however, much
                    difference of opinion as to the parts in the human brain to which these several
                    portions of the brain of fishes arc analogous.</p>
                <p>(1064.) Great variety is met with in the size, position, and direction of the
                    eyes of fishes. In general, however, they are large. There are neither eye-lids
                    nor lacrymal organs, and’ the globe of the eye has but little mobility. In the
                    ray and shark tribes, it is supported on the end of a moveable cartilaginous
                    pedicle, articulated with the bottom of the orbit. The anabliss has the cornea
                    divided into two by an opaque line, and two perforations exist in the iris, but
                    there is only one crystalline lens, vetreous humor, and retina. The crystalline
                    lens is completely spherical, and of great size, so as to leave but little space
                    for the vitreous humor. It is composed of concentric laminae, which are of
                    greater density as they approach the centre. A falciform ligament, commencing at
                    the entrance of the optic nerve, following its curvature downwards, and
                    containing vessels and nervous filaments, is observable; its extremity is
                    attached to the capsule of the crystalline lens. In some fish this ligament has
                    a black colour, like the marsupium of birds. The sclerotica is often supported
                    by osseous or cartilaginous plates, as in birds. The pupil is incapable of
                    altering its dimensions; in the rays and flat fish, its border is fringed with
                    palmated processes. The cornea is nearly flat, and there is but little aqueous
                    humor.</p>
                <p>(1065.) There is found in the eyes of fishes a peculiar body, the <hi
                    rend="italic">membrana vasculosa</hi><hi rend="italic">Halleri,</hi> having the
                    shape of a horse-shoe, situated between the internal layer of the choroid coat,
                    or <hi rend="italic">tunica Fuyschiana,</hi> and the middle layer; it gives
                    origin to a vascular membrane, called the <hi rend="italic">campanula,</hi>
                    which proceeds towards the lens, and has some analogy with the marsupium.</p>
                <p>(1066.) The gastrobranchus appears to be wholly destitute of any organ of vision.
                    In the blind murena, no trace of an eye can be perceived externally, but a
                    rudimental organ exists beneath the skin.</p>
                <p>(1067.) The ear of fishes consists only of the parts be-, longing to the
                    labyrinth; and these organs are generally suspended in a cavity of the cranium,
                    which is a part of that in which the encephalon is contained. The two vertical
                    semi-circular canals are suspended to the top of the skull by a vertical
                    ligament. The oily or macilaginous fluid which surrounds the brain has free
                    access to the cavities which surround the membranous labyrinth. The three
                    semicircular canals are dilated into ampullae, which receive the filaments of
                    the auditory nerve. There is an appendix to the <hi rend="italic">sinus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">medianus,</hi> or principal vestibular sac, termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">utricle,</hi> and a smaller one termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cysticule.</hi> The hard calcareous bodies consist of one in each of these
                    cavities, being three in number. There is no part corresponding to the
                    cochlea.</p>
                <p>(1068.) In the ray there is a spiral tube, wholly within the skiι⅛ which
                    terminates in a kind of finestra ovale, and appears to be the rudiment of an
                    external meatus.</p>
                <p>(IO69.) Many fishes present the extraordinary phenomena of the developement and
                    accumulation of electricity in large quantities, which they have the power of
                    discharging at pleasure, so as to give strong shocks to animals coming in
                    electric contact with them, or forming part of the circuit of the discharge.
                    This effect is often so powerful as to benumb and paralyse their assailants. The
                    electric fishes which are known to possess this power in a high degree are the
                    electric ray <hi rend="italic">(raia torpedo),</hi> the electric eel, <hi
                    rend="italic">(ggmnotus</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193500421"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0421-0718"/><hi rend="italic">electricus),</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">silurus electricus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">malapterurus
                    electricus.</hi> The first of these arc met with principally in the
                    Mediterranean Sea; the second in several rivers in South America; and the last
                    in the Nile and Senegal rivers. Other fishes, however, are known to be
                    electrical, although they have been less studied than those already mentioned,
                    such as the <hi rend="italic">rhinobatus</hi><hi rend="italic">electricus,
                    trichinus electricus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tetrodon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >electricus.</hi></p>
                <p>(1070.) The electrical organs of the torpedo consist of a great number of five or
                    six-sided prisms, placed on each side of the head perpendicularly to the
                    surface, and occupying the whole thickness of the animal. Each prism consists of
                    a tube, with membranous sides, surrounded with nerves and blood-vessels, and
                    containing a vast number of extremely thin plates, parallel to one another, but
                    in a transverse position; the intervals arc filled with a gelatinous fluid.
                    Three large branches of the par vagum, and one branch of the fifth pair of
                    nerves, are distributed to these organs on each side. The electrical apparatus
                    of the gymnotus and silurus are disposed somewhat differently; they are two in
                    number on each side, and extend the whole length of the fish from the head to
                    the tail. One of these is situated deeply, and the other superficially; the two
                    being separated by a membranous partition, and each being formed of horizontal
                    plates, distant one-third of a line from one another, with septa passing
                    perpendicularly between them, and directed from within outwards, and a fluid
                    occupies the intervening spaces. Their nerves are derived from the intercostals,
                    and arc 224 in number.</p>
                <p>(1071.) The identity of the agent called into play by these organs with
                    electricity is beyond all doubt. The same bodies which conduct or intercept the
                    transmission of the latter, have the same property with regard to the former;
                    and shocks are propagated through a chain of several persons, when those at the
                    extremities of the chain touch the fish.- Electric sparks have been obtained by
                    Walsh from the discharge of the gymnotus when passed through a strip of tin foil
                    gummed to a piece of glass and cut through in the middle. Dr. John Davy<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. for 1832 and
                    1834.</p></note> has obtained electro-magnetic effects from the torpedo, by the
                    test of the galvanometer; and has also rendered needles magnetic by the
                    electrical discharge from the fish.</p>
                <p>(1072.) It appears that the power of producing these electrical discharges is
                    quite voluntary, and dependent on the nervous influence; for it does not take
                    place every time that the fish is touched, and it wholly ceases on the
                    destruction of the brain, or the division of the nerves. The animal appears to
                    have the power also of determining the direction of the discharges; and often,
                    when irritated, it refrains from giving shocks. The destruction of the electric
                    organ on one side does not interrupt the action of the opposite organ. Dr. Davy
                    states, that the dorsal surface is charged with positive, and the ventral
                    surface with negative electricity, and that unless both surfaces be
                    simultaneously touched, no shock is fclt; and Matteuci and Colladon<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Séances de l’Acad. des
                    Sciences, Oct. 1836.</p></note> arrived at the same conclusion by experiments
                    made with the galvanometer, as to the direction of the electric currents.
                    Electric fishes, when vigorous, exert this power as strongly in the air as in
                    the water. Wç are quite in the dark with regard to the theory of these
                    phenomena. Matteuci imagines that the source of electric power in these fishes
                    is in the brain; and that the purpose served by the complex arrangement of
                    parallel plates, with intervening fluid, which composes the structure of the
                    electric organs, is that of mere accumulation, analogous to the property of the
                    Leyden phial.</p>
                <p>(1073.) What may be called the nasal cavities or nostrils of fishes, are placed
                    generally in front of the head, and their openings are a valvular membrane or
                    partition; behind this is found an elegantly plaited membrane, disposed in
                    semicircular folds, on which the ramifications of the olfactory <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> nerves terminate.</p>

                    rend="italic">Physiology of</hi><hi rend="italic">Mollusea.</hi></p>
                <p>(1074.) The class mollusea comprehends all the variety of what are commonly
                    called shell-fish, together with the animals, such as the slug, which resemble
                    them in their anatomical character, but which are not furnished with shells.
                    Their comparative anatomy has been studied with great care and diligence by
                    Cuvier, whom chiefly we shall follow in our general description of this
                    class.</p>
                <p>(1075.) The mollusea have neither articulated skeleton nor vertebral canal. Their
                    nervous system does not present a central spinal cord, but merely a certain
                    number of medullary masses, dispersed in different situations in the body, and
                    of which the largest, which may be designated the brain, is placed near the
                    oesophagus, where it is connected with a collar of nerves that embraces that
                    tube. The circulation is always double, like that of fishes, that is to say, the
                    pulmonary circulation is always complete in itself, as well as the systemic. But
                    the muscular ventricle, or heart, is not, as in fishes, placed at the
                    commencement of the former, but of the latter; it impels the blood not into the
                    branchial arteries, but into the aorta. The blood is either white or of a bluish
                    colour; and it contains less fibrin than that of vertebrated animals. The veins
                    probably perform the office of absorbents.</p>
                <p>(1076.) The muscles are endowed with great irritability, and retain this property
                    long after they are divided. They arc attached to different points of the skin,
                    which is smooth and moistened with a viscid liquor. The muscular actions produce
                    contractions and inflexions of the different parts, and elongations of others,
                    by means of which the animal is enabled to accomplish different kinds of
                    progressive motion, whether in water or on land, without the aid of articulated
                    members, or the advantage of solid unyielding structures, like the bones of the
                    vertebrated classes. These movements, however, arc necessarily less rapid and
                    energetic, and less perfectly executed.</p>
                <p>(1077.) A leading characteristic of the structure of the mollusea, consists in a
                    muscular expansion, connected with the integument, which envelopes all the
                    viscera, and is hence denominated the <hi rend="italic">cloak</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">mantle.</hi> It assumes various forms in the different genera,
                    being sometimes contracted into a flat disc, at other times being folded into a
                    tube, or doubled into a sac, or expanded into the form of fins or oars. Most
                    frequently we find a calcareous secretion formed on different parts of one or
                    both of the surfaces of the mantle, which hardens and forms a layer of shell.
                    Successive depositions take place, occasioning the enlargement of the shell in
                    different directions; when the shell is wholly external to the animal, it serves
                    for its habitation and protection; this is the case with the testaceous
                    mollusea; in others, which have no such covering, (or the naked mollusea,) there
                    frequently takes place an internal deposition of the same material, forming an
                    internal shell. The calcareous matter is always intermixed, when deposited, with
                    animal matter, which is sometimes in the form of a distinct membrane, and which
                    has frequently a shining or irridesccnt appearance, constituting the substance
                    known by the name of mother-of-pearl.</p>
                <p>(1078.) Great variety exists in the organs of the digestive functions, as will be
                    seen by the examples we shall give in speaking of the different orders
                    established in this class by Cuvier.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Cephalopoda.</hi></p>
                <p>(1079.) The various genera of sepiae or cuttle-fish, are comprehended in this
                    order.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500434" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0434-0719"/>
                <p>In these animals, the mantle is folded so as to form a sac enveloping all the
                    viscera; its sides being more or less extended into fins. The head alone
                    protrudes from the sac; its form is round, furnished with large eyes, and with
                    long processes or tentacula, flexible in every direction, endowed with great
                    muscular power, and having on the surface a great number of suckers, by which
                    they are capable of adhering with great force to the objects to which they may
                    apply them. These tentacula,or feet, are employed by the animal in walking,
                    which it does with the head downwards; in swimming, which it executes with the
                    head turned backwards; and also in seizing hold of bodies, for which action they
                    are well adapted. Between the basis of the feet is placed the mouth, containing
                    strong horny mandibles, resembling in their form the beak of a parrot. The
                    excretions pass out by a funnel-shaped aperture, situated at the mouth of the
                    sac, and near the head.</p>
                <p>(1080.) The pulmonary organs consist of two branchiae situated within the sac,
                    one on each side, and having the figure of a fern leaf. The great vena cava, on
                    arriving near them, divides into two trunks, terminating in two muscular
                    ventricles placed at the base of the branchiae, for the evident purpose of
                    propelling the blood with more force into the branchial arteries. The branchial
                    veins corresponding to these arteries, unite in a third ventricle situated near
                    the bottom of the sac, and which sends the blood forwards through the aortic
                    system as usual. Thus there may be said to be three separate hearts in the
                    cuttle-fish, one aortic and two branchial. The water respired enters at the open
                    margin of the mouth and passes out by the funnel-shaped aperture already
                    described.</p>
                <p>(1081.) There is found a tongue, of which the surface is bristled with sharp
                    horny points; the oesophagus is dilated into a <hi rend="italic">crop,</hi> and
                    terminates afterwards in a gizzard, equally muscular with that of a granivorous
                    bird. To this succeeds a third stomach, which is membranous, coiled into a
                    spiral form, and receives the bile by two ducts from the liver.</p>
                <p>(1082.) A singular secretion is prepared by a gland in this animal, of a deep
                    black colour, resembling ink, which, when effused, darkens the surrounding water
                    to a considerable distance, and gives the animal an opportunity of escaping from
                    its pursuers. The brain is large; a nervous ganglion surrounds the oesophagus.
                    The optic ganglions are very large; and the nerves form plexuses in the abdomen
                    and in other parts. The eye is similar in its conformation to that of the higher
                    classes of animals; but the ear ⅛ constructed in a still simpler manner than
                    that of fishes, having neither semicircular canals nor external meatus, but
                    consisting merely of a membranous sac lodged in a cavity near the brain, in
                    which a small cretaceous body is contained.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Gasteropoda.</hi></p>
                <p>(1083.) The mollusea which have a shell consisting of a single valve, compose a
                    numerous order, a familiar example of which occurs in the snail. The slug, on
                    the other hand, belongs likewise to this order, although it has no external
                    shell. Mollusea of this description are termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >gasteropodous,</hi> because they crawl on a flat disc placed under the belly;
                    the back is covered with the mantle, which is of greater or less extent, and
                    secretes the shell. The head comes out more or less from the mantle, under which
                    it is occasionally retracted, so as to be both concealed from view, and
                    protected from injury. A small number of tentacula, from two to six, appear
                    above the mouth, but do not surround it. The eyes are exceedingly small, and
                    sometimes adhere to the head, sometimes to the base, or the side, or the
                    extremity of the tentacula; but occasionally none are found. The position and
                    structure of their respiratory organs varies in the different families of this
                    order; and they are always situated under the last turn of the shell when this
                    latter has, as is generally the case, a spiral form; and they receive the water
                    either by a broad opening under the mantle, or by a narrower aperture, and often
                    through a tube formed by the prolongation of the mantle, which is frequently
                    protected by an indentation or tubular process of the shell. A further
                    protection is often afforded by a flat, horny, or calcareous plate, which closes
                    the shell when the animal has retired within it, and which is termed an <hi
                    rend="italic">operculum.</hi></p>
                <p>(1084.) Instead of branchiae, the pulmonary gasteropoda are provided with
                    cavities for the admission of atmospheric air, which they respire in its gaseous
                    form. These cavities are opened and closed at the pleasure of the animal, the
                    mechanism of their respiration consisting in these movements.</p>
                <p>The stomach and intestinal canal are of very various structure in the different
                    genera. In some, as the scyllaea, we find cutting teeth implanted in the coats
                    of the stomach itself; in the pleurobranchus there are four stomachs, like those
                    of ruminant quadrupeds. The aplysia is provided with a very capacious crop,
                    which leads to a muscular gizzard, armed, moreover, with a number of cartilages
                    of a pyramidal shape; a third stomach succeeds to this, having its inner coat
                    lined with sharp hooks; and a fourth, shaped like a coecum; and the intestines
                    are, besides, exceedingly voluminous.</p>
                <p>Many of the gasteropodous mollusea present the curious phenomena of the double
                    hermaphrodite generation formerly adverted to, (§781.) Impregnation of the ova
                    requires the union of two individuals, the female organs of each receiving the
                    male organs of the other, and the fecundation being mutual. This is the case
                    with the helix and the lymneus.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Acephala.</hi></p>
                <p>(1085.) The acephalous mollusea, so named from their having no head, have all the
                    vital organs enclosed in the two folds of the mantle, which shuts like a
                    portfolio, leaving apparent only the orifice of the mouth; but in some cases the
                    month is here prolonged in the form of a tube. In almost every case each of the
                    two sides of the mantle is covered by a valve of shell, so as to constitute a
                    <hi rend="italic">bivalve</hi> molluscous animal; in another tribe the shell is
                    <hi rend="italic">multivalve.</hi> The brain is situated immediately over the
                    mouth, and consists of a certain number of small ganglions. The branchiae have
                    almost always a laminated form, the plates, generally four in number, being
                    covered with a net-work of bloodvessels. The mollusea of this order are
                    unprovided with teeth, the food brought by the water being received into the
                    mouth, and swallowed in its original state, whence it passes into the stomach;
                    sometimes there are two successive cavities performing the functions of the
                    stomach; the intestine is of various length. The liver surrounds the stomach,
                    and pours its secretion directly into the cavity by several apertures.</p>
                <p>(1086.) A large fleshy process, resembling in appearance a tongue, and which has
                    been compared to a foot, projects from the body, and by the varied movements of
                    which it is capable, enables the animal to perform a slow progressive motion.
                    Muscles are also provided for closing the shell, and they generally pass
                    directly from one valve to the other; sometimes there are two muscles, but
                    commonly only one. The valves are separated by the force of an elastic ligament
                    placed at the extremity of the hinge, which is called into action when the
                    muscles that close the shell are relaxed.</p>
                <p>(1087.) The threads, or byssus, spun by many acephalous mollusea in order to
                    attach themselves to rocks, as a ship is moored by her cables, is another
                    peculiarity in these animals, and particularly of the genera mytilus and
                    pinna.</p>
                <p>(1088.) In many mollusea of this order the rectum passes through the cavity of
                    the heart, and this latter organ receives the blood from the veins by means of
                    two auricles.</p>
                <p>Some acephala are hermaphrodite; but the union of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193500447" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0447-0720"/>sexual organs necessary for
                    fecundation takes place in a single individual. This occurs in the
                    holothuria.</p>
                <p>(1089.) Onc of the most singularly constructed of the animals referred to this
                    division of mollusea is the ascidia. The mantle and its envelope, which is a
                    thick and cartilaginous tunic, form together a sac, everywhere closed, excepting
                    at two orifices, the one corresponding to the termination of the intestine, the
                    other leading into a cavity, of which the sides are the branchiae, and at the
                    bottom of which is placed the mouth, the principal viscera subservient to
                    nutrition occupying a second cavity, and the heart being lodged in a third. The
                    principal nervous ganglion is situated between the two external orifices of the
                    sac.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VI.— <hi rend="italic">Comparative Physiology
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">Articulata.</hi></p>
                <p>(1090.) This great division of the animal kingdom comprises all those tribes
                    possessing what may properly be called an external skeleton; that is, a series
                    of rings or hollow cases, of a hard texture, which enclose all the important
                    organs of the body, and which, by their muscular connexions, allow of various
                    kinds of movements, at the same time that they afford protection to all the
                    softer tissues of which those organs are composed. The best idea that can be
                    formed of this mechanical construction may be obtained by examining the body and
                    the limbs of a lobster, in which it will be seen, that contrary to what obtains
                    in vertebrated animals, the harder parts are external, and the muscles are
                    within them, a construction allowing of very free movements of the limbs.</p>
                <p>(1091·) A remarkable degree of uniformity prevails with regard to the
                    distribution of the nervous system in all these animals. The brain, which is
                    situated above the oesophagus, but is still in the head, as in the higher
                    classes of animals, is exceedingly small; and after sending out filaments of
                    nerves to the different parts about the head, is connected with a double nervous
                    cord, which encircles the oesophagus, and runs along the under side of the
                    animal, being joined at intervals by nodules or ganglia, from which, as from new
                    centres, other nervous threads radiate, and are variously distributed to the
                    different vital organs, and to the limbs. Each of these nervous ganglia appears
                    to perform the office of a subordinate brain in relation to the system of nerves
                    which proceeds from it, and to the parts of the body supplied by those nerves,
                    so that when the animal is divided into several portions, each portion seems to
                    possess its own independent vitality. The form and structure of the digestive
                    organs is very various; but jaws are always found, and their motion is lateral
                    instead of vertical, as in vertebrated animals.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Annelida.</hi></p>
                <p>(1092.) The first class of articulated animals arc thean-nelida, or worm-shaped
                    animals. They are remarkable for possessing red blood, which circulates in a
                    double system of complicated vessels, without any heart, or muscular ventricles.
                    The body is soft, more or less elongated, and composed of a great number of
                    segments. The foremost of these, which maybe regarded as the head, contains the
                    largest of the ganglia, or brain, the mouth, and the principal organs of the
                    senses. The branchiae are generally external, and sometimes uniformly spread on
                    the surface of the body; and at other times are confined to the anterior
                    divisions. Tufts of hair or bristles supply the place of feet. The mouth is
                    either furnished with hard jaws, or else extended in the form of a tube.</p>
                <p>( 1093.) The leech, which is referable to this class, has a very capacious
                    stomach, nearly of the size of the whole body, or rather a series of pouches, or
                    dilatations proceeding from each side of the central cavity.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See a description and
                    delineation of this structure in the Bridgewater Treatise οη Animal and

                    their principal organs of touch; and the small black points, observable in some
                    tribes, have been regarded as organs of an imperfect kind of vision. The
                    earth-worm has a remarkably complicated apparatus for circulation, consisting of
                    a great number of dilatations of the dorsal vessel, forming a series of
                    hearts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. ιi.
                    255.</p></note></p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Crustacea.</hi></p>
                <p>(1094.) The articulated form is more perfectly developed in the Crustacea than in
                    the annelida. Their blood is white, and is circulated by the aid of a muscular
                    ventricle, or heart, situated in the back, propelling it through an arterial
                    system; whence it returns by a system of veins, which collect in a trunk passing
                    along the lower part of the abdomen. In some species the heart assumes a very
                    elongated shape. There are always organs termed <hi rend="italic">antennae,</hi>
                    or feelers, situated in front of the head; and these are generally four in
                    number. The jaws are of complicated structure. It is only in a few species that
                    an internal car is met with, and it then consists of a sac full of fluid, in
                    which a calcareous concretion is contained. The eyes are generally two in
                    number, often placed at the end of pedicles, and consisting of a great number of
                    facets, each provided with a separate cornea, retina, and branch of the optic
                    nerve; and the whole constituting what is termed a composite eye. The branchiae
                    are of a pyramidal form, composed of plates, or filaments, or feathery tufts,
                    generally situated at the base of the legs.</p>
                <p>(1095.) The larger genera of this class, as the lobster, have a horny stomach,
                    with strong teeth implanted in its coats, for the evident purpose of breaking
                    and bruising the shells that are swallowed. All these animals cast oft' their
                    shells several times in the progress of their growth, a new shell being
                    successively formed of larger dimensions than the preceding, and adapted to the
                    increased size of the animal.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Arachnida.</hi></p>
                <p>(109β∙) The third class of articulated animals, or the arachnida, have been
                    separated from that of insects with which they had been before associated; being
                    distinguished by the following peculiarities in their conformation and economy.
                    They have a distinct circulation of the blood by means of an elongated dorsal
                    vessel performing the office of a heart, propelling its blood into a system of
                    arteries, and receiving it back again from a system of veins. They are without
                    antennae, but are provided with palpi. They have pulmonary cavities subservient
                    to the respiration of atmospheric air. The head is united with the trunk without
                    the intervention of any neck. The mouth is armed with jaws; and there are
                    several simple eyes situated on the upper part of the head.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Insects.</hi></p>
                <p>(1097.) Nothing can exceed the endless variety of forms displayed by this class
                    of the animal creation. Their internal anatomy and economy, how ever, present
                    many points which are common to the whole class. There is no other trace of a
                    heart, than a long cylindrical tube extending along the back, and termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">dorsal vessel</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but which seems to be
                    closed on all sides, and neither to give out, nor to receive communicating
                    branches of any sort. This vessel appears to contain a fluid, which is
                    irregularly undulated backwards and forwards, by a kind of pulsation, or
                    occasional contraction of one part of the canal, and dilatation of another. It
                    had been supposed, in the absence of any visible blood-vessels, that nutrition
                    in insects is performed by a kind of gradual transudation, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >imbibition,</hi> as it has been termed. Professor Carus, however, has lately
                    made the discovery of a distinct circulation in the vessels of the larvae <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193500460" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0460-0721"/> of several
                    insects, and other observers have found a system of partial circulation in even
                    later periods of insect life. But, in general, in the last stage of
                    transformation, all these vessels, excepting the dorsal vessel, become
                    obliterated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The dorsal
                    vessel of the sphinx ligustri is delineated in the Bridgewater Treatise on
                    Animal and Vegetable Physiology, ii. 245.</p></note> There being neither
                    branchiae nor pulmonary organs where the nutritious fluids could receive the
                    vivifying influence of the air, a complex mode of respiration is resorted to.
                    Apertures are found in different parts, generally along the sides of the body,
                    and which are called <hi rend="italic">spiracles</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >stigmata.</hi> These are the commencements of elastic tubes, which remain
                    continually open, and which are subdivided and ramified like the blood-vessels
                    of other animals, for the purpose of conveying air to every part of the system.
                    These tubes are termed <hi rend="italic">tracheae.</hi></p>
                <p>(1098.) Insects are unprovided with glands for effecting secretions; that purpose
                    being answered by means of long spongy vessels, which appear capable of
                    absorbing the materials they require from the general cavity in which they
                    float.</p>
                <p>(1099∙J The temperature of insects, like that of other animals said to be
                    cold-blooded, varies with that of the surroundingmedium; but is generally one or
                    two degrees higher. In bee-hives and ant-hills, a much higher temperature
                    prevails. This is proved by an elaborate series of experiments made on the
                    temperature of insects, and its connexion with the functions of respiration and
                    circulation, by Mr. Newport.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Philosophical Transactions for 1837, p. 25.</p></note></p>
                <p>(1100.) Their nervous system is formed upon the general model already described,
                    (§ 109L) The digestive organs admit of the greatest possible variety, according
                    to the habits and particular kinds of food consumed. To specify all these
                    diversities would far exceed the limits assigned to us in this work. The
                    external organs connected with the limbs, the antennae, the mouth, and the
                    different functions of sense, fall more properly under the consideration of the
                    naturalist, inasmuch as they furnish the best characters for the distinction of
                    genera and species, and for perfecting their systematic classification. The
                    subject is rendered infinitely more complex in consequence of the metamorphoses
                    which the same insect undergoes in passing through the different stages of its
                    existence, from the <hi rend="italic">egg</hi> to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >larva,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">nympha</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >imago,</hi> or the perfect insect. But for the history of these changes, we
                    must again referto the naturalist, to whose province it more strictly belongs to
                    record them. We must content ourselves with mentioning in this place a few of
                    the more striking peculiarities of internal conformation which are observable in
                    some of the insect tribes.</p>
                <p>(1101.) The first that we shall point out is, the remarkable structure of the
                    digestive organs of the orthoptera, an order of insects which comprehend the
                    blatta, or cockroach, and the mantis or leaf insect, the ear-wig, the locust,
                    the grasshopper, and the cricket. Their stomachs bear some analogy to those of
                    ruminant quadrupeds, in complication at least, if not in office. The first
                    stomach, or crop, is membranous; to this succeeds a muscular stomach, or
                    gizzard, the internal surface of which is armed either with scales, or with
                    horny teeth. Around the pylorus there extend two or more blind pouches,
                    furnished at their extremities with numerous vessels conveying bile. Many
                    similar biliary ducts are inserted in the course of the intestinal canal. It has
                    been strongly suspected that the insects in which these complex stomachs are
                    found, actually possess the power of ruminating their food.</p>
                <p>(1102.) The abdominal cavity of the working bee presents us with two stomachs,
                    together with the intestine and the poison bladder. The anterior stomach in
                    which the oesophagus opens, is the receptacle for the honey, which is
                    occasionally returned into the mouth in order to be stored in the honey-cells,
                    as a magazine of food for the winter. The next stomach is destined to contain
                    the pollen, or material gathered from the antennae of flowers. Its inner coat
                    has a great number of circular folds. Wax is a secretion of a peculiar kind from
                    the bee.</p>
                <p>(1103.) The alimentary canal of the caterpillar, before transformation, consists
                    of a straight and capacious tube, of which the anterior portion is somewhat
                    dilated into what may be considered as the stomach; and of which the posterior
                    portions forms a cloaca; the biliary vessels, which are four in number, and very
                    long, are inserted very far behind. When the caterpillar is transformed into a
                    butterfly, this alimentary canal is much diminished, both in its diameter and
                    length; the first stomach, or crop, is situated on the side of the tube; there
                    is next a second stomach full of irregular dilatations, a slender but long
                    intestine, and a coecum near the cloaca.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>(1104.) The nervous system undergoes corresponding changes during the

                    number is much diminished.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    part a considerable range of action. Organs of vision arc almost constantly
                    present, but those of the other senses are but imperfectly known. The principal
                    organs of touch are the <hi rend="italic">antennae,</hi> which probably also
                    perform other offices relating to sensation, of which we have no certain

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VII.— <hi rend="italic">Comparative Physiology of
                    Zoophytes.</hi></p>
                <p>(1105.) The animals which occupy the lowest division in the scale of life, and
                    constitute an approach to vegetable, namely, the class of zoophytes, present us
                    with much simpler forms of organization than any of those which have passed
                    under our review. Yet amongst these we may trace gradations in the mode in which
                    the more refined organs of the animal economy successively disappear, and their
                    functions are supplied by other parts, and also in the gradual simplification of
                    those functions, till we appear to arrive at an approximation to mere vegetative
                    existence. The great characteristic of the more perfect animals, the circulation
                    of the fluids in vessels which distribute them to every part for the purposes of
                    nutrition and secretion, is wanting in zoophytes; or if any traces of a
                    circulation can be discovered, it is exceedingly partial and limited in degree.
                    There is a well marked disposition in all the organs to assume a symmetrical
                    arrangement about a common centre; being either disposed in radii proceeding
                    from that centre, or arranged in a uniform manner round the circumference of a
                    circle. In those instances in which a nervous system can be traced, which is the
                    case only among the higher order o. echmodermata, the disposition to assume this
                    radiating form is particularly observable.</p>
                <p>(1106.) Many amongst the lowest orders present us with the singular spectacle of
                    compound animals, associated in great numbers for the purposes of a common
                    defence and habitation, and having even nutrition in common. These more
                    particularly constitute an approach to the vegetable kingdom.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Echinodermata.</hi></p>
                <p>(1107.) The zoophytes arranged in this division, which are chiefly the asterias,
                    or star-fish, the echinus, and the holothuria, present us with some appearance
                    of an external skeleton, or hard encasement, consisting of parts which are often
                    articulated together, an imperfect vascular system, and the appearance of a
                    system of nerves.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500473" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0473-0722"/>
                <p>(1108.) The rays of the asterias are composed of numerous pieces, which have been
                    compared to vertebrae, are slightly moveable upon one another, and allow of a
                    slowflexion of the entire ray. It is hollowed below into a longitudinal groove,
                    abounding in perforations for the passage of numerous rows of short tentacula,
                    which perform the office of feet, for the progressive motion of the animal, and
                    which also absorb water, and convey it into the general internal cavityforthe
                    purpose of respiration. The centre of the star is occupied by a large stomach,
                    the entrance to which, or the mouth, is below, and which sends out two
                    prolongations, or coeca, to each ray; these are ultimately ramified into minute
                    vessels, suspended by a membrane which performs the office of a mesentery.</p>
                <p>(1109∙) The structure of the echinus is still more complicated. The calcareous
                    covering of the body has a globular shape, but is composed of several angular
                    pieces joined together, and perforated by rows of lobes, through which the short
                    feet, or tentacula, protrude. Besides these, there are a multitude of spines
                    articulated to the surface of the shell, and subservient to voluntary motion.
                    The mouth is armed with five teeth, inserted in a complicated apparatus of jaws,
                    resembling a pentagonal lantern, provided with numerous muscles, and suspended
                    over the great opening in the centre of the lower surface of the shell. The
                    intestinal canal is of great length, and forms a spiral tube attached to the
                    interior of the shell by a mesentery. A double vascular system extends the whole
                    length of this canal, and is partly spread over the mesentery.</p>
                <p>(1110.) The holothuria resembles in its structure the echinus, but it has a
                    cylindrical instead of a globular form. The respiratory organ is ramified like
                    the branches of a tree, and fills and empties itself at the pleasure of the
                    animal. The mouth has no teeth, and is only protected by a circle of calcareous
                    plates. The intestine is very long, and makes many folds, being also attached to
                    the sides by a mesentery. A partial circulation takes place in a double system
                    of a very complicated arrangement of vessels, which has relation exclusively to
                    the intestinal canal, and of which some of the branches are interlaced with the
                    arborescent respiratory tubes already described.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Entozoa.</hi></p>
                <p>(1112.) Very little is known concerning the physiology of intestinal worms; the
                    information that has been collected being chiefly of a negative kind. They have
                    no visible respiratory organs, and no apparent nervous system or organs of
                    sensation; and still less can we discover any traces of a circulation. The only
                    very distinct organs are those belonging to the functions of nutrition and of
                    reproduction. Some naturalists, indeed, allege that they have detected some
                    filaments of nerves; but the real nature of these filaments is still very
                    doubtful.</p>
                <p>(1113.) Thealimentarycanalmayin most intestinal worms be recognised without much
                    difficulty; it is sometimes enclosed in an abdominal cavity, but at other times
                    apparently passes through the solid parenchyma of the body. In some, as in the
                    taenia, or tape-worm, we may discern ramified vessels for the distribution of
                    the nourishment; but these are not seen in others. The simplest animal of this
                    tribe is the globular hydatid, which consists altogether of a vesicular sac
                    filled with a transparent fluid, and with an indistinct mouth; but without any
                    other apparent external organ. This tribe of entozoa exhibit the simplest
                    example of the gemmiparous mode of reproduction; the young appearing as gemmae,
                    or buds, which at certain periods spout from the homogeneous parenchyma
                    composing the body of the parent, and by a sort of vegetative growth, gradually
                    assume the form of the original animal, and are detached when capable of
                    exercising an independent life.</p>
                <p>Some of the entozoa, as the taenia, or tape-worm, are capable of being multiplied
                    like plants, by division; each segment resulting from the division being
                    converted into an independent animal, acquiring whatever parts may have been
                    deficient, and after a time admitting of further subdivision, with a repetition
                    of the same phenomena.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Acalcpha.</hi></p>
                <p>(1114.) These are either fixed on rocks, or float in the sea; they exhibit more
                    or less of a fibrous texture, and contain vessels which are excavated out of the
                    substance of the body itself, and are not contained in any distinct cavity.</p>
                <p>(1115.) The actinia, or sea anemone, is provided with, numerous hollow tentacula
                    surrounding the mouth and stomach. The space between the stomach and the outer
                    skin is divided into compartments by vertical partitions, and the fluid
                    contained in these compartments may be projected into the tentacula so as to
                    render them turgid.</p>
                <p>(lllG.)The medusa has a hemispherical form, and a gelatinous consistence. The
                    mouth, which is situated in the centre of the flat disc below, is surrounded by
                    fringed tentacula. It leads into a singularly-shaped cavity, which is the
                    stomach, formed of four arches proceeding like radii from the centre, and
                    terminating in tubes which are variously divided, and the branches derived ífom
                    them freely communicating with one another by anastomoses. These are apparently
                    for distributing the nourishment which has been prepared by the stomach, but not
                    for any real circulation. There are four large cavities in the body which appear
                    to be subservient to respiration.</p>
                <p>(1117.) In some species, forming the genus <hi rend="italic">rhizostoma</hi> of
                    Cuvier, there is no central mouth, but a canal commences by an open orifice from
                    the extremity of each of the fringe-like processes of the tentacula, and these,
                    uniting with others in their course upwards, form at length a single tube or
                    oesophagus, which terminates in the central stomach already described.</p>
                <p>Most of the animals of this order, which are found fixed on rocks, are propagated
                    by means of spores or gemmules, constituting one of the modes by which the
                    gemmiparous form of reproduction is effected. These gemmules are minute bodies,
                    formed either on the surface or in some special internal organ of the parent,
                    and which are immediately detached and swim with a spontaneous and independent
                    motion in the circumambient fluid, by means of cilia or short filaments, which
                    are in rapid and incessant vibration. They pursue these motions for a certain
                    time till they find a convenient place for their future habitation, where, when
                    they are once fixed, they generally remain ever after, growing to the dimensions
                    and exercising all the functions of the parent animal. In the acalepha, which
                    are not stationary, the gemmules retain their liberty of moving during the whole
                    period of their existence.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Polypi.</hi></p>
                <p>(1118.) The organization of this numerous order of zoophytes, presents, in every
                    essential particular, great uniformity, and bears a great analogy to that of the
                    actinia. The gelatinous sac or tube, constituting the digestive cavity, is
                    closed at one end, the opening at the other end being the mouth, which is
                    surrounded by a circle of tentacula; and the nutritive fluid passing by
                    imbibition ∙ through the coats of the general sac or stomach for the purpose of
                    nourishment. The hydra may be taken as the type of this tribe of animals. It
                    consists of a mere stomach provided with flexible tentacula for catching food
                    and for progression. This sac may be inverted or turned inside out, without
                    detriment to the animal, digestion being then performed by the new cavity, which
                    is the result of the operation. These animals present the simplest examples of
                    gemmiparous generation, (§ 777).</p>
                <p>No further discovery can be made respecting the organization<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193500486" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0486-0723"/> of these animals, even by
                    applying the microscope, which shews only a semitransparent substance
                    interspersed with opaque grains. The greater number secrete on their outer
                    surface a calcareous or a horny substance, which serves for their mechanical
                    support, but at the same time fixes them on the spot to which they adhere.</p>
                <p>(1119.) The most remarkable feature in their history is their disposition to
                    congregate together in vast numbers, so as to compose by their united
                    architecture whole rocks and even submarine mountains, rising from the bottom of
                    the ocean. Some of these animal republics exhibit amongst the individuals thus
                    associated together communications of nutritious vessels, so that the materials
                    for the sustenance of each passes into the bodies of the neighbouring polypi,
                    and is applied to the purposes of their economy. All these fixed polypi are
                    propagated by spores or gemmules in the manner already described in our account
                    of the stationary acalepha.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Infusoria.</hi></p>
                <p>(1120.) These being all microscopic animalcules of extreme minuteness, it is
                    scarcely possible to arrive at any exact knowledge of their internal
                    organization or economy. Many, and probably all, are possessed of distinct
                    organs for the reception of food, for reproduction, and for voluntary motion;
                    but conjecture alone can fill up the imperfect outline, or suggest any plausible
                    hypothesis as to their powers of sensation, which, however, we are unwilling to
                    refuse to any being which appears to possess the properties and attributes of
                    animality, especially since the splendid discoveries of Ehrenberg have made us
                    acquainted with the complex organization observable in some of the minutest of
                    this prodigiously diversified tribe of beings. It is remarkable, indeed, that
                    those very animalcules, as the monads, which had been ranked by naturalists
                    among the <hi rend="italic">agastrica,</hi> or beings totally without alimentary
                    cavities, are now found to have a very considerable number of stomachs, and to
                    be entitled accordingly to the title of <hi rend="italic">polygastrica.</hi></p>
                <p>It is chiefly amongst the various tribes of infusoria that the simpler modes of
                    generation, such as that termed <hi rend="italic">fissiparous,</hi> are
                    exemplified. In the monas, for instance, a groove is seen to form around the
                    equator of their globular bodies, which groove, gradually deepening, changes
                    their form to that of an hour-glass, and the connecting ligament of the two
                    portions being soon broken, the segments move away from one another, each
                    commencing its independent existence, and being capable of performing all the
                    functions of the undivided monad. In the bell-shaped vorticella, the division
                    commences at the mouth or wide extremity of the bell, and gradually extends in a
                    longitudinal direction towards the insertion of the stem, dividing the body into
                    two equal portions, each being now a distinct and individual animal. The gonium
                    divides itself into four instead of two portions, each portion being again
                    subdivided into four others, the new animalcules assuming rapidly the dimensions
                    and appearance of the one of which they originally formed a part. Other species
                    are propagated by means of gemmules; and some of the infusoria are apparently
                    oviparous.</p>
                <p>CHAP. XXIII HISTORY OF PHYSIOLOGY.</p>
                <p>(1121.) The study of the history of any science furnishes to the mind a body of
                    knowledge not merely ornamental or superfluous, but one that is fraught with
                    instruction and utility, and is conducive to the just comprehension of the
                    subject to which it relates. It is scarcely ever necessary, indeed, for the
                    understanding of any proposition, that the student should follow the same
                    laborious course and travel through the same tortuous mazes by which the
                    discovery had originally been achieved; for the acquisition of any body of
                    knowledge already systematized by the labours of our predecessors, is in general
                    most readily attained by the synthetic method. But as soon as this point has
                    been reached we can conceive no course of study more calculated to improve that
                    knowledge, and to invigorate the faculties by which it may be extended and
                    perfected, than reverting to the analytic process, and following the series of
                    discoveries in the order in which they have actually occurred. From an
                    historical survey of the successive steps by which science has proceeded from a
                    rude origin to its present state of advancement, and which mark its varied
                    progress and even occasional retrogressions at different periods, according to
                    the prevailing disposition of the age, either to a servile submission to
                    authority or to the hasty adoption of crude and visionary theories, we are
                    enabled to derive most important rules for the conduct of the understanding in
                    the search after truth.</p>
                <p>The history of each particular branch of science may, indeed, be regarded as a
                    separate chapter in the history of the human mind. It indicates the sources of
                    its activity and of its strength, and also of its weakness and fallibility; it
                    holds out the most powerful incentives to exertion; it exhibits much to admire
                    and to emulate, and, at the same time, discloses enough to check pride and teach
                    humility.</p>
                <p>( 1122.) The history of physiology must necessarily comprise a large portion of
                    the history of anatomy, which consists in the mere knowledge of the organs and
                    minute structure of the body, such knowledge being, in fact, the foundation on
                    which the higher science of the philosophy of life is built. It is scarcely
                    possible, indeed, to study mere organization, without extending our views to the
                    functions that we see performed, and to the energies that are exerted by the
                    living organs. Our object will therefore be in the present place, to inquire how
                    far these higher qualities of mind have been displayed by the cultivators of
                    this department of knowledge at different periods, so as to mark the progress of
                    the philosophy of life, as contradistinguished from the more mechanical, though
                    equally useful labours of the mere anatomist.</p>
                <p>(1123.) The phenomena which constitute the subjects of physiological inquiry
                    must, indeed, have attracted the attention of mankind long before any accurate
                    knowledge had been acquired of the structure of the organs whose actions give
                    rise to these phenomena. Life in its different forms must have been familiar to
                    all; and every savage and warlike people must have been conversant with the
                    diversified aspects of death, which they inflicted in such various modes.
                    Speculations on the nature of the vital principle, and the physiological
                    conditions on which it is dependent for its origin, maintenance, and decay, must
                    have been formed and pursued in every state of society, removed bpt one degree
                    from barbarism; and such speculations must have stimulated inquiry into the
                    internal mechanism with which that principle is associated, and the hidden
                    springs which regulate its course.</p>
                <p>(1124.) Opportunities must frequently have occurred in the rudest ages, of
                    observing the different parts of the structure of the bodies both of men and
                    animals. The curiosity even of the savage could not fail to be attracted by the
                    remarkable appearance of the internal organs, in the animals which he
                    slaughtered for food, or prepared for sacrifice. Although deterred from the
                    actual examination of the human body, by an instinctive repugnance, or
                    superstitious terror, various casualties occurring in battle, or arising from
                    accidents, would occasionally afford an insight into the human frame. Human
                    bones, and sometimes entire skeletons, would often present themselves to those
                    who revisited the fields of carnage.» Thus would the principal bones, and the
                    most conspicuous viscera of the human body, soon become known, and they would be
                    designated by particular names. Evidence to this effect may be collected from
                    the rudest and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500499" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0499-0724"
                    />most ancient languages; from which we may infer that a certain progress must
                    have been made in this kind of knowledge, long before it had been so arranged
                    and methodized as to deserve the name of a science.</p>
                <p>(1125.) The prevailingcustomamongstmost of the ancient nations, of consigning all
                    dead bodies to destruction by fire, was one of the greatest obstacles to the
                    advancement of anatomical and physiological knowledge. But opportunities were on
                    the other hand afforded of learning the structure of certain animals, by the
                    religious rites, during the celebration of which these animals were sacrificed,
                    and especially by the examinations which were made by the priests of the yet
                    palpitating entrails of their victims, for the purpose of prognosticating future
                    events. Inferences were thus drawn by analogy as to the organization and
                    functions of the human body. The Egyptians, indeed, who composed the most
                    ancient nation of whose manners and customs we possess any authentic records,
                    were supposed to have acquired considerable knowledge of the human structure
                    from the practice of embalming the dead. This operation was performed by a
                    particular class of men, and consisted in taking out a portion of the viscera,
                    washing them with antiseptic fluids, and filling the cavities with aromatic
                    substances. But as this process appears to have been conducted in the rudest
                    manner, it required no skill in anatomy, and was but little calculated to
                    improve the science. It was in the hands of a few persons only; and such was the
                    contempt and abhorrence in which these persons were held by their countrymen,
                    that whatever knowledge they might have acquired by the practice of their art,
                    was not likely to be communicated to others. .</p>
                <p>(1126.) Whatever splendour may have attended the pride of power or extent of
                    empire in these rude and unenlightened ages, the dawn of science was coeval only
                    with that of liberty. The same energies by which man had thrown off the yoke of
                    tyranny, animated them likewise with the desire of knowledge; and nations had no
                    sooner emancipated themselves from despotism, than they began to emerge from
                    barbarism and ignorance. The Greeks, who were the most free, were also the most
                    polished of all the nations of antiquity, and far excelled them in every species
                    of science and of art. So great was the ardour of their philosophers in the
                    pursuit of knowledge, that they frequently travelled into distant countries to
                    collect useful information, and impart it to their pupils. Even in the time of
                    Homer, the Greeks seem to have possessed much general knowledge both of anatomy
                    and physiology, as may be collected from the writings of that poet. He relates
                    that the stone which was hurled at Aeneas by Diomed, not only crushed the
                    thigh-bone, but also tore the ligament of the acetabulum. Merion is represented
                    as being wounded in one of the large veins which return the blood to the heart,
                    or venae cavae; and Ulysses aimed a blow at the Cyclops at the part where the
                    liver adheres to the diaphragm. It has even been supposed that Homer has
                    purposely often wounded his heroes that he might have opportunities of
                    displacing by the minuteness of his descriptions, his accurate acquaintance with
                    anatomy.</p>
                <p>(1127.) Butthough curiosity was roused, and a multitude of detached facts had
                    been observed and collected, it was long before the proper methods of
                    investigation were known, and the true principles of inquiry established.
                    Although it appears that the studies of anatomy and physiology were prosecuted
                    with considerable ardour in the school of Pythagoras, yet as they were regarded
                    merely as a part of natural history, the information relating to these subjects
                    was not sufficiently connected or concentrated to be embodied in one science.
                    Alemeon and Empedocles, who cultivated anatomy, belonged to this school; but the
                    most remarkable of the pupils of Pythagoras, belonging to the Eleatic sect, was
                    Democritus of Abdera, a man whose eccentric manners, as well as penetrating
                    genius, and undisguised contempt for the follies of mankind, have procured him
                    so much celebrity. He is said to have devoted considerable time to the
                    dissection of animals, especially with a view to discover the origin and course
                    of the bile. His fondness for seclusion, and his perseverance in a pursuit which
                    appeared to his countrymen to be without any rational object, led them to
                    suspect the soundness of his intellects; and Hippocrates was sent to visit him
                    in his solitary abode. He found the philosopher seated on a stone, under the
                    ample shade of a plane tree, with a number of books arranged on each side, one
                    on his knee, a pencil in his hand, and several animals which he had been
                    dissecting lying before him. His complexion was pale, his countenance
                    thoughtful; at times he laughed, at times shook his head, mused for a while, and
                    then wrote, then rose up and walked, inspected the animals, sat down, and wrote
                    again. Hippocrates, who perceived the nature of his inquiries, observed him for
                    some time in silent admiration, proclaimed to the bystanders the importance of
                    his researches, and declared to them his regret that want of leisure from his
                    owp professional employments did not allow him to engage in similar
                    pursuits.</p>
                <p>(1128.) But it was only from men whose minds are capable of enlarged views, and
                    can perceive the bearings and connexions of the several parts of the subjects
                    they embrace, that a powerful impulse is given to science, such as to make it
                    almost the creation of their hands, that it is raised to its proper rank among
                    the departments of human knowledge. Such was the vigorous mind of Hippocrates;
                    and so great was the improvement which medicine derived from his genius, that
                    the foundation was thus laid for the more rapid progress of all the sciences
                    connected with it in succeeding times. Hippocrates was born in the island of
                    Cos, in the first year of the 80th olympiad, or 460 years before Christ; an aera
                    which is therefore remarkable in the history of medical science. It appears that
                    at that period a knowledge of medicine had been in a great measure hereditary in
                    certain families, amongst whom the information which had descended from the
                    successive generations was thus retained and augmented. This was the case in the
                    family of Hippocrates, who is said to have been the fourteenth descendant from
                    Esculapius, on his father’s side; while his maternal ancestry could be traced to
                    Hercules. He had been instructed in all the learning of those times; but
                    particularly dedicated himself to the cultivation of medicine, which he formed
                    into a distinct science, collecting and arranging all the information on the
                    subject that was then known. Not satisfied with the knowledge which he could
                    acquire in his native place, he travelled for several years through different
                    parts of Greece and Asia Minor. He visited the temple of Diana at Ephesus, and
                    was at the pains of transcribing and arranging the records of cases and of
                    successful methods of cure, which it was the custom to deposit on tablets in
                    these temples. On retiring to his native island, after the laborious proofs he
                    had given of his diligence and ardour, he continued to exercise his profession,
                    and enjoyed the highest and most extensive reputation. Such was the estimation
                    in which his talents were held, that even princes were solicitous to allure him
                    to their courts; but he was so strongly attached to his native country, that he
                    resisted every temptation which the splendour or the favour of monarchs could
                    hold out.</p>
                <p>(H29∙) Excepting one or two particular treatises, which bear his name, but the
                    authenticity of which is dubious, the writings of Hippocrates are to be regarded
                    rather as medical than physiological; but he seems to have been the first who
                    formed a clear conception of the value of anatomy and physiology as the basis of
                    medical reasoning. Originality of thought, combined with accuracy of
                    observation, forms the characteristic feature of his writings; which con <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193500512" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0512-0725"/> tain, however,
                    many traces of the Pythagorean philosophy, with which he seems to have been
                    early imbued. He formed the bold conception of the existence of a principle,
                    which he calls <hi rend="italic">φυσιs,</hi> or nature, exercising a general
                    direction and superintendence over all the actions and movements of the body,
                    and endowed for that purpose with a species of intelligence directed to
                    beneficial ends. As subservient to this great and prime agent, he imagined that
                    the functions were carried on by means of other subordinate powers or faculties;
                    and also that they were subjected to the influence of the stars. He regarded the
                    body as being composed of three kinds of substances, namely, solids, fluids, and
                    spirits, and ultimately resolvable into the four primary elements of earth,
                    water, air, and fire, the predominance of each of which in particular
                    individuals gave rise to the prevailing temperaments, characterised by the
                    peculiar combinations of the four qualities of dry, moist, cold, and hot. Hence
                    arose his doctrine of temperaments, already noticed, (§ 862). The anatomical
                    details which are interspersed throughout his works are numerous, but do not
                    exhibit any profound knowledge of the subject, besides being in many instances
                    incorrect. The confession which he made on his visit to Democritus shews that he
                    had not devoted any considerable portion of his time either to physiology or to
                    practical anatomy. It is very apparent, indeed, that he never dissected a human
                    body; and much could not be learned from the occasional dissection of brutes. So
                    far was he from having any idea of the real nature of the circulation of the
                    blood, which some have done him the honour to suppose he had discovered, that he
                    seems to have imagined that the arteries contained air, and he was at a loss to
                    determine whether the veins took their origin in the liver, the heart, or the
                    brain. He includes under the same name the ligaments, the tendons, and the
                    nerves, and makes no distinction between their respective offices in the
                    economy. But these imperfections were more to be imputed to the unavoidable
                    disadvantages of the times, than to his own deficiency either of industry or of
                    talent; for wherever he had opportunities of displaying these qualities, and of
                    exerting the whole force of his original mind, he far surpassed all his co
                    temporaries. Hippocrates must indeed be regarded as the father of physiology, as
                    well as of medicine; and his name will ever be cherished by posterity, as one of
                    the most illustrious in the annals of science.</p>
                <p>(1130.) Amongst the Athenian philosophers who paid attention to physiology,
                    Socrates must not be passed over in silence; since he cultivated the science
                    with a view to establish upon it, as upon the most solid foundation, the
                    principles of natural theology. Plato, the friend and pupil of Socrates,
                    likewise devoted a portion of his time to the study of animal structures, and
                    indulged in a variety of fanciful speculations concerning the uses and functions
                    of the vital organs.</p>
                <p>(1131.) Aristotle, the tutor of Alexander the Great, whose transcendant genius
                    embraced the whole domain of human science, prosecuted this, as well as every
                    other branch of the history of nature, with an ardour and perseverance that have
                    rarely been equalled, and never surpassed. Gifted with a mind of extraordinary
                    acuteness and comprehension, he appears to have concentrated within it all the
                    learning of his age, which, moulded and transformed by the power of his genius,
                    assumed new forms of arrangement, yielded new products of generalization, and
                    spread its luminous irradiation over every department of human knowledge. At the
                    request of his pupil he undertook an extensive treatise on the natural history
                    of animals; he was liberally furnished with specimens of all kinds, and
                    empowered to command the services of numerous assistants, from every part of the
                    vast empire of Alexander. He spared no labour in the prosecution of this
                    undertaking, and in making the most profitable use of the resources thus placed
                    at his disposal; and contributed in no small degree to the advancement of our
                    knowledge of the animal economy in the diversified forms of life presented by
                    nature. Yet with all the advantages he possessed, it would appear that his
                    knowledge of human anatomy was exceedingly imperfect. He even acknowledges that
                    the internal parts of the human body are but little known; and points out the
                    probable advantages that might result from the examination <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> animals which have the nearest resemblance to the human species, for
                    supplying these déficiences. But his work on the history of animals, <hi
                    rend="italic">¶-epï ζωωv iστoριas,</hi> is unrivalled by the magnitude of the
                    field which it embraces, and by the vast information it contains. To him belongs
                    the merit of arranging the facts in the order, not of their zoological, but
                    their physiological relations; referring every organ to the functions it
                    performs in the animal economy, and thus anticipating the very principle on
                    which, in recent times, Hunter, Blumenbach and Cuvier have founded their more
                    rational and philosophical views of comparative physiology.</p>
                <p>(1132.) The encouragement given by the Ptolemies, the successors of Alexander in
                    Egypt, to every kind of learning, tended greatly to the advancement of anatomy
                    and physiology. Permission was granted by these monarchs to dissect the human
                    body, which none would otherwise have dared to attempt, in opposition to the
                    prejudices of the Egyptians, which were no less violent against dissection than
                    those of the Greeks.</p>
                <p>(1133.) One of the earliest of the physiologists of this period was Erasistratus,
                    the grandson of Aristotle, and the pupil of Chrysippus. Under the patronage of
                    Nicanor, king of Sicily, he enjoyed frequent permission to dissect the bodies of
                    those who were executed, and is even reported by <hi rend="italic">Celsus</hi>
                    to have had criminals delivered to him for the purpose of their being opened
                    while alive, in order that the natural living state of the internal organs might
                    be examined. This account, however, deserves to be regarded rather as a popular
                    tale, which has no other foundation than irrational prejudices against
                    dissection, and was propagated by idle credulity, and a passion for exaggerated
                    scenes of horror. The works of Erasistratus are now lost; but from the
                    quotations of later authors, he appears to have greatly advanced the knowledge
                    of the structure of the human body, more especially by pointing out the
                    circumstances in which it differs from that of other animals, whose anatomy had
                    been previously studied as making the nearest approach to the organization of
                    man.</p>
                <p>(1134.) Another no less distinguished anatomist of the same period was Herophilus
                    of Chalcedon, who also flourished at Alexandria. He was the disciple of
                    Praxagoras, and was considered as the founder of the medical school at
                    Alexandria. He was much occupied in the dissection ol human bodies, and directed
                    his attention particularly to the nervous system. One of the sinuses of the
                    brain, which he is said to have more particularly described, bears to this day
                    the name of the <hi rend="italic">torcular</hi><hi rend="italic">of
                    Herophilus.</hi> He is stated to have been the first anatomist who taught
                    osteology from the human skeleton. He distinguished the nerves from tendons and
                    ligaments, with which they had, before his time, been confounded. He also paid
                    minute attention to the varieties of the pulse, and thus laid a foundation for a
                    knowledge of the important function of the circulation.</p>
                <p>(1135.) Few physiologists of any note are recorded as having flourished from the
                    time of Herophilus to that of Galen. The names of Lycus of Macedonia; of
                    Marinus, who lived in the reign of Nero, have been transmitted to us as the
                    author of some elaborate treatises on the muscles; and also of Rufus Ephesius,
                    who wrote a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Onomasia,</hi> which was considered
                    as the best system of anatomical knowledge extant at that period.</p>
                <p>( 1136.) Galen, the most celebrated and indeed the last of the physiologists of
                    Greece, was bpm at Pergamos, in Asia <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500525"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0525-0726"/>Minor, about 131 years before the Christian era.
                    His father was imbued with the love of letters, and was anxious that his son
                    should receive the benefit of a learned education, which the early promise he
                    gave of superior talents shewed that he was well qualified to turn to advantage.
                    He was placed under the tuition of the best philosophers of the time, and
                    studied in all the schools with extraordinary diligence. His father died long
                    before he could form any probable anticipation of the future fame of his son. It
                    was two years after this event, that young Galen, who was now in his nineteenth
                    year, first turned his attention to medical pursuits, of which he soon became
                    passionately fond. As Alexandria was still the most celebrated school of
                    medicine in the world, he travelled thither with a view of prosecuting his
                    studies; in order to reap every advantage which foreign countries could afford,
                    he visited in succession different parts of Asia Minor and the islands in the
                    Aegean Sea. Anatomy was ever his favourite pursuit; but being debarred from the
                    advantage of examining human bodies, the dissection of which had then been
                    prohibited, even at Alexandria, he had recourse to that of such animals as were
                    supposed to have the greatest resemblance in their structure to man. He has
                    written very fully on cvery part of anatomy; so that his works may be considered
                    as a system, exhibiting every thing which was known on the subject in his time.
                    He was much impressed with the importance of anatomy as the basis of medicine
                    and surgery, and enforces his opinion with singular acuteness and energy. This
                    is evinced by the following passage in his second book of Academical
                    Administrations:</p>
                <p>“What can be more useful in wounds which are received in battle, in the
                    extraction of darts, excision of bones, the reduction of luxations, the opening
                    of fistulae, than to be well acquainted with the anatomy of the limbs? It is of
                    more use to be acquainted with the exterior than the interior parts of the body,
                    as the shoulders, back, breast, the ribs, the belly, and the outward covering of
                    the neck and head; for we are often required to cut into abscesses and sinuses.
                    In the excision of bones it is necessary to cut and dissect; and if we do not
                    know where the artery, vein, or ncrve may be, we are more likely to be the cause
                    of death than of health to the patient.”</p>
                <p>(1137.) Galen is entitled to great praise for having applied himself to the
                    investigation of physiology in connexion with anatomy; so little had hitherto
                    been known on this subject, that we cannot be surprised at the mixture of error
                    which his works exhibit; but although he may often have proceeded on false
                    principles and fallacious hypotheses, yet the reasonings themselves which he
                    employs are always clear and conclusive. His account of the uses of the hand,
                    for example, is remarkably perspicuous and correct. He succeeded in establishing
                    by experiment the fact that arteries contain blood, and thus refuted the
                    doctrines of the Alexandrian school that they are merely filled with air, which
                    they serve to distribute throughout the body. It is interesting also to trace
                    the effect which these subjects of contemplation produced on Galen’s mind. After
                    reviewing the structure of the hand and foot, and their adaptation to their
                    respective functions, he breaks out into the following apostrophe, admirably
                    characteristic of a mind imbued with the genuine spirt of piety:</p>
                <p>“I esteem myself as composing a solemn hymn to the author of our bodily frame,
                    and in this I think there is more true piety than in sacrificing to him
                    hecatombs of oxen, or burnt-offerings of the most costly perfumes; for I first
                    endeavour to know him myself, and afterwards to shew him to others, to inform
                    them how great is his wisdom, his virtue, his goodness.”</p>
                <p>(1138.) The great reputation which Galen had acquired, instead of promoting,
                    tended rather to impede the progress of anatomy and physiology during several
                    succeeding centuries. Where no hope was entertained of emulating the fame of one
                    who was regarded as an infallible oracle, all motive to exertion was repressed.
                    But other causes of a political nature also contributed to the decline of
                    anatomy, as well as of other branches of learning, from the time of Galen to the
                    downfall of the Roman empire, and during the ages of intellectual darkness which
                    followed. Learning, however, still continued to be cultivated at Alexandria,
                    until the capture of that city by the Saracens, in the year 640, when its
                    magnificent library was burnt.</p>
                <p>(1139·) Anatomy and physiology began slowly to revive among the Arabians; but no
                    addition seems to have been made by them to the knowledge which the Greeks had
                    possessed on these subjects. The Arabian physicians were satisfied with what
                    Galen had taught them; and as the rites of the Mahometan religion prohibited all
                    contact with a dead body, an effectual bar was opposed to all improvement in
                    anatomical or physiological knowledge. The work of Avicenna on anatomy is merely
                    a compilation from Galen and other Greek authors; and whenever he ventures to
                    differ from his authorities he is generally wrong. For more than a thousand
                    years after the time of Galen, anatomical and physiological science may be
                    considered as nearly stationary; for scarcely any discovery of the least
                    importance was made during the whole of that period.</p>
                <p>(1140.) The expeditions of the crusaders were the means of introducing into
                    Europe some knowledge of the literature of the Arabians; and the light of
                    science, after a long period of darkness and ignorance, began at length to dawn.
                    In the fourteenth century, anatomy was revived by Mundinus, a Milanese, who had
                    become acquainted with the writings of Galen through an Arabian translation, and
                    who published a system of anatomy in 1315.</p>
                <p>(1141.) The destruction of the Greek empire by the Turks, in the succeeding
                    century, tended to diffuse throughout the west of Europe, whatever portion had
                    remained of the literature of the east. The learned of every profession fled
                    from Constantinople, which had fallen into the hands of barbarians, and sought
                    an asylum in Italy, where they disseminated the seeds of knowledge. The writings
                    of Galen and of the ancients, could now be read in the original; their
                    superiority to the Arabian authors was soon discover ed; and such implicit
                    deference was paid to their opinions, that for many ages no one would venture
                    upon the slightest innovation. The improvement of anatomy was therefore
                    exceedingly slow. It was promoted, however, by the exertions of eminent
                    painters, such as Raphael, Albert Durer, Titian, and above all, Leonardo da
                    Vinci, whose drawings evince considerable knowledge in that study.</p>
                <p>(1142.) The sixteenth century was more auspicious to the progress of anatomy,
                    which was beginning to be cultivated with ardour in Germany and France, as well
                    as in Italy. Berengarius of Carpi, professor at Bononia, acquired such
                    reputation by his skill in dissection, that he was regarded as the restorer of
                    this science. The structure of the ligaments and bones was successfully studied
                    by Charles Stephens; that of the blood-vessels by Fernelius; and that of the
                    muscles by Andernach. Sylvius was also at this time celebrated as a teacher of
                    anatomy.</p>
                <p>( 1143) But the extravagant veneration of antiquity, that spell which has for so
                    many ages held the medical world in thraldom, was at length broken by Vesalius,
                    who boldly ventured to call in question the authority of Galen. This
                    extraordinary man was born at Brussels in 1514, of a family which had for a long
                    time cultivated medicine. He united to remarkable talents, a degree of ardour
                    and perseverance which enabled him to overcome every difficulty; and his
                    progress in the study of anatomy, for which he had very early shewn a
                    partiality, was commensurate with these great qualities. He commenced his
                    studies at Louvain, and prosecuted them in Italy. In a short time he made
                    himself <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500538" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0538-0727"/>master
                    of the Hebrew, Greeκ, and Arabic languages; so that before he had attained his
                    twentieth year, he had already read the works of Galen and Avicenna in the
                    original. Such was his zeal for anatomy, that it is reported he used to rob the
                    gibbets, and dissect the bodies in his bedchamber. In a few years he excelled
                    his teachers, Fernelius and Sylvius, who were esteemed the first anatomists of
                    their time. He soon detected many errors in Galen, some of whose descriptions of
                    parts had been taken from quadrupeds, and applied to man. These errors he
                    ventured to disclose and to correct in his publications; but his boldness in
                    appealing to nature from the authority of Galen, drew upon him the enmity of all
                    the admirers of that great master. He was assailed from all quarters with the
                    bitterest invectives; and Sylvius himself has not scrupled, in the heat of
                    controversy, to brand him with the epithet of <hi rend="italic">Vesanus,</hi> or
                    madman, in allusion to his real name. The criticism which Vesalius had passed on
                    Galen, was retorted by his enemies upon himself; and it must be confessed that
                    in the plates which Vesalius published, some errors of the same kind were
                    detected. But still their general accuracy was undeniable. The work of Vesalius
                    was soon acknowledged to be unrivalled, and its author eventually enjoyed a
                    complete triumph over all his opponents.</p>
                <p>His fame reached the ears of Charles V., who appointed him his physician; but
                    after being raised to that distinguished station, he was soon doomed to
                    experience the inconstancy of fortune. Having obtained permission to examine the
                    body of a Spanish gentleman, whom he had attended in his last illness, he began
                    to lay open the chest, when the bystanders imagined they perceived a tremulous
                    motion of the heart. This circumstance soon got wind, and probably with much
                    exaggeration, reached the ears of the relations of the deceased, who, seized
                    with horror, denounced Vesalius as a murderer; and coupling this charge with
                    that of impiety, arraigned him at the tribunal of the Inquisition. Where
                    superiority of knowledge was esteemed a crime, Vesalius, however unjustly he
                    might be accused, was certain of condemnation. By the influence, how ever, of
                    Philip II., who had then succeeded to his father Charles V., Vesalius was
                    permitted to commute his punishment to a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, the merit
                    of which, it was thought, might sufficiently atone for the heinousness of any
                    crime. This journey he was accordingly obliged to perform; and on his return he
                    was invited by the senate of Venice to teach anatomy, but he perished by
                    shipwreck before he reached that city, when he was about fifty years of age.</p>
                <p>(1144.) The impulse which had been given by Vesalius to the progress of anatomy,
                    continued to operate; and many were the inquirers who pressed forward in the
                    path in which he had so nobly led the way. The barriers to investigation had
                    been removed; nature was open to inquiry; and men had only to observe and to
                    think for themselves. Every year was now adding some new discovery; and it
                    becomes no longer easy to trace the order of their succession, or to ascribe
                    each to their proper authors. We shall endeavour, however, briefly to enumerate
                    those which are most worthy of being noted.</p>
                <p>(1145.) In the year 1561, Fallopius published, in Italy, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observationes</hi><hi rend="italic">Anatomicae,</hi> a work of much merit, and
                    the fruit of great industry. About the same period also, Eustachius arrived at
                    great eminence as an anatomist, and published a set of plates, which he himself
                    engraved; their beauty and accuracy excite astonishment even in the present
                    day.</p>
                <p>(1146.) <hi rend="italic">Fabricius</hi><hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aquapendente,</hi> a professor of anatomy at Padua, was also one
                    of the most distinguished anatomists and physiologists of that period. He
                    published a splendid volume on the formation of the foetus, and bestowed much
                    pains in investigating the mechanism of the motions of animals. He was the first
                    who delineated and drew the attention of the public to the valves of the veins,
                    which had, indeed, been imperfctly seen by Stephens, Sylvius, and Vesalius, and
                    the existence of which had been denied by Fallopius and Eustachius. It was this
                    discovery, perhaps, more than any other, which paved the way for that of the
                    real course of the blood in its circulation; a discovery which was reserved for
                    the illustrious <hi rend="italic">Harvey</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and which
                    has justly rendered his name immortal. As it may be interesting to review the
                    steps which led to this important physiological discovery, we shall retrace its
                    history to a period somewhat more remote.</p>
                <p>(1147.) It is perfectly well ascertained, from an examination of the works of
                    Galen, and of others who have copied from him, that the ancients had not the
                    most distant notion of the real nature of the circulation. The blood was
                    believed by them to have its origin in the liver, and to be undulated
                    alternately in opposite directions in the veins; they imagined that the finer
                    part of it transuded through the septum, or partition separating the cavities of
                    the heart, from the right to the left side, where it mingled with the air
                    received into the lungs, and forming a vital spirit, was moved by a sort of flux
                    and reflux along the arteries.</p>
                <p>(1148.) On the revival of anatomy in Europe some vague notions of the pulmonary
                    circulation appear to have suggested themselves to many eminent men. Vesalius
                    demonstrated that the blood could not possibly pass from the right to the left
                    ventricle through the septum of the heart. Real-dus Columbus, who was professor
                    of anatomy at Padua, and had been a pupil of Vesalius, distinctly traced the
                    passage of the blood through the vessels of the lungs. The same fact had,
                    however, been already discovered by Michael Servetus, who was born in Aragon in
                    1509, and who is more celebrated as a theologian than as a physiologist. Further
                    progress was made by Andrew Coesalpinus, an Italian physician, who speaks of a
                    communication existing between the veins and arteries at their remote
                    extremities, and notices the effect of the valves of the arteries and of the
                    auricles as calculated to prevent a reflux of the blood; but he is quite at a
                    loss to reconcile this observation with the common notions, which he had
                    imbibed, and to which he still adhered, of the functions of these vessels. But
                    notwithstanding these apparent approximations to the truth, it is probable that
                    many ages would have elapsed before the complete discovery of the circulation,
                    if some bold and penetrating genius, such as that of Harvey, had not arisen.</p>
                <p>(1149∙) This illustrious man was born in the year 1578; and the circumstances of
                    his family gave him the advantage of a liberal education. After six years spent
                    at Cambridge, where he was instructed in all the philosophy of the times;
                    finding that the university furnished but very imperfect means of studying
                    either anatomy or medicine, he repaired, at the age of twenty-one, to Padua.
                    Here he became the pupil of Fabricius, who was at the time demonstrating to his
                    students, with all the enthusiasm of a discoverer, the newly .observed valvular
                    structure of the veins. The attention of Harvey being thus directed to this
                    remarkable conformation, he became anxious, on his return to England, to
                    prosecute the inquiry into the purposes which were accomplished by it. He was
                    obliged, for this purpose, to make many experiments on living animals; and these
                    revealed to him the real course of the blood in its circulation; a discovery
                    which ranks unquestionably as the noblest and most important ever made in
                    Physiology. Harvey taught this new doctrine in his lectures about the year 1616;
                    but did not publish anyaccount of it till theyear 1628. On itsbe-ing made known
                    to the world, it met with the most violent opposition; and so inveterate were
                    the prejudices of the public, that the practice of Harvey was considerably
                    diminished in consequence of his discovery. It was remarked that no <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193500551" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0551-0728"/> physician who had
                    passed the age of forty would admit the truth of a doctrine so much at variance
                    with all the systems in which he had been educated. Envious of his growing
                    reputation, many of his cotemporaries had recourse to all kinds of sophistry
                    with the view of detracting from his merit. They at first vehemently contested
                    the truth of the doctrine; but afterwards, when forced to admit it by the
                    decisive evidence adduced in its support, they changed their ground of attack,
                    and alleged that the merit of the discovery did not belong to Harvey, the
                    circulation having been known even to the ancients. But vain were all the
                    efforts of envy and detraction to lessen that fame, which will command the
                    admiration of all future ages. The physiological researches of Harvey were not
                    confined to the function of circulation; but extended also to that of
                    generation, and to the evolution of the ovum, on which he made a series of very
                    valuable observations.</p>
                <p>(1150.) The beginning of the seventeenth century was an important era in anatomy,
                    for it was also marked by another brilliant discovery, namely, that of the
                    lacteals by Asselli in 1622. It appears, from the testimony of Galen, that
                    Erasistratus had noticed white vessels on the mesentery of kids; but the
                    observation was not followed up, and these vessels were supposed to have been
                    merely veins. Asselli was born at Cremona, and was professor of medicine at
                    Pavia. He observed on the mesentery of a dog numerous vessels, filled with a
                    white fluid; he was immediately convinced that he had made an important
                    discovery, and uttered in the fullness of his feelings, the exclamation
                    “Εύρηκα.” Perceiving similar vessels upon the surface of the liver, and
                    entertaining some theoretical views concerning the functions of that organ, he
                    too hastily concluded that the lacteals terminated in the liver. Asselli
                    published an account of his discovery with coloured prints in 1627.</p>
                <p>(1151.) It was not till about thirty years after this discovery of Asselli, that
                    the lacteals were traced by <hi rend="italic">Pecquet,</hi> a French anatomist,
                    into the receptaculum chyli, and thence into the thoracic duct, which he also
                    followed to its termination in the great veins near the heart. These
                    observations were published in the year 1651. All these discoveries were made in
                    brutes; and it remained to be shewn, that similar structures existed in man.
                    This was accomplished by Veslingius, who had already demonstrated the human
                    lacteal vessels, in the year 1634; and the human thoracic duct in 1649- These
                    parts were afterwards more fully investigated by Peirish and Vanhorne. Shortly
                    afterwards, the general absorbents of the body were discovered by Olaus Rudbeck,
                    a Swede, who was born at Avosa, in the year 1630. This discovery was also
                    claimed by Thomas Bartholin, who was born at Copenhagen in the year 1616; but by
                    his own account he had not seen these lymphatic vessels till December 1651,
                    whilst Rudbeck had not only observed them, but had distinguished their
                    peculiarities the year before; Rudbeck had also traced them to the thoracic
                    duct, which Bartholin had failed to do. Dr Joliffe, an English physician, has
                    also contended for the honour of this discovery; but from a comparison of dates,
                    the priority is clearly in favour of the Swedish anatomist. When we consider the
                    minuteness of these vessels and the transparency of their coats, we are able to
                    appreciate the difficulty of detecting their existence, and our surprise must
                    cease at their having remained unknown for so many ages.</p>
                <p>(1152.) No discovery of equal importance to those we have mentioned has been made
                    in anatomy since that period. Many parts of the body, which were unknown in
                    Harvey’s time, have indeed been brought to light; but the principal improvement
                    has consisted in a more accurate knowledge of the composition and minute
                    structure of the several organs. For this we are chiefly indebted to the
                    invention of new anatomical processes both of investigation and of
                    demonstration. Two principal means were employed in these researches; the one
                    was the microscope, the other the practice of injections.</p>
                <p>(1153.) The microscope was first applied to the purposes of anatomical inquiry
                    about the year 1661, by Malpighi, who was born near Bologna, in the year 1638.
                    He examined, by the aid of this instrument, the minute organization of all the
                    vital parts; and more particularly the glands. These researches into the
                    intimate texture of the various parts of animals were prosecuted with great
                    ardour by Lecuwenhoek, a Dutch anatomist, about the year 1680. In exploring this
                    new field of inquiry, which opened views so remote from common apprehension, his
                    enthusiasm has often carried him beyond what was real, both in the power of the
                    instrument, and in the results it afforded. But still much has been effected,
                    and the boundaries of the science have been greatly enlarged by the skilful
                    employment of the microscope.</p>
                <p>(1154.) The arts of preserving the parts of animals when dissected, by drying and
                    varnishing them, and by other modes of preparation, had long been practised; and
                    in these Vanhorne is said to have attained superior excellence. But the most
                    valuable invention of this kind was that of injecting into the vessels certain
                    fluids which would, after a time, become solid, and admit of the course of these
                    vessels being easily traced. The injecting syringe used for this purpose was
                    invented by De Graaf, a Dutch anatomist, about the middle of the seventeenth
                    century; and soon after, the proper materials for injection were discovered by
                    Swammerdam. The art of injection was carried to a very high degree of perfection
                    by Ruysch; but with a degree of selfish illiberality which cannot be too
                    strongly condemned, he kept secret the methods he employed.</p>
                <p>(1155.) The advancement of Physiology was greatlypro-moted both by the practice
                    of this art, and by the dexterous employment of the microscope; and discoveries
                    in this science have succeeded one another so rapidly from the period of their
                    invention, that in giving an account of them, it is scarcely possible to
                    preserve an unbroken narration; and it would be impossible, in this sketch, to
                    recount the numerous minor improvements which have been made in our knowledge of
                    this department of science from the epoch down to which we have now brought its
                    history. Much error was still mingled with the acquisition of real knowledge on
                    these subjects; and it has required tho exertion of the more severe and
                    scrutinizing spirit of inquiry which characterizes the philosophers of a later
                    period, to winnow the grain from the chaff, and refine the pure metal from the
                    superfluous ore which had been dug up along with it from the mine. Physiologists
                    were slow in recognising the peculiarities which appertain to the vital powers,
                    and those of the beginning of the eighteenth century long persisted in ascribing
                    the phenomena of life to the operation of the same laws which regulate those of
                    inanimate nature. Hence the history of physiology is occupied at that period,
                    chiefly by the contentions which arose between the rival sects of chemists and
                    mathematicians; each striving to apply to physiology the principles and methods
                    of investigation which prevailed in their respective sciences. Much ingenuity
                    was wasted in these unprofitable researches; for although some important fact
                    was occasionally brought to light by the prosecution of elaborate inquiries,
                    prompted by endeavours to support each favourite speculation, yet not one of
                    these hypotheses could long maintain its ground, nor could it be said that a
                    single general principle had been established.</p>
                <p>(1156.) A new light was now thrown on the subject of physiology, which tended to
                    dissipate the clouds of error in which it had been obscured by the dogmatical
                    tenets ofboth the chemical and the mechanical sects; and to effect a complete
                    renovation in the science. The new doctrine which thus superseded the former,
                    originated in Stahl; who,’although educated in the school of the chemists, soon
                    shook off the trammels of his instructors, and with the vigour of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193500564" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0564-0729"/>native genius began to
                    reflect for himself. He perceived the futility of their doctrines, and strongly
                    impressed with the wide differences observable between the phenomena presented
                    by organized beings, and those which the same bodies exhibit when devoid of
                    vitality, conceived that they were governed by some agency opposed to the
                    ordinary physical powers of matter; and to this agent he gave the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">anima·,</hi> (see §. 101), ascribing to it endowments allied to
                    intelligence, which controlled all the changes in the system, and of which the
                    operations were always directed to salutary ends. This hypothesis, gratuitous
                    and unphilosophical as it was, had the beneficial effect of directing the
                    attention of physiologists to the phenomena which peculiarly characterise the
                    living state, and prepared them for the study of the laws of these vital
                    phenomena. Much praise is also due to Hoffmann, who, although too hasty in his
                    conclusions to inspire confidence in their correctness, appears to have been
                    amongst the earliest of the followers of Stahl, who entertained proper views of
                    the principles and objects of physiology. Boerhaave was celebrated at this time
                    for the extent of his information, the soundness of his judgment, and his talent
                    in the art of instruction. His doctrines had extensive influence in the schools
                    of medicine; but being destitute of the solid support of facts, they did not
                    long survive their propounder.</p>
                <p>(1157.) But the great founder of modern physiology is unquestionably Haller,
                    whose labours in this field of inquiry are so prodigious in extent, and so
                    fruitful in results, that the publication of his Elements, to which it may be
                    per ceived we have had occasion in the course of this treatise perpetually to
                    refer, must be considered as forming an important era in the history of the
                    science.</p>
                <p>(1158.) The attention of physiologists was beginning to be more particularly
                    directed to the functions of the nervous system; and the labours of Whytt at
                    this period had tended much to give it this impulse. Amongst the host of names
                    which claim our notice as having contributed their share in the rapid progress
                    of discovery, since this time, we can point out only a few of the most
                    illustrious. William Hunter, the Monros, and Cullen, are amongst those most
                    eminent for the services which they have rendered to physiology; but perhaps the
                    largest contributor to the mass of facts collected in modern times was John
                    Hunter. The merits of Bichat were also of the first order; and considering how
                    early his career was cut short by the hand of death, the additions which he has
                    made to the stock of facts, and the influence which his opinions have had on the
                    progress of the science, must excite astonishment. Germany and Italy, as well as
                    France, have been prolific in ardent devotees and successful cultivators of
                    physiology; and although it might be invidious to point out particular names, we
                    should be sorry to omit those of Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Soemmerring, Meckel,
                    Gmelin, and Müller; nor should the justly earned fame of Cuvier be passed over
                    in silence, even in this brief and imperfect retrospect of the benefactors of
                    our race, for such we must esteem all those who enlarge the sphere of human
                    knowledge, and thereby confer the most solid accession to the power and
                    happiness of man.</p>
