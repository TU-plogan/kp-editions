                <p><label type="entry">PENN, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, an eminent
                    writer amongst the Quakers, and the planter and legislator of Pennsylvania, was
                    the son of Sir William Penn, and born at London in the year 1644. In 1660 he was
                    entered a gentleman of Christ-Church, in Oxford; but having previously received
                    an impression from the preaching of one Thomas Loe, a Quaker, he withdrew, with
                    some other students, from the national worship, and held private meetings, where
                    they preached and prayed amongst themselves. This having given great offence to
                    the heads of the college, Mr Penn, although only sixteen years of age, was fined
                    for non-conformity; and, continuing his religious exercises, he was at length
                    expelled the college. Upon his return home, he was on the same account treated
                    with great severity by his father, who at length turned him out of doors; but
                    his resentment afterwards abating, Penn was sent, in company with some persons
                    of quality, to France, where he continued for a considerable time, and returned
                    not only well skilled in the French language, but a polite and accomplished
                    gentleman. About the year 1666, his father committed to his care a considerable
                    estate in Ireland. Being found in one of the Quakers’ meetings in Cork, he, with
                    many others, was thrown into prison; but having written to the Earl of Orrery,
                    he was soon after discharged. However, his father being informed that he still
                    adhered to his opinions, sent for him to England, and finding him unmoved by all
                    his arguments, turned him out of doors a second time. About the year 1668, he
                    became a public preacher amongst the Quakers, and in that year was committed
                    close prisoner to the Tower, where he wrote several treatises. Being discharged
                    after seven months’ imprisonment, he went to Ireland, where he also preached
                    amongst the Quakers. Returning to England, he was, in 1670, committed to Newgate
                    for preaching in Gracechurch Street meeting-house, London; but being tried at
                    the sessions-house of the Old Bailey, he was acquitted. In September the same
                    year his father died, and, being perfectly reconciled to his son, left him both
                    his paternal blessing and a good estate. But his persecutions were not yet at an
                    end; for in the year 1671 he was committed to Newgate, for preaching at a
                    meeting in Wheeler Street, London; and during his imprisonment, which continued
                    six months, he also wrote several treatises. After his discharge he went into
                    Holland and Germany; and, in the beginning of the year 1672, married and settled
                    with his family at Rickmansworth, in Hertfordshire. The same year he published
                    several pieces, and particularly one against Reeve and Muggleton. In 1677 he
                    again travelled into Holland and Germany, in order to propagate his opinions,
                    and had frequent conversations with the Princess Elizabeth, daughter to the
                    Queen of Bohemia, and sister to the Princess Sophia, mother of George I. In the
                    year 1681, Charles II., in consideration of the services of Mr Penn’s father,
                    and several debts due to him by the crown at the time of his decease, granted Mr
                    Penn and his heirs the province lying on the western side of the river Delaware,
                    in North America, which thence obtained the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pennsylvania.</hi> Upon this Mr Penn published a brief account of the province,
                    together with the king’s patent; and proposing an easy purchase of lands, and
                    good terms of settlement, for such as were inclined to remove thither, he
                    induced many to proceed to the new settlement. These having made and improved
                    their plantations to good advantage, the governor, in order to secure the
                    planters from the native Indians, appointed commissioners to purchase the land
                    which he had received from the king of the native Indians, and concluded a peace
                    with them. The city of Philadelphia was planned and built; and he himself drew
                    up the fundamental constitutions of Pennsylvania, in twenty-four articles. In
                    1681 he was elected a member of the Royal Society; and the next year he embarked
                    for Pennsylvania, where he continued about two years, and returned to England in
                    August 1684.</p>
                <p>Upon the accession of James II. to the throne, he was taken into a great degree
                    of favour with his majesty, which exposed him to the imputation of being a
                    Papist; but from this he fully vindicated himself. However, upon the Revolution,
                    he was examined before the council in 1688, and obliged to give security for his
                    appearance upon the first day of next term, which was afterwards continued. He
                    was several times examined and discharged; and at length warrants being issued
                    out against him, he was obliged to conceal himself during two or three years.
                    But being at last permitted to appear before the king and council, he
                    represented his innocence so effectually that he was acquitted. In August 1699,
                    he, with his wife and family, embarked for Pennsylvania, whence he returned in
                    1701, in order to vindicate his proprietary right, which had been attacked
                    during his absence. On Queen Anne’s accession to the crown, he was in great
                    favour with her majesty, and often at court. But in 1707 he was involved in a
                    law-suit with the executors of a person who had formerly been his steward; and,
                    though many thought him aggrieved, the Court of Chancery did not deem it proper
                    to afford him any relief; upon which account he was obliged to live within the
                    rules of the Fleet for several months, till the matter in dispute was
                    accommodated. Penn died in the year 1718.</p>
                <p>At one period of his life Penn lodged in a house in Norfolk Street, in the
                    Strand. In the entrance to it he had a peeping-hole, through which he could see
                    any person who came to him. A creditor one day sent in his name, and having been
                    made to wait more than a reasonable time, he knocked for the servant, whom he
                    asked, “Will not thy master see me ?” “Friend,” answered the servant, “he has
                    seen thee, but he does not like thee.” Mr Penn’s friendly and pacific manner of
                    treating the Indians produced in them an extraordinary love for him and his
                    people; so that they maintained a perfect amity with the English settled in
                    Pennsylvania. He was the great bulwark of the Quakers, in defence of whom he
                    wrote numberless pieces. The most esteemed of these are, 1. His Primitive
                    Christianity revived; 2. His defence of a paper entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gospel Truths, against the exceptions of the Bishop of Cork</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> 3. His Persuasive to Moderation; 4. His Good Advice to the
                    Church of England, Roman Catholic, and Protestant Dissenter; 5. The Sandy <pb

                    shaken; 6. No Cross, no Crown; 7. The great case of Liberty of Conscience
                    debated; Ö. The Christian Quaker and his Testimony stated and vindicated; 9. A
                    Discourse of the general Rule of Faith and Practice, and Judge of Controversy;
                    10. England’s Present Interest considered; 11. An Address to Protestants; 12.
                    His Reflections and Maxims; 13. His Advice to his Children; 14. His Rise and
                    Progress of the People called <hi rend="italic">Quakers</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> 15. A Treatise on Oaths. Most of these have passed through several
                    editions, some of them many. The letters between William Penn and Dr Tillotson,
                    and William Penn and William Popple, together with Penn’s letters to the
                    Princess Elizabeth of the Rhine, and the Countess of Hornes, as also one to his
                    wife on his going to Pennsylvania, are inserted in his works, which were first
                    collected and published in two volumes folio; and the parts since selected, and
                    abridged into one volume folio, are deservedly admired for the good sense by
                    which they are characterized.</p>
