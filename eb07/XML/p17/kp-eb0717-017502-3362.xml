                <p><label type="entry">PEKING, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Pekin</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated city of Asia, and capital of the great empire of China. It is built
                    in the form of an oblong square, of which the four walls face the cardinal
                    points, and enclose an area of about fourteen square miles, independently of the
                    suburbs, which are very extensive. The walls are built of brick, and are thirty
                    feet in height. In the south wall there are three gates, and in each of the
                    other sides two, from which it is sometimes called the city with nine gates; but
                    its usual name is <hi rend="italic">Peking,</hi> or the Northern Court. The city
                    is divided into two parts; namely, the old city, which is inhabited by the
                    Chinese; and the new city or the imperial city, which is inhabited by the
                    Tartars. It is in the shape of a parallelogram, and is about a mile in length
                    from north to south, and three fourths of a mile from east to west. The middle
                    gate on the south side opens into this space; and it is surrounded by a wall
                    built of large red polished bricks, twenty feet in height, covered with a roof
                    of tiles painted yellow and varnished. Here are contained the imperial palace
                    and gardens, all the tribunals or public offices of government, and lodgings for
                    the ministers, eunuchs, artificers, and tradesmen belonging to the court. Within
                    the enclosure flows a winding rivulet, which being formed into canals, basins,
                    and lakes, with artificial mounts, rocks, and groves, exhibits a lively
                    imitation of the picturesque and the beautiful in natural scenery. The imperial
                    palace of Yuen-mien, which is situated without the city, is even on a larger
                    scale, the grounds being at least ten miles in diameter, and comprising an area
                    of 60,000 English acres, laid out, like the grounds in the palace within the
                    walls, in representing all the great features of nature, namely, lakes,
                    mountains, forests, rocks, and rivers, which are thrown together with an
                    irregular boldness of style that has a striking effect. These grounds contain
                    thirty distinct places of residence for the emperor, besides a village of
                    considerable size. These buildings, however, are remarkable for their meanness,
                    resembling rather cottages than palaces. Even the very dwelling of the emperor,
                    and the grand hall of audience, when divested of their colour and gilding, are
                    not much superior to the barns of an English farmer. Nor is any rule of
                    proportion studied in the construction of these apartments. The length of the
                    audience-hall is a hundred and ten feet, by forty-two in breadth, and the height
                    is twenty feet. The ceiling is embellished with circles, squares, and polygons,
                    and loaded with a great variety and glare of colours. The throne, placed in the
                    recess, is adorned with exquisite carving. It is supported by rows of pillars
                    painted red, and consists entirely of a wood resembling mahogany. Between the
                    other two gates in the south and north walls run two streets in a straight line,
                    four English miles in length, and about a hundred and twenty feet in breadth.
                    These are crossed by one street of the same breadth, which runs from the gate of
                    the eastern wall to the opposite gate on the west. There is another street which
                    runs in the same direction; but it is interrupted in its progress by the north
                    wall of the imperial city, round which it is carried. The cross streets, which
                    branch off from the main streets at right angles, are merely lanes, being very
                    narrow. They are all unpaved, and covered with sand and dust, but are frequently
                    watered, and kept very clean. The houses are low, few being more than one story
                    in height; not a chimney is to be seen rising above the ordinary level; and this
                    circumstance, together with the regularity of the streets, all laid out in
                    straight lines, give to the city the appearance of an encampment. None but the
                    great shops have either windows or openings in the front wall, though most of
                    them have a sort of terrace, with a railed balcony or parapet wall in front,
                    ornamented with flowers, shrubs, or stunted trees. The principal streets have on
                    each side a line of buildings, consisting entirely of shops and warehouses, in
                    front of which the goods are displayed; and large wooden pillars are erected
                    higher than the houses, on which are notified in gilt characters the nature of
                    the goods to be sold, and the honest character of the dealers, and which are,
                    besides, decorated with various-coloured flags, and streamers and ribands from
                    top to bottom, exhibiting the appearance of a line of shipping dressed in the
                    colours of all the different nations of Europe. Nor are the sides of the houses
                    less brilliant in the several colours in which they are painted, consisting
                    generally of sky-blue or green, mixed with gold; and amongst the articles which
                    make the most splendid show are the coffins for the dead, and the funeral biers,
                    which vie in their expensive trappings with the marriage cars. Barrow, who
                    visited China with Lord Macartney’s embassy, gives a lively description of the
                    animated scene which the first <hi rend="italic">coup d’ail</hi> of the streets
                    presented to the view. “The multitude of moveable workshops,” says Mr Barrow,
                    “of tinkers and barbers, cobblers and blacksmiths; the tents and booths where
                    tea and fruit, rice and other eatables, were exposed for sale, with the wares
                    and merchandise arrayed before the doors, had contracted the spacious street to
                    a narrow road in the middle, just wide enough for two of our little vehicles to
                    pass each other. The cavalcade of officers and soldiers that preceded the
                    embassy; the processions of men in office, attended by their numerous retinues,
                    bearing umbrellas, and flags, and painted lanterns, and a variety of strange
                    insignia of their rank and station; different trains that were accompanying with
                    lamentable cries corpses to their graves, and, with squalling music, brides to
                    their husbands; the troops of dromedaries laden with coals from Tartary, the
                    wheelbarrows and hand-carts stuffed with vegetables; occupied nearly the whole
                    of this middle space in one continued line, leaving very little room for the
                    cavalcade of the embassy to pass. All was in motion. The sides of the streets
                    were filled with an immense concourse of people buying and selling, and
                    bartering their different commodities. The buzz and confused noises of this
                    mixed multitude, proceeding from the loud bawling of those who were crying
                    their· wares, the wrangling of others, with every now and then a strange
                    twanging noise like the jarring of a cracked Jew’s harp, the barber’s signal
                    made by his tweezers, the mirth and laughter that prevailed in every group,
                    could scarcely be exceeded by the brokers in the bank rotunda, or the Jews and
                    old women in Rosemary Lane. Pedlars with their packs, and jugglers and
                    conjurers, fortune-tellers, mountebanks, quack-doctors, comedians and musicians,
                    left no space unoccupied.” Tartar women are commonly seen amongst the crowd,
                    either walking or riding on horses, which they bestride like men. The Chinese
                    women are, however, rigidly confined to the house in Peking, as in other parts
                    of the empire.</p>
                <p>Of the ornamental structures to be seen in Peking, the most remarkable are three
                    singular erections at the four points where the great streets intersect each
                    other, called triumphal arches, but which are rather monuments to the memory of
                    distinguished characters, especially of those»</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193493375" xml:id="kp-eb0717-3375-0176"/>
                <p>who have attained to extraordinary longevity. They are formed sometimes of stone,
                    but generally of wood; and consist of a large central gateway, with a smaller
                    one on each side, all covered with narrow roofs; and, like the dwelling-houses,
                    they are splendidly painted, varnished, and gilt. Large characters of gold
                    announce that each monument was erected in commemoration of some distinguished
                    person, or of some interesting event.</p>
                <p>The police of this capital is well regulated, and the public peace seldom
                    disturbed. At certain distances, and at the end of every cross street, is placed
                    a soldier, who keeps watch in a sentry-box; and few streets are without a
                    guardhouse. The proprietor or inhabitant of every tenth house is, besides, held
                    responsible for the conduct of his nine neighbours; and is bound, on the
                    appearance of any riotous conduct, to give intimation to the nearest
                    guard-house. The soldiers also on guard go their rounds, and at intervals strike
                    upon a short tube of bamboo, which gives a dull hollow sound, and which, Barrow
                    mentions, prevented himself and other members of the British embassy from
                    sleeping until they became accustomed to it. “The city,” says Sir George
                    Staunton, “partakes of the regularity and interior safety of a camp, but is
                    subject also to its constraints. In the suburbs only public women are registered
                    and licensed, though they are not numerous. The inhabitants of Peking are not
                    remarkable for their cleanliness. There are no common sewers in the city to
                    carry off the dirt and dregs that must accumulate amid such a large collection
                    of people; and such are the singular and revolting habits of the people, that no
                    kind of filth or nastiness is thrown into the streets to create an offensive
                    smell: it is carefully stored up within the house in an earthen jar kept for the
                    purpose; and when it is full, it is sold for manure, and carried off in small
                    bored carts with one wheel, which supply the city with vegetables. The
                    consequence of this filthy practice is, that a disgusting odour remains about
                    all the houses the whole day long.”</p>
                <p>The walls by which the city is surrounded do not appear to exceed twenty-five, or
                    at most thirty feet in height. They are flanked with square towers, placed at
                    regular distances of about seventy yards each, with a small guardhouse on its
                    summit; and these towers project about forty feet from the line of the wall. The
                    wall at its base is about twenty-five feet thick, and the width across the top
                    within the parapets is twelve feet. The middle part, composed of the earth which
                    had been dug out of the ditch, is kept together by two retaining walls, partly
                    of brick and partly of stone. No cannon are mounted on the walls or bastions;
                    but in the high building surmounting the gate, and which is several stories in
                    height, the port-holes are closed with red doors, on the outside of which are
                    painted representations of cannon, not unlike the sham ports in a ship of
                    war.</p>
                <p>The most exaggerated ideas were formerly entertained of the population of Peking.
                    In the last century the Jesuit Grimaldi carried it to the amount of sixteen
                    millions. According to the most accurate information that could be obtained by
                    the embassy of Lord Macartney, the present population of Peking may be estimated
                    at three millions. The low houses seem to be by no means adequate to so vast a
                    population; but very little room is required for a Chinese family, especially
                    amongst the middling and lower classes. A Chinese dwelling, surrounded by a wall
                    six or seven feet in height, contains a whole family of three generations, with
                    their respective wives and children. Still, with all these allowances, it is
                    probable that this estimate of three millions, given by the Mandarins to the
                    British embassy, is considerably exaggerated. Long. 116. 28. E. Lat. 39. 55.
