                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Peru</hi> is the name of one of the republics of South
                    America, but it likewise designates a large empire long since dismembered, yet
                    still renowned for its wealth and ancient civilization. The limits of the
                    present state do not comprehend much more than one third of the country over
                    which the incas held dominion, from its having been repeatedly partitioned by
                    the Spaniards, and always unwisely even for themselves. Ancient Peru extended
                    from about 2. 0. of north to the twenty-sixth parallel of south latitude, thus
                    including what is now called the Republic of the Equator, or Quito; and from 57.
                    0. to 81. 0. of west longitude, thus comprehending the whole of Bolivia or Upper
                    Peru. Previously, however, to defining the boundaries of the republic, and
                    describing its present condition, we shall briefly glance at the early annals of
                    the country, and then take a rapid historical survey of the political
                    revolutions which it has undergone, from the period when the Spaniards first
                    drew their swords upon the “Children of the Sun.”</p>
                <p>The native annals of Peru ascend no higher than the era of the first inca, who
                    flourished in the twelfth century. The individual who first established
                    monarchical authority in the country was called Manco Capac, supposed by the
                    natives to have been commissioned by divine Providence to deliver the world from
                    an evil genius, to whose diabolical sway it had been abandoned. From this
                    superstition, and also from tradition, it appears that previously to the period
                    in question, the inhabitants of Peru ranked amongst the most barbarous of the
                    American savages, roaming the primeval forests with which their country was then
                    covered, more like wild beasts than men, strangers to agriculture and to all the
                    useful arts, and having no fixed place of abode. Manco Capac, however, along
                    with the beautiful Mama Oello or Ocollo, at once his wife and sister, reclaimed
                    the Peruvians from this degraded condition. He showed them how to till and
                    irrigate the soil, to construct residences, and to fix the division of lands. He
                    overthrew their altars which were stained with blood, and taught them the more
                    harmless idolatry of worshipping the sun. Assisted by Oello, he instructed the
                    people in the moralities of life and the obligations of nature; he enjoined
                    every man to bestow a portion of his time and industry for the benefit of his
                    neighbour, and inculcated brotherly love not only amongst members of the same,
                    but of different families. He framed laws for the happiness of the community,
                    and commanded obedience to them more by humanity than by force. At the same time
                    he compelled his subjects to submit implicitly to the will of the incas, and
                    retarded the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494896" xml:id="kp-eb0717-4896-0293"
                    />progress of the human mind by making it unlawful for a son to follow any
                    profession except that of his father. The empire which this remarkable person
                    founded comprised only a small territory around the city of Cuzco; and the
                    Peruvian traditions assign no earlier date than that of his reign to the dawn of
                    civilization. It is the opinion of Humboldt, however, that the architectural
                    monuments which are found on the elevated table-land of Tiahuanaco, had an
                    origin prior to the twelfth century, and that they served as models for the
                    edifices which the incas erected at Cuzco; thus proving, that remarkable
                    advancement had been made in the useful arts before the time of Manco. Who the
                    architects of these original structures really were, it is nearly impossible to
                    conjecture, far less to assert with confidence. The Spaniards, on their arrival
                    in the country, were informed by the natives that they were constructed by “a
                    race of white and bearded men,” who inhabited the ridge of the Cordilleras long
                    before the foundation of the empire of the incas.</p>
                <p>But to whatever race they may have belonged, it seems perfectly certain that they
                    had found their way to Peru along the ridges of the Cordilleras, and that the
                    civilization of South America, as well as that of Mexico emanated from the
                    north. The following observations of Humboldt, in reference to the appearance of
                    Manco Capac, are characterized by his usual sagacity. “Though no traditions
                    point out any direct connection between the nations of North and South America,
                    their history is not the less fraught with analogies in the political and
                    religious revolutions from which dates the civilization of the Aztecs, the
                    Muyseas, and the Peruvians. Men with beards, and of fairer complexions than the
                    natives of Anahuac, Cundinamara, and the elevated plain of Cuzco, make their
                    appearance without any indication of the place of their birth, bearing the
                    titles of high priests, legislators, the friends of peace and the arts, and
                    operate a sudden change in the policy of the nations, who hail their arrival
                    with veneration. Quetzalcoatl, Bochica, and Manco Capac, are the sacred names of
                    these mysterious beings.” Still this only refers to a second migration. Those to
                    whom the natives attributed the construction of the more ancient works had
                    arrived in the country long before the first inca came amongst them, no one knew
                    from whence. But over the erection of these earliest architectural monuments
                    there hangs a veil of impenetrable mystery.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Under the sway of Manco and his successors the improvement of the barbarians of
                    Peru advanced with amazing celerity; but it soon reached as high a point as the
                    state of knowledge and the political circumstances of the country would admit.
                    In Peru agriculture was carried on with greater skill than in any other part of
                    America; and the monarchs themselves set an example of industry, by cultivating
                    a field near Cuzco with their own hands; an honour which is still conferred upon
                    agriculture in the “celestial empire.” They showed much ingenuity in the
                    building and navigation of their floats; but it was in the erection and
                    ornamenting of their temples and palaces that the Peruvians displayed the utmost
                    extent of their constructive skill. The ruins of these magnificent edifices,
                    which are found in every province, attest at once the great power possessed by
                    the early monarchs, and the high degree of knowledge in theartsto which the
                    people had attained; whilst they also show that during two centuries at least
                    the nation must have subsisted in a state of considerable improvement. The great
                    temple of the sun at Pachacamac, with the palace of the inca, and the fortress,
                    were so connected together as to form one great building half a league in
                    circuit. But perhaps the noblest works of the incas were the two great roads
                    from Cuzco to Quito, a distance of not less than 1500 miles.</p>
                <p>One of these was carried through the mountainous country, and the other wound
                    along’the maritime plains. At proper intervals storehouses were erected for the
                    accommodation of the inca and his attendants in his progress through his
                    dominions; and flying bridges of ropes were stretched across the torrents which
                    intersected the road in their course from the Andes to the western ocean.
                    Although these roads were only fifteen feet in breadth, and not fit for
                    carriages, yet they must be considered very wonderful works, from the natural
                    obstacles which had been overcome in constructing them. Mounds of earth and
                    other works rendered the ascent of hills comparatively easy. Granaries were
                    built at certain distances; and charitable houses, ever open to the wanderer,
                    were founded by the incas. Canals, fortresses, and other buildings of a public
                    nature, varied and improved the aspect of the country.</p>
                <p>In many of the provinces, the sides of lofty hills, or rather mountains, are
                    cased round with terraces or hanging gardens, which rise one above another to a
                    surprising elevation. Each terrace is faced with stone, and although of
                    inconsiderable width, they cover the sides of such high and extensive mountains,
                    that they alone must have produced subsistence for a large population. These
                    terraced strips of land were by the Peruvians called Andenes, which probably
                    induced the conquerors to give the name of Andes to the whole of the gigantic
                    mountain chain which stretches from the Straits of Magelhaens to the Isthmus of
                    Panama. The Andenes are often to be seen in districts where rain never falls,
                    and how they could have been irrigated is now unknown.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Memoirs of General Millar, vol. ii. p.
                    188-9.</p></note> Amongst the remarkable works of the ancient Peruvians were the
                    azequias or aqueducts, by which large tracts of country now condemned to
                    perpetual sterility were made fertile by water conveyed from an immense
                    distance. The subterraneous azequias of Nasea were of great extent; and although
                    many of them are choked up, a sufficient number remain to give amazing fertility
                    to the valley of Nasco. It is not known how far they penetrated, but it is
                    supposed that the Peruvians drove an adit horizontally until they met with a
                    perennial spring.</p>
                <p>The skill of the ancient Peruvians in mining, metallurgy, and the working of the
                    precious metals, was considerable, and beyond that of the other American
                    nations. Not only were the sacred temples and the royal residences profusely
                    adorned with ornaments of gold and silver, but even trees and shrubs
                    fantastically formed of these metals were placed in the imperial gardens at
                    Cuzco. The most ordinary domestic utensils were made of them; and several of
                    their vessels and trinkets are said to have exhibited considerable skill in the
                    workmanship. Mirrors of highly polished stone have been discovered in their
                    sepulchral mounds; but that which gave the Peruvians a decided superiority, in
                    various arts, over the other tribes of the west, was such a knowledge of
                    metallurgy as enabled them to mix copper and tin in such proportions as to form
                    a compound metal hard enough to supply the place of iron. But notwithstanding
                    this advantage, they were lamentably deficient in all the jmplements necessary
                    for the mechanical arts, and none of their attainments are entitled to be
                    considered as greater than those of a people in the first stage of incipient
                    civilization. The painting, statuary, and carving which adorned their temples
                    and palaces appear to have been very indifferent. Humboldt remarks, that the
                    Peruvians were not unacquainted with symbolical paintings, but that they had
                    nothing at all equivalent to the picture-writing and hieroglyphics of the
                    Mexicans. They made use of knots and threads of various colours, which they
                    called <hi rend="italic">qmppos</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and these strings
                    were used to record events, as well as for purposes of calculation. Their
                    knowledge<pb break="no" facs="nls:193494909" xml:id="kp-eb0717-4909-0294"/> of
                    astronomy, although exceedingly imperfect, was yet far from being contemptible.
                    The incas, who had discovered the annual revolution of the sun, marked out the
                    summer and winter solstices by high towers, which they erected on the east and
                    west of the city of Cuzco. By the position in which the sun rose and set on the
                    east and west of these, the summer and winter solstices were determined. They
                    also observed the equinoxes, and celebrated the event of the vertical position
                    of the luminary in heaven, by holding a great festival in the temple which they
                    had dedicated to it on earth. They distinguished the months by the moon, and
                    their weeks were called quarters of the moon. Like other ignorant races of men,
                    they were alarmed by eclipses of the sun or moon; but they do not appear to have
                    predicted events by the aspect of the stars, though dreams, and the entrails of
                    beasts, which they offered in sacrifice, were considered as instructive objects
                    of divination.</p>
                <p>The government of the incas was a species of theocracy, the sovereign uniting in
                    his own person the functions of priest and king, with both temporal and
                    spiritual domination. The sun was the object of supreme adoration, and the incas
                    were considered as his children, descended from him through Manco Capac, who was
                    believed to be the offspring of their god. They also adored a twofold being
                    named Con Pachacamac, who they believed was the creator of the Peruvians. But
                    although the Peruvian form of government was the most absolute despotism, it was
                    much more mild in its nature, and less oppressive in its operation, than that of
                    the Mexicans. The people were taught, and they yielded, the most slavish
                    submission to their sovereigns; for, after their deity the sun, the incas were
                    regarded with the greatest veneration. Almost every crime was punishable with
                    death; and the incas seldom forgave an injury. It was customary for them to
                    mutilate the faces and limbs of all the individuals taken in a revolted
                    district. As an illustration of the nature of their government, one law may be
                    sufficient. If it were discovered that a priestess of the sun had violated her
                    oath of chastity, she was buried alive, whilst her seducer was tortured to death
                    in the most cruel manner. Even the families of the offending parties were
                    consigned to the flames; and a line being drawn around the birthplace of the two
                    lovers, like the doomed cities of Scripture, it was marked out as a desert for
                    ever. The number of offenders against any of the laws is said to have been
                    extremely few. Their religion, however, was unpolluted by the bloody rites of
                    that of Mexico The “terrible god,” the Moloch of the west, held no sway in Peru.
                    Lambs and other animals were offered in sacrifices, but human victims never bled
                    on the altars of the sun. The national character of the Peruvians harmonized
                    with the genius of their religion, being more gentle and pacific than that of
                    any other people in America. Even their wars are said to have been prosecuted
                    with singular humanity. But the funeral rites of their monarchs accorded ill
                    with this mildness in religion and general manners. At the death of the incas
                    and of other eminent persons, a number of their vassals were buried in the
                    tumuli, along with the dead bodies. The number was sometimes very great. On the
                    death of Huana Capac, the greatest of their incas, above a thousand victims were
                    doomed to accompany him to the tomb. In another particular the manners of the
                    Peruvians were singularly barbarous. Although very well acquainted with the uses
                    of fire in culinary operations, they astonished the Spaniards by devouring both
                    flesh and fish perfectly raw.</p>
                <p>Gold and silver were used for ornamental purposes alone, and were never employed
                    as a circulating medium. The produce of the earth was enjoyed in common. The
                    whole being divided by proper officers into four portions, the first was
                    destined for the indigent; the second was set apart for the maintenance of the
                    priests and virgins of the sun, and for other religious purposes; the third was
                    appropriated to the community; and the fourth and last to the inca and his
                    family. The incas spoke a language which was not permitted to be taught even to
                    the nobles, far less to the people; and messages were transmitted to members of
                    his family, from one end of the kingdom to the other, without the bearers of
                    them, who were stationed at regular intervals, understanding the import of the
                    communication which they conveyed. This language was lost a generation or two
                    after the conquest.</p>
                <p>That Cuzco was the only city which ancient Peru possessed, as asserted by Dr
                    Robertson, is completely at variance with the accounts of recent travellers, who
                    have found extensive remains in various parts of the country. It was, however,
                    the capital of the empire, and the centre of its wealth and civilization.
                    Throughout the rest of Peru the people appear to have lived chiefly in detached
                    habitations or small villages, with the exception, it may be hazarded, of a few
                    large towns, situated widely apart and in particular positions; for it appears
                    that the Peruvians never built a town or suffered a single house to occupy a
                    spot that was susceptible of cultivation. Little intercourse was maintained
                    amongst the different provinces, for there were no stated markets, as in Mexico
                    and the inland trade was insignificant. Distinction of ranks was recognised, for
                    not a small proportion of the inhabitants were scarcely above the condition of
                    slaves; but there was no separation of crafts, every Peruvian practising all the
                    arts indiscriminately. That this people could have advanced far in improvement
                    under such a system was impossible; and we are only surprised that they should
                    have attained to such a degree of refinement as they actually reached. The
                    natural character of the Peruvians was also such as to preclude anything like a
                    rapid progress of manners and refinement of life. They were tame and abject;
                    their mildness degenerated into sloth, and their submission into a slavish fear
                    of danger. When all these circumstances are taken into consideration; the vast
                    extent of country over which the inhabitants were scattered, chiefly in hamlets
                    and huts, and having little intercourse with the imperial city; the physical
                    weakness of the Indian race in general, and the natural timidity of the Peruvian
                    character in particular, increased as it must have been by the system of
                    government under which they lived; and the political debility which necessarily
                    attached to a social structure so slenderly constituted as that of Peru; when
                    these things are duly weighed, we shall experience less surprise that the
                    conquest of the country should have been effected, almost without a struggle, by
                    a handful of daring and desperate adventurers.</p>
                <p>The first intelligence of the great Southern Ocean, and the country washed by its
                    waters, was obtained by Nuñez de Balboa, Spanish governor of Darien, in 1512,
                    and purely by accident. In one of their numerous inroads into the country
                    adjacent to that in which they gained a permanent footing, a violent dispute
                    arose amongst the Spaniards about the division of some gold. A young cacique or
                    petty prince, who was present, astonished at their contention about a thing
                    which was to him of little value, acquainted them with the existence of a
                    country six suns to the south, where even the utensils in common use were made
                    of the same metal as that about which they seemed ready to shed each other’s
                    blood. The eager cupidity of the Spaniards was roused by this welcome
                    information, and no time was lost in preparing for the invasion of this land of
                    gold. Balboa, accompanied by a hundred and ninety of his countrymen, and about a
                    thousand Indians, commenced his journey across the isthmus, which, although only
                    sixty miles in breadth, was so encumbered with natural obstacles, that five and
                    twenty day§ were spent before he obtained a sight of the Southern Ocean, which
                    he did from a mountain near Panama. The view of this vast expanse repaid the
                    adventurers for their past toils and sufferings. They advanced to the shore with
                    the utmost alacrity; and their leader, rushing up to the middle in the waves,
                    with his sword and buckler, took possession<pb break="no" facs="nls:193494922"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-4922-0295"/> of it in the name of the king his master. The
                    part which he discovered is still designated the Gulf of St Michael, the name
                    which he bestowed upon it. Balboa, however, did not reap the reward which he
                    merited for this important discovery. By an ungrateful government he was
                    superseded in his command; and although afterwards restored to high authority,
                    he fell a victim to the jealousy of the individual with whom he was associated
                    in the government.</p>
                <p>For a short time after the death of Balboa, the thoughts of conquering Peru were
                    laid aside; but a new expedition was at length set on foot, at the head of which
                    appeared the famous, or rather infamous, Francisco Pizarro, a soldier of
                    fortune, and formerly in the service of Balboa. Associated with him were Diego
                    de Almagro, a man of as humble extraction as himself, and likewise a soldier of
                    fortune, and Hernando de Luque, who combined the functions of priest and
                    schoolmaster at Panama. Towards the close of 1524, Pizarro sailed from the port
                    of Panama in a small vessel, with only a hundred and twelve followers, to
                    undertake the subjugation of half the western world. We may smile at the
                    disparity between the extent of the enterprise and the <hi rend="superscript">
                    j</hi> paucity of the means by which it was to be achieved, and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> feel astonished that it should ever have been
                    attempted un- &lt; der such circumstances. But the Spaniards, naturally brave,
                    courted danger, and were enamoured with the excitement of conquest. Exposure to
                    peril had rendered them fearless, and a succession of triumphs had made them
                    arrogant. The season at which Pizarro embarked was the most improper that could
                    have been chosen; for the periodical winds which then began to blow were
                    directly adverse to the course which he wished to steer. But after a series of
                    disasters and disappointments, which he bore with a patience and fortitude
                    worthy of any undertaking, and in defiance of a recall from the governor of
                    Panama, he succeeded, in 152υ, in reaching the coast of Peru. After touching at
                    several villages, he landed at Tumbez, a place of some note, about three degrees
                    south of the line, and remarkable for its stately temple and a palace of the
                    incas. Here the golden dreams of the Spaniards were, if possible, more than
                    realized. But for the present they could only feast their eyes on the vision <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> riches before them; for the force of Pizarro was far too
                    limited to attempt the conquest of the opulent empire thus discovered; and
                    towards the close of the third year from his departure this adventurer regained
                    the port whence he had sailed.</p>
                <p>Pizarro immediately repaired to the court of Spain, for the purpose of turning
                    his discovery to advantage. The powers which he solicited were granted him. He
                    was invested with supreme civil and military authority over the country to be
                    conquered, his jurisdiction being declared to extend prospectively two hundred
                    leagues to the southward of the river St Jago. The means of executing this
                    commission he was left to provide entirely from his own resources, which were
                    slender; but they proved sufficient. He returned to his confederates at Panama,
                    and after exerting his utmost efforts, the whole armament which he was able to
                    fit out amounted only to three small vessels, carrying a hundred and eighty
                    soldiers, of whom thirty-six were mounted. His first descent was on the shores
                    of St Matthew’s Bay, whence he pursued his march southward along the coast,
                    meeting with little or no resistance, and suffering no calamities except such as
                    were inflicted by the insalubrity of the climate and the sterility of the soil.
                    From first to last, the New World was conquered as much by the terror which the
                    aspect and manners of the invaders inspired in the breasts of uncivilized men,
                    as by force of arms; and the general impression made on the timid Peruvians
                    proved irresistible and paralysing. But another cause contributed to the rapid
                    success of Pizarro. At this very time the country was embroiled in a civil war.
                    When the Spaniards first visited the coast of Peru, Huana Capac, the twelfth
                    monarch from the founder of the state, was seated on the throne of the incas. By
                    his victorious arms he had subjugated the kingdom of Quito; a conquest of such
                    extent and importance as almost to double the power of the Peruvian empire. This
                    prince is represented as alike conspicuous for his pacific virtues and for his
                    abilities in war. He was, at all events, a bold innovator; for, in defiance of
                    the fundamental law against polluting the blood of the children of the sun with
                    any foreign alliance, he espoused the daughter of the conquered monarch; and by
                    this princess he had a son named Atahualpa, commonly written Atabalipa, to whom
                    he left the kingdom of Quito at his death, in the year 1529. To Huascar, his
                    eldest son by a mother of the royal line, was bequeathed the rest of his
                    dominions. This arrangement was productive of a civil war, in which the
                    sovereign of Quito proved victorious; and, to place himself more firmly on the
                    throne, he put to death all the descendants of Manco Capac whom he could seize
                    either by force or stratagem. Huascar himself was a prisoner in his hands, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> but from political motives his life was spared. This
                    unhappy " contest completely diverted the attention of the Peruvians from the
                    circumstance of a foreign invader having violated their soil. It was some time,
                    however, before Pizarro gained information of the events which so opportunely
                    conspired to forward his enterprise; indeed the first intelligence he received
                    was the appearance in his camp of messengers from the rival sovereigns, each
                    soliciting the fatal aid of their common enemy.</p>
                <p>Pizarro, as sagacious as he was daring and unprincipled, perceived at once the
                    importance of the intelligence, and the fortunate position in which the affairs
                    of the country were placed for him and his cause. At the head of an
                    ill-accoutred train of a hundred and two foot soldiers, of whom twenty-two were
                    armed with cross-bows, and only three with muskets, and sixty-two mounted
                    followers, he pushed forward from St Michael’s, where, in May 1532, he had
                    established the first Spanish colony in Peru. He directed his course towards
                    Caxamarca, a town of the interior, distant twelve days’ march, where Atabalipa
                    was eneamped with a considerable body of troops. Appearing in the guise of an
                    ambassador, or rather pacificator, his professions were received with
                    inconsiderate credulity; and the inca became the victim of the perfidy of the
                    Spaniard. Relying with unsuspicious simplicity on the honour of the man whom he
                    considered as his guest, Atabalipa consented to give him an audience in that
                    part of the city where he and his followers had established themselves. In the
                    mean time Pizarro had made every preparation for receiving the inca in a manner
                    which he little expected. He arranged his troops in as advantageous a situation
                    as possible, within a square wholly surrounded by a strong rampart or wall of
                    earth; and there he awaited the emperor, who slowly approached with all the pomp
                    of barbaric splendour. The latter was borne on the shoulders of his principal
                    attendants, seated on a throne or couch, resplendent with plates of gold and
                    silver, enriched with precious stones, and adorned with waving plumes of the
                    most gorgeous hues. Behind him came the chief officers of his court, and bands
                    of singers and dancers attended the cavalcade, whilst the Peruvian army, to the
                    number of 30,000 men, swarmed all over the surrounding plain. With matchless
                    perfidy Pizarro instructed a priest to inform Atabalipa, that the vicegerent on
                    earth of the God whom they worshipped had made a donation of all the nations of
                    the New World to the king of Castille, their master, and that he must
                    accordingly surrender Peru. At the same time he was required to renounce the
                    service of the sun, and become a convert to the religion of the Spaniards.
                    Astonished at this extraordinary proposal, he asked the priest for a sight of
                    his credentials; and a breviary being handed to him, he lifted it to his
                    ear.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494935" xml:id="kp-eb0717-4935-0296"/>
                <p>“This,” said he, “is silent; it tells me nothing;” and he dashed it to the ground
                    with disdain. The wily monk, who appears to have been exactly the tool which
                    Pizarro wanted, ran towards his countrymen, calling out that the word of God had
                    been insulted, and that they ought to take immediate vengeance on the impious
                    dogs who were guilty of such a profanation. At once the signal for assault was
                    given, and an indiscriminate massacre of the unresisting Peruvians took place.
                    In vain did the wretched fugitives seek shelter from the avenging steel of the
                    Spaniards. They were pursued even within the sanctuaries of their religion, and
                    cut down around their altars with unrelenting barbarity. Atabalipa himself was
                    taken prisoner, and put into close confinement. A proposal of the inca to ransom
                    himself by paying an. enormous quantity of gold was instantly caught at by
                    Pizarro; and the devoted subjects of the captive king, with eager alacrity,
                    obeyed his call to bring him their treasures in order to procure his liberty.
                    Meanwhile, Almagro arrived with a reinforcement of Spaniards equal to that
                    already in the country. The rapacious bravoes who composed it, being as yet
                    unglutted with the spoil of the richest country in the world, urged Pizarro to
                    put the inca to death, and thus clear the way for a thorough plunder of the
                    whole empire. The chief of this banditti had himself previously determined on
                    taking this step, and probably only waited for the proposal coming from the
                    troops in order to carry it into execution. After performing a ceremony
                    preparatory to execution (it would be an abuse of language to call it a triaD,
                    the Spaniards condemned the inca of Peru to be burned alive, which merciless
                    sentence was, as a great favour, mitigated to strangling, and the unhappy victim
                    suffered accordingly. Amongst a list of imaginary crimes which were laid to his
                    charge, there was one of which he had really been guilty, namely, putting to
                    death his brother Huascar. This cruel and unnecessary deed of blood he was
                    induced to commit from fear lest, in his own helpless situation, his rival to
                    the throne might join the invaders against him. But Spaniards were not competent
                    to try him for such an act; he was only amenable to his own country; and the
                    allegation was as iιτelevant as the other parts of the charge in this solemn
                    mockery of justice.</p>
                <p>The murder of Atabalipa was soon followed by a revolution in the affairs of the
                    Spaniards, whose barbarous inhumanity now rendered them Odious to the Peruvians.
                    Even amongst themselves were found a few persons not altogether divested of pity
                    and a sense of justice; and the dread of impending danger from the Indians now
                    uniting against Pizarro, alone restrained these soldiers within the bounds of
                    discipline. At Cuzco, the partisans of Huascar elevated his brother Manco Capac
                    to the throne of the incas, whilst Pizarro set up Taparpa, the son of Atabalipa,
                    as emperor. But this prince was relieved by death from the degradation of being
                    innocently accessary to the humiliation of his country. No other person having
                    been invested by the Spaniards with the insignia of mock royalty, the title of
                    Manco Capac was universally acknowledged. The attempts of the Indians, however,
                    to arrest the progress of the invaders proved unavailing; but the latter
                    quarrelled amongst themselves about the division of the spoil. Ferdinand
                    Pizarro, the brother of the general, had been sent to the court of Spain to
                    report the progress of spoliation, and to deposit a part of the booty. Honours
                    were conferred upon him, and his brother obtained an additional grant of land,
                    whilst he himself was invested with the jurisdiction of a very large tract of
                    country lying still further to the southward. No sooner did Almagro hear this
                    than he attempted to seize Cuzco, alleging that it lay within the limits of his
                    government; and a civil war between his partisans and the Pizarro faction was
                    only prevented by an accommodation, on the singular footing that Almagro should
                    indemnify himself by attempting the conquest of Chili. This reconciliation left
                    the general at liberty to settle the internal policy of his province. He divided
                    the country into districts, over which magistrates were appointed to preside;
                    and he removed the seat of government from Cuzco to Lima, which he named Ciudad
                    des los Reyes. He likewise despatched some of his most distinguished officers to
                    inspect those provinces of the empire hitherto unvisited by the Spaniards; but
                    this imprudent feeling of security nearly proved fatal to him. The Peruvians,
                    with Manco Capac at their head, seeing the Spaniards weakening themselves by
                    dividing their force, seized the opportunity of making a desperate effort to
                    avenge their wrongs and to rid themselves for ever of their oppressors. This
                    insurrection took place in the year 1535-1536. The Spanish historians, probably
                    to exalt the prowess of their countrymen, assert that an army of more than two
                    hundred thousand men was collected, part of which invested Lima, where the
                    governor was closely shut up, whilst a still larger body of men laid siege to
                    Cuzco. Half of the city had already fallen into the hands of the Peruvians, and
                    the besieged were reduced to the most desperate condition, when Almagro suddenly
                    made his appearance in the neighbourhood. Upon his arrival, his assistance was
                    solicited by both parties; but the inca, despairing of success in his
                    negotiations with Spaniards, attacked Almagro during the night. Spanish valour
                    and dis-^ cipline, however, prevailed over the greatly superior numbers of the
                    Indians, who were repulsed with terrible slaughter, and the governor of Chili
                    advanced unopposed to the gates of Cuzco. Over the capital of the incas his
                    authority was now fully recognised, though not without an affray, in which
                    several Spaniards were killed. But very soon afterwards matters began to assume
                    a serious aspect; in short, it now came to the issue of arms, whether Pizarro or
                    Almagro should remain master of Peru. The latter was at first completely
                    successful against the brothers of the general; but in an engagement with
                    Pizarro himself he was defeated and taken prisoner. The conquerors behaved with
                    a cruelty which struck horror into the minds of the barbarians, who had
                    assembled out of curiosity to see the battle. Almagro, after languishing some
                    months in prison, was at length formally tried and condemned to death; which
                    sentence he underwent by being first strangled in private, and afterwards
                    beheaded in public.</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile intelligence having reached the court of Spain of the dissension
                    which had taken place in Peru, the king appointed a new governor, who, on his
                    arrival, was to assume the supreme command, provided Pizarro had fallen, which
                    proved to be the case. Almagro left a son by an Indian woman, and this youth he
                    appointed his successor, by virtue of a pow er granted him by the emperor. The
                    partial division of the spoil which had been made by Pizarro and his brothers
                    tended to alienate many of the Spaniards from their cause. Great numbers of the
                    disaffected repaired to Lima, where the house of young Almagro was always open
                    to receive them; and here a conspiracy was formed against the life of Pizarro,
                    at the head of which was Juan de Herrada, an officer of distinguished abilities,
                    and who had had the superintendence of Almagro’s education. The natural
                    intrepidity and fearless disposition of the general proved his ruin; for,
                    utterly disregarding the warnings which were given him of approaching evil, he
                    took no measures either to discover the plot or to protect his own person from
                    violence. In this state of fancied security access to his palace was easily
                    gained by the conspirators. On the 26th of June 1540, Herrara, with eighteen of
                    the most determined of his followers, sallied from the house of Almagro, and
                    advancing through the streets, shouted “Long live the king, but let the tyrant
                    die.” He entered the palace of Pizarro without opposition, and gained the
                    apartment where his victim was conversing with some of his friends, having just
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494948" xml:id="kp-eb0717-4948-0297"/>risen from
                    table. His resolute mind no form of danger could appal: he hastily snatched a
                    sword and buckler, with which he maintained the unequal contest, in a manner
                    worthy of his past exploits. But friend after friend was cut down at his side;
                    and, no longer able to turn aside the numerous weapons so furiously aimed at his
                    life, he received a deadly thrust in his throat, sunk to the ground, and
                    expired. Thus perished by the swords of assassins Francisco Pizarro, the
                    conqueror of Peru, a man who in mere valour was probably never surpassed; but
                    whose injustice, rapacity, and cruelty rendered him unworthy of a better
                    fate.</p>
                <p>After the death of Pizarro, young Almagro was placed at the head of the
                    government; but his career was short and troubled. The new viceroy having
                    arrived from Spain, he refused to relinquish his pretensions, and a struggle
                    ensued, which proved fatal to himself and all his followers. Another
                    insurrection, however, broke out under Gonzales Pizarro, who had just returned
                    from a most disastrous expedition into the country to the east of the Andes, and
                    was thus prevented from taking any part in the revolutions which had so rapidly
                    succeeded each other in Peru. To oppose this new aspirant to viceregal power,
                    Nuñez Vela, governor of Lima, assembled a motley army of Indians and Spaniards;
                    and, after various successes on both sides, a decisive battle was fought under
                    the walls of Quito, in which Nuñez perished, along with the greater number of
                    his followers. But another viceroy arrived from Europe in the person of the
                    licentiate Pedro de la Gasea, and against him it was necessary for Gonzales to
                    take the field. But many deserted his standard to rally round that of a person
                    who was invested with a lawful authority to govern them; and those whom the
                    tyranny of the usurper had driven to forests and caverns now quitted their
                    hiding-places and joined the royalists. On the 9th of June 1548, an engagement
                    took place near Cuzco, in which the last of the Pizarros, deserted by his
                    followers, was taken prisoner, and afterwards beheaded. Such is the last event
                    of any importance connected with a history, every line of which is written in
                    blood. During these ferocious contentions, in which the rancour of enmity was
                    rendered more intense by avarice, honour, the proverbial virtue of the Spaniard,
                    was utterly disregarded. There was hardly one of them who did not abandon the
                    party which he had originally espoused, and betray or desert his former
                    associates. This is not to be wondered at when we reflect that most of the
                    followers of Pizarro were needy adventurers, soldiers of fortune, exactly
                    similar to those who had for centuries swarmed in various countries of Europe,
                    and who sold their services to the best paymaster. The same mercenary principle
                    appears to have been acted upon by the Spaniards in Peru; they attached
                    themselves most tenaciously to the leader who held out the richest bribe. Petty
                    insurrections continued to disturb the country for several years; and most of
                    the first invaders, as well as a large proportion of the licentious soldiery
                    whom the fame of their success had drawn thither, perished in their contests one
                    with another. Ultimately the devoted land was thus cleared of those turbulent
                    and desperate spirits which had been let loose upon it, and the royal authority
                    was finally as completely established in Peru as in the other Spanish
                    provinces.</p>
                <p>The whole of the dominions of Spain in the New World were at first divided into
                    two immense governments; one subject to the viceroy of Mexico and the other to
                    the viceroy of Peru. But the latter was, at two subsequent periods, reduced in
                    order to give such extension to other provinces as should entitle them to the
                    rank of viceroyalties. In the year 1718, the province, or, as it was sometimes
                    called, the kingdom, of Quito, was detached from Peru, and added to the
                    government of New Grenada. In the year 1778 the provinces of the Rio de la
                    Plata, Potosi, Charcas, Chiquitos, and some others, were detached from the
                    jurisdiction of the Peruvian viceroy, and erected into a separate government, of
                    which Buenos Ayres was made the capital. To these four governments alone was
                    attached the dignity of a viceroyalty. Guatemala, the provinces of Venezuela,
                    Caraccas, Cumana, and Chili, were severally formed into distinct jurisdictions
                    under a captain-general. Having already given a view of the colonial system of
                    administration under which the Spanish territories in the New World groaned for
                    nearly three centuries (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mexico,</hi> we
                    shall only here advert to two distinct features of the tyranny which was
                    exercised over the aborigines of Peru. These were the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mita</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">repartimiento.</hi> The former was a civil
                    conscription, by which the population of every district was compelled to furnish
                    annually a certain number of labourers for the service of the proprietors of the
                    lands or mines. It is true that under the incas a great body of the natives were
                    held in a state of degrading vassalage, so that a change of masters did not
                    involve a change of condition in as far as mere labour was concerned; but the
                    effects of being condemned to work in the mines for a fixed period proved most
                    fatal to them. By the regulation, every Indian from the age o'f eighteen to
                    fifty was pressed into the mining service for six months once in every three
                    years and a half. On these occasions they were under the necessity of quitting
                    their homes and families, relinquishing their professions, and repairing, it
                    might be, many hundred miles to some inhospitable spot, where, it is said,
                    scarcely one Indian in five survived the first year of his labours. More than
                    twelve thousand Indians were annually subject to the <hi rend="italic">mita</hi>
                    conscription of the single province of Potosi; and it is computed that upwards
                    of eight millions of human beings perished in the mines of Peru alone.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Memoirs of General Miller,
                    vol. i. p. 5. There is probably great exaggeration in this estimate; for,
                    besides the difficulty of accounting for such, a mortality in mines which
                    subsequently have not proved at all so mortal, we learn from Ulloa that a
                    considerable proportion of the workmen served voluntarily. Certain it is,
                    however, that wherever mines were wrought in a compulsory manner, an alarming
                    decrease took place in the Indian population. In a memorial presented to Philip
                    III. in 1609, Captain Juan Gonzales de Azevedo asserts, that in every district
                    of Peru in which Indians were compelled to labour in the mines, their numbers
                    had been reduced to one third, and in some places to one half, of the population
                    in 1581. Amongst other causes of this decrease may be mentioned, the civil wars;
                    the expeditions of the Spaniards, in which vast numbers of the Indians perished;
                    the small-pox, peculiarly fatal to Indians; and the immoderate use of spirituous
                    liquors.</p></note> The Indians were also pressed into the employment of the
                    governors of provinces and others; a species of servitude which was perfect
                    liberty compared with that of the mines.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">repartimientο</hi> was a privilege originally granted to
                    the corregidors or governors of districts, empowering them to furnish to the
                    Indians, at a fair price, articles of necessary consumption. In course of time
                    this privilege degenerated into a compulsory and oppressive exaction. Not only
                    were the most worthless commodities forced upon the Indians, who were compelled
                    to pay for them doubly or even triply, but also articles for which they had no
                    earthly usc; for instance, razors for men who had no beards, spectacles for
                    those who had “the eye of the hawk” even in old age, and silk stockings for
                    Indians who go barefoot. Even luxuries, the very use of which was unknown to
                    them, formed part of the supplies which they were compelled to purchase. The
                    collection of the royal tribute afforded the corregidor another pretence for
                    exactions; whilst the priests to whose spiritual guidance the Indians were
                    assigned plundered them without mercy, of all that escaped the rapacity of the
                    governors. “The atrocities committed by these wolves in sheep’s clothing,” says
                    Miller, “would almost surpass belief <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494961"

                    as the Ulloas, and had we not before us recent facts which confirm their
                    statement.” But the bow, however elastic, may be bent until it recoils. An
                    insurrection broke out in the year 1780, and threatened the most disastrous
                    consequences to the Spaniards; but it ultimately proved fataI to Tapac •Amaru
                    and the other Peruvians engaged in it.</p>
                <p>In the celebrated warof independence, which was fomented in the year 1808, and
                    broke out over all the Spanish pos- -sessions in South America two years
                    afterwards, Peru was the last to join; and it was there that the royalists made
                    their final stand in behalf of the mother country.<note anchored="true"

                    revolt until the year 1821, and probably would have done so for a much longer
                    period, had a foreign force not come to the aid of the patriots. It soon became
                    evident to those who had established the independence of Chili, that the
                    conquest of Peru was necessary to its security; and the project for achieving it
                    attracted to their cause many military adventurers from Europe, now restored to
                    profound peace by the fall of Napoleon. Amongst others, Lord Cochrane, and
                    several English officers who had distinguished themselves in the naval service,
                    found employment in the fleet, which was speedily equipped, and which, in
                    discipline, though not in force, soon attained so decided a superiority over the
                    navy of Spain as to give it the command of the navigation of the South Sea.
                    Being to windward of the Spanish ports, it was easy at any time to choose the
                    point of attack. Under San Martin was formed an army of 5600, which, with the
                    fleet, consisting of one ship of sixty-four guns, one of fifty, one of
                    thirty-six, and one of thirty-two, besides some corvettes and transports, sailed
                    from Valparaiso, in the latter end of 1820, and reached Lima in February the
                    following year. The troops were landed to the northward of Callao, and
                    continued, without making any great exertion, till May, when the garrison of
                    Lima being much straitened, an armistice was concluded.</p>
                <p>Pezuela, then the viceroy of Lima, was opposed by the audienda and the
                    municipality, who censured him for not adopting measures sufficiently energetic
                    to repel the invaders. The same disposition prevailed amongst the officers of
                    the army, who at length resolved to depose Pezuela∙ He made no resistance; but
                    having quitted the government and country, the command was placed in the hands
                    of Don José de la Serna on the 29th of January 1821. The troops of La Serna were
                    not much superior in number to the invaders; but some of them having gone over
                    to San Martin, turned the scale in favour of the latter. Lima continued to be
                    straitened by the general, and Callao to be blockaded by Lord Cochrane, who
                    performed one of those acts of desperate valour which struck astonishment into
                    the Spaniards. With the boats of his little squadron he entered the port of
                    Callao, and, under the guns of its tremendous batteries, boarded, captured, and
                    carried off one of their largest ships of war, with more men on board than were
                    in all the boats that attacked her.</p>
                <p>After some months had elapsed, a convention was agreed on, when La Serna with his
                    army marched out of Lima, and San Martin with his forces entered it several days
                    afterwards. A garrison was, however, left by the royalists in Callao. The
                    protracted operations had given time to remove the most valuable property,
                    which, with the females of the best families, and the non-combatants, reached
                    the mountainous districts. San Martin, in the possession of Lima, was in the
                    same condition as La Serna had been for some months before, with many mouths
                    besides those, of his army to fill, and his intercourse with the country that
                    furnished provisions intercepted; but he had the advantage of naval superiority,
                    and could draw supplies from the coast, though, till Callao was taken, the
                    difficulty of landing rendered the arrival of such supplies very precarious.</p>
                <p>As a measure of the last importance, San Martin sought to implant the feeling of
                    independence, by some act which should bind the inhabitants of the capital to
                    that cause. On the 28th of July 1821, therefore, the ceremony of declaring and
                    swearing to maintain the independence of Peru took place. The troops were drawn
                    up in the great square, in the centre of which was erected a lofty stage, where
                    the independent flag of Peru was for the first time unfurled; General San
                    Martin, who displayed it, exclaiming, “From this moment Peru is free and
                    independent, by the general wish of the people, and by the justice of her cause,
                    which God defend.” Oaths of fidelity to the new government were afterwards
                    taken, and, on the 3d of August, San Martin declared himself protector of Peru,
                    and assumed the supreme civil and military command. He at the same time
                    stipulated, that as soon as the country should be free from a foreign enemy, he
                    would resign the command to the individual whom the people should be pleased to
                    place at the head of the government. The offices of government were filled up by
                    him, and General de las Hcras was appointed commander-in-chief of the army.
                    Amongst the first legislative acts of the protectorate was a decree declaring
                    that the children of slaves born in Peru subsequently to the 28th of July
                    preceding should be free. This was followed by another abolishing the tribute,
                    and forbidding the name of Indians to be applied to the aborigines, who were
                    thenceforth to be denominated Peruvians, like the Creoles. Others of less
                    importance were added to the list of benefits conferred by the new government;
                    but in the mean time a disgraceful scene was exhibiting at Callao, where Lord
                    Cochrane, having come to an open quarrel with the protector, was endeavouring to
                    gain possession of the fortress by negotiation, intending, should he be
                    successful, to hoist the Chileno flag, in opposition to the views and policy of
                    San Martin. The true cause of the misunderstanding it is not very easy to
                    ascertain, nor is it of much importance. On the 2lst of September the fortress
                    of Callao surrendered to the protector; and on the 26th of the same month, he,
                    in the capacity of commander-in-chief of the liberating army, ordered Lord
                    Cochrane to quit the coast of Peru. General Canterac, who had meditated an
                    attack on the patriots, for the purpose of relieving the castle of Callao,
                    retreated to the Cordillera; so that, with no one near to create any alarm, San
                    Martin was at liberty to take steps for the consolidation of his government and
                    the termination of hostilities.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, however, recent events would appear to have thrown the inhabitants
                    into a fever of excitement, productive of cabals which cast fatal embarrassments
                    in the way of any energetic measures being taken. The protector, in
                    endeavouring, with the very best intentions, to promote those who had declared
                    for the patriot cause, gave great umbrage to certain persons by his
                    appointments, and they unfortunately led to a disastrous prolongation of the
                    contest. General Tristan, who had received the command of a body of troops at
                    lea, allowed himself to be surprised and his retreat cut off by Cantcrac, who
                    took one thousand prisoners, besides some pieces of artillery, and other spoil.
                    This reverse threw a damp over the minds of the people, who had previously lent
                    their cheerful aid to the cause; but any seriously bad effects were prevented by
                    the victory which the patriots gained over the royalists at Pinchincha on the
                    24th of May 1822. Passing over a short visit which the protector of Peru paid to
                    the liberator of Colombia at Guayaquil, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494974"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-4974-0299"/>and the result of which was not So satisfactory as
                    had been anticipated, we find the protector resuming the supreme command on the
                    21st of August. Secure of the support of the army, he would have experienced
                    little opposition in quelling the spirit of insubordination manifested both by
                    the civil authorities and the people, had he resorted to compulsory measures;
                    but this would have been in opposition to his usual policy, and might have
                    justified the clamours of his enemies. One alternative alone seemed left to him.
                    Agreeably to a decree issued by the council of state, deputies had already been
                    summoned; and on the 20th of September the congress was installed in due form.
                    The protector repaired in state to the hall of the deputies, where, divesting
                    himself of the insignia of supreme power, he resigned his authority into the
                    hands of the representatives of the people. He then withdrew, and immediately
                    set out for his country-seat near Callao, leaving behind him a proclamation as
                    his farewell address. This document embodied his reasons for retiring, and
                    contained some wholesome advice to the new republic. Congress lost no time in
                    appointing a new executive, under the title of the Junta Gubernativa; and Xavier
                    de Luna Pizarro was chosen president of the congress. One of the first acts of
                    that assembly was to decree that San Martin should bear the title of Founder of
                    the Liberty of Peru, and enjoy a considerable pension; whilst the thanks of the
                    Peruvian nation were likewise awarded to Lord Cochrane for his achievements in
                    the cause of Peruvian independence.</p>
                <p>The proceedings of the new government were marked by feebleness and discord. An
                    unsuccessful effort to reduce the royalists increased popular clamour against
                    the government junta, which was at last expelled from power, and Colonel Don
                    José de la Riva Aguero was made president of the republic. Santa Cruz, a
                    Peruvian, who in the sequel greatly distinguished himself, assumed the chief
                    command of the army; and it was determined in a council of war to make another
                    effort in the Puertos Intermedios. Whilst they were employed in this enterprise,
                    General Sucre arrived at Lima with 3000 Colombian troops; but this force, with
                    2000 Peruvians, partly militia and partly the wreck of a former army, was found
                    insufficient for the protection of the capital, against which Canterac advanced
                    at the head of 9000 well-disciplined men. Lima was accordingly abandoned by the
                    patriots, and immediately taken possession of by the royalists, who, however,
                    soon afterwards evacuated it, after having exacted heavy contributions from the
                    remaining inhabitants, and destroyed the mint. Both Generals Santa Cruz and
                    Sucre, who with a united army might have accomplished something of moment,
                    proved unsuccessful; and the former allowed himself to be out-generalled by
                    Canterac. The cause of independence in Pern seemed hanging by a thread, which it
                    required little exertion to break, when the celebrated Bolivar made his
                    appearance in Lima on the 1st of September 1823. He was received with the
                    greatest enthusiasm, and was immediately invested with supreme authority,
                    military and political. Great activity was now infused into the measures of
                    government; and, acting in the capacity of dictator, Bolivar dissolved congress,
                    and levied an army, with which he sallied from the capital on the second week of
                    November. Riva Aguero, who refused to join him, was imprisoned by his own
                    troops, who immediately submitted to the dictator. But a fresh misfortune
                    awaited the patriots in the mutiny of the soldiers at Callao. The consequence
                    was, that this town, along with the city of Lima, once more fell into the hands
                    of the royalists. The cause of independence in Peru now seemed desperate; but
                    the conduct of Bolivar at this critical moment is deserving of the highest
                    praise. By his firmness, activity, and seasonable severities, he checked farther
                    defections, and obtained the respect and entire confidence of every true
                    patriot. Nor did he disappoint public confidence.; for in less than a year from
                    that time Sôuth American independence was finally established.</p>
                <p>In the month of July 1824 the liberating army commenced its march towards Pasco
                    in three divisions, two of which were Colombians, headed by Generals Lara and
                    Cordova; and one was Peruvian, under Lamar. General Sucre was chief of the staff
                    of the whole army. In his preparatory measures for facilitating the passage of
                    the troops to Pasco, a distance of two hundred leagues, through the most
                    mountainous region in the world, this officer displayed great skill; and the
                    army, 9000 strong, reached its destination in safety, and unmolested by the
                    royalists. Various manoeuvres now took place; and in an action of cavalry the
                    patriots inflicted a severe blow on their adversaries. A series of marches and
                    countermarches occupied the months of August, September, October, and November;
                    and on the 6th of December the patriots reached the village of Quinua; whilst
                    the royalists, by entering Guamangilla, cut off their retreat, and placed them
                    in an extremely critical situation. On the 8th the viceroy, La Serna, moved from
                    this position, and occupied with his whole force the heights of Condorkanki,
                    within gun-shot of the encampment of the patriots. Between the opposing armies
                    lay the plain of Ayacucho; and as a battle cm the following day had become
                    inevitable, on this plain were to be decided the destinies of South America. It
                    is in shape nearly square, about a league in circumference, and flanked right
                    and left by deep and rugged ravines. The eastern boundary is formed by the
                    abrupt and savage ridge of Condorkanki, whilst its western extremity is the
                    Indian village Quinua, a little distance in front of which lay the patriot army,
                    not 6000 strong, that of the royalists being fully one third more numerous. Next
                    morning, the 9th of December 1824, the expected conflict took place, and
                    continued for about an hour, when the royalists were defeated with great loss.
                    Indeed their army may be said to have been almost annihilated; for 3200 rank and
                    file, amongst whom was the viceroy, were made prisoners of war, the remainder
                    dispersing in a state of total disorganization in all directions. The battle of
                    Ayacneho is pronounced by Mr Miller “the most brilliant ever fought in South
                    America ;” and it may be considered as the last regular engagement, although not
                    the last struggle, in which Spain was engaged for the recovery of her revolted
                    colonies. Rodil still held out at Callao for the mother country, with the most
                    desperate tenacity. It was a gallant, but at the same time an unnecessary and
                    hopeless defence, when nearly the whole of the vast continent had declared for
                    the cause of independence. Many families of the highest rank, who had shut
                    themselves up with this determined individual, were exterminated by disease or
                    famine. For thirteen months he sustained, unaided, bombardments both by sea and
                    land, rendered still more terrible by the accumulated miseries of pestilènce and
                    nearly utter want of food. He capitulated upon honourable terms on the 19th of
                    January 1826, and thus the last link of the chain which had bound seventeen
                    millions of Americans to the tottering monarchy of Spain was finally broken.</p>
                <p>But although thus happily relieved of the presence of a foreign enemy, these
                    infant republics could not agree amongst themselves; and, from the period of
                    their establishment down to the present time ( 1838), their history is
                    disfigured by a series of altercations, intrigues, plots, and counterplots,
                    which have materially retarded their proper consolidation, and the advancement
                    of the arts of peace. Bolivar was exceedingly desirous that the constitution
                    which he had framed for Upper Pern, now named after him Bolivia, should be
                    adopted by Peru proper; but public opinion was strongly opposed to his wishes.
                    The Peruvians, also, apparently the most fickle of the fickle, began to feel
                    their Colombian allies a burden to them. In short, whilst the national manners
                    and habits of the Colombian troops were the opposite <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193494987" xml:id="kp-eb0717-4987-0300"/>of congenial to them, the
                    dislike with which the latter were regarded, from this dissimilarity of tastes,
                    increased the hatred of the Peruvians for the Bolivian code. This spirit soon
                    led to the formation of a strong party, which in its turn gave birth to a
                    conspiracy, having, it was said, for its object the assassination of Bolivar
                    himself, and the expulsion of the Colombians. It was fortunately discovered and
                    crushed before any evil was effected; but it served to throw the affairs of Peru
                    into greater disorder than ever, and this was increased by the announcement of
                    Bolivar’s determination to quit the country. The public mind became fearfully
                    excited by this intelligence, and every argument and remonstrance was employed
                    to induce him to remain amongst them, lest his departure should reduce their
                    government to a state of perfect anarchy. On the 17th of August the electoral
                    college of the province, and that of the city of Lima, resolved that the
                    Bolivian constitution should be adopted in Peru, and that Bolivar should be
                    named Présidente Vitalicio. Their example was followed by the other provincial
                    colleges, with the exception of that of Tarapaca. Matters of importance,
                    however, soon peremptorily required the presence of the liberator in Colombia,
                    and Santa Cruz was left at the head of the government.</p>
                <p>No sooner was Bolivar gone, than the popular spirit of resistance to the Bolivian
                    code manifested itself, and the Peruvians began to devise measures for getting
                    rid of that system and of the Colombians together. This dissatisfac- ' tion
                    naturally terminated in a revolt, at the head of which was Colonel Bustamente, a
                    young Colombian. The chief officers of the Colombian army were arrested and sent
                    home, and not long afterwards they were followed by their troops. The people now
                    unanimously denied the right of electoral colleges to decide upon the adoption
                    of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> form of government; and when the new congress
                    assembled at Lima on the 4th of June 1827, the Bolivian constitution was
                    disdainfully thrown aside, the Peruvian constitution of 1823 being declared to
                    be in force. General Lamar was chosen president of the republic, a nomination
                    which at first gave universal satisfaction; but he soon increased the number of
                    the troops to such an extent as to embarrass the revenues, which, it may well be
                    believed, were sufficiently limited. The reason of this augmentation of the army
                    soon became apparent in a furious and ill-judged proclamation of war against
                    Colombia. The menaces of this state might furnish a plausible plea for taking a
                    step which might be pronounced as rash, considering the wavering condition of
                    all these infant republics; but Peru appears to have been the original
                    aggressor. There were various motives for this declaration of war on the part of
                    Peru, one of which was the desire of taking possession of Guayaquil, and of
                    rendering it a Peruvian port; and on the part of Colombia the principal motive
                    was the non-payment of the debt due by Peru, and amounting to about 3,595,000
                    dollars. But the foundations of the dispute were deeply laid in personal
                    animosities and national jealousy. War being therefore determined on, Lamar
                    entered the Colombian territory at the head of a considerable army; and at
                    Tarqui, near Jiron, in Quito, a sanguinary conflict took place on the 27th of
                    February 1829. The battle was obstinately contested, but terminated at last in
                    favour of the Colombians. On the following day, preliminaries of peace were
                    agreed to, the mild terms of which were highly creditable to the moderation and
                    equity of the conquerors. The chief stipulations were, that neither republic
                    should interfere in the affairs of the other, and that Peru should discliarge
                    the debt which it owed to the Colombian army. The imbecility which Lamar
                    manifested on this occasion gave rise to a conspiracy against him, and he was
                    formally deposed on the 29th of June by General La Fuente, who became
                    vice-president. A plot was, however, formed against La Fuente, and he was
                    expelled from the vice-presidency. General Gamarra was subsequently appointed
                    president, but soon afterwards relinquished the office in favour of Orbegoso.
                    During the early part of the year 1834 the ex-president Gamarra, along with
                    Generals Bermudez, Frias, and Vargas, took arms against the president, and
                    seized Junin, Cuzco, Puno, Ayacucho, and several other districts, avowing their
                    intention of erecting the southern provinces into a separate state, of which
                    Cuzco was to be the capital. At first the revolt was crowned with some success;
                    but in the month of April, Bermudez’s army, consisting of about 1200 men,
                    suddenly deserted him, and went over to the president; and shortly afterwards
                    Gamarra was totally defeated by General Miller. On the 24th of February 1835,
                    General Salavery, who commanded the garrison at Callao, instigated the troops to
                    declare against the government at Lima, and on the following day took possession
                    of the city, declaring himself supreme chief of the republic. The president
                    Orbegoso, with about 200 troops, retired to Pasco. Salavery having swelled his
                    force by the troops which had in the previous year revolted under Gamarra,
                    extended his authority over nearly the whole of Peru. Orbegoso, unable of
                    himself to recover his lost power, retired within the limits of Bolivia, and
                    applied for assistance to Santa Cruz, the president of that republic. Santa Cruz
                    joined them at Arequipa with a Bolivian army, and the united forces entered
                    Peru, advancing as far as Cuzco. Here the army of Salavery was stationed under
                    the command of Gamarra, for the usurper himself found it necessary to remain at
                    Lima, to maintain his authority against the odium excited by his arbitrary
                    exactions. The two armies delivered battle at Yaua-cocha on the 13th of August,
                    when Gamarra was totally defeated, the greater part of his troops having gone
                    over in a body to the enemy. Salavery lost no time in making preparations to
                    defend himself to the last extremity within the walls of the capital. He called
                    out a levy <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse</hi> of the
                    province, including all freemen of colour between the ages of fifteen and
                    forty-five, without exception, and declared, that if his orders were not obeyed,
                    and a stout defence cordially prepared for, he would set fire to Lima as soon as
                    Orbegoso and Santa Cruz should appear before it. He changed his intention,
                    however; and having collected a body of about 2500 men, took the field, and
                    posted himself on the heights of Challapampo, to the north of Arequipa. Towards
                    the end of January 1836, the united forces of Orbegoso and Santa Cruz, amounting
                    to double the number of those of Salavery, advanced to attack him. But he had
                    fortified himself in such a manner that it became necessary to construct works,
                    which, however, were soon completed. In order to cut off his retreat, and also
                    intercept his communication with some vessels which had been prepared to be sent
                    against Bolivia, General Miller was despatched with a sufficient force, and on
                    entering Isla he made prisoners a general and some other officers destined for
                    the Bolivian expedition. In the mean time, Santa Cruz, finding it impossible to
                    attack Salavery in his fortified position, adopted a stratagem which proved
                    completely successful. Having ordered his army to make such a retrograde
                    movement as made it appear that he was in full retreat, the rebel army,
                    believing this to be the case, began to débouché from the pass of Tingo on the
                    morning of the 7th of February. Santa Cruz, seizing the favourable moment for
                    attacking the enemy, fell upon them with great promptitude and vigour. The
                    combat was obstinate, but the issue was not at any period doubtful. Salavery was
                    completely defeated; and so well concerted had been the plans of Santa Cruz,
                    that very few escaped, excepting such as dispersed themselves singly over the
                    country. Amongst the prisoners were 220 officers, including Salavery himself,
                    who, along with seven other officers, two of whom were generals, were tried by a
                    court-martial, condemned to death, and shot on the 18th of February 1836. The
                    port of Callao, Lima, the squadron destined for <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193495000" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5000-0301"/>Bolivia, and all the
                    provinces of Peru, immediately submitted to the restored government.</p>
                <p>It now appeared doubtful, [however, whether the president of Bolivia had been
                    altogether the disinterested ally which he had at first appeared, and whether
                    Orbegoso had not purchased his assistance by secret engagements. At all events,
                    it was now discovered that Peru was of too great extent to be governed as one
                    state. An assembly of deputies from the southern departments was held at Sicuani
                    on the 17th of March, under the protection and guarantee of Bolivia, when the
                    independence of these departments was solemnly declared, and a new state formed,
                    called South Peru, composed of the departments of Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cuzco, and
                    Puno. The chief power was intrusted to General Santa Cruz, as supreme protector
                    of South Peru. In the month of July of the same year, a similar assembly of
                    deputies from the northern departments of Junin, Lima, Libertad, and Amazonas,
                    convoked by Orbegoso, followed the example of the southern provinces, and formed
                    themselves into an independent state, under the name of North Peru, Orbegoso
                    being appointed president.</p>
                <p>During the year 1837, these republics continued in an unsettled state, and the
                    old differences with Chili led to a declaration of war on the 17th of May, the
                    united provinces of Rio de la Plata having joined Chili against the
                    Peruvio-Bolivian confederation. Fortunately,however, after menacing each other
                    for a few months, a treaty of peace was concluded between Chili and Peru, on the
                    17th of November 1837;</p>
                <p>The constitution established by a congress of the three confederated states of
                    North and South Peru, and Bolivia, is modelled upon that of the United States of
                    North America. The government consists of three powers, namely, the legislative,
                    the executive, and the judiciary. Each of the three republics has its own
                    distinct congress; and, collectively, they may be said to form a federal
                    republic, united to one another for mutual support and protection. Every second
                    year a general congress is assembled, and is composed of a senate and chamber of
                    representatives. The members of the senate are elected for life, thirty
                    candidates being sent from the different departments of the confederation, from
                    which number the president chooses fifteen. To become eligible for a senator or
                    representative, the candidate must possess landed property, or an income arising
                    from some branch of industry, of 2000 dollars for a senator, and of 1000 dollars
                    for a representative. The head of the confederation is chosen by the general
                    congress, out of six candidates proposed by the three republics. This head of
                    the government is elected for ten years. He may be accused and condemned by the
                    general congress for the crime of high treason, or if he attempt to hold the
                    reins of government beyond the lawful period fixed by the constitution. The
                    ministers of state, consuls, diplomatic agents, magistrates, and so forth, are
                    responsible to the general congress, but can only be accused by the chamber of
                    representatives. The congress by which the form of government was agreed to,
                    appointed General Don Andre Santa Cruz protector of the Peruvio-Bolivian
                    confederation for the first period of ten years. Santa Cruz is thus virtually at
                    the head of three independent states. Although, nominally, Orbegoso has been
                    president of North Peru since the 30th of December 1833, he cannot be viewed in
                    any other light than in that of a vice-president, who governs the internal
                    affairs of one of the states of a federal union, the supreme head of which is
                    the fortunate soldier above named. With regard to the constitution of the
                    individual states, little else has yet been agreed to, excepting that the
                    government of the countries shall be intrusted to a senate and house of
                    representatives.</p>
                <p>By the division of Peru which took place, the departments of Lima, Libertad or
                    Truxillo, Junin, and the Pampas, form one republic, under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">North Peru;</hi> and the departments of Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cuzco,
                    and Puno, another republic, under the name of <hi rend="italic">South Peru.</hi>
                    But as the limits of each are yet imperfectly defined, and as they are still to
                    a certain extent united, we shall now proceed to give a general description of
                    them as forming one country.</p>
                <p>The territory of Peru is separated from the republic of the Equator on the north
                    by the river Tumbez, in latitude 3. 34. south, but for about three geographical
                    degrees this part of Peru is a comparatively narrow peninsula, projecting from
                    the main body of the country. In about latitude 6. 30. south, an imaginary and
                    very irregular line separates it on the north, first from the republic already
                    mentioned, and afterwards from Brazil. On the east and south-east it is
                    separated from the latter country partly by the river ItCnez, pai'tly by the
                    river Madera, the great tributary of the Amazons, and partly by a line drawn
                    through barbarous regions, which may be said to belong to either country or to
                    neither. Throughout its whole extent on the west and south-west it is washed by
                    the Pacific Ocean; and on the south it is bounded by Bolivia, the limits of
                    which are not yet settled; but the most southerly land of Peru does not extend
                    beyond the twenty-second parallel of south latitude. From this point, as far
                    towards the equator as fifteen degrees south nearly, the country is only a long
                    and narrow strip of land, forming the province of Arequipa, but beyond this
                    meridian it enlarges prodigiously. In longitude it extends from about 62. to 82.
                    west from Greenwich.</p>
                <p>The entire length of Peru from north to south, including the long and narrow
                    peninsula of Arequipa, is estimated at fifteen hundred miles; but its
                    coast-line, which is winding, and has an oblique general bearing from north-west
                    to southeast, cannot be less than 2100 miles. The breadth of Peru is also very
                    great towards its northern boundary, but 700 miles may be taken as its average
                    extension from west to east. According to the careful estimate made by Humboldt,
                    Peru comprises an area of 41,500 square leagues.</p>
                <p>The surface of this immense territory is of the boldest and most varied
                    description. By far the most striking physical feature of all the countries of
                    South America bordering on the Pacific is the colossal mountain-ridge of the
                    Andes, which traverses them from south-east to north-west, in a line nearly
                    parallel with the coast, the bendings and windings of which it follows with
                    remarkable fidelity. Humboldt, who has carefully traced the course of these
                    mountains, describes them as separating in the vicinity of the celebrated city
                    of Potosi, in 19. 35. of south latitude, into two parallel chains. These,
                    however, reunite at the northern extremity of the great basin of Lake Titicaca,
                    between latitude 14. and 15., and so form again an undivided ridge, which runs
                    parallel with the coast line to the northern extremity of Peru, and beyond it.
                    There are, however, other chains, apparently branches of the grand ridge, which
                    have a general bearing from south to north, and in some parts enclose elevated
                    tracts of table-land. In the western or Pacific ridge', immense summits are seen
                    from the cities on the coast, towering in lofty succession above the region of
                    perpetual snow; but the mightiest part of the range is situated in Bolivia.
                    Between the Andes and the Pacific Ocean extends the plain or western part of
                    Peru, and few countries of the globepresent a more singular physical character.
                    It is a belt Or zone of sand nearly two thousand miles in length, and the
                    average breadth of which is not more than thirty miles. In some parts it is as
                    little as seven, and in others it exceeds fifty miles in width; and in this
                    enormous stretch of country, the general character of which is aridity, there
                    are intervals of many leagues between the different towns and cities, in which
                    neither inhabitants nor any traces of vegetation are visible. No rain falls
                    throughout the whole of this desolate Sahara of the west, and thunder and
                    lightning are unknown. In explanation of these singular circumstances, it has
                    been conjectured, that the chain of the Andes, which <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193495013" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5013-0302"/>runs along its eastern
                    boundary like an immense rampart, to repel the encroachments of the deep,
                    intercepts the clouds which come laden with moisture from the Atlantic, and that
                    the constant winds from the south drive the vapours that collect in the
                    antarctic circle beyond the limits of Peru before they discharge their humidity.
                    But, as a compensation for the want of rain, there is uniformly a very heavy
                    fall of dew during the night; and the country is also intersected by rivers,
                    streams, and torrents, by which, at intervals, strips of the long and dreary
                    waste are redeemed from natural sterility. The insulated valleys thus formed
                    constitute the whole habitable parts of Western or Lower Peru, as it is
                    sometimes called; but they are situated from twenty to ninety miles apart. The
                    banks of the water-courses are the parts which, by being laboriously irrigated,
                    are rendered fruitful, and peopled in proportion to the supply of water. During
                    the season when the snows of the Andes melt, the rivers swell to a prodigious
                    extent, and can only be crossed by means of a balsa, which is a raft or
                    frame-work fastened upon four bulls’ hides sewed up, made air-tight, and filled
                    with wind. A few of the large rivers reach the sea, but the smaller ones are
                    exhausted in irrigating the cultivated patches, or are absorbed by the
                    encompassing desert. “No stranger can travel from valley to valley,” says
                    Miller, “as the inhabited strips are inappropriately called, without a guide;
                    for the only indication that the desert has been trodden before, is an
                    occasional cluster of bones, the remains of beasts of burden that have perished.
                    The sand is frequently raised into immense clouds by the wind, to the great
                    annoyance of the traveller, who generally rides with his face muffled up.” The
                    habitable parts of Western Peru, therefore, are merely a series of oases in a
                    great desert of sand, similar to those of Africa. It presents great inequalities
                    of surface, and some of the sand-hills attain the elevation of mountains. But
                    size is a relative term; and in the presence of the stupendous back-ground of
                    the Andes, which lessens all neighbouring objects, they shrink into mere hills
                    of diminutive size. The constant evaporation which is continually going on, as
                    is evinced by the great nocturnal fall of dew, produces a haziness in the
                    atmosphere, and the sun seldom appears with that brilliancy which it displays in
                    the higher levels. Indeed, for six months of the year, a fog, which is
                    considered as very beneficial, hangs over the country; and although, at the
                    most, it attaches itself as a fine mist to woollen clothing, the Limanese call
                    it aquaceros, a torrent. The heat is seldom so intense as to prevent the
                    labourers from working in the open air, and the thermometer rarely rises to
                    above seventy-five degrees. The medium height throughout the year, in which
                    there is little variation, is about sixty-four degrees. In this district are
                    produced most of the tropical plants. The plantain, banana, pine-apple,
                    sugar-cane, vine, cocoa, olive, coffee, and cotton, as well as the most
                    delicious fruits, some peculiar to the country, arrive at great perfection.</p>
                <p>As we advance from the coast towards the Andes, vegetation becomes more
                    luxuriant, for as the growth of plants depends upon the supply of water, that
                    supply is greatest the nearer we approach to the sources of the streams. The
                    range of the Andes nearest to the Pacific Ocean commences generally with hills
                    of moderate elevation, but in some parts with bold, projecting, and abrupt
                    precipices. The sides of these hills are covered with forests, rendered almost
                    impenetrable by the numerous parasitical plants which twine around the lofty
                    trees, and, whilst by their verdure they give beauty to the scenery, prevent the
                    access of visitants until a path be cut out by severe labour. These forests,
                    hundreds of leagues in extent, afford acacias, mangle trees, arborescent brooms,
                    and ferns; aloes and other succulent plants; cedars, cotton or Cuba trees of
                    gigantic magnitude, many kinds of ebony, and other useful woods, many species of
                    palms, and the maria, a tree of enormous size, used in ship-building. The
                    valleys between the hills afford most of the trees which are natives of the
                    tropics; but few of them are well fitted for the purposes of building.</p>
                <p>The district called Higher Peru, commencing at the termination of the sands on
                    the shore, continues increasing gradually in height towards the east, until the
                    ridge of the Andes or the Cordilleras is attained. The line of perpetual snow is
                    about 14,000 feet above the level of the sea, and from that line upwards
                    vegetation necessarily ceases; below it, the plants, by regular gradations,
                    display the nature of the climate, and its adaptation to the various families of
                    vegetables; and, in different parts, exhibit every species of production which
                    can be found, from the dwarf plants of Lapland, to the odoriferous spices of
                    Sumatra.</p>
                <p>This portion of Peru contains the sources of those vast rivers which traverse the
                    whole continent of South America, and are the greatest on the face of the earth.
                    Here the Maranon commences its unrivalled course; and here rise its magnificent
                    tributaries, the Ucayalc, Huallaga, and others, which themselves are swelled by
                    an innumerable multitude of streams, descending from the eastern ridges of the
                    Andes, all being finally absorbed by the monarch of the waters. This mountainous
                    region of Peru possesses large tracts of soil of great fertility, and a climate
                    admirably adapted for raising food for man. The air is much purer and more
                    salubrious here than on the coast, where its heat and humidity generate fevers.
                    There is a great variety of climate in the Andes, as may easily be inferred from
                    the character of the country, rising as it does from nearly the level of the sea
                    to a height far above the line of perpetual refrigeration, and thus presenting
                    on one and the same parallel of latitude the different climates of all the
                    regions of the globe. The valleys and plateaus embosomed in these mountains, in
                    spite of their vicinity to the region of eternal snow, enjoy a moderate climate,
                    and are very fertile. These are eagerly sought as an abode, especially by the
                    Indians; and by the productions here cultivated the inhabitants of the coast are
                    almost entirely supported. The number of articles of culture might be still
                    further increased, for many useful plants hitherto unknown might be naturalized,
                    if care were taken to ascertain the locality, and the relative proportions of
                    atmospheric heat which they require, previously to their being transplanted. In
                    this mountainous district are situated the famous gold and silver mines of Peru,
                    the source of its unrivalled wealth, and the cause of all the misery which it
                    endured for three centuries of slavery and degradation. They are seated deep in
                    the recesses of the Andes, and at great elevations, so that the climate is very
                    cold, and alike unfavourable to vegetation and to the health of man. The
                    celebrated mines of Pasco and Huancavelica are between 13,000 and 14,000 feet
                    above the level of the sea.</p>
                <p>But by far the largest, most beautiful, and most valuable part of the Peruvian
                    territory lies to the east of the Andes, commencing on the eastern declivity of
                    the second chain, and stretching to the confines of Brazil. In this vast region
                    a thousand sources of wealth still lie buried, for the greater part of it may be
                    said to be yet unknown, and the riches which it contains are immense. “Here are
                    plains traversed by lower hills,” says Dr Poeppig, “covered with an ocean of
                    foliage, vying in beauty with the climate of Chili, and far surpassing it in the
                    abundance and luxuriance of its productions. To these join, within the extensive
                    frontiers, those boundless plains, where gigantic rivers, which roll their broad
                    waves through solitary forests, are the only means of communication between the
                    widely-scattered dwellings of a very scanty population.”<note anchored="true"

                    vegetation; and the world does not present ns with any higher standard of
                    comparison. The vast plains in which the declivities of the Andes terminate are
                    called sometimes Pampas del Sa-, cramento, or more usually Collona, or the Land
                    of the Missions. This name they owe to the Jesuits, whose zeal for the
                    conversion of the natives induced them to penetrate these trackless solitudes,
                    and to gladden them’ with the tidings of great joy. They planted a number of
                    settlements throughout this vast unviolated wilderness, and, by collecting in
                    villages the rude inhabitants, attempted to civilize them, not only by
                    instilling into their minds the doctrines of religion, but by teaching them such
                    arts as their limited natural talents enabled them to acquire. Many of these
                    missions still exist, and, by the good which they have done and are still doing,
                    they in some degree atone for the injuries inflicted on Peru by its subjugators.
                    The Indian tribes who inhabit the Pampas are too numerous to be specified
                    individually. They are small and scattered, with as many various languages as
                    there are tribes or divisions, and differing much from each other in the degree
                    of civilization to which they have attained. Some of them are docile and
                    cheerful; others are savage and warlike, and continually in a state of hostility
                    with one another. The banks of the Huallaga, the Ucayalc, and other great
                    rivers, are the parts most thickly peopled by the Indian tribes. The Pampas are
                    represented as being covered with trees and verdure, and yielding balsams, oils,
                    gums, resins, and many valuable drugs, spices, and other rare productions. The
                    trees are lofty, and form impenetrable forests, in which wander all the animals
                    peculiar to the torrid climate of America.</p>
                <p>The following excellent account of a very interesting portion of this vast
                    territory is by a recent explorer of these regions. “The Pampa del Sacramento
                    was so called from its having been discovered by some of the newly converted
                    Indians in 1726, on the day of the festival of Corpo de Dios. It comprises the
                    greatest part of the land lying between the Huallaga, the Ucayale, the Maranon,
                    and the Pachitea (an upper tributary of the Ucayale, which rises near Pasco);
                    and it is remarked with apparent justice in the Viagero Universal, that the two
                    continents of America do not contain another country so favourably situated or
                    so fertile. It is about three hundred miles long from north to south, and from
                    forty to about a hundred in breadth. Two of its boundary rivers, the Maranon and
                    Ucayale, are at all times navigable for vessels of large burden, and the other
                    two for boats and small craft. There arc a great many streams which rise in the
                    centre of the district, some of which fall into the Ucayale, and others into the
                    Huallaga, most of which are navigable for canoes and flat-bottomed boats at all
                    seasons; those which fall into the former of these rivers are the most
                    considerable, viz. the Pachitea, the Aguaytia, the Cuxhiabatay, and the Santa
                    Catalina. The northern part is much intersected by channels from the Huallaga to
                    the Maranon, which afford great facilities for communication. This part of the
                    Pampa appeared to be quite flat and thickly covered with trees, some of which
                    were large, and the soil a red clay. The level extends as far south as Sarayacu,
                    in the neighbourhood of which, and across the Huallaga, it rises into gentle
                    hills. Farther southward we had no opportunity of seeing the country, except
                    upon the banks of the Huallaga, which were generally level, but occasionally
                    intersected by hills, which, indeed, near the Pongo, and from the Caracol, where
                    we embarked on the river, to Juana del Rio, are entitled to the designation of
                    mountains. The hills which are marked in Mr Arrowsmith’s map of Peru and
                    Bolivia, published in 1834, as the east branch of the Andes, are not deserving
                    of the name of mountains. The productions of the Pampa, as we learned from Padre
                    Plaza (the present missionary priest) are all indigenous, and in general
                    spontaneously produced. The earth supplies vegetables sufficient for the
                    consumption of the inhabitants; and the rivers furnish an inexhaustible store of
                    delicious fish of various kinds. The beasts in the forest are the same as are to
                    be found in all parts from the Huallaga to Para. By the Padre’s account,
                    however, they are not numerous, from the great destruction of them by the
                    Indians, which is sometimes wanton. There is an almost endless variety of
                    beautiful birds, many of which are excellent food. The vegetable kingdom, which
                    has hitherto been unexplored by botanists, rivals in beauty and fragrance that
                    of any other part of the world. The climate seems very much like that of the
                    island of Madeira. During our stay at Sarayacu, we registered the thermometer
                    three times a day, and its minimum and maximum were 75° and 85° of Fahrenheit,
                    and the sun at this time passed over our zenith. Padre Plaza told us, that in
                    the dry season, that is, in June, July, and August, the temperature is extremely
                    even, and the heat by no means oppressive, as it is allayed by refreshing
                    breezes, which generally blow in the contrary direction to the current of the
                    river. In December, January, and February, fevers and agues sometimes make their
                    appearance, but are rarely attended with fatal consequences, when the parties
                    affected take proper care, which these people, however, are not apt to do.”<note

                    distinct tribes of Indians, differing considerably from one another in their
                    manners and habits.</p>
                <p>The Spaniards, and even the Peruvians before them, made little progress to the
                    east of the stupendous barrier of the Andes, which indeed must for ever prove a
                    great natural disadvantage to the eastern provinces, in shutting them out, as it
                    were, from communication with the western portion of Peru. And when to these
                    obstacles we add the precipitous height of the eastern declivity of the mountain
                    chain, the impracticable forests, the dangers to be apprehended from the
                    barbarians which people them, the almost insufferable heats, the annoyance of
                    the innumerable venomous insects and reptiles, and the many deep and impassable
                    rivers; when these circumstances are considered, we may cease to wonder that the
                    conquerors of Peru should have made small advances beyond the range of the
                    Cordillera. The Gran-Chaco, or Great Desert; the countries between Paraguay and
                    Chiquitos; those reaching from Moxos and Apolobamba to the rivers Amazons and
                    Huallaga, and from the Apurus to the Ucayale, are regions almost wholly unknown
                    to us. Wherever the interior has been penetrated, it has been by means of some
                    of those mighty rivers which, descending from the Cordilleras, have forced, as
                    it were, a natural outlet through the otherwise impassable and almost boundless
                    forests below. It was not, however, from the coasts of Peru, and by proceeding
                    in an easterly direction, that the Spaniards reached them. They were originally
                    made known by adventurers from the south, who discovered them, after toiling up
                    the long and arduous passage of the river Paraguay. The difficulties with which
                    the nations to the eastward of the Andes have to contend in the transport of
                    their productions across the Cordillera, of course add very greatly to the
                    expense of these articles. Those of Chiquitos and Moxos are transported more
                    than two hundred leagues to Lima, over a double range of the Andes; and if they
                    are taken to Buenos Ayres the distance is tripled. Nothing but gold, silver, and
                    precious stones can repay the enormous expense of transport on beasts of burden
                    over such extensive tracts of country, beset with all but insurmount <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193495039" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5039-0304"/> able natural
                    obstacles. It is not surprising, therefore, that with such impediments before
                    them, the natives should relinquish the idea of cultivating the soil for the
                    purpose of exportation, and remain content with raising what is barely
                    sufficient for the supply of their own daily wants. But an entirely new road to
                    Peruvian commerce might be opened by means of the vast rivers which traverse the
                    country.</p>
                <p>Amidst the various circumstances which distinguish Peru, there are some of the
                    most calamitous and terrific description. The whole country is subject to the
                    most violent convulsions of nature. Earthquakes are frequently felt in almost
                    every part, and are sometimes accompanied with most extensive and fatal effects.
                    The lofty chain of the Andes is a collection of volcanoes, some in constant
                    activity, others occasionally ejecting inflammable substances; whilst there are
                    many whose fires in the lapse of ages seem to have burned out. Electrical
                    phenomena are frequent in the Andes of Peru, some of which are regarded with
                    superstitious veneration by the Peruvian of the lower class. when he sees a
                    silvery lustre glistening through the clouds at midnight from the summit of a
                    lofty mountain, or a phosphorescent light shining in the wooded clefts of the
                    lower Andes, he is immediately persuaded that there are either rich veins of
                    gold or silver running along the surface, or that the buried treasures of the
                    incas invite the bold adventurer to search for them, which he frequently does.
                    Appalling visitations of thunder and lightning are not uncommon in all parts of
                    Peru excepting the western coast.</p>
                <p>In enumerating the productions of this country, we shall commence with those of
                    the Pampas, where by far the most valuable of them are to be found. We pass over
                    the flora, which is unusually rich and extensive, and also plants of a humbler
                    character; for, although interesting to the man of science, they would form but
                    a dry catalogue of botanical names to the general reader. The vegetables which
                    at present form articles of use or commerce are, coffee, sugar, rice, maize,
                    capaiva, sarsaparilla, Peruvian .bark, cotton, resin, cocoa, and gums, including
                    copal and laurel wax, bees’ wax, and a variety of oils. Of dye-stuffs there are,
                    anatto, amarillo, cani, mahogany-bark, indigo, shambo, morado, ensena which
                    resembles logwood, and others. In describing the qualities of some of these, and
                    the quantities in which they are produced, Thadeus Haenke observes, “The cocoa
                    of Apolobamba, of Moxos, of Yu-racarees, and of all the woods which extend from
                    thence to the shores of the Maranon, is infinitely superior to that of
                    Guayaquil. The finest quality of carscarilla is only found on the eastern side
                    of the Andes. Of the indigo there is no end; I can say the same of the cotton
                    and the rice. The precious balsam of capaiva, the sarsaparilla, the gum-elastic,
                    and the most fragrant species of vanilla, are all produced in extraordinary
                    abundance in these regions. The mighty forests which line the shores of the
                    rivers abound in the finest timber for all uses, especially for shipbuilding,
                    and in trees distilling the most aromatic and medicinal gums. Amongst others
                    there is a species of cinnamon, called by the natives the <hi rend="italic"
                    >canela de clova,</hi> which only differs in the greater thickness of the bark
                    and its darker colour, according to its age, from that found in the East Indies,
                    and which is as fragrant as the spice from which it takes its name.”<note

                    describes the woods as consisting of mahogany, cedar, asarquiro, nogal,
                    almen-dra, huito, arabisa, chonta, spindo, and others. The fruits are the
                    pine-apple, which attains an incredible size, the orange, chirimolla, lucuman,
                    ciruellas, patillos, guayabas, figs, limes, citrons, papayas, melons,

                    pomegranates, cherries, peaches, quinces, grapes in abundance, bananas, pepinos,
                    plantains, guavas, peras, duraznos, strawberries, mulberries, and a number of
                    others. There are a great variety of vegetables, including yucas, potatoes,
                    sweet potatoes, onions, mountain-cabbage, beans, and so forth. The grains
                    usually cultivated are wheat, barley, and maize. In some parts excellent tobacco
                    is raised; and in others large quantities of sweetmeats, both dry and in syrup,
                    are made from peaches, quinces, and grapes, the latter being much esteemed.
                    Gourds attain an enormous size in some districts, and are converted into all
                    kinds of household utensils required by the Indians, even into wash-tubs, from
                    which circumstance some idea of the magnitude of the vegetable may be formed.
                    Huanuco, a place situated at 6300 feet above the level of the sea, in a
                    beautiful valley upon the eastern side of the Andes, and seventy-four miles from
                    Lima, is celebrated for the productiveness of its soil. Here grow all sorts of
                    vegetables, and grains and fruits, the latter being produced in greater
                    perfection than in any other part of Peru. There is a fruit called chonta, from
                    which the Indians prepare an intoxicating liquor; but the staple article made
                    use of for producing the effects of wine, spirits, or opium, is coca; and as
                    this remarkable plant is very extensively cultivated, and has now become an
                    indispensable necessary of life amongst the Indians of the Andes, it merits some
                    attention.</p>
                <p>The coca <hi rend="italic">(Erythroxylon coca,</hi> Lam.) is a bush from six to
                    eight feet in height, somewhat resembling a black thorn in its numerous small
                    white blossoms and the lively bright green of its leaves. The latter, which are
                    gathered and carefully dried, form an article of brisk trade, and the use of
                    them seems as old as the first knowledge of the history of Peru. It is a
                    stimulant, which acts upon the nervous system in the same manner as opium, and
                    unhappily the use or abuse of it has degenerated into a vice, or rather a
                    disease, which appears to be incurable. “The Indians of America,” says an able
                    writer on this subject,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Foreign Quarterly Review for April 1836.</p></note> “especially those of the
                    Peruvian Andes, notwithstanding the civilization which surrounds them, have a
                    vague sense of their own incurable deficiency, and hence they are eager to
                    relieve themselves, by violent excitements, from such melancholy feelings. This
                    accounts not only for the use of coca, but also for the boundless love of
                    spirituous liquors, which possesses scarcely any other people in the world in an
                    equal degree. To the Peruvian the coca is the source of the highest
                    gratification; for under its influence his usual melancholy leaves him, and his
                    dull imagination presents him with images which he never enjoys in his usual
                    state.” Dr Poeppig draws a melancholy picture of the dreadful effects of this
                    insinuating drug, which gives rise to many diseases apparently in some degree
                    peculiar to those who use it. A person abandoned to the use of coca is under the
                    dominion of a spell so malignant that no earthly power can dissolve it, and so
                    fascinating that no prospect of danger will deter him from gratifying his
                    propensity. As soon as the longing for this intoxication becomes irresistible,
                    the coquero sculks for concealment into solitary darkness, or flies from the
                    face of man into the depths of the wilderness, where he makes choice of a tree,
                    beneath the shade of which he flings himself down to enjoy his coca. Unheeded he
                    observes night closing upon him, doubly awful in the gloomy forest; and tempests
                    of wind and rain, the fury of the hurricane which uproots the oldest trees, the
                    terrible roll of the thunder, augmented a thousandfold by the multiplied
                    reverberations of the Andes, or the presence of the ounce, abroad for his
                    nightly prey, and grow ling at his feet, all are insufficient to appal the
                    debauchee, or rouse him from his lethargy. In two days he generally returns,
                    pale, trembling, his eyes sunk, the most fearful picture of unnatural<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193495052" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5052-0305"/> indulgence which
                    humanity ever presented. He who has once been seized with this passion, and is
                    placed in a situation that favours its development, is considered as a lost man.
                    Dr Poeppig informs us that there are many instances of young men of good
                    families amongst the whites and Creoles, who, having obtained a relish for coca,
                    were from that moment lost to the civilized world. Shunning society, they
                    retreated into the most unfrequented parts of the wilderness, and there,
                    degraded, and sunk into half savages, they fell victims to premature death,
                    through the immoderate use of this intoxicating herb.</p>
                <p>The grapes are so abundant in some parts that large quantities of wine might be
                    made for exportation; but no more is produced than is needed, and a little is
                    even imported. Strong liquors, such as brandy and rum, are distilled; and oil is
                    made from the olive. The various kinds of capsicums are cultivated with more
                    attention and skill than almost any other plants, and, when dressed in various
                    ways with garlic, form a most important article of food to the greater portion
                    of the inhabitants. The celebrated Paraguay tea is likewise a very common
                    beverage. Another liquor in universal use is chica, which, from having been
                    found in the tombs of the aborigines, is proved to have been used by them prior
                    to the conquest. The chica of the present day is of the consistence of milk, of
                    a yellowish colour, and, when poured from one vessel into another, froths like
                    beer. Its taste is generally acid, but when very good the acidity is scarcely
                    perceptible. It is made by steeping Indian corn in water till it swells, after
                    which it is dried and ground. The flour and bran are boiled in water, strained,
                    and left to ferment four and twenty hours, when it is fit for use. Sugar is
                    occasionally added; and with eggs it is sometimes made into flip.</p>
                <p>The zoology of Peru has not received that attention which has been bestowed upon
                    the vegetable kingdom by the distinguished travellers Humboldt and Bonpland. The
                    three most celebrated animals of the Peruvian Andes are the lama, the vicugna,
                    and the condor, an account of which is given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bolivia.</hi> The demand for animal food is but small, and hence little
                    attention has been paid to the breeding, and none to the fattening, of cattle.
                    Neither cows nor sheep are numerous; those found in the country are the progeny
                    of the breed brought originally from Europe. In the mountainous districts,
                    between Huamanga and Cuzco, both butter and cheese are made; but in the lower
                    country, oil is the universal substitute for the former. Pigs are bred in great
                    numbers in the more elevated districts. The whole coast is well stored with fish
                    of every kind. The natives of the Indian villages on the shore are very
                    dexterous in catching them; and, with the addition of capsicum and garlic, they
                    form the chief part of their subsistence.</p>
                <p>Peru is proverbial for its richness in mines of gold and silver, especially the
                    latter, although the former is proportionally plentiful. “Gold,” says Thadeus
                    Haenke, “and it is the finest in the world, is found there in such abundance,
                    that I have no hesitation in saying there is scarcely a pass in the mountains
                    where it is not to be discovered, although in some parts it may be of easier
                    access than in others, and better known.” The quantity of gold produced in Peru
                    arises partly from some mines in the province of Tarma, and partly from washings
                    established on the rapid mountain torrents. The latter, however, have in many
                    instances been abandoned. The principal silver mines are situated in the Cerro
                    de Pasco (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pasco).</hi> There are also mines
                    of quicksilver, which, however, are now exhausted, or nearly so.<note

                    the mines of Peru, the quantities which they have produced, and their actual
                    condition, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mines.</hi></p></note> Cobalt,
                    antimony, and especially rock-salt, abound in Peru; but as these are, excepting
                    the latter, found chiefly in the mountainous districts, the distance, and the
                    want of roads, render their conveyance too expensive to enable them to be
                    advantageously carried to any market of consumption. There are a few mines of
                    copper and of lead, which, from the same causes, are worked on a very contracted
                    scale. In the northern territory there are said to be mines of sulphur which
                    remain unworked, and bituminous pitch is found in the same quarter. Dr
                    Meyen<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Meyen, Voyage
                    round the World, Berlin, 1835.</p></note> mentions that Tarapaca, in the
                    department of Arequipa, has received from nature a peculiar present in its
                    woodmines, which the inhabitants use as fuel in their saltpetre works, although
                    probably there is not a single tree in all the surrounding country. This
                    substance is not coal, but is stated to be dry timber, easily cleft, immense
                    forests of which are buried under the sand of that plain. The trees all lie
                    prostrate, with their tops towards the coast, and the timber is found
                    exceedingly useful, burning with a flame as bright as that of common wood.</p>
                <p>Amongst the antiquities of Peru may be numbered Cuzco itself, and the ruins of
                    other cities or towns, which have been much more recently discovered, and to
                    which we have already alluded. There are also extensive remains of
                    fortifications; and a great number of tumuli or sepulchral mounds are found
                    widely scattered over the country. In these, relics of various kinds have been
                    discovered, such as gold and silver ornaments, warlike weapons, and household
                    utensils, comprising jars of earthenware, with figures upon them, which proves
                    that the Indians were acquainted with pottery. Dr Poeppig informs us, that the
                    mania of digging for treasures annually destroys in Peru many ancient and
                    remarkable remains. Wherever the Peruvian beholds tumuli evidently raised by the
                    hand of man, or an ancient building indicates the former abode of an
                    exterminated people, he immediately suspects the existence of the guacas or
                    caverns, which were filled by the incas at the time of the conquest with gold
                    and precious stones, and forgotten at the premature death of these chieftains,
                    who had buried their treasures from a sense of duty, and not chosen any persons
                    as the depositaries of their secret. The work of demolition immediately
                    commences; the abodes of the dead are rudely violated, and in their eagerness to
                    find what alone to them is valuable, the Peruvians, and the Spaniards likewise,
                    pay little attention to the preservation of the other interesting relics, but
                    carelessly break them to pieces, and scatter them about. There will soon not be
                    a tumulus left in the country. The most absurd fables have been invented and set
                    afloat in connection with the favourite hypothesis of vast treasures remaining
                    yet undiscovered. According to a tradition coeval with the conquest of the city
                    of Cuzco, there is in a mountain lake in its vicinity a gold chain which went
                    twice round the market-place, and of such large proportions that an Indian could
                    with difficulty carry a single link of it.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Peru are inconsiderable, and consist chiefly of those homely
                    articles which are required by the poorer classes of the community. On the high
                    land, where warm clothing is necessary, the want is chiefly supplied by a
                    species of long-woolled baize, made from the fleeces of the aboriginal sheep,
                    and in some instances from the wool of sheep of the European breed. In the
                    valleys, and on the coast, where the heat forbids the use of woollens, cotton
                    cloths are made, but of a very inferior texture. The Indians manufacture a
                    variety of cotton fabrics, which are consumed in the country, such as
                    counterpanes with raised figures. Straw-hats of a variety of colours, perates or
                    mats, and segarreros, also form part of their manufactures<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193495065" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5065-0306"/>; and they likewise execute a
                    very fine filligree work of gold and silver. Goat-skins are made into good
                    cordovan. Tanning, soap-making, distilling, saltpetre, and other manufactures,
                    are also amongst the items of productive industry; but Peru looks to Europe for
                    a great part of the necessaries as well as the Iuxuries of life. In dyeing the
                    cloths, whether of woollen or cotton, the natives make use of plants which are
                    scarcely known in Europe, or at least have not been applied to the same purpose.
                    The dress of the Peruvians is very simple, consisting of a square cloth, with a
                    hole in the centre, through which the head is thrust, and which falls before and
                    behind so as to defend the whole body. The head is generally covered with a hat
                    made of the straw of the maize, which is as large as, and serves the purpose of,
                    an umbrella.</p>
                <p>The foreign trade of Peru is principally carried on with the united kingdom of
                    Great Britain and Ireland, into which the following articles were imported

                    1835 was L.441,324. By comparison with former years this shows a decided
                    increase of our trade with Peru. In 1827 it was L.228,466; in 1830, L.368,469;
                    in 1832, L.275,610; in 1833, L.387,524; and in 1834, L.299,235. This shows
                    remarkable fluctuations; but these must for the most part be attributed to the
                    political agitations of the country.</p>
                <p>The trade of the United States with Peru is next in importance to that of Great
                    Britain, and it displays the same fluctuations, and likewise the same increase
                    on a number of years. The exports from Peru into the United States during the
                    year 1835 amounted to 1,118,278 dollars. During the previous year the amount was
                    only 618,412 dollars. A considerable quantity of gold and silver specie is
                    imported into the United States from Peru. The imports into Peru from the United
                    States consist of flour in very considerable quantities, raw cotton, beef and
                    pork, butter and lard, candles, soap, chairs, cider, gunpowder, turpentine,
                    linseed oil, tobacco, wax, quicksilver, German linen, Russian sheetings, and
                    steel. It will be seen that these articles are for the most part different from
                    those imported into the country by Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The trade of Peru with France is likewise considerable. The gold and silver
                    specie, the bark, tin, skins, hides, and other productions of the former, being
                    exchanged for the silks, brandy, wine, and other commodities of the former. With
                    Spain likewise a trade of much the same nature is carried on. Quantities of
                    specie and a few other articles are sent to Genoa, Canton, and other ports. From
                    Paraguay large quantities of the Paraguay tea are introduced. It must be
                    observed with regard to the trade of Peru, that a considerable quantity of the
                    produce of the country is imported into Great Britain and other places at
                    second-hand from Buenos Ayres and Valparaiso. Indeed, much of the foreign trade
                    of Peru is carried on through the medium of Buenos Ayres.</p>
                <p>Peru carries on some trade with Chili, and also with the states to the north of
                    its own territory. Timber for the construction of ships and houses is brought
                    from Guayaquil, and indigo from Mexico Large quantities of wheat are imported
                    from Chili; for although Peru might easily raise a sufficiency of all kinds of
                    cerealia to supply its own consumption, it has never been able to do so. A few
                    years ago a heavy duty was imposed on the wheat imported from Chili, with the
                    view of encouraging its cultivation at home. But the Chilians became indignant,
                    and reciprocated by imposing a duty of twelve dollars per quintal on the
                    importation of Peruvian sugars. The Peruvian congress then proposed to admit
                    into their ports all foreign vessels at reduced duties, on condition of not
                    touching previously at any Chilian port. The two states thus view each other
                    with a jealous eye in their commercial affairs, and also in other respects. The
                    moneys, weights, and measures are the same as those of Spain.</p>
                <p>The following is an abstract of the commercial treaty lately concluded between
                    Great Britain and the Peruvio-Bolivian Confederation.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation
                    between his Majesty William IV. and the Peruvio-Bolivian Confederation, signed
                    at Lima, õth June 1837. Parliamentary Papers for 1838.</p></note> It is agreed
                    that there shall be perpetual amity and freedom of commerce between Great
                    Britain and these countries, complete protection and security to person and
                    property being afforded; but that the coasting trade shall be confined to
                    national vessels. That Peruvio-Bolivian vessels, in trading with Great Britain,
                    shall enjoy the same privileges as the traders of the most favoured nation,
                    duties and other charges being the same; and this stipulation is reciprocal.
                    After the expiration of fifteen years, it is agreed that there shall be no
                    distinction between Peruvio-Bolivian and British vessels in entering each
                    other’s ports. To avoid future misunderstanding, it is also agreed that, for
                    fifteen years, any ship, the property of a citizen of the Peruvio-Bolivian
                    Confederation, and of which the master and three fourths of the crew are such,
                    shall be placed on the same footing as a national vessel, that is, a vessel
                    built in the country; but after the period specified expires, the sovereign of
                    Great Britain is to possess the right of restricting the privileges enjoyed by a
                    ship of either country to such as are actually <hi rend="italic">built</hi> in
                    that country, taken in war, or condemned for trading in slaves. That the
                    citizens and subjects of the contracting parties, in the territories of each <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193495078" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5078-0307"/> other, shall be
                    placed upon the same footing as the natives, with the privilege of exemption
                    from all compulsory military services, exactions, or requisitions, and from
                    forced loans. That liberty of conscience and freedom of religious exercises be
                    enjoyed; and that the Peruvio-Bolivian Confederation shall co-operate with Great
                    Britain for the total extinction of the slave-trade. There are some other
                    stipulations in the treaty, but these, being of minor importance, do not require
                    particular mention.</p>
                <p>Peru labours under disadvantages exceedingly unfavourable to its commerce. On the
                    whole Pacific coast, for about two thousand miles, there are only three or four
                    ports capable of admitting vessels of any size, viz. Callao, the port of Lima;
                    Arica, a port of Arequipa, and a miserable place, although resorted to by
                    trading vessels, for want of a better, it is presumed; and Islay, the new port
                    or harbour of the city of Arequipa. It is supposed that the commerce will
                    increase when the port of Arica is closed, which has been contemplated by
                    government. Farther north is the port of Pisco, a small place, but enjoying some
                    share of maritime commerce, although not a port of entry. From Callao to the
                    confines of Colombia there does not appear to be one port worthy of the name, if
                    we except Pacasmayo, the port of Truxillo, which is a wretched place, and Paita,
                    the port of Piura. Add to this disadvantage that of the barrier of the Andes,
                    which cuts off all communication, except at a great expense, between the richest
                    part of the country and the coast where its native wealth might be readily
                    exported. These are heavy drawbacks on all commercial industry; and, as the
                    latter is an insurmountable difficulty, the Peruvian government must look to
                    another quarter for an outlet for the produce of the country. This is to be
                    found in the numerous large and navigable rivers which traverse the regions
                    situated between the Andes and the Amazons, the great natural drain of all these
                    territories. The advantages which Peru would derive from commercial intercourse
                    with civilized nations are too great and too obvious to be overlooked by the
                    government, if tranquillity were only permanently restored. But as long as these
                    republics continue to tear each other to pieces, and exhaust their resources in
                    fruitless warfare, little improvement in commerce or amelioration of their
                    social condition is to be anticipated. In reference to the navigation of the
                    Amazons and its affluents, it has been well observed by an able writer—“The time
                    appears to be now arrived, when the solution of the question touching the course
                    of the great rivers that empty themselves into the Amazons between the Huallaga
                    and the Madeira may be expected. And we anticipate with confidence, that a
                    question of so great importance in a commercial point of view, will not escape
                    the notice of the patriotic government of Bolivia, and of its highly gifted
                    president Santa Cruz; and that, ere long, the productions of the rich provinces
                    of Apolobamba, Moxos, and of the other countries situated on the eastern
                    declivity of the Andes, will find their way to European markets by the less
                    circuitous route of the Amazon and its confluents.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>It is nearly impossible to obtain precise information as to the amount of the
                    present revenues of Peru. Under the colonial government of Spain, the revenues
                    of the crown amounted, <hi rend="italic">communibus annis,</hi> to about
                    6,000,000 of dollars, and the expenditure to about 3,200,000; the balance being
                    annually remitted to the parent state. The present revenue has been estimated at
                    L.1,250,000, the expenditure at a little less than that sum, and the national
                    debt at about L.6,000,000. In the year 1832, it was agreed to between the states
                    of Peru and Bolivia, that for the future the former should be obliged to
                    maintain a military force of 3000, and the latter of 2000 men, and that neither
                    power should be at liberty to augment its army without the consent of the other.
                    The naval force is very small, consisting of one frigate, two corvettes, and two
                    galliots; but this must be considered as the peace establishment. When the
                    country is at war, it will be necessary to increase the military force
                    considerably.</p>
                <p>According to the constitution of 1828, the religion of the republic is the Roman
                    Catholic and apostolic. “The nation permits it by all the means that conform to
                    the spirit of the evangelist, and will not permit the exercise of any other.” It
                    may be mentioned, that a similar article is found in the Chilian constitution of
                    May 1833. The question of religious toleration gave rise to very animated
                    discussions in both countries, and called forth all the powers of the author of
                    Cartas Peruanas, in support of the exclusive exercise of the Catholic religion,
                    and the supremacy of the pope. The -work here mentioned was an examination of
                    the evidences of Christianity, and was published to neutralize the bad effects
                    of the infidel and irreligious books which some interested persons had
                    disseminated throughout the country during the revolutionary agitations.
                    Education is said to be at a low ebb. There is a university at Lima, which in
                    1831 had fifty-five students. This institution is the most ancient and the most
                    celebrated in all South America. There are a number of colleges, and a national
                    library, which is one of the richest in the New World. Ten or twelve journals
                    are published in Lima; indeed, if this city were to be taken as a fair criterion
                    by which to judge of the state of literature and learning in Peru, we might be
                    led to form a very high estimate of it, for it concentrates nearly the whole in
                    itself. But, since the revolution, extensive arrangements have been made for the
                    general diffusion of knowledge amongst the people.</p>

                    other subdivisions are as numerous as the possible combinations of the primitive
                    castes. The Indians or native Peruvians are still the most numerous class
                    throughout the country. They present nothing of the fierce and untamed character
                    of the Caribbs or Canadian Indians, but are timid, reserved, and of a melancholy
                    temperament. Much of their apathy and insensibility is unquestionably natural to
                    them, but it has been deepened and rendered more inveterate and habitual by ages
                    of oppression. They are sunk in gross ignorance; but that they are incapable of
                    being roused from their lethargy, and taught the arts of peace and civilization,
                    is a gratuitous absurdity, which several of them have triumphantly refuted by
                    making a distinguished appearance in the pulpit and at the bar. The manufacture
                    of beautiful fabrics is quite common amongst them, and many of the tribes are
                    indus trious agriculturists. They have been converted to Christianity; and they
                    have wiped off the reproach of cowardice by their achievements during the war of
                    independence, in which they generally took the part of the royalists. Yet they
                    cherish a deep and mournful impression of the days of the incas; and in all the
                    remote districts of the country the death of the last of the race is annually
                    celebrated by a sort of rude tragedy, accompanied by plaintive and melting
                    strains of music. The mixed races are more numerous than the pure Spaniards,
                    although less so than the native Peruvians. According to Mr Stevenson, the
                    mestizo is strong and swarthy, with very little beard, laborious, and well
                    disposed; the mulatto is less robust, but acute, talkative, imaginative, and
                    fond of dress and parade. In a public disputation at the university, a mulatto
                    in the gallery will often help the embarrassed student out with his syllogism.
                    The zambo, or mulatto and negro, is violent, morose, and stubborn, prone to many
                    vices, and guilty of more robberies and murders than any of the other classes,
                    excepting only the Chinos or negro-Indians, who are said to be the very worst
                    mixed breed in existence; they are ugly, lazy, stupid, and cruel. (R. R. R.)</p>
