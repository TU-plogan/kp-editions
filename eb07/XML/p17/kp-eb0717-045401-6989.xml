                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Phrenology,</hi> derived from <hi rend="italic">φpnv, the
                    mind,</hi> and λoγos, <hi rend="italic">discourse,</hi> is a term which has been
                    recently applied to denote a new doctrine of mental philosophy, founded on a
                    presumed knowledge of the functions of different portions of the brain, obtained
                    by comparing their relative forms and magnitudes in different individuals, with
                    the propensities and intellectual powers which these individuals are found
                    respectively to possess. This term has of late years totally superseded the more
                    unpretending titles of <hi rend="smallcaps">Craniology</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cranioscopy,</hi> by which this doctrine, in its earlier
                    periods, and before it had aspired at effecting a revolution in psychology, was
                    designated, and which simply implied the study of the external forms of the
                    skull, both in men and animals, with a view to determine the size of the
                    subjacent parts of the brain, and thence to derive indications as to the mental
                    and moral qualities of each individual.</p>
                <p>The original propounder of the doctrine which is the basis of phrenology was Dr.
                    Gall, a physician of Vienna, whose system, matured in conjunction with Dr.
                    Spurzheim, has attracted so much attention, and been so keenly discussed, both
                    here and on the Continent, that we think it our duty to present our readers with
                    a general outline of this pretended science.</p>
                <p>Of the several parts which compose the human body, the mechanism of which has
                    been so thoroughly unfolded by the diligence of modern anatomists, there are few
                    whose use in the economy is wholly unknown. The intention and operation of every
                    part of our frame subservient to the mechanical purposes of connexion,
                    oflocomotion, and ofstrength, such as the bones, muscles, and ligaments, are, in
                    general, sufficiently apparent; the functions performed by the abdominal and
                    thoracic viscera are, for the most part, well ascertained; and we are able, in
                    like manner, to discern the adaptation of the organs of sense to receive
                    appropriate impressions from surrounding objects. One organ alone, and an organ
                    of vast importance in the system, connected with every other, and essentially
                    interwoven with our sensitive existence, has baffled all investigation, and
                    still presents a wide blank in this rich and cultivated field of knowledge. The
                    brain, that large mass of pulpy substance, which fills the cavity of the
                    cranium, is, even at the present day, as incomprehensible in its functions, as
                    it is subtle and complex in its anatomy. It appears, indeed, to be sufficiently
                    established, that the brain is, in some unknown way, subservient to sensation
                    and voluntary motion, and is thereby the immediate agent by which the soul and
                    body mutually exert an influence over each other: and it has also been very
                    generally supposed, that this organ is immediately concerned in all our mental
                    operations, besides being the instrument by which we feel and act. But the
                    phenomena comprehended under the operations of the mind are exceedingly various
                    and complicated, and are also of very different kinds; so that before we can
                    reason concerning them, it is necessary that they should be properly
                    distinguished and arranged. Metaphysicians have, accordingly, classed them as
                    referable to our sentient, our intellectual, our active, and our moral powers.
                    Further subdivision again is required; and the intellectual phenomena, for
                    instance, are arranged according as they relate to the faculties of con ∙
                    ception, association, memory, abstraction, judgment, imagination, invention,
                    &amp;c. Other phenomena are distributed under the heads of the different active
                    principles, such as the propensities, the instincts, the affections, and the
                    passions, which belong to our nature. Whilst we thus discover a great diversity
                    in the functions of the mind, we observe also as great a complexity of structure
                    in the organs by which they are performed. Shall we rest satisfied with an
                    acquiescence in the general proposition, that the brain is the organ of thought?
                    May we not rather regard it as a congeries of distinct organs, corresponding to
                    the different faculties into which the mind maybe analyzed; each organ having
                    its appropriate office, and being immediately subservient to some particular
                    function of the mind? The question has, indeed, presented itself to many
                    physiologists; but few have ventured farther in attempting its solution, than to
                    throw out some vague and general conjectures as to the uses of certain parts, or
                    as to the supposed habitation of the sentient principle. Thus, for a long period
                    it was held, that the cerebrum was the organ of perception, and the cerebellum
                    the organ of memory. The cavities which are met with in the interior of the
                    brain have often been considered as the scene of the intellectual operations.
                    Nemesius, the first bishop of Emesa, under the reign of Theodosius, taught that
                    the sensations had their seat in the anterior ventricles, memory in the middle,
                    and understanding in the posterior ventricles. Albertus Magnus, in the
                    thirteenth century, went so far as actually to delineate upon a head the
                    supposed seat of the different faculties of the mind. He placed common sense in
                    the forehead, or in the first ventricle of the brain, cogitation and judgment in
                    the second, memory and moving power in the third. Peter de Montagnana, in 1491,
                    published the figure of a head, on which were indicated the seat of the <hi
                    rend="italic">sensus</hi><hi rend="italic">communis,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cellula</hi><hi rend="italic">imaginativa,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cellula</hi><hi rend="italic">aestimativa</hi><hi rend="italic">seu</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cogitativa,</hi><hi rend="italic">cellula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >memorativa,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cellula rationalis.</hi> LudovicoDolci,
                    Servito, and a great number of other writers, have hazarded similar hypotheses
                    as to the locality of the different faculties. Both Haller and Van Swicten
                    fancied that the internal senses occupy different places in the brain; but they
                    considered its whole organization as too complicated, too intricate, and too
                    difficult, to allow of any hope that the seat of memory, of judgment, or of
                    imagination, could ever be detected.</p>
                <p>In the pursuit of this speculation, no one has engaged with more ardour and
                    perseverance than Dr. Gall, who, after many years of patient labour, and much
                    fruitless wandering in search of the truth, conceived that he had at last
                    discovered the clue which was to conduct us through the mazes of this labyrinth,
                    and enable us to arrive at a more accurate knowledge of human nature, and of the
                    means which may conduce to its perfection. The account which he gave of the
                    circumstances that gradually drew his attention to the subject, and of his
                    progress in this new path of discovery, is as follows: Brought up in the midst
                    of a numerous family, and naturally gifted with the talent for observation, he
                    was struck, even when a boy, with the diversities of disposition and of
                    character amongst his brothers and sisters, and the companions with whom he was
                    educated. He remarked, that each excelled in a particular study, or was
                    distinguished by a peculiar turn of mind. One was noted for the beauty of his
                    handwriting; another for his quickness at arithmetic; a third for his aptitude
                    in learning languages; a fourth for remembering everything that he read in
                    history. This diversity was apparent in all that they did; thus the style of
                    composition of the one was remarkable for its flowing and elegant periods; of
                    another for its <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497002" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7002-0455"
                    />'baldness and dryness; of a third for its condensation and vigour. Many
                    displayed talents for arts which had never been taught them; they excelled,
                    perhaps, in drawing, or in the execution of works of mechanism; some sought for
                    amusement in noisy sports, others preferred cultivating their gardens; a few
                    placed their chief delight in rambling through fields and forests, and in
                    collecting birds, insects, and flowers. One was of a social and affectionate
                    disposition, another was selfish and reserved; a third was fickle, and not to be
                    depended upon. The great facility with which some of his school-fellows could
                    commit their tasks to memory, which to him was a work of immense labour,
                    although in matters of reasoning and judgment he felt himself their superior,
                    often proved a grievous source of mortification, and excited in him a strong
                    desire to know the cause of this difference. He at length remarked, that all the
                    boys gifted with this kind of memory had large and prominent eyes. He afterwards
                    went to the university; and directing his attention to all those among his
                    fellow-students, who presented the same peculiarity of feature, he learned that
                    they were all distinguished by the tenacity of their memories; as, indeed, he
                    soon found to his cost, for they were sure to leave him far behind in every
                    competition, where the exercise of this faculty was essential to success. This
                    observation gave rise to others; it suggested the notion, that other
                    intellectual endowments might also be indicated by the features; and Gall, by
                    degrees, came to imagine that he had discovered a number of external signs,
                    which respectively indicated a decided turn for painting, for music, for
                    mechanical arts, or other objects. He had by this time commenced the study of
                    medicine; and, in the course of his academical instructions, he heard much about
                    the functions of the muscles and viscera; but nothing was taught about those of
                    the brain and its different parts. It then occurred to him, that the differences
                    he had already noticed in the external configuration of the head, as connected
                    with certain dispositions of mind, were occasioned by differences in the form of
                    the brain. Delighted with the prospect which this idea opened to him of
                    discovering the functions of particular parts of this organ, and of obtaining an
                    insight into the connexion between the mind and the body, he formed the
                    resolution of prosecuting the research, till he had either accomplished his
                    object, or satisfied himself that it was not to be attained by that method.
                    Natural history, which had long been his favourite study, furnished ample scope
                    for the extension of these inquiries. He had been in the practice of collecting
                    plants and animals of various kinds, and of arranging them, not according to the
                    artificial methods of classification detailedin booksof science, but according
                    to their more obvious resemblances. He now studied the relations between their
                    external forms, and their natural habits and dispositions. Dogs showed him the
                    greatest diversities in their capabilities of being educated. He remarked that
                    some were naturally expert at the chace, while others, of the same breed, could
                    not be trained without the utmost difficulty; that some perpetually lost
                    themselves, while others found their way home from great distances. In birds, he
                    observed that one would listen with attention to a tune which it heard, and
                    immediately learn it; while another of the very same brood would sing nothing
                    but the note that was natural to it. Whence, he would ask himself, can arise
                    this wide diversity among individuals?</p>
                <p>The solution of this difficult question was not to be hoped for, unless by means
                    of observations conducted on the largest possible scale. He therefore set about
                    examining all the skulls he could lay hold of, that had belonged to individuals
                    whose history was known. He looked out for all persons in any way distinguished
                    for a particular talent or moral quality. He examined their heads with great
                    attention, and noted the peculiarities in their shape. He also collected
                    observations on other individuals, who were remarkable for the weakness of any
                    faculty, and then compared together the positive and negative indications. On
                    the other hand, when he chanced to meet with a head that presented some
                    singularity in shape, he was at much pains to obtain information as to the moral
                    and intellectual character of the person to whom it belonged. When he had no
                    other resource, he did not scruple, as Dr. Spurzheim informs us, to address his
                    questions directly to the person in whose head he observed any distinct
                    protuberance. We aré also told, that he was in the habit of collecting around
                    him the boys he met with in the streets of Vienna, and of inducing them, by
                    petty bribes, to confess their own faults, and betray those of their companions.
                    He excited them, for instance, to fight together, in order to discover which
                    possessed most courage, and thence drew inferences as to the organ which
                    prompted that sentiment. In order to obtain more precise data for his
                    conclusions, he endeavoured to procure models of the more remarkable heads that
                    he met with, and generally got permission from the individuals themselves to
                    take a cast of their heads in plaster of Paris. The Count of Sauran, then
                    minister of police at Vienna, gave him material assistance in effecting these
                    objects; and he was thus in no long time in possession of a very large
                    collection of casts, all bearing more or less upon the several points of his
                    theory. If he happened to hear of the death of any one whose head he had already
                    moulded, he was at great pains to procure his skull, that he might compare the
                    form of its different parts with the shape of the head during life. As it was
                    soon known that the doctor aimed chiefly at those who possessed some remarkable
                    talent, a very general alarm spread itself amongst the inhabitants of Vienna;
                    and not a few were pursued with the terror of being selected as the subjects of
                    cranioscopical investigation, and of their skulls being destined to make a
                    figure in his anatomical cabinet. The aged Mr. Denis, librarian to the emperor,
                    is said to have inserted an express clause in his will, to protect his head from
                    the keen scalpel of Dr. Gall. Notwithstanding these fears and precautions, he
                    contrived to amass an extensive collection of skulls, as well as of heads, in
                    illustration of his doctrines. He next availed himself of the aid of comparative
                    anatomy; and having no family to provide for, spared no expense in procuring
                    skulls of all sorts of animals, with a view of tracing the form and size of
                    corresponding organs throughout the whole series. Being physician to the
                    establishment for the <hi rend="italic">deaf and dumb</hi> at Vienna, he had
                    opportunities of observing the natural features of uncultivated minds, and the
                    various degrees in which they were susceptible of education. With the same view,
                    he used to call together into his house persons of the lowest class, such as
                    coachmen, and beggars in the street, and excite them to display their characters
                    before him. His professional practice made him acquainted with a great number of
                    families, and afforded him many opportunities of making valuable observations.
                    He neglected no means of instruction that could be derived from the inspection
                    of the heads of patients labouring under different forms of insanity. He was
                    physician to the director of establishments for education, and was allowed to
                    examine every child who excelled, or showed any remarkable disposition. He
                    visited the prisons and houses of correction, as well as the hospitals for
                    idiots and lunatics. He took casts of the heads of criminals, inquired into the
                    offences for which they were confined, and collected the history of their lives;
                    and thus derived from every quarter materials for bringing his theory to
                    perfection.</p>
                <p>As his observations multiplied, he became sensible that he had fallen into many
                    errors in the earlier periods of his inquiries, and was forced to give up many
                    of his favourite opinions, which he found had been too hastily adopted, with
                    regard to the general form of the head, as connected with«.</p>

                <p>the character of the individual. He felt the necessity of being in future more on
                    his guard, and resolved to institute a separate examination of the different
                    regions of the skull; and although he was here, also, frequently obliged to
                    shift his ground in assigning the function of each part, his researches were, on
                    the whole, attended with more uniform success. By degrees he acquired greater
                    confidence in the stability of his conclusions, and at length ventured to
                    announce them to the public, by the delivery of lectures on his new science. His
                    doctrines were eagerly received, and much canvassed at Vienna; but their fame
                    had no sooner reached the Austrian court, than a violent outcry was raised
                    against them by the bigoted priests, who controlled all the operations of that
                    weak and misguided government, and who represented these doctrines as tending to
                    materialism and atheism. The consequence of this senseless clamour was, that
                    Gall was interdicted from lecturing. But the number of those to whom he had
                    communicated the principles of his art, and in whom he had infused a strong
                    desire to continue to profit by his instructions, was by this time very
                    considerable, especially among the strangers who happened to be at Vienna. They
                    formed a strong party in his favour, and made such interest at court,
                    principally through the medium of the foreign ambassadors, that the doctor was
                    again permitted to resume his prelections, on condition that he delivered them
                    to foreigners only; as it was wisely considered that their being exposed to the
                    dangers of knowledge, would not be of any material consequence to the state, as
                    long as care was taken that the infection did not spread farther; the emperor
                    kindly preserving the bliss of ignorance for the exclusive enjoyment of his
                    Austrian subjects.</p>
                <p>It was long before Gall committed himself by writing on the subject that had
                    procured him so much celebrity. He merely announced, in 1798, in a letter
                    addressed to Baron Retzer, which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Deutsche
                    Merkur</hi> of Wieland, his design of publishing a large work on the new theory,
                    of which he affords his readers only an imperfect glimpse. A detailed account
                    was afterwards given by Μ. Froreiss, one of his pupils, in the second volume of
                    Voight’s <hi rend="italic">Magazin</hi><hi rend="italic">Physique</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and an amusing outline appeared from the pen of Μ. Charles
                    Villers, in a letter addressed to Cuvier. Various surreptitious copies of his
                    lectures were also circulated throughout the protestant states of Germany, where
                    they excited so much curiosity, that Dr. Gall was at length induced to make a
                    tour for the purpose of delivering them himself at the principal universities in
                    the north of Germany. With this view he visited Dresden, Berlin, Hallé, Jena,
                    Weimar, Göttingen, Hamburgh, &amp;c. and every where met with the most
                    flattering reception, being invited to the several courts of the states through
                    which he passed, and treated with the honours due to a distinguished literary
                    character. By frequenting the first societies, and conversing with the best
                    informed persons, he had ample opportunities of extending his observations, and
                    he was attentive to improve these opportunities to the utmost of his power. Dr.
                    Spurzheim, who had at an early period been associated with him in these
                    inquiries, and who had devoted himself particularly to the anatomical researches
                    they comprised, accompanied him in this tour, and participated in all his
                    labours. Dr. Gall at length settled in Paris, where he continued his pursuits
                    and lectures, and united with them the practice of his profession.</p>
                <p>In 1810 Drs. Gall and Spurzheim published, in conjunction, the first volume, in
                    quarto, of the work they had announced, and which was to contain a full account
                    of their doctrines, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Anatomie et Physiologie

                    in 1812. This work, together with the one published in 1815, by Dr. Spurzheim,

                    account of their system. Information on the subject may, however, be derived
                    from the following books, besides those of Froreiss and Villers, already
                    mentioned. The best of the foreign works is that of Professor Bischoff, entitled

                    <hi rend="italic">Some Account of Dr. GalΓs new Theory of Physiognomy, founded
                    upon the Anatomy and Physiology of the Brain, and the Form of the Skull,</hi>
                    appeared in London in 1807, and is chiefly taken from Dr. Bischoff’s work,
                    including the critical strictures of Dr. Hufeland. Soon after the publication of
                    Dr. Spurzheim’s book, a small volume, principally reprinted from a short tract
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Pamphleteer,</hi> was given to the public by Mr. Thomas
                    Forster, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Sketch of the New Anatomy and
                    Physiology of the Brain and Nervous System of Drs. Gall and Spurzheim,
                    considered as comprehending a complete system of Zoonomy, with observations on
                    its tendency to the improvement of education, of punishment, and of the
                    treatment of insanity.</hi> Two pamphlets in opposition to these doctrines were
                    published by Professor Walter of Berlin, in 1805, of which, as well as of
                    Bischoff’s work, a short account is given in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Medical and Surgical Journal</hi> for July 1806. Dr. Spurzheim having conceived
                    that he was unfairly attacked in some of the Reviews, thought proper to publish
                    a reply, in a pamphlet which made its appearance at Edinburgh in 1817, entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Examination of the Objections made in Britain against the
                    Doctrines of Gall and Spurzheim.</hi> These, together with the lectures
                    delivered in London by Dr. Spurzheim, are the sources which have supplied the
                    materials for the following summary.</p>
                <p>It is laid down both by Gall and Spurzheim as the foundation of their doctrines,
                    that the nature of man, like that of all other created beings, is determinate,
                    and that the faculties with which he is endowed are <hi rend="italic"
                    >innate</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is, that they are implanted in him at
                    his first formation, and are not the result merely of the external circumstances
                    in which he may afterwards happen to be placed, nor of the wants and necessities
                    to which these circumstances may have given rise. They warn us that this opinion
                    is by no means at variance with that of Locke, who argues only against the
                    in-nateness of ideas, and not of the faculties or capacities of receiving ideas.
                    Education, doubtless, has a powerful influence in modifying and giving certain
                    directions to these faculties; but the faculties themselves, that is, the
                    capacities of feeling, of intellect, and of action, must have already
                    pre-existed before they could be called into play, and thus produce the various
                    phenomena which diversify the scene of human life. Savages have at different
                    times been found in woods destitute of all the ordinary faculties of rational
                    beings. Their resemblance to brutes has been supposed to be the consequence of
                    their total want of education; but, when we come to examine into their real
                    condition, we shall find that they are wretched beings, with great bodily
                    defects; for the most part deeply tainted with scrofula, and almost always
                    complete idiots. In general, they appear to have been abandoned in their
                    childhood by their parents, to whom they were burdensome. The pretended savage
                    of Aveyron, who was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497028"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-7028-0457"/>kept in the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb at
                    Paris, was almost completely idiotical. He was quite deaf, and his head and body
                    were incessantly in motion from side to side, even when he was sitting.</p>
                <p>In estimating the causes of that diversity which we see prevailing in the
                    characters and faculties of individuals, much has been ascribed to the influence
                    of diet, mode of living, and the impressions received in early infancy, while
                    the organs are yet tender, and highly susceptible of every kind of external
                    influence. But the operation of these causes, as well as the power of education
                    in general, is much too limited to explain the immense differences we observe
                    among different men, and even among different children of the same family.
                    Helvetius and other bold metaphysicians have maintained the paradox, that all
                    men are born originally the same, and are moulded into what they afterwards
                    become solely by the force of external circumstances. Genius, according to this
                    doctrine, is a mere creature of the fancy, and originally belongs no more to one
                    man than to another. Train all men alike, and their powers, their attainments,
                    and their actions, will all be similar. Accident, more than design or
                    premeditation, has fixed the destinies of great men, as well as disposed of
                    those who are unknown to fame. “Demosthenes,” say these philosophers, “became
                    eloquent, because he heard an oration of Callistratus, whose eloquence made so
                    deep an impression on his mind, that he aspired only to acquire this talent.
                    Vaucanson excelled in mathematics, because, being obliged, when a child, to stay
                    alone in the waiting room of his mother’s confessor, he found there a clock,
                    examined its wheels, and endeavoured, with the help of a bad knife, to make a
                    similar machine of wood. He succeeded; and one step leading on to another, he
                    arrived at the construction of his wonderful automatons. Milton would not have
                    composed his <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> had he not been deprived of
                    his place of secretary to Cromwell. Shakspeare composed his tragedies because he
                    was an actor, and he became an actor because he was forced to leave his native
                    place on account of some juvenile errors. Corneille fell in love, made verses
                    for the object of his passion, and thence became a great poet. An apple fell
                    from a tree at the feet of Newton, while Re was in a contemplative mood: this
                    event, so trivial in itself, led him to the theory of gravitation.” Reflections
                    of a similar kind are often met with in the writings of poets and moralists.
                    Those contained in Gray’s <hi rend="italic">Elegy</hi> must be familiar to all
                    our readers. Dr. Johnson considered talents or genius as a thing that, when once
                    existing, might be directed any way. Newton, he thought, might have become a
                    Shakspeare, for, said he, a man who can run fifty miles to the south, can run
                    fifty miles to the north.</p>
                <p>Yet these are but the ingenious speculations of the theorist, more calculated to
                    dazzle than to convince, and obviously in contradiction with the daily
                    experience of mankind. Original differences in the constitution of the mind
                    exist as certainly as in that of the body; and doubtless are dependent upon
                    differences in organization. Children often show, from their earliest infancy,
                    the germs of those peculiarities of character which adhere to them through life,
                    which hardly any education can alter, and which no condition of life or
                    variation of circumstances can afterwards affect. It is needless to expatiate on
                    the subject of the diversities of intellectual powers exhibited by different
                    individuals under the very same circumstances of birth and education;
                    diversities which, as we have already seen, first directed the mind of Dr. Gall
                    to his physiognomical researches. Many of these peculiarities are unquestionably
                    derived from the parent, and are observed to prevail in certain families, and to
                    descend through several successive generations.</p>
                <p>That no sensation, or other affection of the mind, and that no operation of
                    intellect can take place without a certain condition of the nervous system, is a
                    position established by so many direct proofs, that its truth must be generally
                    admitted. The question becomes more difficult when we come to inquire what part
                    of the system it is that exercises these functions. It is quite clear that the
                    sentient principle does not reside in the nerves, or in the part which receives
                    the first impression from the external cause of sensation. The opinion which has
                    been embraced by many physiologists, and particularly Bichat, that while the
                    brain is the organ of the intellectual faculties, the nerves of the great
                    viscera of the abdomen and thorax are the seat of the moral sentiments, is at
                    variance with a multitude of facts in comparative anatomy. There are animals
                    endowed with the faculties ascribed to these nervous plexuses, or ganglions of
                    the great sympathetic nerves, distributed to certain viscera, which have not the
                    viscera in question. On the other hand, most quadrupeds have viscera analogous
                    in their whole structure to those in man, without having the faculties of which
                    in man it is pretended they are the seat. We have a complete series of proofs
                    that the nerves, of themselves, and without an uninterrupted continuity with the
                    brain, can produce neither sensation nor voluntary motion. Compression of the
                    brain, by any cause, produces an entire suspension of all sensation and
                    consciousness, and puts a complete stop to every operation of intellect. All the
                    other parts of the body, on the other hand, may be wounded or destroyed, and
                    even the nervous mass of the spinal marrow may be compressed or injured, at a
                    certain distance from the brain, without the immediate destruction of the
                    feelings and intellectual faculties. In tetanus, produced by a cause remote from
                    the brain, the other nervous systems are affected in the most violent manner,
                    while the functions of the mind continue unimpaired.</p>
                <p>In children, Dr. Spurzheim observes, the brain is yet pulpy, and the faculties
                    imperfect; its growth accompanies their improvement; its maturity marks their
                    greatest degree of vigour. If its developement has been considerable, the
                    manifestations of these powers are energetic; if small, they are comparatively
                    weak. In proportion as the organization of the brain decreases, the strength of
                    the moral sentiments and intellectual faculties decreases also. If the
                    developement of the brain take place too early or too late, the faculties
                    exhibit corresponding variations. Certain faculties are more active in men, and
                    others in women, according to the difference of their cerebral organization; and
                    peculiarities of character are hereditary, according as the corresponding
                    organization of the brain, on which they depend, is propagated from parents to
                    their children.</p>
                <p>Although many facts show that considerable injuries may be sustained by the brain
                    without detriment to the mental faculties, yet as a general principle, it is
                    contended by Dr. Spurzheim, that these faculties are weakened or destroyed in
                    proportion as the brain is mechanically altered. It is, however, certain, that
                    physiologists are by no means agreed as to this point; and that innumerable
                    cases might be quoted in direct contradiction to this principle. These are
                    attempted to be explained away by the general supposition, that most of them are
                    the result of very inaccurate observations, in which the statement of the facts
                    has been distorted and vitiated by ignorance, prejudice, or credulity; and that
                    the rest are inconclusive as to the general question, from the observers not
                    being aware of the real functions of the injured parts, and being inattentive to
                    the circumstance, that almost all the parts of the brain being double, the loss
                    of those on one side would scarcely be felt, as long as the corresponding organs
                    on the other side remained entire. On the other hand, it should be recollected,
                    that a derangement in an organ may occur of such a nature as that our senses
                    cannot enable us to discover it. How often is this exemplified in fatal diseases
                    of the nervous system, such as hydrophobia, tetanus, and atonic gout. Analogy
                    shows us other parts where apparently no proportion is pre <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193497041" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7041-0458"/>served between the injury and
                    the derangement of function. Sometimes large abscesses are met with in the lungs
                    without much disturbance of the function of respiration; and ossification of the
                    heart, without any sensible affection of the circulation. In persons possessed
                    of great irritability, very slight wounds of the brain may produce serious
                    effects, while considerable wounds in others, who are less irritable, shall be
                    attended with no bad consequences. This consideration will go a great way
                    towards explaining the fact, that in many cases of insanity, instead of our
                    discovering any change in the brain, a diseased state has been observed in the
                    liver, the bowels, and other viscera; and may serve as an answer to the
                    assertions and objections of Pinel, who states that the most accurate
                    dissections have not taught us any thing with regard to the seat of mental
                    alienation, and that we have no sufficient data to conclude, from diseases of
                    the brain, that it is exclusively the organ of the intellectual faculties.</p>
                <p>Those who have opposed the theory of the subserviency of the brain to the
                    operations of mind, have laid great stress upon an argument derived from the
                    phenomena of hydrocephalus. In patients afflicted with this disease, the brain
                    appears to be destroyed and replaced by water; and yet the intellectual and
                    moral faculties have remained perfect to the last. Drs. Gall and Spurzheim
                    conceive, that the facts have been very erroneously represented; and that the
                    only alteration which the brain sustains in these cases, is a displacement of
                    its parts, and not an absorption of its substance. The effused fluid, by
                    accumulating in the ventricles, gradually unfolds the convolutions of the
                    hemispheres of the brain, and expands them to such a degree, that they are
                    reduced to a thin stratum of substance, constituting a sort of bag, within which
                    the fluid is still contained. This stratum of brain is sometimes not more than a
                    line in thickness, and is generally lacerated in attempting the dissection; in
                    which case the water rushes out, the real structure escapes notice, and the
                    fluid is erroneously supposed to have been accumulated between the brain and its
                    membranes.</p>
                <p>It has been advanced, as another objection to the same theory, that monsters are
                    sometimes born without any brain, who yet suck and perform various movements.
                    Actions of this kind, however, are purely automatic, and appear to be unattended
                    with consciousness; with such actions the brain has no concern whatever. Some
                    have founded their opposition to the theory, on the result of some experiments
                    of Duverney on pigeons, which, it is alleged, continued to perform all their
                    animal functions after the whole of the brain had been removed from the skull.
                    But Dr. Spurzheim, on repeating these experiments on birds and rabbits, found,
                    indeed, that the destruction of the superior parts of the brain does not destroy
                    the functions of the five senses and of voluntary motion, but that it is
                    impossible to take out all the cerebral mass without killing the animal. As soon
                    as the <hi rend="italic">corpora striata</hi> and optic <hi rend="italic"
                    >thalami</hi> are wounded, convulsions and death ensue; consequently he does not
                    hesitate to pronounce the account given by Duverney to be entirely false. He, in
                    like manner, wholly discredits the stories related by Morgagni, Zacutus,
                    Lusitanus, Bartholine, Haller, Vallisneri, Moreschi, Giro, Dr. Simson,
                    Soëmmerring, and others, concerning petrified or ossified brains being found in
                    individuals, without prejudice to the exercise of their intellectual faculties.
                    He admits it to be doubtful, how far, in perfect animals, the brain may be
                    necessary to the passive consciousness of the external senses; but deems it
                    certain, that the exertions of the will, including voluntary motion and
                    reflection, depend entirely upon the brain; no phenomenon of this kind ever
                    taking place without that organ.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Concluding, therefore, that the brain is the organ
                    of the sensitive, the intellectual, and the moral faculties, we have next to
                    inquire, whether these faculties are exercised in common by the whole, or any
                    particular portion of the brain, or whether, on the other hand, they are more
                    especially the offices of different parts of that organ. Dr. Gall adopts the
                    latter of these opinions, and upon this view of the subject is the whole of his
                    system founded. The following is the reasoning on which be builds it.</p>
                <p>Physiologists, influenced by the metaphysical tenets of the schools, have often
                    maintained, that the soul, being simple, its material residence must be simple
                    also, and that all the nerves must end in one point; or, which amounts to the
                    same, that they can have but one common origin, because each individual has but
                    one soul. Bonnet, Haller, and others, who had extended its seat to the whole
                    substance of the brain, were opposed by these metaphysicians, who did not
                    reflect that a little more or less room could not enable them to explain any
                    better the nature of the soul; nor that, as Van Swicten and Tiedemann remark, a
                    material point, in which all ideas and sensations should centre, is
                    inconceivable, in consequence of the confusion and disorder that would result
                    from such an arrangement. It appears ridiculous, indeed, that the physiologist,
                    to whom all nature is open, should direct his researches and inductions by the
                    guidance of such frivolous speculations. Great pains were, however, taken to
                    determine this central point, or <hi rend="italic">sensorium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">commune</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it is enough to enumerate
                    the various and contradictory opinions that have been held with regard to it, in
                    order to be satisfied of the utter futility of this research. Descartes, in his
                    treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Passions,</hi> labours to prove that the soul
                    is concentrated in the pineal gland. This hypothesis continued in fashion for
                    some time, till it found an enemy in a follower of Descartes, the Dutch
                    physician Boutekoe, who dislodged the soul from its narrow watch-tower in the
                    pineal gland, and confined it in the more spacious prison of the <hi
                    rend="italic">corpus callosum.</hi> Lancisi, Maria, and La Peyronie,
                    successively declared themselves in favour of this new opinion; and the latter
                    of these anatomists wrote a memoir in support of it, which was printed by the
                    Academy of Sciences in 1741, and which has since been republished separately.
                    Digby next transferred the soul to the <hi rend="italic">septum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lucidum</hi> in place of the <hi rend="italic">corpus
                    callosum.</hi> Vieussens allowed it greater latitude, assigning for its
                    boundaries those of the <hi rend="italic">centrum ovale</hi> of the medullary
                    substance. Willis, again, restricted it to the <hi rend="italic">corpora
                    striata</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Serveto, to the aqueduct of Sylvius.
                    Wharton and Schellhammer placed it in the commencement of the spinal marrow;
                    Mol-inetti and Wrisberg in the <hi rend="italic">pons Varolii</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> Crusius and Meig in the origin of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >medulla oblongata</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whilst Drelincourt and others
                    lodged it altogether in the cerebellum. Lastly, Soëmmerring imagined the soul to
                    reside in the serosity which moistens the inner surface of the ventricles, to
                    which he had traced the extremities of many nerves from the organs of sense; and
                    conceives that the different motions or oscillations of this fluid are the
                    immediate material cause of our sensations.</p>
                <p>Discarding the notion that the functions of sense and intellect are concentrated
                    in any particular point or portion of the brain, let us next examine the opinion
                    that all the faculties are exercised by the whole mass of brain considered as
                    one organ. We may, in the first place, remark, that the analogy of other parts
                    of the system is adverse to this hypothesis. Every different secretion has its
                    appropriate gland, the offices of which are never interchanged. The liver never
                    secrets urine, nor the kidneys bile. The five external senses are distinct and
                    independent of one another. Every where do we observe that nature, in order to
                    produce various effects, has varied the material organs. The structure of the
                    brain in its different parts, is far from being simple and uniform; it is
                    composed of two substances; the one soft, pulpy, and ash-coloured; the other
                    white, opaque, and fibrous in its texture. The fibres of the latter run parallel
                    to each other, having, at the same time, various collateral connexions, but by
                    no means uniting in any one central part <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497054"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-7054-0459"/>which can be considered as their common origin or
                    termination. The parts of the brain are numerous, and distinct from one another,
                    bearing evidence of a very complex and artificial construction. They are
                    constant in their general arrangement in different subjects, shewing in this
                    respect a striking contrast with the distribution of blood-vessels, or even the
                    disposition of the muscles and viscera, in which it is so common to meet with
                    variations. Comparative, as well as human anatomy, furnishes strong analogical
                    arguments in favour of a plurality of the cerebral organs, corresponding to the
                    plurality of faculties. However defective may be our knowledge of the structure
                    of these organs in the lower animals, still a general comparison of their
                    faculties, as we ascend in the scale of being, shows us that the number of these
                    faculties increases in proportion as the cerebral parts are multiplied. The
                    immense augmentation of the powers of intellect which we behold in man, when
                    compared with the limited instincts of animals, is neither in proportion to the
                    increased size of the five external senses, nor of any other part of the body,
                    but to the increase of the cerebral organs only. It is the great size of the
                    hemispheres of the brain, more especially, that characterizes this organ in man,
                    and establishes its superiority, as an instrument of intellect, over that of all
                    other animals. Man unites in himself all the organs which are variously
                    scattered and distributed among the brute creation; but he has also organs in
                    his brain, which no other animal besides himself possesses; and these are the
                    seats of faculties of a higher order, peculiar to him alone.</p>
                <p>'Considerations arising from the differences in the proportional energy with
                    which the faculties manifest themselves in different individuals, are also in
                    favour of the plurality and independence of the organs. If the brain were one
                    simple organ of mind, and alike instrumental in all its faculties and
                    operations, wherever we met with any one faculty in a state of high energy, we
                    must suppose the whole organ adapted to produce this degree of energy, and ought
                    to expect its other operations to be equally energetic. Yet we may find the same
                    individual remarkably deficient in other faculties, which are equally dependent
                    on this organ. One person shall excel in verbal memory, while he cannot combine
                    two ideas philosophically; another is a great painter, but a bad musician, or a
                    wretched poet; another is a good poet, but a bad general. If the brain be a
                    single instrument, it cannot be at once both weak and strong; it cannot exhibit
                    one faculty in its perfection, and another in a very limited extent. But all
                    difficulty vanishes if we admit it to be an assemblage of many organs; for the
                    combinations of these organs may be as infinitely diversified as the actions and
                    powers of man. The argument derives additional force from the readiness with
                    which this theory may be applied to explain the diversity of character we meet
                    with in the brute creation, and especially to the varieties of disposition
                    observable among some of our domestic animals, which, under the same
                    circumstances of education, exhibit such different qualities. In like manner,
                    the diversity of character in the same individual, at different periods of his
                    life, are most readily explicable on the supposition of distinct organs, which
                    have their respective periods of growth, maturity, and decline. The analogy of
                    the external senses is also strongly in favour of the same doctrine. Thus the
                    taste and smell appear earlier than the senses of seeing and hearing, because
                    their respective organs are earlier developed. This reasoning will be confirmed
                    when it is found, as will afterwards be shown, that the proportional size of the
                    different parts of the brain is very different in different individuals. Is it
                    not, therefore, reasonable to suppose, that the different energies of the
                    several functions of the mind are connected with these differences in the
                    structure of the organs which respectively produce them?</p>
                <p>The faculties of animal life are incapable of long continu ed exertion; rest is
                    necessary for the renovation of their powers. Fatigue is the consequence of the
                    prolonged action of the muscles of voluntary motion; but when one set of muscles
                    are fatigued, the power of others is still unimpaired, and they are ready to be
                    employed in a different action, without any additional fatigue. When we have
                    been long sitting, we are relieved by standing; and even the bed-ridden find
                    ease from a change of posture. Our eyes, in like manner, may be fatigued by
                    looking at pictures; but we can then listen to music, because there is one organ
                    for seeing, and another for hearing. It is well known that study, long
                    protracted, produces fatigue; but we can continue to study, provided we change
                    the object of attention. If the brain were a single organ, the whole of which is
                    employed in performing all the functions of mind, a new form of study should
                    increase instead of relieving the sense of fatigue. Thus the analogy is complete
                    between the phenomena of mental and bodily exertion. Are we not, then, justified
                    in extending it to the instruments by which these operations of mind and body
                    are effected?</p>
                <p>The phenomena of sleep are also readily accounted for on this hypothesis. During
                    this state all the organs do not remain inactive; but sometimes a particular
                    organ enters into action, and this constitutes dreaming. The state of vigilance
                    is that in which the will can put in action the organs of intellectual
                    faculties, of the five senses, and of voluntary motion; but it is incorrect to
                    define it as the state in which all these organs are active, for it is
                    impossible that all the faculties should be active at the same moment.
                    Somnambulism may be regarded as a state of still more incomplete sleep, or one
                    in which several organs are watching. If, during sleep, the action of the brain
                    is partial and is propagated to the muscles, locomotion takes place; if to the
                    vocal organs, the sleeping person speaks. All this may take place in different
                    degrees. Some persons dream and speak in their sleep; others dream, speak, hear,
                    and answer; others, besides dreaming, rise, walk, and do various things. This
                    latter state is called somnambulism; that is, the state of walking during sleep.
                    Now as the ear can hear, so the eyes may see, while the other organs sleep; and
                    there are undoubted facts which prove that several persons in the state of
                    somnambulism have seen; but it has always been with the eyes open. There are
                    also convulsive fits in which the patients see without hearing, or <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Some somnambulists do things of which they are
                    not capable in a state of watching; and dreaming persons reason sometimes better
                    than they do when awake. This phenomenon is not astonishing. If we wish to
                    reflect upon any subject, we avoid noise, and all external impressions; we cover
                    the eyes with our hands, and we put to rest a great number of organs, in order
                    to concentrate all vital power in one, or in a few. In the state of dreaming and
                    somnambulism this naturally happens; consequently the manifestations of the
                    active organs are then more perfect and more energetic; the sensations are more
                    lively, and the reflections deeper than in a state of watching.</p>
                <p>States of disease are also adduced as proving the plurality of the cerebral
                    organs. In many cases of insanity we find only one faculty deranged, whilst all
                    the rest are in a perfectly sound state. Lunatics, on the other hand, are met
                    with, who are reasonable only while pursuing some particular train of thought.
                    There was a chemist, for instance, who was insane on every subject except
                    chemistry. An embroiderer, during her paroxyms of insanity, while uttering the
                    greatest absurdities, calculated correctly how much stuff was necessary to such
                    or such a piece of work. The effects of blows, or other injuries on the head,
                    supply facts of a similar kind, which afford still more convincing proofs that
                    the brain is susceptible of being very partially affected. Some persons lose
                    from this cause the memory of proper names, while they preserve the memory of
                    words <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497067" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7067-0460"/>which
                    indicate the qualities of objects. One Lereard of Marseilles, after having
                    received a blow from a foil in the orbit, lost entirely the memory of names;
                    sometimes he did not recollect those of his intimate friends, or even of his
                    father. Cuvier, in his historical eulogium on Broussonet, states that this
                    celebrated botanist, after having recovered from an apoplectic fit, never could
                    recollect proper names nor substantives, though he had recovered his prodigious
                    memory with respect to other objects. He knew plants, their figure, leaves, and
                    colours; he recollected the adjectives, but could never recover the generic
                    substantives by which they were designated. These and similar instances of
                    partial affections of the faculties support the supposition of their being owing
                    to different conditions of various parts of the brain subservient to these
                    faculties.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the doctrine that different portions of the brain exercise different
                    mental functions, is countenanced by numerous authorities in former as well as
                    in modern times. It is expressly stated in the writings of Boerhaave, Van
                    Swicten, Haller, Prochaska, Soëmmerring, &amp;c.; and the Academy of Dijon long
                    ago proposed it as a prize-question, to determine the situation of these
                    different cerebral organs. Charles Bonnet, indeed, went the length of
                    maintaining that each fibre of the brain is a particular organ of the soul.</p>
                <p>It seems hardly necessary to expose the absurdity of the accusation that these
                    doctrines tend particularly to materialism, although the dread of such a
                    consequence has been sanctioned by royal edicts. There are two opinions only,
                    which, in respect to this question, stand opposed to each other; namely, that
                    which asserts perception to take place by the intervention of a material organ,
                    and that which asserts it to take place immediately by the energies of the mind
                    itself, or at least without the intervention of the body. The doctrines of Gall
                    are unquestionably incompatible with this last opinion, that is, with pure
                    immaterialism, which may in fact be regarded as denying the existence of matter
                    altogether. This sceptical spiritualism can be avoided only by the admission of
                    the necessity of a material organ; and if this be admitted, any modification of
                    such opinion, that does not exclude mind as the ultimate percipient, must be
                    equally remote from absolute materialism. The immaterialist believes that it is
                    the soul which secs and the soul which hears, as much as that it is the soul
                    which judges and the soul which imagines; and since he does not condemn, as
                    impious, the allotment of different organs of sight and hearing, what greater
                    heresy is there in the allotment of different parts of the sensorium, as the
                    organs of judgment and imagination? If, indeed, any one were to say, that the
                    affections of these parts are themselves judgment and imagination, he would be a
                    materialist; but he would be as much a materialist, if he should say, that the
                    affections of the organs of sight and hearing are themselves the ideas of colour
                    and sound.</p>
                <p>Supposing it, then, established that each function of the mind is exercised by a
                    separate portion of the brain, let us next inquire whether observation can
                    furnish us with any means of determining the precise nature of the function, to
                    which each particular organ is subservient. Although it is clear that the
                    adaptation of each organ to the performance of its office, must be wholly
                    dependent on its particular organization, yet it is equally evident that no
                    consideration of its general structure as shewn to us by anatomy, can teach us
                    <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> what such function really is, and still less
                    what may be its degree of energy, or its peculiar quality and modifications. The
                    energy of the function must in all cases depend on certain conditions of the
                    organ, such as the perfection of its original constitution, its elaborate
                    texture, its relative size, and the degree of exercise it has received; and will
                    also be regulated by the influence which other faculties may exert on its
                    operations. The only one· among these conditions, which is open to observation,
                    is the relative size of the organ. In general, we find that the properties of
                    bodies act with an energy proportionate to their size. A large loadstone
                    attracts a greater mass of iron than a small loadstone. A large muscle, in like
                    manner, is stronger than a small one. If the nerves of the external senses be
                    larger on one side of the body, the functions on that side are also stronger.
                    Comparative physiology shews us that the olfactory, optic, and auditory nerves
                    of those animals which are distinguished for the excellence of their smell,
                    sight, or hearing, are marked by being numerous and large, evincing a more
                    elaborate developement. The coincidence is so uniform as to justify the general
                    inference, that wherever any organ is met with in a higher state of
                    developement, we may there expect to find the power dependent on it increased in
                    energy in the same proportion. May not this analogy be fairly extended to the
                    organs which compose the brain? Our present object, it must be recollected, is
                    not to determine every degree of activity existing in a’ cerebral part, but
                    merely the <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> of its function; and for this purpose
                    the indication afforded by its comparative size, in different cases, will
                    suffice.</p>
                <p>We may observe in different individuals a considerable variation in the
                    proportional devclopement of different parts of the brain. It is reasonable to
                    suppose, that the functions which are more developed in one person than in
                    others, will be more active, and manifest themselves with more energy, than
                    those which are less developed. Those which are comparatively small we may
                    expect to be less active, and their powers more feebly exerted. Let us then
                    select as the subjects of observation such persons as are marked by strong
                    peculiarities of mind or character, and especially such as are endowed with a
                    partial genius, as it is called; that is, who manifest in a very high degree any
                    particular faculty of mind: let us note the peculiarities in the form of their
                    heads, and observe what organs in them are of an unusually large size. By
                    repeated comparisons we shall arrive at the knowledge of the particular organ in
                    which that faculty resides. The converse method, <hi rend="smallcaps">oh</hi>
                    the other hand, must be pursued with those who betray a singular deficiency of
                    power in any faculty. With such persons we must endeavour to discover what
                    particular part of the brain exhibits an imperfect developement. The results of
                    both these modes of determining the functions of each organ, when compared
                    together, will correct, and, if just, will ultimately corroborate each other.
                    Experience, multiplied and extended, will finally confirm and establish our
                    conclusions, and complete the system in all its parts.</p>
                <p>But the living brain can never be exposed to observation, and, from the nature of
                    its substance, loses much of its form and texture soon after death. It may
                    appear impossible to discover the form or size of particular parts of the brain
                    during life, since the whole mass is inclosed in the bony case of the skull, of
                    which the thickness varies in different parts; and since the skull itself cannot
                    be immediately inspected, being covered by muscles and integuments, which, by
                    contributing to smooth all the inequalities of its surface, must preclude us
                    from forming an exact estimate of its real shape. This obvious objection to the
                    proposed inquiry, Drs. Gall and Spurzhcim labour to remove by the following
                    considerations. If we attend to the successive stages of the growth of the
                    skull, we find that its ossification begins at different points; and the bony
                    processes extend in divergent lines, adapting themselves exactly to the form and
                    size of the cerebral parts they are destined to inclose and protect. Whatever
                    violence may be done to the bones of the skull during birth, they soon return to
                    their natural state, partly from their elasticity, and partly from the inherent
                    powers of the brain, which tend constantly to restore its original shape. The
                    compression<pb break="no" facs="nls:193497080" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7080-0461"/> of
                    the brain is besides of too transient a nature to produce any permanent change
                    in the primitive forms either of the skull or of the brain. If it ever amounted
                    to what could irrecoverably derange the organization, and hinder its future
                    developement, the necessary consequence of such a degree of violence would be
                    death or idiocy.</p>
                <p>In the progress of its growth, the increasing dimensions of the skull keep pace
                    with those of the brain. All the cerebral parts do not increase simultaneously;
                    and this partial developement is equally observable in the skull. The forehead,
                    for instance, which at birth is narrow and flat, grows wider and more prominent
                    from the age of three months to that of eight or ten years. After this period,
                    the middle part of the forehead is less developed in proportion to the other
                    parts. The neck of the child is very small, because the cerebellum, which is
                    situated at the inferior occipital <hi rend="italic">fossae,</hi> is not yet
                    developed; but in proportion as this organ increases in size, the skull grows
                    prominent at that part. The same happens with all the other cerebral parts which
                    increase progressively. The shape of the skull cannot be in any degree
                    influenced by external causes, such as occasional pressure in one direction, as
                    happens in carrying burdens on the head, or artificial modelling of the heads of
                    infants, as is asserted to be practised among the Caribs and other savage
                    nations. In other parts of the body we may remark, that whatever soft parts are
                    inclosed in bones, the shape of the latter is adapted to the dimensions of the
                    former, and is regulated by the changes they undergo; the ribs, and even the
                    spine, yield to the pressure of an abscess, or the enlargement of an aneurism;
                    and the bones of the face, in like manner, make way for the increase of tumours,
                    and adapt themselves to the new form these render necessary. By experience in
                    feeling the living head, we may readily learn to distinguish the form of the
                    bones which lie beneath the integuments. The observation of the shape of the
                    skull, or of the head, is therefore capable of giving us exact information as to
                    the relative size and shape of the different parts of the brain, and on the
                    knowledge thus obtained is founded the art of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cranioscopy.</hi></p>
                <p>In practising this method, however, it is necessary to guard against several
                    sources of error. We must take into account several protuberances, which belong
                    to the natural state of the skull, and which had some particular destinations
                    foreign to the immediate functions of the brain; such as the mastoid processes
                    behind the ears, the crucial spine of the occiput, the zygomatic processes, and
                    the frontal sinuses. The cerebral parts, situated behind the orbits, indeed,
                    require some exercise on the part of the organos-cope, in order to be exactly
                    determined. The developement may be perceived by the configuration and position
                    of the eyes, and by the circumference of the orbits. It is therefore necessary
                    to examine whether the eyeball is prominent or hidden in the orbit, whether it
                    is depressed or pushed sideward, inward, or outward. According to this position
                    of the eyeball, we may judge that such or such parts of the brain, which is
                    situated against such or such part of the orbit, is more or less developed. The
                    functions of those organs, which lie wholly at the basis of the brain, can be
                    ascertained only by examination after death.</p>
                <p>It may be objected, that the organs are not confined to the surface, or
                    convolutions of the brain; but although this be the case, and although they
                    really extend from the surface to the basis of the brain, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >medulla oblongata,</hi> yet the degree in which they are expanded at the
                    surface, where they form the convolutions, will indicate, in general, the
                    relative magnitude of the whole organ. The analogy of the five senses, of which
                    the peripheric expansions indicate the developement of their respective nerves,
                    shews the reasonableness of this supposition. From a large eye, implying a large
                    retina, or peripheric expansion of the optic nerve, we naturally infer that the
                    nerve itself is of considerable magnitude: may we not draw the same conclusion
                    with regard to the organs of the moral sentiments and intellectual faculties,
                    whenever we find that the convolutions, which are their peripheric expansions,
                    are much developed?</p>
                <p>In feeling for the organ, Dr. Gall recommends the use, not of the fingers, but of
                    the middle of the palm of the hand; and declares that habit, as well as a
                    certain natural delicacy of tact, is necessary to qualify a person to make these
                    observations with certainty of success. We are warned, also, to confine our
                    observations to young and grown-up persons in the flower of their age; for at an
                    advanced period of life the brain diminishing by degrees, and retiring from the
                    skull, leads to the recession of its inner table, and consequent inequality in
                    its thickness, which renders it impossible to judge exactly of the size or shape
                    of brain from that of the head. Analogous changes occur in the skulls of some
                    lunatics, and occasion similar difficulties in applying the rules of
                    cranioscopy. It is also to be considered, that our aim is to distinguish the
                    size, and not the mere prominence of each organ. If one organ be much developed
                    and the neighbouring organ very little, the developed organ presents an
                    elevation or protuberance, but if the neighbouring organs be developed in
                    proportion, no protuberance can be perceived, and the surface is smooth.</p>
                <p>We have already stated the mode in which Dr. Gall proceeded to apply and to
                    verify these principles; it is now time that we should present our readers with
                    the result of his labours.</p>
                <p>He aιτanges the faculties of the mind, with their corresponding organs, according
                    as they relate to the feelings and to the intellect: the first class
                    comprehending the <hi rend="italic">propensities,</hi> all which are common to
                    men and animals, and the <hi rend="italic">sentiments,</hi> which constitute
                    what the French denominate <hi rend="italic">tame,</hi> and the Germans <hi
                    rend="italic">gemuth;</hi> and the second class comprising the faculties by
                    which we acquire knowledge, or the <hi rend="italic">knowing faculties,</hi> as
                    he terms them; and also the <hi rend="italic">reflecting faculties,</hi> which
                    last compose what the French call <hi rend="italic">V esprit,</hi> the Germans
                    <hi rend="italic">gkeist,</hi> and what we should generally understand by the
                    term <hi rend="italic">intellect.</hi> He finds that the organs of those
                    faculties which men possess in common with animals, are situated towards the
                    basis and back part of the brain; while those of the superior faculties, which
                    are peculiar to man, are placed somewhat higher; and the organs subservient to
                    the intellectual faculties occupy exclusively the forehead. The total number of
                    special faculties is thirty-three, as may be seen by the following
                    enumeration.</p>
                <p>1. Of the faculties common to men and animals, the first is that physical
                    propensity which has for its final purpose the continuance of the species. The
                    cerebellum, a part which occupies the lowest situation in the encephalon, is
                    affirmed to be the organ, the actions of which give rise to this propensity.
                    Accident led Dr. Gall to this discovery, by his noticing the size of the back of
                    the neck in a lady whose character, in respect to this passion, was not
                    equivocal: and subsequent observation on an extensive scale, both in the human
                    subject and in the lower animals, have abundantly confirmed him in his opinion.
                    The following are the leading arguments on which he has rested it. First, the
                    great size of the organ indicates the importance of the function to which it is
                    subservient, and there is no cause, except the existence of such an organ in the
                    brain, that is adequate to account for this propensity. The function of
                    copulation takes place only in those animals which have a nervous mass or
                    cerebellum. Throughout the whole class of quadrupeds, the neck of the male is
                    thicker than that of the female, as may be observed particularly in the bull,
                    the ram, and the stallion. It is also remarked that vigorous pigeons are
                    distinguished by the size of their necks.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497093" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7093-0462"/>
                <p>The developement of the cerebellum is simultaneous with that of the genital
                    organs at the period of puberty, and early castration prevents its developement,
                    as well as that of the beard, and the organs of the voice. Wounds of the neck
                    have been observed by Hippocrates to be sometimesfollowed by impotency. In other
                    cases, however, they produce erotic excitement. Apollonius Rhodius, in speaking
                    of the love of Medea, represents her as suffering a violent pain in the back of
                    her neck. A case occurred to Professor Reinhold, at Leipsig, in which an
                    excitement of the genital organs succeeded the introduction of a seton in the
                    neck, in a boy who laboured under ophthalmia. Spirituous frictions on the neck
                    in hysterical fits are very useful. Lastly, the position of the cerebellum is
                    supposed to prove its destination. After hunger and thirst, no fonction is more
                    necessary than that of propagating the species. This function is the most common
                    in animals after nutrition, and the cerebellum is in the inferior part of the
                    head. Hence it is probable, that it is destined to the propensity of
                    propagating, or that it is, as Dr. Spurzheim expresses it, the organ of <hi
                    rend="italic">amativeness.</hi></p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Philoprogenitiveness,</hi> or the love of progeny, the <hi
                    rend="italic">στοργή</hi> of the Greeks, has its seat in those convolutions of
                    the brain situated immediately above the hind part of the tentorium, and
                    corresponding, therefore, on the outside of the skull with the crucial spine of
                    the occiput. Dr. Gall had observed a distinct protuberance on this part of the
                    head in women, and comparing the skulls in his collection, found a similar
                    elevation on the skulls of children, and on those of monkies. During five years
                    he was in search of a faculty that was common to all the subjects of those
                    observations, and was in the habit of suggesting this difficulty to his
                    auditors. At length a clergyman who attended, observed that monkies have much
                    attachment to their progeny. The Doctor pursued this idea, and found that it
                    applied perfectly to the observed appearances, as the developement of this part
                    coincided always with the energy of this propensity. In animals it is generally
                    larger in the females than in the males of the same species. This rule holds
                    good in the human subject, although it is liable to occasional exceptions; for
                    there are men who manifest the strongest propensity to associate with children,
                    and in whom we accordingly find this organ larger than in the generality of
                    women. In negroes we find this organ more prominent than in Europeans. In the
                    cuckoo, the crocodile, and other animals to whom nature has not appointed the
                    office of rearing their progeny, this organ is extremely defective. The crime of
                    infanticide is more likely to be perpetrated by mothers in whom this organ is
                    deficient in size; and accordingly out of 29 women who were guilty of this
                    crime, Dr. Gall found 25 who had this organ extremely small. On the other hand,
                    a female, who, being seized with delirium during child-birth, imagined that she
                    was pregnant with five children, was found to have this organ unusually large.
                    It must, no doubt, have been of gigantic dimensions in the lady, who, stricken
                    by the curse of the gipsey whom she had refused to relieve, was impressed with
                    the belief that she was about to give birth to as many children as there are
                    days in the year·.</p>
                <p>3. The organ of <hi rend="italic">Inkabitiveness,</hi> or the propensity which
                    some animals, such as the chamois and the wild-goat, have to inhabit high
                    situations, is placed still higher in the occiput than the former, in a line
                    proceeding towards the top of the head. In animals of the same species which
                    live in low countries, we do not meet with an equal degree of protuberance in
                    this part of the brain, as is observable in those which prefer living in
                    elevated and mountainous districts. This is seen even in the rat, some varieties
                    of which choose for their dwelling corn-lofts or the higher parts of a house,
                    while others prefer living in the cellars. This faculty is not very active in
                    man; but Dr. Gall conceived that it was in him allied to pride and haughtiness.
                    Dr. Spurzheim, however, disclaims this doctrine; as he thinks it impossible to
                    confound the</p>
                <p>“instinct of physical height” with the moral sentiment of self love and pride.
                    Mr. Combe, conceiving that this organ has a more extensive sphere of action, and
                    that it confers the power of being conscious of every thing going on in the
                    mind, and of concentrating the attention, terms this power <hi rend="italic"
                    >Concentrativeness.</hi></p>
                <p>4. The organ of <hi rend="italic">Adhesiveness,</hi> or the propensity to attach,
                    ourselves to persons, animals, or other objects, is situated on each side of the
                    former, immediately under the <hi rend="italic">lambdoidal suture,</hi> and
                    gives a fullness to the lateral and posterior part of the head. This organ is
                    the source of friendship, moral love, society, marriage, and attachment of all
                    kinds. Dogs have it in an eminent degree, especially those races whose fidelity
                    and constancy are characteristic, as the terrier, spaniel, and lap-dog. It is
                    less prominent in the butcher’s dog, greyhound, and mastiff. It was very large
                    in a notorious highwayman at Vienna, distinguished equally as a robber and a
                    friend, and who chose rather to die than to betray his confederates.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Combativeness,</hi> or the propensity to fight, results from
                    the operation of an organ, situated immediately behind the ears on each side, at
                    a part corresponding to the posterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, and
                    behind the mastoid process. It is the seat of anger, as well as of pugnacity;
                    and its locality is fully established, in Dr. Gall’s estimation, by an extensive
                    series of facts. His first discovery of the seat of this faculty, was from his
                    observation of the head of the Austrian General Wurmser; and it was subsequently
                    confirmed by the experiments we have already mentioned which he made on boys he
                    had collected from the street. The breadth of the occiput is a criterion of the
                    spirit and courage of horses, dogs, &amp;c. The bull-dog and pug-dog are in this
                    respect superior to the mastiff. The hyaena is strongly contrasted with the
                    hare, and the guinea-hen with the robin red-breast.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Destructiveness, or</hi> the propensity to destroy in
                    general, but more especially to destroy life, has its seat just above the ears;
                    the prominence of which part will account for the strange pleasure which some
                    people take in killing or tormenting animals, in seeing executions, and for
                    their inclination to commit murder. Among animals, this instinct for blood is
                    strongly marked in the carnivorous tribes, especially in the lion, tiger, and
                    others of the feline tribe; and the breadth of their skulls in this part shows
                    us the great size of this organ, compared with that of their victims, the sheep,
                    the goat, or the hare. The heads of murderers have in general been found to
                    possess a visible prominence at this place. When the band of ferocious robbers
                    and assassins, who so long infested the left banks of the Rhine, under
                    Schinderhanns, had been caught, and a number of them executed, Dr. Gall found
                    this organ strikingly developed in the heads of these banditti. This propensity
                    is frequently strong in children, in idiots, and in madmen. Its object, in the
                    lower animals, is evidently to procure the food on which nature destined they
                    should live; yet some animals kill more than is necessary for their nourishment.
                    In man this propensity presents different degrees of activity, from a mere
                    indifference to the pain of animals, to the pleasure of seeing them killed or
                    tortured, or even the most imperious desire to kill. Dr. Gall called this
                    faculty <hi rend="italic">murder</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but Dr. Spurzheim
                    thinks it produces the propensity to destroy in general, without determining the
                    object to be destroyed, or the manner of destroying it. “It gives,” says he,
                    “the propensity to pinch, scratch, bite, cut, break, pierce, devastate,
                    demolish, ravage, burn, massacre, strangle, butcher, suffocate, drown, kill,
                    poison, murder, and assassinate.” It would seem, therefore, that this organ has
                    a great deal to answer for.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Constructiveness,</hi> the propensity to build, or the
                    disposition to the mechanical arts, is indicated by the developement of the
                    brain at the temples. Dr. Gall found this to be the case in great mechanicians,
                    architects, sculptors, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497106"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-7106-0463"/>and designers; and also in the skulls of the
                    beaver, marmot, field-mouse, and rabbit, which construct habitations. Hares, on
                    the contrary, which lie in the fields, have this organ defective, although in
                    general they resemble rabbits. He possesses the skull of a milliner of Vienna,
                    who had a good taste, and understood perfectly the art of changing the forms of
                    her merchandises; in this skull the organ in question is prominent. It is by
                    means of this faculty that birds build nests, savages huts, and kings palaces.
                    It produces also fortifications, ships, engines of war, manufactures of all
                    kinds, furniture, clothes, toys, &amp;c. There was a lady at Paris, who, every
                    time she was pregnant, felt the greatest propensity to build. The excessive size
                    of this organ may lead a man to ruin his family by building, or to coin false
                    money.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Covetiveness,</hi> or the propensity to covet, gather, and
                    acquire, without determining the object to be acquired, or the manner of
                    acquiring it, has its organ situated at the temples, on the anterior inferior
                    angle of the parietal bone. This faculty gives a desire for all that pleases;
                    money, property, animals, servants, land, cattle, or any thing upon earth. It
                    produces egotism and selfishness, and may, when abused, lead to usury,
                    plagiarism, fraud, or theft. The instinct of stealing, it is asserted, is not
                    always the effect of bad education, of poverty, idleness, or the want of
                    religion and moral sentiment. This truth, says Dr. Spurzheim, is so generally
                    felt, that every one winks at a little theft committed by rich persons, who in
                    other respects conduct themselves well. Mr. Combe terms this faculty <hi
                    rend="italic">Acquisitiveness.</hi></p>
                <p>9. The organ of <hi rend="italic">Secretiveness,</hi> or the propensity to
                    conceal, or to be clandestine in general, is situated in the middle of the side
                    of the head, above the organ of the propensity to destroy. Dr. Gall first
                    observed this organ in a person who had many debts, <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> but who had the address to conceal his real situation, so that the
                    creditors could have no knowledge of each other. He ascribes to this faculty
                    cunning, prudence, the <hi rend="italic">savoir faire,</hi> the capacity of
                    finding means necessary to succeed, hypocrisy, lies, intrigues, dissimulation,
                    duplicity, falsehood; in poets, the talent of finding out interesting plots for
                    romances and dramatic pieces; and finally, the quality of slyness in animals, as
                    in the fox and the cat, who conceal their intentions, and are clever in hiding
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>To the second genus of the order of feelings, namely, Sentiments, belong the
                    following faculties :—</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Self-love, or self-esteem.</hi> Dr. Gall first noticed this
                    organ, which lies in the middle of the upper posterior point of the head, in a
                    beggar, who stated that he was reduced to his present condition by his pride,
                    which made him neglect his business. The animals endowed with this organ are the
                    turkey-cock, peacock, horse, &amp;c. Dr. Gall thought this organ is the same as
                    that of the faculty which makes certain animals dwell upon mountains; but Dr.
                    Spurzheim, as we have already observed, draws a line of distinction between
                    them. The two great activity of this faculty is the cause of various abuses, as
                    pride, haughtiness, disdain, contempt, presumption, arrogance, and insolence.
                    The want of it disposes to humility. It is said to be more active in women than
                    in men, and that its excess is sometimes the cause of madness.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Love of Approbation.</hi> Persons fond of the good opinion
                    of others, have the upper posterior and lateral part of the head much developed.
                    This may be called the organ of ambition or vanity, according to the object,
                    which may be of various kinds. A coachman endowed with this faculty is pleased
                    if his manner of conducting horses be approved; and a general is elated if he be
                    applauded by his nation for leading his army to victory. This faculty is more
                    active in women than in men, and even in certain nations more than in others.
                    More women become mad from this cause than men.</p>
                <p>12. Organ of <hi rend="italic">Cautiousness.</hi> Two persons at Vienna were
                    known to be remarkable for their extreme irresolution. One day, in a public
                    place, Dr. Gall stood behind them, and observed their heads. He found them
                    extremely large on the upper posterior part of both sides of the head. Hence he
                    derived the first idea of this organ. Circumspect animals also, as the stag,
                    roe, pole-cat, otter and mole, and those which place sentinels to warn them of
                    approaching danger, as the chamois, cranes, starlings, and bustards, have this
                    cerebral part much developed. This faculty produces precaution, doubts, demurs;
                    and, in general, exclaims continually “<hi rend="italic">take care?</hi> It
                    considers consequences, and produces all the hesitations expressed by the word
                    <hi rend="italic">but.</hi> When excessive, it produces uncertainty,
                    irresolution, unquietness, anxiety, fear, melancholy, hypochondriasis, and
                    suicide. Dr. Gall finds this organ more strongly marked in children than in
                    grown persons.</p>
                <p>13. The organ of <hi rend="italic">Benevolence</hi> in man, or of <hi
                    rend="italic">meekness</hi> in animals, is situated on the superior middle part
                    of the forehead. In most animals it is restrained to a passive goodness; but in
                    man its sphere of activity is very considerable, producing all the social
                    virtues, or in one word, <hi rend="italic">Christian charity.</hi></p>
                <p>14. The organ of <hi rend="italic">Veneration,</hi> or of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theosophy,</hi> occupies the centre of the uppermost part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic">frontis.</hi> Dr. Gall: had observed in
                    churches, that those who prayed with the greatest fervour were bald; and that
                    their heads were much elevated. The pictures of saints show the very
                    configuration which he had thus noticed in pious men; and the head of our
                    Saviour, also, is generally represented of this shape. It is by this faculty
                    that man adores God, or venerates saints, and persons and things deemed
                    sacred.</p>
                <p>15. The organ of <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi> is situated on the side of that of
                    veneration. Dr. Spurzbeim considers the sentiment of hope as proper to man. and
                    as a sentiment necessary in almost every situation; it gives hope in the
                    present, as well as of a future life. In religion it is called faith. Its
                    excessive developement produces <hi rend="italic">credulity.</hi></p>
                <p>16. <hi rend="italic">Ideality,</hi> or the poetical disposition. The heads of
                    great poets are enlarged above the temples, in an arched direction. The
                    sentiment inspired by this organ is the opposite of circumspection; it renders
                    us enthusiasts, while circumspection stops our career by saying “take care.” If
                    the part of the head above this organ, and a little backward from it, be very
                    much developed, the person is disposed to have visions, to see ghosts, and to
                    believe in astrology, magic, and sorcery.</p>
                <p>17. The faculty of <hi rend="italic">Righteousness,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conscientiousness,</hi> which produces the sentiment of just and unjust, right
                    and wrong, has its organ situated a little more forward than the organ of
                    approbation. It produces the sentiment of duty, and constitutes what is called
                    conscience or remorse. Dr. Spurzheim admits farther an organ of <hi
                    rend="italic">justice,</hi> which he seeks for on the side of the following
                    organ.</p>
                <p>18. <hi rend="italic">F)eterminateness,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Firmness.</hi>
                    Dr. Gall observed that persons of a firm and constant character have the top of
                    the brain much developed. Lavater had made the same observation. This faculty
                    contributes to maintain the activity of the other faculties by giving constancy
                    and perseverance. Its too great activity produces infatuation, stubbornness,
                    obstinacy, and disobedience. Its deficiency engenders fickleness and
                    inconstancy.</p>
                <p>To the order called Intellect, and the first genus of that order, viz. the <hi
                    rend="italic">knowing faculties,</hi> belong the following species:</p>
                <p>19∙ <hi rend="italic">Individuality,</hi> or the faculty which procures us the
                    knowledge of external beings, after we have received impressions from them by
                    the external senses, occupies the middle of the lower part of the forehead. Dr.
                    Gall found this part very prominent, indicating a great developement of the
                    anterior and inferior part of the brain, in all persons, who, from their
                    extensive, but superficia! knowledge in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497119"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-7119-0464"/>arts and sciences, were capable of shining and
                    taking a lead in conversation. It has been not unaptly, though satirically
                    characterized as the <hi rend="italic">blue-stocking</hi> faculty. Tame animals
                    have the forehead more developed than wild ones, and are more or less tameable
                    in proportion as the forehead is more or less developed; Dr. Gall, therefore,
                    calls this organ that of <hi rend="italic">educability.</hi> Dr. Spurzheim,
                    however, objects to this term, and has substituted that of individuality; he
                    also remarks that the organ is early developed in children, because they are
                    obliged to acquire a knowledge of the external world.</p>
                <p>20. The organ of <hi rend="italic">Form</hi> leads us to take cognizance of the
                    forms of objects, with the existence of which the preceding faculty had made us
                    acquainted. Persons endowed with it in a high degree, have a great facility of
                    distinguishing and recollecting persons; they are fond of seeing pictures, and
                    if they make collections, they collect portraits. Crystallography is the result
                    of this faculty. The conception of smoothness and roughness also belongs to it.
                    This of ’ gan is placed in the internal angle of the orbit, and, if much
                    developed, it pushes the eyeball toward the external angle, that is, a little
                    outward and downward. The Chinese appear to have it in perfection.</p>
                <p>21. <hi rend="italic">Size.</hi> After the existence and figure of any body, the
                    mind considers its dimensions or size, for there is an essential difference
                    between the idea of size and that of form. The organ must therefore be
                    different; it is probably however in the neighbourhood of the former.</p>
                <p>22. <hi rend="italic">Weight.</hi> The ideas of weight and resistance, density,
                    softness and hardness, cannot be attributed to the sense of feeling, and
                    require, therefore, a particular faculty for their conception. Its organ must be
                    situated in the vicinity of the two last.</p>
                <p>23. <hi rend="italic">Colour.</hi> The faculty of conceiving colour is, in like
                    manner, totally distinct from the sense of vision, or the faculty of perceiving
                    light. Its organ is placed in the midst of the arch of the eye-brows, giving
                    them, when expanded, a vaulted and rounded arch. This configuration is
                    characteristic of painters, and is strikingly displayed in the Chinese, who are
                    well known to be very fond of colours. This faculty is generally more active in
                    women than in men.</p>
                <p>24. <hi rend="italic">Space,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Locality.</hi> The faculty
                    of local memory, by which we recollect localities, and find our way to places
                    where we have been before, is much stronger in some persons than in others.
                    Animals are also endowed with it, and it enables them to return to their
                    dwellings and their progeny, when obliged to leave them in search of food. It is
                    conspicuous in some dogs; while others are very deficient in this respect. The
                    migration of birds is the result of this faculty. The pictures and busts of
                    great astronomers, navigators, and geographers, as of Newton, Cook, Columbus,
                    &amp;c. present a great developement of this organ, which is situated under, but
                    extends a little beyond, the frontal sinuses. The swallow, the stork, and the
                    carrier-pigeon, have all this organ. This faculty conceives the places occupied
                    by the external bodies, and makes space not only known to us, but inspires a
                    fondness for this kind of knowledge. It makes the traveller, geographer, and
                    landscape painter; it recollects localities, judges of symmetry, measures space
                    and distance, and gives notions of perspective.</p>
                <p>25. <hi rend="italic">Order.</hi> This faculty enables us to conceive order. It
                    gives method and order in arranging objects as they are physically related. Its
                    organ is probably situated outward, but not far from the organs of size and
                    space.</p>
                <p>26. <hi rend="italic">Time.</hi> Ideas of time are the result of a distinct
                    faculty; for they may exist without those of order and number. They seem to be
                    higher in the scale, and their organ, accordingly, occupies a higher place in
                    the brain.</p>
                <p>27∙ <hi rend="italic">Number.</hi> All the ideas that are concerned about unity
                    or plurality, that is, about number, belong to a faculty whose organ is situated
                    in a part of the brain near the external angle of the orbit. The object of this
                    faculty is cal-: culation in general. When much developed, the arch of the
                    eye-brows is considerably depressed, or is elevated at the outer extremity. This
                    conformation is apparent in the portraits and busts of great calculators, as
                    Newton, Euler, Kaestner, Jedediah Buxton, and Pitt. The heads of negroes are
                    very narrow at this part; and, in general, they do not excel in this
                    faculty.</p>
                <p>28. <hi rend="italic">Tune.</hi> The perception of musical tone is distinct from
                    that of sound, and implies a different faculty from that of hearing. Its organ
                    is placed on the lateral parts of the forehead. Its form varies according to the
                    direction and form of its convolutions. In Gluck and Hadyn, it has a pyramidal
                    form; in Mozart, Viotti, Zumsteg, Dusseck, and Crescentini, the external corners
                    of the forehead are enlarged but rounded.</p>
                <p>The heads and skulls of singing birds, especially the males, exhibit this organ
                    fully developed. Monkeys are absolutely destitute of it.</p>
                <p>29∙ <hi rend="italic">Language.</hi> The organ of the faculty of learning the
                    artificial signs for the operations of the mind, of perceiving their connection
                    with the thing signified, and of remembering them, and judging of their
                    relations, occupies a transverse situation in the midst of the knowing
                    faculties, and presses upon the basis of the orbit of the eye, so as to project
                    the eye forwards when much developed. This produces what is commonly called a
                    goggle-eye, denoting strong verbal memory. Sometimes the eyes are not only
                    prominent, but also depressed downward, so that the under eyelid presents a sort
                    of roll, or appears swollen. Such persons are fond of philology, that is, they
                    like to study the spirit of different languages.</p>
                <p>The second genus of the order Intellect, viz. the reflecting faculties, contains
                    the following species :—</p>
                <p>30. <hi rend="italic">Comparison.</hi> This faculty compares the sensations and
                    ideas of all the other faculties; and points out their difference, analogy,
                    similitude, or identity. Dr. Gall observed various persons, who, in every
                    conversation, had recourse to examples, similitudes, and analogies, in order to
                    convince others; and seldom to reasoning and philosophical arguments. In them he
                    found, in the midst of the superior part of the forehead, an elevation which
                    presented the form of a reversed pyramid, and he named this organ, according to
                    its functions, the organ of analogy. Nations who have this faculty in a high
                    degree are fond of figurative language.</p>
                <p>31. <hi rend="italic">Causality.</hi> This faculty examines causes, considers the
                    relations between cause and effect, and always prompts men to ask, <hi
                    rend="italic">Why</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> Persons fond of metaphysics have
                    the superior part of the forehead much developed and prominent in a
                    hemispherical form, as Mendelsohn, Kant, Fichte, and others. The ancient artists
                    have given to Jupiter Capitolinus a forehead more prominent than to any other
                    antique head.</p>
                <p>32. <hi rend="italic">Wit.</hi> Persons who have this faculty, who write like
                    Sterne, Voltaire, Piron, &amp;c. have the superior external parts of the
                    forehead elevated. The essence of this faculty consists in its peculiar manner
                    of comparing, which always excites gaiety and laughter. Jest, raillery,
                    mockery·, ridicule, irony, &amp;c. are its offsprings.</p>
                <p>33. <hi rend="italic">Imitation.</hi> Persons who have a considerable elevation
                    of a semi-globular form at the superior part of the forehead, have the faculty
                    of imitating, with great precision, the gestures, voice, manners, and, in
                    general, all the natural manifestations of men and animals. They have a
                    disposition to be actors, and are prone to gesticulation. This organ is, in
                    general, more developed in children than in adult persons.</p>
                <p>To the above catalogue of the organs enumerated by Dr. Spurzheim, Mr. Combe has
                    since added the two following, namely, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497132"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-7132-0465"/>34. The organ of <hi rend="italic">Wonder,</hi>
                    (situated immediately above <hi rend="italic">Ideality,</hi> in the lateral
                    parts of the anterior regions of the vertex,) which occasions the belief in the
                    reality of ghosts, and other mysterious apparitions and visitations, and
                    inspires a love for all that is marvellous and supernatural, and also a taste
                    for novelty and fashion. When largely developed, it excites young men, born and
                    bred in inland situations, to choose the sea as a profession.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">System of
                    Phrenology,</hi> fourth edition, p. 381.</p></note></p>
                <p>35. The organ of <hi rend="italic">Eventuality,</hi> which, when large, gives
                    prominence or a rounded fulness to the middle of the forehead. “The function of
                    this faculty is to take cognizance of changes, events, or active phenomena,
                    indicated by active verbs. In such expressions as the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >rock</hi><hi rend="italic">falls,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">horse</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gallops,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">battle</hi> is <hi
                    rend="italic">fought,</hi> the substantive springs from Individuality, and the
                    verb from Eventuality. It prompts to investigation by experiment, while
                    Individuality leads to observation of existing things. Individuality gives the
                    tendency to personify abstract ideas, such as Ignorance and Wisdom; and
                    Eventuality to represent them as acting. An author in whom Individuality is
                    large, and Eventuality small, will narrate actions, but deal little in physical
                    description.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Fid.</hi> p. 518.</p></note></p>
                <p>Two other primary facul ties are mentioned by Mr. Combe; one, which he terms <hi
                    rend="italic">Alimentiveness,</hi> or the desire of eating and drinking; and
                    another, which had been called by Spurzheim <hi rend="italic">Vitativeness,</hi>
                    or the <hi rend="italic">Love of Life</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the seat
                    of these powers has not been exactly determined.</p>
                <p>Excepting in the case of idiots, all the thirty-five organs above described are
                    possessed by every person, but they exist in greater or less perfection in
                    different individuals. Peculiarity of character is the result of irregularity in
                    the original structure, or inequality in the relative developement of the
                    several organs; circumstances which, according as they are diversified, lay the
                    foundation of every excellence, as well as constitute the fatal sources of vice
                    and depravity. These doctrines should, however, by no means be understood as
                    lending their sanction to the latter; for crimes are considered as flowing from
                    the abuse of certain faculties, and as still requiring for their prevention the
                    counteracting influence of morality, and the salutary coercion of Iaw. It must
                    be of importance to every individual to know, if such knowledge be attainable,
                    what is the degree of energy of the propensities and other faculties with which
                    he may have been naturally and originally endowed; because every organ and
                    corresponding faculty may be invigorated by proper exercise. The business of
                    education will accordingly consist in exciting or restraining their
                    developement, according to their natural deficiency or exuberance. Phrenology,
                    by pointing out what are the strongest faculties in a child, will enable us to
                    adopt the best plan of intellectual, as well as moral discipline; will assist us
                    in regulating his passions, and maintaining a due balance between all his moral
                    sentiments; and guide us in the choice of a profession for our pupil,
                    conformable to the particular bent of his genius. “What benefit would arise to
                    society,” says Mr. Forster, the zealous advocate of these doctrines, “should we
                    be enabled to make a just election of objects in youth, to be placed in
                    situations capable of ripening their naturally energetic faculties. Phrenology
                    will lead to important considerations regarding criminal punishment,
                    particularly in houses of correction. It will enable us to distinguish, not only
                    between those who have naturally strong evil propensities, from those whom
                    distress or other contingencies may have hurried on to crime, but will point out
                    the particular nature of the evil propensities to be corrected.” It will also
                    tend, he conceives, to establish important distinctions between different kinds
                    of insanity, and enable us to discover the treatment appropriate for the cure of
                    each. Lastly, it may prepare the way to a radical improvement of the human race,
                    by pointing out those conformations of the head which it is desirable to
                    eradicate or to perpetuate, and which should therefore be avoided or preferred
                    in the choice of marriages. “It is certainly a pity,” says Dr. Spurzheim, “that,
                    in this respect, we take more care of the races of our sheep, pigs, dogs, and
                    horses, than of our own offspring.”</p>
                <p>Such is the body of doctrines, and such the reasonings in their support, which
                    have emanated from the school of Gall and Spurzheim, and which they have
                    dignified with the appellation of a new science. A host of opponents, as might
                    be expected, have arisen against a system so much at variance with common
                    notions, leading to conclusions so remote from vulgar apprehension, and
                    admitting so easily of being held up to ridicule by partial or exaggerated
                    statements. We have already noticed the objection founded upon its supposed
                    tendency to favour materialism, and shall pass over others of a similar nature,
                    which proceed upon the presumption of a greater knowledge of the laws of the
                    creation than we really possess, or which are derived from imperfect or mistaken
                    views of the theory itself. We shall also refrain from employing the weapons of
                    ridicule against a system so vulnerable to its attacks, and which would have
                    been so capable of affording Swift a new incident for the history of the
                    philosophers of Laputa. The simple exposition of the sandy foundation on which
                    it has been built, of the flimsy materials of which it has been composed, and
                    the loose mode in which they have been put together, will suffice to enable our
                    readers to form their own conclusions as to the soundness and solidity of the
                    edifice.</p>
                <p>It is, in the first place, obvious, that nothing like direct proof has been given
                    that the presence of any particular part of the brain is essentially necessary
                    to the carrying on of the operations of the mind. The truth is, that there is
                    not a single part of the encephalon, which has not, in one case or other, been
                    impaired, destroyed, or found defective, without any apparent change in the
                    sensitive, intellectual, or moral faculties. Haller has given us a copious
                    collection of cases, which bear upon this point; and a similar catalogue has
                    been made by Dr. Ferriar, who, in a paper in the fourth volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Manchester Transactions,</hi> has selected many of Haller’s cases,
                    with considerable additions from other authors. The evidence afforded from this
                    mass of facts, taken conjointly, appears to us to be sufficient to overturn
                    their fundamental proposition. This evidence is not impeached by the feeble
                    attempts of Dr. Spurzheim to evade its force, by a general and vague imputation
                    of inaccuracy against the observers, or by having recourse to the principle of
                    the duplicity of each of the cerebral organs; a principle of very dubious
                    application, on a subject of so much uncertainty as the physiology of the brain.
                    Poor, indeed, must be his resources, when we find him resorting to the following
                    argument, in proof that the brain is the organ of thought, namely, that “every
                    one feels that he thinks by means of his brain.” We doubt much if any one has
                    naturally that feeling.</p>
                <p>It requires, also, but a slight attention to perceive, that the very ground-work
                    on which the whole of the subsequent reasoning proceeds, namely, that the
                    different faculties of the mind are exercised respectively by different portions
                    of the brain, is in no respect whatever established. The only arguments in its
                    favour which bear the least plausibility, are derived from analogy. Now,
                    analogy, in reasoning concerning the unknown operations of nature, is, at best,
                    but slippery ground; and when unsupported by any other kind of evidence, cannot
                    lead to certain knowledge, far less constitute the basis of an extensive system.
                    The utility of analogical deductions as to what takes place in one department<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193497145" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7145-0466"/> of nature, from
                    our knowledge of what occurs in another, consists chiefly in their affording
                    indications of what may possibly happen, and thus directing and stimulating our
                    inquiries to the discovery of truth by the legitimate road of observation and
                    experiment. But to assume the existence of any such analogy as equivalent to a
                    positive proof, resulting from the evidence of direct observation, is a gross
                    violation of logic. Yet it is upon assumptions of this kind that Drs. Gall and
                    Spurzheim have ventured to found all the leading propositions of their doctrine.
                    In the secretions of the body, they observe, the preparation of different fluids
                    is consigned to different glands, having different appropriate structures; and
                    they consider this analogy as a demonstrative proof of what happens in the
                    operations of thought, and the phenomena of the passions, which, because they
                    differ as much in their nature as milk does from gall, must, accordingly, be the
                    result of actions in different portions of the brain; which portions are,
                    therefore, to be regarded as so many different organs, rather than as parts of
                    one organ. Even in a case where all the analogies are favourable to one side of
                    a question, such a loose mode of reasoning would be entitled to little
                    confidence; but how fallacious must it not prove, when analogies can be pointed
                    out which apply in the opposite direction? It requires no extensive knowledge of
                    the animal economy to perceive, that modifications of functions equally
                    diversified with those of the intellect, are, in many cases, the result of
                    actions taking place in the same organ. Does not the same stomach digest very
                    different and even opposite kinds of aliment? Yet we do not find that one
                    portion of that organ is destined for the digestion ofmeat, and another for the
                    digestion of vegetable matter; although the operations required for the
                    conversion of such different ingredients into the same chyle, cannot possibly be
                    the same. Nervesperform the double office of volition and sensation; but the
                    different bundles offibres which convey each impression, the one to the muscles,
                    the other to the sensorium, are wrapped up in the same sheath, and are so
                    intimately intermixed during their course as to constitute a single cord. The
                    same organ serves for the hearing of acute and of grave sounds. The whole
                    retina, and not merely different portions of its surface, receives the
                    impression of different kinds of colour; there is not one organ for the
                    perception of blue and another for the perception of red rays. Guided by such
                    analogies as these, might we not be equally justified in concluding, that the
                    same part of the brain may serve for the memory of words, as for the memory of
                    things; and that the same portion of that organ which enables us to conceive the
                    idea of figure, may also suggest to us that of size?</p>
                <p>The same doctrine of the plurality of cerebral organs, is endeavoured to be
                    supported by another analogy, equally vague and loose with the former, namely,
                    that the sense of fatigue from long continued muscular exertion, resembles, in
                    its circumstances, the effects of long continued study on the mind, and is
                    equally relieved, in both cases, by a change of action. To us, however, it
                    appears, that this analogy might, with equal justice, have been adduced, as
                    favouring the opposite view of the subject; for we can just as readily conceive
                    the sense of fatigue to take place from the exercise of the whole organ in a
                    particular mode, as from that of any part of the organ; and relief must equally,
                    in both cases, be experienced from the ceasing of that action, or from the
                    substitution of one of a different kind. The muscles admit only of one kind of
                    action; and the energy which each derives from the nerves, when once exhausted,
                    is not so readily replaced from the general stock belonging to the system. In
                    the finer textures of the body, which approach more to that of the brain, the
                    analogy not only fails of giving support to the doctrine, but has an opposite
                    tendency. The same retina, when fatigued by the continued impression <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> a particular colour, is still as ready as before to
                    receive the impression of another colour. The circumstance of partial fatigue
                    with regard to one set of actions, may, therefore, exist, without implying the
                    necessity of a separate organ for the performance of these actions. Indeed, if
                    the brain have any laws similar to those of muscular motion, it must have a much
                    greater number peculiar to itself, and all such distant analogies as those we
                    have been considering, must be perfectly inconclusive. Similar observations will
                    apply to the explanation of the phenomena of sleep, of dreams, of somnambulism,
                    of partial losses of memory, and of insanity. It is equally conceivable, that
                    they should result from the imperfect or differently modified actions of one
                    organ, as from the separate activity of different parts of that organ, whilst
                    the other parts are inactive. Analogies may be equally adduced in support of
                    both sides of the question, and can certainly prove nothing on either.</p>
                <p>Drs. Gall and Spurzheim appeal with great confidence to anatomy, and particularly
                    to their own anatomical discoveries, as affording a solid support to their
                    doctrines. “We never,” say they, “separate anatomy from physiology, for
                    physiology without anatomy is unfounded; while anatomy without physiology is
                    useless. A physiological system of the brain would necessarily be false, were it
                    in contradiction with its anatomical structure.” This conclusion, which at best
                    is but a negative one, is totally inapplicable to the theories in question. The
                    anatomy of the brain is so complex, and so void of apparent adaptation to any
                    purpose we can understand, that it will suit any physiological system nearly
                    equally well; at least it can never be adduced in contradiction of any
                    hypothesis, however wild, that can be framed as to the mutual operation of soul
                    and body. All that these anatomists have done, in this respect, is to show that
                    there is no appearance of a common centre of departure or of a collection of
                    nervous filaments. The separation of the parts of the brain and their diversity
                    of shape, can no more be evidence of a diversity in their functions, than the
                    multitude of distinct and separate lobules which compose the kidneys of birds,
                    and of a great number of quadrupeds, arc indications that each part performs a
                    different office. Comparative anatomy, indeed upon which so much is made to
                    hinge, is of all guides the most fallible in questions of this nature; since we
                    behold, in numberless instances, a great variety of ways in which nature
                    accomplishes the same function and the same purpose, in different departments of
                    the animal creation. But on a comparison of animals with each other, it may even
                    be doubted, whether there is any connexion or proportion observable between
                    their intellect or inclinations and the number of parts in their brains.</p>
                <p>The possibility of discovering the size and the shape of the different parts of
                    the brain from the external examination of the head, is also discountenanced by
                    anatomy. There are often considerable impressions on the interior of the skull,
                    where the corresponding exterior surface does not exhibit the slightest
                    appearance of projection, and is sometimes even depressed; and there are
                    frequently large prominences without, where ther® are no corresponding
                    concavities within; so that when the outer surface of the bony case is compared
                    with a mould in plaster or wax of the cavity itself, they exhibit considerable
                    differences, and, from the great variation which may take place in the thickness
                    of the bones, this difference is not the same in degree in any two skulls.</p>
                <p>Hollow as are the foundations of this theory, the mate-rials which compose the
                    superstructure will prove, on examination, to be still more frail and unsound.
                    The whole fabric rests upon the validity of a single proposition, which in
                    itself is extremely questionable, namely, that the size of an organ is in
                    general a criterion of the energy with which its function is performed. If any
                    doubt should remain as to its truth, the whole of the pretended discoveries
                    relative to the functions of the several parts of the brain are shaken, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193497158" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7158-0467"/> and the
                    fantastical edifice has no auxiliary prop to arrest its fall. So essentially,
                    indeed, does the whole of this system depend upon the truth of a number of
                    independent propositions, that if any one of them should turn out to be
                    incorrect, the whole fabric must give way. The evidence in its favour, instead
                    of being cumulative, is disjunctive. Where each proposition must be sustained by
                    a separate series of proofs, as is the case here, it is evident that the chances
                    of eιτor must be multiplied in proportion to the number of steps we must ascend
                    before we can arrive at the last conclusions. Let us, for example, examine the
                    logic by which the above fundamental principle is deduced. “A large muscle,” say
                    they, “is stronger than a small one; and a large loadstone is more powerfill in
                    its attraction than a smaller one. Why should it not be the same with regard to
                    the brain ?” Thus again do they confide in a loose analogy, derived from another
                    and a totally different part of the economy; and as if the organization and
                    functions of the animaI body were not sufficiently remote from the nature and
                    operations of the human mind, the inanimate world is ransacked for the shadows
                    of an analogy, which, when viewed through such a distance of intervening mist,
                    may wear the semblance of reality. But the phantom must immediately vanish upon
                    a near inspection. For the perfection of a refined and delicate instrument, such
                    as must be that which is subservient to the operations of the intellect,
                    innumerable conditions must concur; amongst which that of size, it is reasonable
                    to suppose, is the least important Delicacy of texture, fineness of
                    organization, and harmony of adjustment between the several parts of its complex
                    structure, must contribute infinitely more towards rendering it capable of
                    performing its office, than superior magnitude; a circumstance which in itself
                    is quite as likely to prove a source of imperfection, as to impart additional
                    facility. Increase of size in the viscera of the body is often the indication of
                    a diseased, instead of a healthy state. Small eyes, Professor Hufeland observes,
                    see with more strength, and last longer than large eyes. Why may not this be
                    also the case with the organs of the brain? But really, in our present state of
                    ignorance as to the mode of operation by which they are subservient to the
                    processes of intellect and sensation, all such reasonings <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> on their functions, as connected with their size, must be completely
                    illusory.</p>
                <p>Even were we to admit so questionable a doctrine as that the energies of the
                    parts of the brain are proportional to their magnitude, insuperable difficulties
                    would still be opposed to the determination of their relative size in the living
                    head; crowded as all these organs are in a narrow compass, and completely hid
                    from our view by an irregular bony case which protects them from injury, and
                    which is itself covered by a thick and variable layer of muscle and integument.
                    Let us, however, for the sake of argument, suppose that the form of each organ
                    within the skull can really be ascertained by external examination of the head;
                    shall we allow it to be an easy task to determine the real character of the
                    individual who is the subject of observation? Are we always able to discriminate
                    between real and affected sentiment; or to mark with certainty the operation of
                    all the various motives which constitute the springs of action? Is the transient
                    glance of a passing observer sufficient for unravelling the complex web of our
                    affections, or unveiling the secret and tortuous recesses of the human heart, so
                    as to assign to each principle its precise sphere of agency? Can the most
                    profound moralist, or acute metaphysician, pronounce with confidence what are
                    the natural dispositions of any human being, knowing as we do, that these
                    dispositions must have been changed or modified, exalted or subdued, perverted
                    or refined, by the force of habit, education, example, and a multitude of other
                    powerful causes, which, in his progress through life, have moulded his
                    intellectual and moral constitution? Can he trace them through the guise of
                    falsehood, artifice, and dissimulation, which so commonly hide his real
                    character from the world, and which occasionally deceive the eye of the closest
                    and most vigilant observer? Is it to the behaviour of a person who knows that he
                    is watched; is it to the partial report of his friends; is it to the testimony
                    of the individual himself, the most fallible of all, that the phrenologist is to
                    trust for his knowledge of human character? Such, however, is the kind of <hi
                    rend="italic">experience,</hi> from which it appears that all the doctrines
                    relative to the functions of the different parts of the brain have been derived;
                    and it is in this experience, as in an impregnable fortress, that the adherents
                    of the system make their last and most resolute stand. Quitting the airy region
                    of theory, they fancy themselves posted upon a rock, secure against the
                    insidious minings of scepticism, and bidding defiance to the rude assaults of
                    argument. The appeal to the evidence of induction, as to the supreme authority
                    in the court of philosophy, is made with confidence; and all the wild effusions
                    of a bewildered fancy are presumed to be sanctioned by a supposed conformity
                    with experience. You may speculate or reason, they exclaim, as you please;
                    observation shows that such and such forms of the head, are the invariable
                    concomitants of such and such predominant dispositions and faculties. Who will
                    dare to set up his opinion in opposition to ascertained facts? We venture only
                    to express strong doubts as to the reality of these facts, on which so much is
                    made to depend, possessing the character of <hi rend="italic">general
                    facts,</hi> that is, of being the results of legitimate induction; and to
                    suggest the expediency, previously to any admission of their truth, of inquiring
                    not only into the manner in which the knowledge of these pretended facts has
                    been obtained, and in which inductions from them have been made, but also into
                    the talents and qualifications of the observer upon whose testimony we receive
                    them for the exercise of this philosophical process. We should know in what
                    spirit he conducted the inquiry; with what previous dispositions he examined the
                    objects of his contemplation; what motives led him to these researches; and what
                    interest he may have in the event. Experience, we should recollect, leads to
                    very different results, according to the sagacity and good faith of the person
                    who acquires it. Minds already prejudiced collect from it only a confirmation of
                    their errors, and become, by its means, only the more obstinately wedded to
                    their opinions. The sailor, steadfast in his belief that his whistling to the
                    sea will raise a wind, or conjure up a storm, instead of being undeceived by
                    experience, is only the more strengthened in his faith by the observations which
                    it furnishes to him. In what a multitude of instances do we not find men
                    deceiving themselves as grossly, when they draw inferences from what they see,
                    if prepossessed with the expectation of meeting with a certain coincidence, or
                    succession of events. How disposed are we all to disregard the exceptions to a
                    preconceived rule, and to allow undue weight to every example that conforms to
                    it. How willingly we repel the evidence that opposes, and how eagerly we catch
                    at whatever corroborates our previous notions, especially when those notions
                    have originated with ourselves, and are viewed as the darling offsprings of our
                    own lucubrations.</p>
                <p>The discerning reader may already have perceived strong indications of this bias
                    in the framers of the phrenological system, from the account we have already
                    given of its origin and history, and of the kind of evidence on which they
                    pretend to establish its doctrines. In order, however, to enable him to form a
                    correct idea of the species of logic which they have been in the habit of
                    employing and which they deem conclusive, and of the tone of mind with which
                    they prosecute the investigation of subjects where nothing but the exercise of
                    consummate prudence can secure from error, we shall conclude by offering one or
                    two specimens of their mode of reasoning. We shall pass over <pb break="no"

                    more ridiculous than the preceding, of irresistible natural inclinations to
                    wander from place to place, to commit murder, theft, infanticide, and other
                    crimes, without any assignable object. We shall refrain from criticising the
                    wonderful accounts of people who were insane on one side of the head only, and
                    observed their insanity with the other side, and of others who heard angels
                    sing, and devils roar, only on one side; nor shall we stop to investigate the
                    curious case of the woman who declared in a court of justice, when accused of
                    having destroyed her infant, that her sole motive for becoming pregnant was that
                    she might enjoy the exquisite pleasure of killing her own child. Neither shall

                    analyzed the human soul; but content ourselves with examining, what in fact
                    alone deserves examination, the sort of evidence brought forward to establish
                    the relation between each faculty and a particular defined portion of the brain.
                    We shall take, for this purpose, the following passage, which may be esteemed a
                    fair specimen of the whole.</p>
                <p>“Dr. Gall examined the head of a woman at Vienna who was known as a model of
                    friendship. She suffered different changes of fortune; she became alternately
                    rich and poor; but was attached to her former friends. Gall found the part of
                    her head situated upward and outward from the organ of philoprogenitiveness,
                    very prominent, and called it the organ of friendship. Our observations are not
                    multiplied enough to enable us to decide positively on this organ; yet its seat
                    appears to be more than probable. It <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be inferiorly,
                    because this faculty exists in the lower animals, and is a propensity. <hi
                    rend="italic">For this reason</hi> it belongs to their region of the head; and
                    according to its mimical signs, and the motions of the head when it is active,
                    it lies laterally and backward.” Dr. Spurzheim, it is obvious, here reasons in a
                    circle; for he assumes as true the thing to be proved, namely, that faculties of
                    a certain class reside in a certain department of the head, and then applies it
                    to establish the very proof on which the proposition itself ought to have
                    rested. In order to render intelligible the latter part of his argument, the
                    reader should be informed that Drs. Gall and Spurzheim believe, that, when any
                    faculty of the mind is strongly excited, the action of the corresponding organ
                    in the brain tends to raise that part of the head in which it is situated; so
                    that the person has a propensity to lay his finger upon the nearest external
                    part of the head, or sometimes to apply his band to it, either to cool it when
                    too hot, or to warm it when too cold, and that he is occasionally prompted to
                    rub it in order to excite it when too sluggish. Thus, when we endeavour to
                    recollect a name or a word, we unconsciously slap our foreheads, or rub the skin
                    a little above the eyes, or perhaps higher still, just where the appropriate
                    organ of memory is situated, that it may awake and exercise its peculiar
                    faculty. When embarrassed by any difficulty, we gently stimulate in like manner,
                    the organ of contrivance, by scratching the head at the part under which is the
                    seat of <hi rend="italic">constructweness.</hi> The timid man scratches his head
                    on the organ of courage behind his ear, as if he tried to rouse the feeble organ
                    into activity. A proud man holds his head erect upon his shoulders, and raises
                    himself upon his toes, for no other reason than because the organ of the
                    sentiment lies at the very top of the head, and is therefore elevated by the
                    action. A sense of danger, or the necessity of <hi rend="italic"
                    >circumspection·,</hi> leads all animals, man not excepted, to stretch their
                    necks forwards horizontally, thus presenting the broad extent of that organ, as
                    it were, in front. Devotion raises the head gently; and our adorations are all
                    directed upwards, not because we regard the Deity as above, but because the
                    organ of adoration is situated in the centre of the upper part of the head. When
                    busied in deep contemplation, we cover the whole forehead with our hands, as it
                    is there that the reflecting faculties are lodged; and, accordingly, when we
                    reproach any one for his want of reflection, we put our hand to this part of the
                    head; and exclaim, “he wants it here.” If we try to recollect a date, we put
                    into action the organ of time, which being situated over the eyebrows, and a
                    little to one side, occasions an involuntary movement of the eyes upwards and
                    towards the temples. In beating time to a musical air, we make the head
                    oscillate from side to side, because the organs of tone as well as of time,
                    being situated on each side, and being alternately in action, occasion these
                    gesticulations. Sterne excelled in wit: and we find him represented in all his
                    portraits with his head leaning on his hand, the fore-finger of which is placed
                    on a particular part of the forehead. Dr. Spurzheim considers this as one of the
                    proofs that the organ of wit occupies that very spot.</p>
                <p>With minds capable of allowing any weight to such observations and imbued with
                    such notions of the nature of philosophical induction, as are implied by the
                    grave admission of such frivolous arguments as these, the investigation of the
                    laws of nature must be an easy and a delightful task. With the abundant and
                    all-powerful resources, which their indulgent method of reasoning is ever ready
                    to supply, all difficulties may be smoothed away, all chasms immediately filled
                    up, and all obstacles made to vanish the moment they arise. We need not be under
                    any embarrassment at meeting with a skull exhibiting a particular prominence,
                    although the faculty which should correspond to it be deficient. Doubtless the
                    individual must have been strongly gifted by nature with this faculty, but
                    education has long ago taught him to disguise or suppress its manifestations. It
                    exists, perhaps, unknown to the person himself, and wants only a proper occasion
                    for its being exhibited; or more probably the other faculties, having received a
                    greater proportional developement, have overpowered and prevented it from
                    appearing. If we find, on the contrary, a strongly marked faculty, without the
                    corresponding shape of the head, we may still conclude that the organ exists
                    notwithstanding; for the neighbouring organs, having received a greater
                    extension, may have pushed it from its true place, or have grown up around it,
                    and have concealed it from vulgar observation. Its not having been recognised is
                    only a proof of want of skill in the observer; no doubt, it would easily have
                    been discovered by the eye or hand of a true believer, and experienced
                    cranioscopist; for it should be recollected that the differences are often very
                    minute, and require the <hi rend="italic">tactus eruditus</hi> for their
                    detection. Besides, how can we be certain that the excellence of the faculty in
                    question is not of an artificial or relative kind, and that it results from
                    education, or the weakness of opposite faculties, rather than from nature? If
                    all these expedients should fail us, we have nothing to do but to plunge into
                    the depths of metaphysics, to refine and make subtle distinctions, or loosen the
                    signification of a few words, till we have entangled ourselves in a wood, and
                    lost sight of the real difficulty that had perplexed us. Thus will the theory be
                    freed from all exceptions, and the induction be rendered complete. With such a
                    convenient logic, and accommodating principles of philosophizing, it would be
                    easy to prove any thing. We suspect, however, that on that very account, they
                    will be rejected as having proved nothing.</p>
                <p>We have here re-printed the Essay on this subject which appeared under the
                    headofCκAsioscopγ,in the Supplement to the last edition of the present work. We
                    have done so because we have not seen any reason to alter our views. Since the
                    year 1818, when that essay was written, replies have been attempted to some of
                    our strictures; particularly by Mr George Combe, in his “<hi rend="italic"

                    Journal have admitted that our Article was “regardedin the South as the most
                    formidable attack Phrenology ever had to sustain,” <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> and have in so far paid us a compliment, we deem it unnecessary to
                    answer, otherwise than very generally, their comments on the reasonings
                    contained in it; be-causemostofthosecomments are foundedon a misconception
                    ofthescope ofour arguments. When, for instance, we attempted toshow, that, in
                    establishing a philosophical principle, mere analogiesought not to be esteemed
                    as equivalent to proofs,and when we maintained that they are still less to be
                    relied on, when other analogies, ofacontrary tendency, can be adduced on the
                    other side of the question, we are represented by Dr. Combe as building our
                    arguments on analogy, the very principle of which we were pointing out the
                    fallacy, and repudiating the authority; and we are even charged with being
                    guilty of the strange inconsistency of endeavouring to “refute direct inductive
                    evidence, by that drawn from analogy.” <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> Any reader
                    who had paid the least attention to the train of reasoning we employed, must
                    have perceived that our reasoning was diametrically the reverse of that which is
                    imputed to us; and that we had even guarded against the possibility of mistake
                    by the sentence concluding with the words, “all such reasonings <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> must be completely illusory.”</p>
                <p>By the help of a mis-quotation, in which the qualifying adverb “nearly” is
                    omitted, we are represented as having asserted, that the anatomy of the brain
                    “will suit any physiological system equally well.” <hi rend="superscript">
                    3</hi> All the notions we can form of the nature of mental operations are so
                    completely and essentially different from any of the affections of which we can
                    conceive matter to be capable, that it is utterly impossible for us to
                    understand the mode in which a connexion has been established between them; or
                    to imagine any physical structure whatsoever, which shall, in the remotest
                    manner, correspond with the metaphysical constitution of the soul. This,
                    however, we may confidently assert, that amongst all the hypotheses which have
                    been propounded respecting the correspondence between the corporeal instruments
                    of the mind, and the mental faculties themselves, the one which is the least in
                    accordance with the actual structure of the brain, is that devised by the
                    phrenologists. Let a person, unacquainted with the anatomy of that organ, be
                    shown the phrenological map of the cerebral regions, and let him be told, that
                    to each corresponding subjacent portion of the brain is ascribed, as to a
                    separate organ, a certain special mental function; one set of these organs being
                    appropriated to the establishment of certain definite propensities, whilst
                    another set gives rise respectively to various sentiments, and a third confers
                    each its peculiar intellectual power; with what immeasurable surprise, on
                    lifting up the bony covering which had concealed this expected assemblage of
                    well defined organs, would he behold a uniform mass of pulpy substance, divided
                    by furrows only, into serpentine but continuous convolutions, bearing no
                    conformity or even similitude to the notions which his previous instructions had
                    led him to form of distinct masses, divided from each other in accordance with
                    their phrenological functions. Each of these pretended organs, far from being
                    isolated in its structure, as its alleged isolated functions would imply, from
                    the neighbouring parts, is seen to pass on, without visible boundary, to the
                    next, by a continuity of cerebral substance. Turning round upon his instructor,
                    would he not complain of being misled by him; and would he not require him to
                    explain what intermediate function he can ascribe to those portions of the same
                    convolution which occupy an intermediate place between two organs, to which he
                    has already assigned functions utterly heterogeneous with one another? What
                    lucid ideas can he convey of a function intermediate between <hi rend="italic"
                    >benevolence</hi> and <hi rend="italic">imitation,</hi> between <hi
                    rend="italic">ideality</hi> and <hi rend="italic">acquisitiveness,</hi> between
                    <hi rend="italic">cautiousness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">adhesiveness,</hi> or
                    between <hi rend="italic">self-esteem</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >concentrativeness</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inhabitiveness,</hi> of which the
                    respective organs are not merely contiguous, but pass insensibly into one
                    another; and what is the curious and hitherto nondescript office that he will
                    assign to those portions of the brain which occupy the central space at the
                    junction of quintuple groups of organs, such as those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ideality, acquisitiveness, constructiveness, tune,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >wit,</hi> all of which, though separated by the fancy of the phrenologist, have
                    been by nature amalgamated into one continuous mass,undistinguishable by any
                    visible lines of demarcation? jí</p>
                <p>Not content with expressing his dissatisfaction at our failing to perceive the
                    accordance between the structure of the human brain and the doctrines of
                    phrenology, Dr. Combe extends his censure to our objection as to the evidence
                    which observations on lower animals are supposed to afford in their favour; and
                    to our assertion, that in the construction of their system “much wasmade to
                    hinge” on facts derived from comparative anatomy. That the founders of the
                    system placed great reliance on this kind of evidence, is a proposition
                    sufficiently borne out by the testimony of Sir George Mackenzie, who, when
                    speaking of inhabitiveness, remarks, “it is chiefly from observation on the
                    lower animals that Dr. Spurzheim seems <hi rend="italic">to consider it as
                    certain,</hi> that there is such a faculty in man.” <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> The fallacy of the reasoning by which comparative anatomy has been
                    pressed into the service of phrenology, has been so ably exposed by Dr.
                    Prichard, in his Treatise on Insanity, that we shall beg leave to borrow from
                    that work the following judicious remarks. “The chief peculiarity,” observes Dr.
                    Prichard, “of Dr. Gall’s psychological theory, was the attempt to draw a
                    parallel between the animal qualities displayed by the lower animals and the
                    individual varieties discovered among men.” He proceeded “on the principle, that
                    the innate or original faculties are common to man and the lower tribes of
                    animals, to those at least which bear to man a general analogy in their
                    organization, and especially in the structure of their nervous system; and
                    sought for analogies in physical phenomena between the brute tribes, tracing in
                    them the rudiments of those properties which, taken collectively, and in their
                    highest degree of developement, form the human character, and which, in lower
                    degrees and various relations, constitute the distinctive nature of each of the
                    inferior kinds. The attempt was ingenious, and seemed to hold out the prospect
                    of discovering curious and interesting relations; but it is necessary, before
                    embarking in the inquiry, to determine whether the analogies are real or
                    apparent; for it has been tacitly assumed that the supposed distinction between
                    instinct and reason is unreal, and that the active principles are of the same
                    kind in the higher and lower beings of the creation.” “Perhaps metaphysical
                    writers have been mistaken in laying down so broad a line of difference as they
                    have established. We must, then, either elevate the brutes, or lower the
                    superiority of mankind. Shall we say, after tracing the operations of a
                    constructive instinct so wonderfully displayed by the beaver, or in the ceils in
                    which the bee lays up his honey, that an impulse to action precisely similar
                    gave origin to the pyramids of Egypt, or to the building of Constantinople?
                    Shall we venture to affirm that the tunnel under the Thames owes its existence
                    to a burrowing propensity resembling that of the rabbit or the mole? Shall we
                    conclude that Parry and Franklin sought the regions of the north, impelled by
                    the instinct of the migratory rat; and that Magellan and De Gama traversed the
                    Southern Oceans directed by an influence analogous to that which moves the
                    flight of swallows? Or may we, with greater probability, determine that the

                <p>tribes act under the guidance, not of blind instinct, but of enlightened reason;
                    that metaphysicians were mistaken when they laid down the principle, ‘ Dens est
                    anima brutorum,’ that the birds of passage have some acquaintance with physical
                    geography, and know the quarter where tropical warmth exists and genial breezes
                    blow; that the bee has studied the exact sciences, and knows by calculation the
                    form most advisable for its cells? In short, that there is a real analogy and
                    correspondence between the mental faculties of man and the physical endowments
                    of those creatures whom he conceitedly regards as his inferiors? If either of
                    these positions can be maintained, there will be a sound foundation for the
                    comparative pyschology of Dr. Gall and his followers; but if they should be
                    rejected as improbable, we must admit that the analogies pointed out are remote,
                    the things compared are different in kind, they agree only in external
                    appearances; and we shall be brought to the conclusion that it has pleased the
                    Author of nature to bring about corresponding results in the rational and
                    irrational departments of the creation, by very different means.”</p>
                <p>“If the evidence,” continues Dr. Prichard, “brought in support of the
                    organological system depends so entirely on universal coincidence between
                    psychical properties and corresponding varieties in the structure of the nervous
                    fabric, it must be important to determine whether there are any departments of
                    the animal kingdom in which instincts and motive habitudes, and an entire
                    psychical nature are displayed analogous to those of vertebrated animals, while
                    yet in these departments there is no structure which can be said to bear
                    resemblance to the complicated cerebral system of the so termed higher animals.
                    In all the vertebrated kinds, the organization of the nervous fabric is in one
                    principle, and the same fundamental type, with different degrees of
                    developement, is traced in man and all other mammifers, in birds, reptiles, and
                    fishes; but here the resemblance terminates, and the nervous system of
                    molluscous animals and insects presented but few and remote analogies to
                    thatwhich belongs to the first great branch of the animal creation. It is,
                    indeed, to be presumed that the nervous system, taken as a whole, fulfils, in
                    the tribes last mentioned, the same offices as in those animals who have it
                    enclosed in a bony case. Still, nothing exists at all resembling the complicated
                    formation of a brain, with its lobes and convolutions. It is so much the more
                    surprising to find the higher instincts, which had almost disappeared in fishes,
                    display themselves with new splendour and variety in the brainless insects;
                    creatures which, in the wonderful imitations of intelligence that govern their
                    motive habits, rival, if they do not even exceed, the sagacity of the animals
                    which most approximate to man.”</p>
                <p>“Now, if it should be established, that all those properties of animal life,
                    approximating to intelligence, or bearing analogies so striking to the
                    manifestations of mind, which, in one great division of the animal kingdom are
                    assumed to be essentially connected with, and depending on, a particular system
                    of organization, exist in another department, and display themselves in all the
                    same various profusion, while the creatures belonging to this latter department
                    are yet destitute of that system of organization, and of any thing that bears
                    the resemblance to it, the advocates of Phrenology will be obliged to abandon
                    that broad ground on which they have attempted to fortify their position. Within
                    the more confined field which the vertebrated tribes alone present, it will be
                    more easy to maintain such an assumed connexion of physical properties with a
                    peculiar structure; or, rather, it is more difficult to disprove it when
                    assumed. The general analogy which prevails throughout these tribes in the
                    organization of their cerebral and nervous system, affords no room for so
                    decisive a contradiction to the relation which the phrenologists would
                    establish. Yet even within this field great and striking facts display
                    themselves which are adverse to the hypothesis. Birds and reptiles, as Jacobi
                    has observed, are nearly, if not wholly destitute of many cerebral parts, which
                    in mammifers are held as of high importance for the manifestation of psychical
                    properties, and yet they display psychical phenomena similar to those of
                    mammifers. Whenever an undoubted and tangible fact can be laid hold of in the
                    different proportional developement of cerebral parts, which can be brought into
                    comparison with the relative differences of animal instinct, or of psychical
                    properties in general, there is, if I am not mistaken, a manifest failure of
                    correspondence between the two series of observations. This has been shown by
                    Rudolphi in a striking manner, with respect to the cerebellum. The cerebellum,
                    as this writer has observed, is found to lessen in its proportional developement
                    as we descend in the scale of organized beings, without any corresponding
                    diminution, and even with an increase of the propensity which Gall connects with
                    it. How remarkably powerful is this instinct in birds; and yet how small is the
                    cerebellum in the feathered tribes compared with its size in mammifers, and even
                    in the latter, when we consider the magnitude which it attains in the human
                    species? We observe those tribes in which the cerebellum nearly or entirely
                    ceases to exist, obeying, nevertheless, the impulsion of instinct as blindly or
                    devotedly as other kinds which have the organ in question remarkably developed.
                    When we consider the great amplitude which the cerebellum attains in man, in
                    comparison with its size in lower animals, we are obliged, if we really attach
                    any importance to such a system of correspondence, to acknowledge some relation
                    between this circumstance and the transcendant superiority of the human
                    intellect, compared with the psychical powers of brutes.”</p>
                <p>“The facts which suggest themselves as we follow these trains of reflection, are
                    scarcely to be reconciled with the phrenological theory: they seem, in the first
                    place, to show, that the relations which in it are assumed to prevail through
                    all nature are subject to vast exceptions; and as one great proof of the
                    doctrine is the assumed universality of such relations, or the endowment of
                    psychical properties in coextension with certain peculiarities of structure in
                    cerebral parts, the exceptions endanger at least the outworks of the whole
                    doctrine. When, in a more limited survey, we confine our observation to the
                    sphere of vertebrated animals, and discover that variations in psychical
                    phenomena take place without any evidence of corresponding changes in the
                    structure of cerebral parts, and that these changes, on the other hand, occur
                    without such alterations as we are led to anticipate in psychical properties,
                    the system of organology seems to be shaken to its very centre.” <hi

                <p>Whilst the defenders of phrenology have, on the one hand, misrepresented the
                    minor points of our argument, they have, on the other, disguised from their
                    readers that it is on the insufficiency of the evidence adduced in support of
                    their doctrine, that we rest our main objection to its credibility. We maintain,
                    that they have taken only a one-sided view of what nature presents to our
                    observation; that they have paid attention to those facts alone, which are
                    confirmatory of phrenology, and shut their eyes to those which oppose it. In
                    order to establish what they consider as the rule, they have collected together
                    all the instances in its favour, and have passed over or suppressed all the
                    exceptions. What we assert is, that more enlarged inquiry, conducted with a more
                    entire devotion to the cause of truth, anda scrupulous rejection of error, would
                    have shewn the latter to be at least equal, if not superior in number to the
                    former. Our own observations, as far as we have pursued them, .have led ’ <hi

                <p>us to this conclusion; and it was on the result of these observations that our
                    scepticism was principally founded. So frequent, indeed, are the exceptions,
                    that even the founders of the system, Drs. Gall and Spurzheim themselves, on
                    applying it practically, committed, as is well known, very glaring mistakes;
                    giving frequently the most false judgments of the characters of various
                    individuals. Have these mistakes, we may ask, been any where recorded by the
                    phrenologists, and candidly set off against the instances in confirmation of
                    their sagacity? What avails their collections of thousands of examples of
                    coincidences, when the perhaps equally numerous instances of discordance are
                    excluded from the catalogue? The fact, that the brain of Cuvier was of unusual
                    magnitude, has been triumphantly proclaimed in all the publications on
                    phrenology; but we are not aware that any phrenologist has brought forward the
                    equally well-certified fact, that the brain of Sir Walter Scott was found on
                    examination to be “not large.” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>In like manner, a long catalogue of persons avowing their belief in phrenology,
                    including many men of eminent talents and extensive knowledge, has been paraded
                    before the public; but we have not yet seen any counter list of unbelievers
                    prepared with the view of ascertaining, in a science professedly of pure
                    observation, on which side the weight of authorities preponderates. The class of
                    men who, from the nature of their pursuits, are perhaps best qualified to form a
                    correct judgment in matters of this nature, are the members of the medical
                    profession; yet how inconsiderable, compared with the total number, is the
                    proportion of those belonging to that profession who, according to Mr. Combe’s
                    catalogue, have given in their adhesion. Sculptors, again, compose another class
                    of men whose studies lead them more especially to the most minute and accurate
                    knowledge of the external form of the human head; yet amongst the many who are
                    at present engaged in the active exercise of their noble art, Mr. Combe has been
                    able to bring forward the name of only one solitary individual as lending a
                    countenance to phrenology.</p>
                <p>y “Itis not enough,” as Dr. Prichard very justly observes, “to have a few chosen
                    coincidences brought forward by zealous partizans, who go about in search of
                    facts to support their doctrine, and pass by, or really cannot perceive the
                    evidence that ought to be placed in the opposite scale. The principles of the
                    system ought to be applicable in every instance. The phrenologists, however,
                    aware of numerous and striking exceptions, elude their evidence’by asserting,
                    that when a certain portion of the cranium and of the brain is greatly
                    developed, while the faculty there lodged has never been remarkably
                    distinguished, it nevertheless existed naturally, though the innate talent, for
                    want of proper cultivation, has never been displayed; the predominant organic
                    power was never discovered by the owner, though, according to the principles of
                    the doctrine, with this organic power a proportional impulse to exertion, or an
                    instinctive energy is combined, which communicates of itself a strong and
                    irresistible tendency to particular pursuits. When, again, a strongly marked
                    propensity, or a decided talent has been manifested without any corresponding
                    amplitude of structure, it is in like manner pleaded, that by sedulous exercise
                    and culture, a natural deficiency has been overcome. Thus the phrenologist
                    avails himself of a double method of elusion; his position, like the cave of
                    Philoctetes, affords him an escape on either side; and in one direction or
                    another he contrives to baffle all the address of his opponents.</p>
                <p>“If, however, the testimony of facts in a great scale should be found adverse to
                    the alleged coincidences, or to the correspondence of given mental equalities
                    with certain conditions of the brain, phrenology will not continue to make
                    proselytes, and it will be ultimately discarded as an hypothesis without
                    foundation. At present, most inquisitive persons seem to be in doubt on this
                    subject, and to be looking out for evidence. I have taken every opportunity that
                    has occurred to me for many years of making inquiries of persons who had a great
                    field of observation within their reach, what had been the result of their
                    experience on this subject. Many of the persons have been physicians, who were
                    superintendants of extensive lunatic establishments. Some of them had been men
                    who had addicted themselves to the study of phrenology, and were predisposed to
                    imbibe the opinions of its authors; some have been persons distinguished by
                    their researches in the anatomy and physiology of the brain and nervous system.
                    Among these I do not remember to have found one who could say that his own
                    observation had afforded any evidence favourable to the doctrine. Yet we should
                    imagine, that a man who lives amidst hundreds of monomaniacs must have
                    constantly before his eyes facts so obvious that he could not be mistaken in
                    their bearing. Some hundreds, and even thousands of such persons have passed a
                    part of their lives under the inspection of Μ. Esquirol, who possesses most
                    extensive resources for elucidating almost every subject connected with the
                    history of mental diseases, and has neglected no inquiry which could further the
                    attainment of that object. The result of his observations will be allowed to be
                    of some weight on the decision of this question, in which the appeal is
                    principally to facts of the precise description of those with which he has been
                    chiefly conversant. At his establishment at Ivry he has a large assemblage of
                    crania and casts from the heads of lunatics, collected by him during the long
                    course of his attendance at the Salpétrière, and at the Royal Hospital at
                    Charenton, which is under his superintendance. While inspecting this collection,
                    I was assured by Μ. Esquirol, that the testimony of his experience is entirely
                    adverse to the doctrine of the phrenologists; it has convinced him that there is
                    no foundation whatever in facts for the system of correspondences which they lay
                    down between given measurements of the head and the existence of particular
                    mental endowments. This observation of Μ. Esquirol was made in the presence of
                    Μ. Mitivié, physician to the Salpétrière, and received his assent and
                    confirmation. Μ. Foville, physician to the extensive lunatic asylum at St. Yon,
                    gave me a similar assurance. There are few individuals in Europe whose sphere of
                    observation has been so extensive as that of Μ. Esquirol and Μ. Foville, and
                    certainly there arc none whose science and habits of observation better qualify
                    them to be witnesses in such a subject of inquiry; but testimonies to the same
                    result may be collected from unbiassed witnesses, whose evidence taken
                    collectively may have nearly equal weight. Among these there are men
                    unscientific, though capable of correct and unprejudiced observation, as well as
                    anatomists and physiologists. In the number of the latter is Rudolphi, who
                    declares that he has examined many hundreds of brains without finding any thing
                    that appeared to him favourable to the phrenological theory.” <hi

                <p>The mode in which Dr. Combe evades the force of the strong testimony here
                    adduced, is quite characteristic of the disposition to be found amongst
                    confirmed phrenologists, of resolutely rejecting all evidence that militates
                    against the system they have adopted. Thus, he says, in reference to the passage
                    we have just quoted, “If Dr. Prichard believes that the intelligent and
                    benevolent Esquirol, is that person,” (namely, one “competent to form a judgment
                    on the subject,”) and if his collection of crania and casts be the hostile
                    evidence which is relied on, this only proves, in a forcible manner, that Dr.
                    Prichard is himself not competent to judge, <hi rend="italic superscript">

                    We cannot help remarking here, that, on another occasion, when criticising the
                    suggestion we threw out, in the Essay on Cranioscopy, of the propriety of
                    inquiring into the talents and qualifications of observers before admitting the
                    truth of the facts received on their testimony, a very different language was
                    held. « When they” (the advocates of phrenology) “affirm that the subjects of
                    observation are patent to the whole world, who have eyes to see, and
                    understandings to comprehend; and when they say, compare manifestations with
                    cerebral developement, and you are at the bottom of the problem yourself; what
                    need for inquiry into their talents and qualifications to observe ?” “When Gay
                    Lussac hears that Sir Humphry Davy has made a discovery in chemistry, and reads
                    Sir Humphry’s statement of the way in which it was made, does he begin by
                    inquiring first, whether it be possible to make the discovery at all, seeing
                    natural substances are <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> so changed and modified,
                    exalted and subdued’ by a multitude of powerful causes? And, after settling this
                    point, does he, in the second place, proceed to inquire into Sir Humphry Davy’s
                    talents and qualifications as a chemist, and into his capacity to make the
                    discovery, and then believe it, or not, according to the result of this
                    investigation? No man who knows the first rudiments of philosophy would follow
                    so absurd and preposterous a course. What should we think of Gay Lussac’s
                    refutation of Sir Humphry’s discovery, founded on a metaphysical inquiry into
                    the possibility of making it, and into the ‘ talents and qualifications’ of the
                    discoverer? We should pity him for his ignorance of the rudiments of
                    philosophy.” <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi></p>
                <p>This happy talent, possessed by the champions of phrenology, of shaping their
                    course either one way or the opposite, according as it may suit the convenience
                    of the occasion, enables them, at one time, to proclaim, that the evidences of
                    their science are palpable and demonstrative, that the field of nature is open
                    to all inquirers, that “every one who has eyes may see” and judge for himself;
                    and at another, when such judgment is against them, they can turn round, and
                    allege that in order to arrive at the truth a peculiar discretion and tact,
                    acquired by long experience and careful appreciation of minute and hair-breadth
                    differences of size is necessary. They can then declare that the observer who
                    has not arrived at the same conclusions as themselves, is doubtless incompetent
                    to the task he has attempted; and that his testimony, being of no value, ought
                    to be wholly set aside.</p>
                <p>Let it be borne in mind, then, by the practical inquirer into the truth of
                    phrenology, that he will not be esteemed qualified to verify its doctrines,
                    unless he be previously deeply versed in the new system of psychology, can
                    assign to each of the thirty-five special and primary faculties of the soul its
                    sphere of operation, and has acquired a readiness in unravelling their
                    multifarious combinations, so as to analyze, by this subtile metaphysical
                    chemistry, all human qualities into their proximate and ultimate elements, refer
                    all actions to their proper innate impulses, and assign the proportions of the
                    various ingredients which are mixed up in the formation of the character of
                    each, individual. No one is competent to excel in this new branch of philosophy
                    who doubts the possibility of appreciating the intensities of moral or
                    intellectual qualities by geometrical measurements, on scales divided into
                    tenths and hundredths of inches. The young and ardent phrenologist, who after
                    having applied his callipers to the skull subjected to his examination, and
                    taken a note of the dimensions of each of the thirty-five organs, proceeds to
                    verify his observations by comparing them with the character of the possessor of
                    those organs, will never fail to meet with <hi rend="italic">wonderful
                    coincidences,</hi> sufficient to give him the greatest satisfaction, and confirm
                    him in the persuasion that he possesses the real key to the secrets of nature in
                    the hitherto recondite science of mental philosophy. A moderate share of
                    dexterity in reconciling apparent discrepancies will suffice to ensure a
                    preponderance of favourable evidence; since, fortunately, there have been
                    provided in the brain different organs, sometimes of similar and sometimes of
                    opposite properties, capable, by a little adjustment <hi rend="italic">of
                    plus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> on either side of the equation, of
                    furnishing the requisite degrees of the mental quality sought for, and of thus
                    solving every psychological problem. We shall suppose, for instance, that he is
                    inspecting the head of a person known to have given credit to the prophecies of
                    a weather almanack; he finds, on reference to the “system of phrenology,” that a
                    belief in astrology is the offspring of No. 16, that is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ideality</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so that if this organ happen to be
                    sufficiently large, the phenomenon is at once accounted for. But if it be not,
                    our phrenologist will have another chance; for he will probably discover it to
                    arise from the dimensions of No. 15, which inspires <hi rend="italic">hope,</hi>
                    the source of the <hi rend="italic">propensity to credulity.</hi> Habitual <hi
                    rend="italic">irresolution</hi> may result either from the magnitude of No. 12,
                    or the diminutiveness of No. 18; thus affording very great convenience for
                    making our observations of the character square with those of the dimensions of
                    the organs, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> If, again, the magnitude of
                    the organ of <hi rend="italic">combativeness</hi> accord with the manifestations
                    of pugnacity given by the individual, it is weil, and we need inquire no
                    farther, but set it down at once as an irrefragable proof of the accuracy of
                    phrenological determinations. Should the correspondence, however, not prove
                    satisfactory, the organ being large for instance, and the manifestation small,
                    we have then further to examine the dimensions of the organ of <hi rend="italic"
                    >caution,</hi> the influence of which is to moderate and check the operation of
                    the former; and we shall perhaps find this organ sufficiently large to account
                    for the phenomenon. Both these organs may be large, or both small, or the first
                    may be small and the second large, or the converse; and other modifications of
                    action may result if either one or both be only of moderate size, allowing great
                    latitude of choice in the assignment of motives. Should we be so unfortunate as
                    to exhaust all the combinations without meeting with the success we desire,
                    there is still an abundance of auxiliary faculties of which we may avail
                    ourselves with advantage. If we were to explain the fact of the individual in
                    question having accepted a challenge, he might have been inspired by <hi
                    rend="italic">cornbativeness,</hi> whose voice was “still for war,” or goaded on
                    by <hi rend="italic">destructiveness,</hi> to fight that he might destroy; <hi
                    rend="italic">firmness</hi> may have urged him to persevere by the consideration
                    that he had previously resolved it, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >concentrativeness,</hi> by rivetting his attention to the subject, may have
                    screwed his courage to the sticking place; or he may have been prompted by <hi
                    rend="italic">imitation</hi> to follow the example, or by <hi rend="italic"
                    >approbation</hi> to gain the applause of his friends. We have also to take into
                    the account the countervailing influence of faculties which are pulling in the
                    opposite direction, and qualifyingthe combined powers of the former incentives:
                    And shouldcaω⅛&lt;m- <hi rend="italic">ness</hi> not be in sufficient force, we
                    are to consider the power of <hi rend="italic">conscientiousness,</hi> which
                    preaches forbearance, meekness, and forgiveness; of <hi rend="italic"
                    >veneration</hi> which appeals to the high authority of religion and of law; of
                    <hi rend="italic">benevolence</hi> restraining the hand from inflicting pain and
                    death; of <hi rend="italic">approbation,</hi> who qualifies her sanction by
                    raising other voices condemnatory of the deed; and last, though not least, the
                    <hi rend="italic">love of life</hi> which recoils with instinctive dread from
                    the possible catastrophe. Drawing, then, a diagram of all these component moral
                    forces, in their proper directions, and suitable proportions, it will not be
                    very difficult to obtain by this artificial dynamicophrenological process, the
                    exact resultant which corresponds with the actual fact to be explained.</p>

                <p>Lest it should be imagined that the above description is a caricature of the new
                    method of philosophizing, so admirably calculated to establish the truths of
                    phrenology, we shall beg to quote the following passage from Sir George
                    Mackenzie’s <hi rend="italic">Illustrations</hi> as an example of this
                    satisfactory process of ratiocination.</p>
                <p>“In discussing the conjectured faculty of inhabitiveness with Mr. Combe, he had
                    the goodness to make us acquainted with a case, in which <hi rend="italic"
                    >locality</hi> and <hi rend="italic">inhabitiveness</hi> were both very moderate
                    in developement, but the <hi rend="italic">propensity to wander,</hi> as he
                    informed us, very powerful. Dr. Spurzheim mentions this propensity as belonging
                    to <hi rend="italic">locality·,</hi> and he states several remarkable cases in
                    which the organ was much developed, and the propensity strong. The case referred
                    to by Mr. Combe was, on this account, interesting; and we will state the result
                    of our inquiries into the particulars, for the purpose of giving an example of
                    the caution with which we ought to receive the description of any case brought
                    in opposition, since it sometimes appears to be necessary even among
                    friends.</p>
                <p>“The young man to whose case we refer, had a very strong desire to adopt a
                    seafaring life, contrary to the wishes of his friends. It occurred to them, that
                    a voyage up the Baltic, during the stormy months of October and November, might
                    have the effect of giving him a disgust to the profession for which he showed so
                    ardent a desire. He suffered so many privations and hardships, that he yielded
                    to the wishes of his friends, although the desire to go to sea continued as
                    strong as ever. On proposing a few questions, we found that the propensity was
                    confined to <hi rend="italic">being at sea</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that
                    this propensity did not originate in a desire to wander; for neither travelling
                    on land, nor mere change of place, would have gratified the propensity. At the
                    same time, the person referred to declared, that regular voyages to the same
                    place would not have satisfied him. The propensity had haunted him as long as he
                    could remember any thing. Being anxious himself to contribute to the unravelling
                    of what appeared mysterious and irreconcilable to the system, he stated that he
                    used to go once or twice a-day to examine the mechanism and rigging of ships in
                    Leith harbour, an employment of which he was passionately fond; and long before
                    he commenced his trial voyage, he had become familiar with the names and uses of
                    every part of a ship, and of the rigging. He was fond of machinery, and has
                    often amused himself by making models of ships; and his mechanical turn was so
                    strong, that he had constructed a model of machinery, by which a ship’s motion
                    may be applied to work the pumps. This mechanical propensity, and his early
                    attachment to naval machines, together with <hi rend="italic">firmness,</hi>
                    appear to us to have given rise to his desire for a sea-faring life. <hi
                    rend="italic">Courage</hi> might also have prompted his wish to enter the navy.
                    Thus the supposed propensity to wander appeared not to exist; and it was found
                    that a mechanical genius, an early attachment <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> to
                    the mechanism of a ship, <hi rend="italic">perseverance, courage,</hi> and
                    probably also love of <hi rend="italic">approbation,</hi> or ambition, and <hi
                    rend="italic">ideality,</hi> all of which were well developed in the individual
                    referred to, combined to inspire the desire to enter the navy.” <hi

                <p>It is to be lamented that, at the period when this elaborate investigation was
                    undertaken, the organ of <hi rend="italic">wonder</hi> had not yet been made;
                    for as one of the functions of this organ, according to Mr. Combe, is to “incite
                    young men, to chuse the sea as a profession,” much light would have been thrown
                    upon the object of the inquiry by a critical examination of its dimensions
                    compared with those of all the other organs which were taken into consideration
                    as combining their influence in producing the result.</p>
                <p>There is this very remarkable peculiarity in the pursuit of phrenology, that the
                    student is perplexed, not with the difficulties, but with the facilities it
                    affords for explaining every phenomenon. The pliability of its doctrines is
                    exemplified, not merely in the analysis of motives, but likewise in the
                    influence which we are allowed to ascribe to the habitual exercise, or education
                    of the faculties. The observed magnitudes of the respective organs indicate, not
                    the acquired, but the natural powers, sentiments, and propensities. Now, the
                    character of the individual is the joint result of the force of natural
                    endowments, and of the amount of moral and intellectual cultivation which has
                    been bestowed upon them. But can we ever know enough of the minute history of
                    the progress of the mind of any individual to enable us to form a correct
                    estimate of the relative power of these two elements, which have, in the
                    formation of each respective faculty, combined their operations? If it be true
                    that an organ may'· be the seat of a faculty varying in its activity according
                    to the occasions which call it forth, by what physical criterion can we
                    distinguish the active from the dormant conditions of that organ? Unless we can
                    draw, with precision, these distinctions, it is evident that the ground of all
                    cranioscopical observation is cut from under us.</p>
                <p>It may be indeed alleged, that at all periods of life, and even after the bones
                    of the skull are consolidated, the organs increase or diminish in size according
                    to the exercise or disuse of the faculty associated with it, whether such change
                    may have been brought about by voluntary training, or by the discipline of
                    circumstances; and certainly, if such were the fact, our experience would repose
                    on a much surer basis, than if the form of the organs merely retained the stamp
                    originally impressed upon them by nature. But the hypothesis that the cerebral
                    organs acquire additional size by the exercise of their powers was positively
                    rejected as untenable by Dr. Spurzheim, as we have heard him publicly declare;
                    and it is, we believe, repudiated by the generality of phrenologists.</p>
                <p>We do not think it difficult to account for the progress which phrenology has
                    made amongst the very numerous class of persons who find in it a source of
                    agreeable occupation, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> giving exercise to their
                    ingenuity in discovering striking coincidences, and gratifying their
                    self-complacency by inspiring them with the fancy that they are penetrating far
                    into the mystic regions of psychology. For the last twenty or thirty years,
                    various popular writers, and lecturers without number, have been displaying
                    their powers of elocution, exercising their skill in the critical examination of
                    developements, and expounding the doctrines of the new philosophy to wondering
                    and admiring audiences. With all these advantages and appliances to boot, the
                    wonder seems to be, not that phrenology has met with the success of which so
                    much boast is made, but that it has not speedily gained the universal assent;
                    for had it been a real science, like that of Chemistry and other branches of
                    Natural Philosophy, founded on uniform and unquestionable evidence, it could not
                    have failed, by this time, of being generally recognised as true.</p>
                <p>When we consider that the present age is not one in which there is any lack of
                    credulity, or in which a doctrine is likely to be repudiated on the score of its
                    novelty or its extravagance, we cannot but smile at the complaints of
                    persecution uttered by the votaries of the system of Dr. Gall, and at the
                    attempts they make to set up a parallel between its reception in this country,
                    in these times, and that which, two centuries ago, attended the speculations of
                    Galileo, and subjected him to the tyrannous cognisance of the Inquisition; or to
                    establish an analogy between the dogmas of phrenology and the discoveries of the
                    circulation of the blood, and of the analysis of light, which have immortalized
                    the names of Harvey and of Newton.</p>
