                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">PETERHEAD</label>, a parish of Scotland, situated on the east
                    coast, in latitude 57. 34. N. and longitude 1. 35. W. in the district of Buchan,
                    and county of Aberdeen. It extends along the coast in a straight line about four
                    miles, bending along the sea-shore about five miles; and from east to west it
                    extends from three to four miles. The surface is nearly level along the coast.
                    The Stirlinghill and Blackhill, containing extensive quarries of granite, are on
                    the southern and,western boundaries. The surface of the parish extends to
                    upwards of 9000 imperial acres, of which about 8300 are under cultivation, 72
                    are planted, 500 are capable of cultivation, and the remainder is chiefly rocky.
                    Extensive improvements in the cultivation of the soil have been made within the
                    last thirty years. The rental of the landward part of the parish is about
                    L.10,000. The population amounts to 7867.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Peterhead,</hi> a burgh in the parish of the same name, in
                    the county of Aberdeen, is situated upon the most easterly point of the mainland
                    of Scotland. Previously to 1593 it was a small fishing village. In that year it
                    was erected into a burgh of barony by George, earl marischal. It was forfeited
                    in 1715, and purchased by the York Building Company, from whom the present
                    proprietors, the governors of the Maiden Hospital founded by the company of
                    merchants of the city of Edinburgh, and Mary Erskine, acquired it by purchase in
                    1728. The superiors had the nomination of the magistrates until the passing of
                    the burgh reform act in 1832, by which the municipal government has been vested
                    in twelve councillors, who from their own number choose a provost, three
                    bailies, and a treasurer. The town contains about 1000 inhabited houses, besides
                    warehouses, and the rental is about L.7500. The boundaries of the town have been
                    considerably enlarged under the burgh reform act, and now embrace the village of
                    Buchanhaven, and part of the lands of Invernettie.</p>
                <p>The harbours of Peterhead are extensive; and, from their peculiar position at the
                    termination of the most easterly promontory of land in Scotland, having an
                    entrance both from the south and north, and being about equally distant from the
                    Friths of Forth and Moray, much resorted to by vessels frequenting the east
                    coast of Scotland, and affording, as they do, shelter and protection, not only
                    to the trade of the port, but also to shipping in general frequenting the east
                    coast of Scotland, they deserve attention in a national point of view. About
                    L.47,000 have been expended in building these harbours. They are managed by
                    commissioners incorporated by act of parliament, and yield an annual revenue of
                    about L.2800. The south harbour em<pb break="no" facs="nls:193495182"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-5182-0315"/>braces an area of 6∙16 imperial acres, having from
                    twelve to fourteen feet water at medium springs, and from eight to ten feet at
                    neap-tides. The north harbour, which has an area of 10∙86 imperial acres, has at
                    spring-tides eighteen feet water, and never under fourteen feet on any tide. The
                    quays extend to about 3350 feet in length. Connected with the harbours there is
                    an excellent graving-dock. The shipping belonging to the port amount to about
                    13,000 tons. The number of vessels which annually take shelter in the harbours
                    may be stated on an average at 240. The leading articles of export are grain,
                    meal, eggs, butter, cattle, fish, and the produce of the fisheries. The imports
                    are groceries, clothiery, flour, salt, iron, timber, coal, lime, bone manure,
                    &amp;c. An extensive trade to Greenland and Davis’ Straits has been carried on
                    from Peterhead with various success since the year 1788. During that time 3020
                    whales have been caught, which have yielded 30,296 tons of oil. The herring
                    fishery has of late been carried on with great success. In 1837, 262 boats were
                    employed in this fishery, and upwards of 40,000 barrels of herrings were caught.
                    It is supposed that Peterhead, being situated farther east than any other land
                    in Scotland, must at all times be one of the best stations for carrying on the
                    herring fishery, as, if the herrings pass along the coast, they must pass near
                    to this headland, and as the tides are strong, only the best fish can make head
                    against them; and, in fact, it has been found that those caught at Peterhead are
                    of superior quality. The lighthouse, which stands on the Buchanness, at the
                    extremity of the south bay, is of the utmost importance, both as regards the
                    interests of the general trade of the port, and the prosecution of the
                    herring-fishery. A considerable trade is occasionally carried on in granite from
                    the quarries in the neighbourhood. The stone, which is generally of the red
                    granite, and of excellent quality, may be raised in large blocks. The pillars in
                    the British Museum, the docks at Sheerness, the pillar erected in London to the
                    memory of the late Duke of York, and many other public works, have been built of
                    granite from Peterhead.</p>
                <p>In former times Peterhead was much resorted to as a watering-place; and as it
                    certainly possesses many advantages to the invalid who requires sea-bathing and
                    the tonic effects of the mineral waters, it held a high rank amongst the places
                    of summer retreatfor upwards of two centuries. Perhaps no place in the island is
                    more suitable for those whose cases require the bracing effects of sea-bathing
                    or sea-air; the former, from the rapidity of the tides and the absence of
                    rivers, being to be enjoyed in the greatest possible perfection; and the latter,
                    from the almost insular situation of the place, and the total absence of all
                    muddy or marshy exhalations, or other sources of contamination, affording all
                    the advantages without the inconvenience of a sea-voyage. In many cases much
                    benefit may also be derived from the use of the chalybeate waters with which the
                    neighbourhood abounds. But perhaps the renovated health and spirits which are in
                    most cases the result of a season at Peterhead are mainly to be attributed to
                    the air and bathing, together with the regular hours and habits which such a
                    residence naturally inculcates.</p>
                <p>The town is plentifully supplied with excellent springwater, which within the
                    last few years has been brought at a great expense for the use of the
                    inhabitants and the shipping; and it is now lighted with gas. There are no
                    manufactures of woollen or cotton goods in Peterhead, although, from its
                    situation, there is every reason to believe that such manufactures might be
                    carried on with advantage.</p>
                <p>The places of worship are, the original parish churchy the East parish church or
                    chapel of ease, the Episcopal chapel, and the United Session, Congregational,
                    and Methodist meeting-houses. In the town there is a news-room, and also a
                    reading society, who have a large and valuable lib rary; and there have lately
                    been established an association for the promotion of science, literature,
                    &amp;c. and a mechanics’ institution. There is a weekly market, which is held on
                    Friday; and there are two annual fairs, viz. on the third Tuesday in May and the
                    second Tuesday in November, both old style.</p>
                <p>Of late years the town has very much increased, both in inhabitants and in trade
                    and shipping. The inhabitants are intelligent and industrious, and therefore
                    there is reason to anticipate the future extension and prosperity of the burgh.
                    The population of the town in 1838 amounted to 6200. The number of qualified
                    electors was 211.</p>
