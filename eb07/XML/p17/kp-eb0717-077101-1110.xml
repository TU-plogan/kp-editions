                <p><label type="entry">PITTENWEEM</label>, a royal burgh and seaport town on the
                    Frith of Forth, in the parish of the same name, and on the east coast of
                    Fifeshire. It is situated on gently-elevated ground, which overhangs the
                    harbour, and consists of an irregular main street, having the form of an oblong
                    square, from which a number of by-streets stretch out along the public roads.
                    The houses are chiefly of old date, with the exception of a neat range of
                    respectable cottages on the north side of the town.- In the main street are
                    situated the town-house, the parish church (an old ungainly structure, with a
                    turreted spire), and all that remains of the ancient priory of PittenWeem. In
                    addition to the ruins of the priory, there is a quadrangular range of most
                    antique houses, which are stated to have been the residences of the prior and
                    other superior officers of the establishment. This ancient edifice is now
                    included within the private property of a gentleman, who resides in a part of
                    it. The town derives its name from a spacious cave, called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >weem,</hi> hollowed out, partly by the action of the waves, and partly by art,
                    from the rock on which stands the residence alluded to. There is also a
                    communication between the prior’s house and the cave, by means of a spiral
                    stair, the orifice of which has, however, been lately built up. Besides the
                    established church, there is an Episcopalian chapel, and one or two dissenting
                    places of worship. Pittenweem was erected into a royal burgh in the year 1542,
                    and, like all the other Fifeshire burghs, had a thriving and extensive trade,
                    which was carried on with success till the time of the union, from which date
                    its importance and its trade have alike declined. It was also a great fishing
                    station, and much coal was once wrought here; but both are now considerably
                    decreased. The harbour is very much exposed to easterly winds but it has been
                    improved so far as the means of the town will allow, and is now rather an
                    extensive work. The revenue of the burgh amounts to above L.550, and its
                    expenditure to nearly the same amount. In the year 1833, the town was in debt to
                    the amount of L.1621 sterling. The burgh is governed by a council, consisting of
                    four bailies,· a treasurer, and nineteen councillors; and, with St Andrews, the
                    two Anstruth- 6rs, Crail, Cupar, and Kilrenny, it returns a member to
                    parliament. The population in 1821 amounted to 1200, and in 1831 to 1317.</p>
