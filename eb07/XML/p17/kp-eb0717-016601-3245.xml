                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PEARL</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> a
                    hard, white, shining body, usually roundish, found in a testaceous fish, a
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Mya.</hi> Pearls, though esteemed of the number of
                    gems, and highly valued in all ages, proceed only from a distemper in the animal
                    which produces them, analogous to the bezoars and other stony concretions in
                    several animals of different kinds. Mr Bruce mentions muscles found in the salt
                    springs of the Nubian desert, in many of which he observed those excrescences
                    which might be called pearls, but all of them ill formed, foul, and of a bad
                    colour, though of the same consistence, and lodged in the same part of the body,
                    as those of the sea. “The muscle,” says he, “is in every respect similar, I
                    think larger. The outer skin or covering of it is of a vivid green. Upon
                    removing this, which is the epidermis, what next appears is a beautiful pink
                    without gloss, and seemingly of a calcareous nature. Below this, the
                    mother-of-pearl, which is undermost, is a white without lustre, partaking much
                    of the blue and very little of the red; and this is all the difference I
                    observed between it and the pearl-bearing muscle of the Red Sea.”</p>
                <p>In Scotland, especially to the northward, in all rivers running from lakes, there
                    are found muscles which have pearls of more than ordinary merit, though seldom
                    of large size. They were formerly tolerably cheap, but the wearing of real
                    pearls having come into fashion, those of Scotland have increased in price
                    greatly beyond their value, and superior often to the price of oriental ones
                    when bought in the East. The reason of this is a demand from London, where they
                    are actually employed in work, and sold as oriental. But the excellency of all
                    glass or paste manufactory, it is likely, will keep the price of this article,
                    and the demand for it, within bounds, when every lady has it in her power to
                    wear in her ears, for the price of sixpence, a pearl as beautiful in colour,
                    more elegant in form, lighter and easier to carry, and as much bigger as she
                    pleases, than the famous ones of Cleopatra and Servilla. In Scotland, as well as
                    in the East, the smooth and perfect shell rarely produces a pearl; the crooked
                    and distorted shell seldom wants one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Artificial</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Pearls.</hi> There
                    are methods of making artificial pearls, in such manner as to be with difficulty
                    distinguished from the best oriental. The ingredient used for this purpose was
                    long kept a secret; but it is now discovered to be a fine silver-like substance
                    found upon the under side of the scales of the blay or bleak fish. The scales,
                    taken off in the usual manner, are washed and rubbed with fresh parcels of
                    water, and the several liquors suffered to settle; after which the water being
                    poured off, the pearly matter, of the consistence of oil, remains at the bottom,
                    and is called by the French <hi rend="italic">essence d’orient.</hi> A little of
                    this is dropped into a hollow bead of bluish glass, and shaken about so as to
                    line the internal surface; after which the cavity is filled up with wax, to give
                    solidity and weight. Pearls made in this manner are distinguishable from the
                    natural only by their having fewer blemishes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mother-of-</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Pearl,</hi> the

                    alkaline salt, prepared chiefly in Germany, Russia, and Poland, by melting the
                    salts out of the ashes of burned wood, and, having reduced them to dryness,
                    evaporating the moisture, and, calcining them for a considerable time in a
                    furnace moderately heated. The goodness of pearl-ashes may be ascertained by a
                    uniform and white appearance; but they are nevertheless subject to a common
                    adulteration, not easily distinguishable by the mere appearance, and which is
                    done by the addition of common salt. Pearl-ashes are much used in the
                    manufacture of glass, and need no preparation, except where very great
                    transparency is required.</p>
