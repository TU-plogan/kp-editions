                <p><label type="entry">PHOENICIA, or more properly <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Phoenice</hi></label>, the ancient name of a country situated between the
                    thirty-fourth and thirty-sixth degrees of north latitude, being bounded by Syria
                    on the north and east, by Judaea on the south, and by the Mediterranean on the
                    west. How it obtained its name is not certainly known. Some derive it from one
                    Phoenix; and others from the Greek word <hi rend="italic">phoenix,</hi>
                    signifying a <hi rend="italic">palm</hi> or <hi rend="italic">date,</hi> as that
                    tree abounded in the country. Some suppose that Phoenice was originally a
                    translation of the Hebrew word <hi rend="italic">Edom,</hi> from the Edomites
                    who fled thither in the days of David. By the contraction of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">Canaan</hi> it was also called <hi rend="italic">Chna,</hi> and
                    anciently <hi rend="italic">Rhabbothin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Colpitis.</hi>
                    The Jews commonly named it <hi rend="italic">Canaan;</hi> though some part of
                    it, at least, was known to them by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syrophoenice.</hi> Bochart tells us, that the most probable etymology is <hi
                    rend="italic">Phene Anak,</hi> the descendants of Anak. Such were the names
                    peculiar to this small country, though Phoenice was sometimes extended to all
                    the maritime countries of Syria and Judaea, and Canaan to that of the
                    Philistines, and even of the Amalekites. On the contrary, all these names were
                    superseded by those of Palestine and Syria.</p>
                <p>There is some disagreement amongst authors respecting the northern limits of this
                    country. Ptolemy states the river Eleutherus as the boundary of Phoenice to the
                    north; but Pliny, Mela, and Stephanus, place it in the island of Aradus, to the
                    northward of that river. Strabo observes, that some considered the river
                    Eleutherus as the boundary of Seleucis, on the side of Phoenice and Coelesyria.
                    On the coast of Phoenice, and south of the river Eleutherus, stood the cities of
                    Simyra, Orthosia, Tripolis, Botrys, Byblus, Palaebyblus, Berytus, Sidon,
                    Sarepta, Tyrus, and Palaetyrus.</p>
                <p>According to Ptolemy, Phoenice extended even beyond Mount Carmel; for that
                    geographer places in Phoenice not only Ecdippa and Ptolemais, but Sycaminum and
                    Daera, which are situated to the southward of that mountain. But these towns,
                    properly speaking, belonged to Palestine. We will not take upon us to mark out
                    the bounds of the midland Phoenice. Ptolemy reckons in it the towns of Area,
                    Palaebyblus, Gabala, and Caesaria Paniae. This province was considerably
                    extended in the early times of Christianity, when, being considered as a
                    province of Syria, it included not only Damascus, but also Palmyra.</p>
                <p>The Phoenicians were governed by kings; and their territory, small as it was,
                    included several kingdoms, namely, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193496950"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-6950-0451"/>those of Sidon, Tyre, Aradus, Berytus, and Byblus.
                    In this particular they imitated and adhered to the primitive government of
                    their forefathers, who, like the other Canaanites, were under many petty
                    princes, to whom they allowed the sovereign dignity, reserving to themselves the
                    natural rights and liberties of mankind. Of their civil laws no remnant has been
                    preserved.</p>
                <p>With regard to religion, the Phoenicians were the most gross and abominable
                    idolaters. The Baal-berith, Baalzebub, and Baal-samen, mentioned in Scripture,
                    were some of the Phoenician gods; as were Moloch, Ashtaroth, and Thammuz, also
                    mentioned in the sacred writings. The word <hi rend="italic">Baal,</hi> in
                    itself an appellative, was no doubt applied to the true God, until he rejected
                    it on account of its being so much profaned by the idolaters. The name was not
                    appropriated to any particular deity amongst the idolatrous nations, but was
                    common to many; it was generally imagined, however, that one supreme God
                    presided over all the rest. Amongst the Phoenicians this deity was named <hi
                    rend="italic">Baal-samen,</hi> but the Hebrews would have called him <hi
                    rend="italic">Baal-shemirn,</hi> or the God of heaven. In all probability this
                    was also the principal Carthaginian deity, although his Punic name is unknown.
                    Many religious rites of the Carthaginians have been handed down to us by the
                    Greek and Roman writers; but they all bestowed the names of their own gods upon
                    those of the Carthaginians, a circumstance which leads us to a knowledge of the
                    correspondence between the characters of the Phoenician and the European
                    deities. The principal deity of Carthage was, according to Diodorus Siculus,
                    Chronos or Saturn; and the sacrifices offered up to him were children of the
                    best families. We also learn, that the Carthaginians had a brazen statue or
                    colossus of this god, the hands of which were extended in the act of receiving,
                    and bent downwards in such a manner that the child laid thereupon immediately
                    fell down into a hollow where there was a nery furnace. It is added, that this
                    inhuman practice seemed to confirm a tradition handed down to the Greeks from
                    remote antiquity, that Saturn devoured his own children.</p>
                <p>The goddess Coelestis, or Urania, was held in the highest veneration by the
                    Carthaginians. She is supposed to have been the same with the queen of heaven
                    mentioned in Jeremiah, or the Juno Olympia of the Greeks. According to
                    Hesychius, the same word, in the Punic language, was applied both to Juno and
                    Venus; nay, the ancient Greeks frequently confound Juno, Venus, and Diana or the
                    moon, which is to be attributed to the Egyptians and Phoenicians, from whom they
                    received their system of religion, and who in the most ancient times appear to
                    have had but one name for them all. Besides these there were several other
                    deities, who were worshipped amongst the Phoenicians, particularly those of
                    Tyre, and consequently amongst the Carthaginians. These were Jupiter, Apollo,
                    Mars, and Bacchus. Jupiter was worshipped under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Belus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Baal;</hi> to him they addressed their oaths.;
                    and his name they placed at the head of their treaties. Apollo or the Sun went
                    either by this name simply, or by others of which it formed a part.</p>
                <p>The Carthaginian superstition, however, was not confined to these deities alone.
                    They worshipped the fire, the air, and the other elements, and had a multitude
                    of local gods. Nay, they paid divine honours to the spirits of their heroes, and
                    even to men and women whilst yet in life; and in this adoration Hannibal had for
                    some time a share, notwithstanding the infamous conduct which his countrymen
                    showed towards him at last. In order to worship these gods with more
                    convenience, the Carthaginians had a kind of portable temples. These were
                    covered chariots, in which were small images representing their favourite
                    deities, and which were drawn by oxen. They served also as a kind of oracle, and
                    their responses were understood by the motion impressed upon the vehicle. The
                    tabernacle of Moloch is supposed to have been a machine of this kind; and it is
                    not improbable that the whole was derived from the tabernacle of the Jews in the
                    wilderness.</p>
                <p>Besides all the deities above mentioned, we find another, named the <hi
                    rend="italic">Baemon</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> of Carthage, which is
                    mentioned in the treaty made by Philip of Macedonia and Hannibal. What this
                    deity was we know not; but it may be observed, that the pagan world in general
                    believed in the existence of daemons, or intelligences who had a kind of middle
                    nature between gods and men, and to whom the administration of the world was in
                    a great measure committed. Hence it is no wonder that they should have received
                    religious honours; for when once mankind were possessed with the opinion that
                    they were the ministers of the gods, and trusted with the dispensation of their
                    favours, as well as the infliction of their punishments, it is natural to
                    suppose that they would be desirous of making their addresses to these
                    beings.</p>
                <p>Much has been said of their arts, sciences, and manufactures; but as all that we
                    find concerning them is couched in general terms, we cannot enter into
                    particulars. The Sidonians, under which denomination we comprehend the
                    Phoenicians in general, were a people of most happy genius. They were from the
                    beginning addicted to philosophical exercises of the mind; insomuch that a
                    Sidonian, by name Moschus, taught the doctrine of atoms before the Trojan war,
                    and Abomenus of Tyre puzzled Solomon by the subtilty of his questions. Phoenice
                    continued to be one of the seats of learning, and in later times both Tyre and
                    Sidon produced their respective philosophers; namely, Boethus and Diodatus of
                    Sidon, Antipater of Tyre, and Apollonius of the same place, who gave an account
                    of the writings and disciples of Zeno. As to their manufactures, the glass of
                    Sidon, the purple of Tyre, and the fine linen they wove, were the products of
                    their own country, and their own invention; and for their extraordinary skill in
                    working metals, in hewing timber and stone, and their perfect knowledge of what
                    was solid, great, and ornamental in architecture, we need only remind the reader
                    of the large share which they had in erecting and decorating the temple at
                    Jerusalem under their king Hiram. Their fame for taste, design, and ingenious
                    invention, was such, that whatever was elegant, great, or pleasing, whether in
                    apparel, in vessels, or in toys, was distinguished by way of excellence by the
                    epithet of Sidonian.</p>
                <p>The Phoenicians were likewise celebrated merchants, navigators, and planters of
                    colonies in foreign parts. As merchants, they may be said to have engrossed all
                    the commerce of the western world; as navigators, they were the boldest, the
                    most experienced, and the greatest discoverers of ancient times, and for many
                    ages they had ho rivals. In planting colonies they exerted themselves so much
                    that, considering their territory was little more than the slip <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> land situated between Mount Lebanon and the sea, it is
                    surprising how they could furnish such supplies of people, and not wholly
                    depopulate their native country.</p>
                <p>It is generally supposed that the Phoenicians were induced to deal in foreign
                    commodities by their neighbourhood to the Syrians, who were perhaps the most
                    ancient of those who carried on a considerable and regular trade with the
                    nations farther to the east. And this conjecture appears at least probable; for
                    their own territory was but small, and little able to afford any considerable
                    exports, if we except manufactures; but that their manufactures were
                    considerable until they began to turn all the channels of trade into their own
                    country, it is difficult to believe. In Syria, which was a large country, they
                    found store of productions of the natural growth of the soil, whilst many choice
                    and useful commodities were imported from the East. Thus, having a safe coast,
                    with convenient harbours on one side, and excellent materials for ship-building
                    on the other; perceiving how acceptable many commodities which Syria furnished
                    would be in foreign parts, and being stimulated by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193496963" xml:id="kp-eb0717-6963-0452"/>the example of the Syrians;
                    they turned all their thoughts to trade and navigation, and by an uncommon
                    application soon eclipsed their masters in that art.</p>
                <p>It were in vain to discourse of the Edomites who fled hither in David’s time, or
                    to inquire why Herodotus supposed that the Phoenicians came from the Red Sea.
                    That some of the Edomites fled into this country in the days of David, and that
                    they were a trading people, is very evident; but what improvements they brought
                    with them into Phoenice it is hard to say, and it is not less difficult to
                    ascertain their numbers. In all probability they brought with them a knowledge
                    of the Red Sea, and of the southern parts of Arabia, Egypt, and Ethiopia, and by
                    their information made the Phoenicians acquainted with those coasts; and by
                    these means the latter were enabled to undertake voyages to those parts, for
                    Solomon, and Pharaoh-Necho, king of Egypt.</p>
                <p>Their whole thoughts were employed about schemes for advancing their commerce.
                    They affected no empire but that of the sea, and appeared to aim at nothing but
                    the peaceable enjoyment of their trade. This they extended to all the known
                    parts they could reach; to the British Islands, commonly understood by the
                    Cassiterides; to Spain, and other places in the ocean both within and without
                    the Straits of Gibraltar; and, in general, to all the ports of the
                    Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the Palus Maeotis or Sea of Azof. In all these
                    parts they had founded settlements, whence they drew whatever was useful to
                    themselves, or might prove so to others; and thus they enjoyed the three great
                    branches of trade, as it is commonly divided into importation, exportation, and
                    transportation. Such appears to have been their trade by sea; and as to that
                    which they carried on by land in Syria, Mesopotamia, Assyria, Babylonia, Persia,
                    Arabia, and even in India, it was not less extensive, and may give us an idea of
                    what this people once was, and how deservedly their merchants are mentioned in
                    Scripture as equal to princes. Their country was at that time the great
                    warehouse, where every thing that could administer either to the necessities or
                    luxury of mankind was to be found; and all this they distributed as they judged
                    best for their own interest. The purple of Tyre, the glass of Sidon, and the
                    fine linen made in this country, together with curious pieces of art in metals
                    and wood, appear to have been the chief and almost only commodities of Phoenice
                    itself. Indeed their territory was so small, that it is not to be imagined they
                    could afford to export any products of their own growth.</p>
                <p>Having thus spoken in general terms of the trade of the Phoenicians, we shall now
                    touch upon their shipping, and some things remarkable in their navigation. Their
                    larger vessels were of two sorts, being divided into round ships or gauli, and
                    long ships, galleys, or triremes. When they drew up in line of battle, the gauli
                    were disposed at a small distance from each other in the wings, or in the van
                    and the rear; whilst their triremes were contracted together in the centre. If
                    at any time they observed that a stranger kept them company in their voyage, or
                    followed in their track, they were sure to get rid of him if they could, or
                    deceive him if possible; and in this policy they went so far, as to venture the
                    loss of their ships, and even their lives, so jealous were they of foreigners,
                    and so tenaciously bent upon keeping the whole trade to themselves. To
                    discourage other nations from engaging in commerce, they practised piracy, or at
                    least pretended to be at war with such as they met when they thought themselves
