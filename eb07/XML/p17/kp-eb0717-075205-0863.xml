                <p><label type="entry">PITCAIRNE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Archibald</hi></label>, a
                    physician of great eminence, was born at Edinburgh on the 25th of December 1652.
                    FIis father, Alexander Pitcairne, who was engaged in trade, and became one of
                    the city magistrates, derived his lineage from the ancient family of Pitcairne
                    of Pitcairne in the county of Fife. His mother, whose name was Sydserf, belonged
                    to a good family in the county of Haddington, descended from Sydserf of Ruthlaw.
                    After having been initiated in classical learning at Dalkeith school, he was
                    sent to the university of Edinburgh in 1668, being then sixteen years of age. ln
                    1671 he took the degree of A. Μ. It was the wish of his family that he should
                    devote himself to the study of divinity: but for the office of a minister he
                    seems to have had no vocation; and his father, not without some degree of
                    reluctance, permitted him to direct his next views to the profession of law. To
                    this new pursuit he betook himself with all the ardour of a young and ambitious
                    mind; but his intensity of application produced such an effect upon his health,
                    that the physicians, apprehensive of his being visited with consumption, advised
                    him to try the effect of a residence in the south of France.</p>
                <p>On his arrival at Paris, he found his health so much improved, that he judged it
                    unnecessary to visit Montpellier; and after having formed some pleasant
                    acquaintances among his young countrymen engaged in the study of physic, he
                    determined to prosecute his own studies without seeking for any other school.
                    They however persuaded him that Paris could not boast of any able professors of
                    law; and he was easily induced to listen to their advice of relinquishing all
                    thoughts of the bar.</p>
                <p>Scire potestates herbarum usumque medendi Maluit, et mutas agitare inglorius
                    artes.</p>
                <p>After he had for several months attended the hospitals, his father deemed it
                    expedient to recall his wandering footsteps. He accordingly returned to
                    Scotland; and being in this state of preparation for any one of the learned
                    professions, divinity, law, or physic, he continued to enlarge his fund of
                    knowledge, and to cultivate his excellent talents. The mathematical sciences
                    were however his favourite pursuit; and this propensity is supposed to have been
                    fostered by his intimacy with David Gregory, who became professor of mathematics
                    at Edinburgh, and afterwards Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford. Of his
                    learned friend Dr Gregory, who belonged to a very remarkable family, he has made
                    honourable mention in his works. In this department of study, we are informed,
                    “he made a great progress in a short time; and meeting with the lately invented
                    method of infinite series, he made some improvements thereon, which were
                    afterwards published by Dr Wallis.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Biographia Britannica, vol. v. p. 33G0.</p></note> He is
                    further said to have perceived the necessary connexion between physic and
                    geometry, and thus to have fixed his choice unalterably upon that
                    profession.</p>
                <p>He now applied himself to the study of botany, pharmacy, and materia medica, in
                    which branches he could at that time receive no public instruction in Edinburgh.
                    It appears to have been the usual method to attend the private instructions of
                    some established practitioner. In the year 1675 he returned to Paris; and having
                    prosecuted his studies with great ardour and success, he took the degree of Μ.
                    D. at Reims on the 13th of August 1680. He entered upon his professional career
                    in his native city; and of the Royal College of Physicians, incorporated by a
                    charter bearing date the 29th of November 1681, he was one of the original
                    fellows. His talents and learning were such as could not fail to attract the
                    attention of those among whom he lived. He was a scholar and a wit, as well as a
                    man of science; and he so completely deserted the beaten track of medical
                    speculation, that he was soon regarded as no ordinary? character.</p>
                <p>After his first settlement in Edinburgh, he married Margaret the daughter of
                    Colonel James Hay of Pitfour. She bore him a son and a daughter; but the mother
                    and her children did not long survive, and he devoted an elegiac poem to her
                    memory. He continued to rise in professional reputation; and this was greatly
                    encreased by the publication of his “Solutio Problematis de Inventoribus,” which
                    was printed at Edinburgh in 1688, and again at Leyden in 1693. The object of
                    this tract is to vindicate to Harvey the honour of having discovered the
                    circulation of the blood; an honour of which many attempts had been made to
                    deprive him. According to the notion of Vander Linden, and various other
                    writers, this great fact in the animal economy was known to Hippocrates; but
                    their opinion is very scientifically refuted by Dr Pitcairne. There seems to be
                    much more reason to believe that the unfortunate Servetus “had imperfect
                    glimmerings of that light which afterwards Dr Harvey communicated with so bright
                    a lustre to the learned world.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Learning, p. xxiii. 210. 3d edit. Lond. 1705, 8vo.</p></note></p>
                <p>An attempt to found a medical school in the university had been made in the year
                    1685. The first professor in that faculty was Sir Robert Sibbald, who was
                    appointed on the 24th of March. Dr Halket and Dr Pitcairne were appointed on the
                    9th of September; but it has not been ascertained that they read any lectures.
                    Of the estimation in which Pitcairne was held, we find a more striking proof in
                    the circumstance of his being invited by the curators of the university of
                    Leyden to accept a professorship of physic. Of this invitation he did not
                    hesitate to avail himself; and his inaugural oration was delivered on the 26th
                    of April 1692.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Archibald

                    was highly applauded, and the ordinary salary of his professorship was augmented
                    by one half. We however learn from a passage in Bayle’s correspondence, that his
                    lectures were too abstruse, and contained too large an infusion of geometry, to
                    be altogether popular.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    little more than a year, during which he read lectures on the works of Bellini,
                    such as were then published. While he was professor here, he printed several
                    dissertations which were drawn from his lectures: in these he attempts to
                    explain the circulation of the blood, and some of the principal parts of the
                    animal oeconomy mechanically, as had been done by Bellini, whom he places next
                    to Harvey upon the bench of inventors of physic.” Lorenzo Bellini, who was a
                    professor in the university of Pisa, testified his gratitude by dedicating to
                    Pitcairne a collection of his Opuscula.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Laurentii Bellini Opuscula aliquot, ad Archibaldum

                    date. A long and remarkable dedication, “Viro meritissimo Arcliibaldo
                    Pitcarnio,” is dated at Florence on the 20th of March J693. It commences thus:
                    “Rapiunt me mores tuí, vir meritissime; tua enim illa to gerendi ratio, qua me
                    per literas compellare voluisti, ad omnem optimi et magni viri speciem est ita

                    quod fuerit tam apte factum ad genium meum.” In this dedication he introduces
                    Pitcairne’s letter, dated at Leyden on the 22d of June 1692.</p></note> One of
                    his pupils at Leyden was Dr Mead, who always retained the highest regard.for his
                    master.</p>
                <p>Before he quitted Edinburgh, he had made an engagement to marry a daughter of Sir
                    Archibald Stevenson, one of the king’s physicians. In the course of the year
                    1693 he accordingly returned, with the intention of fulfilling his promise, and
                    immediately resuming his academical duties; but the reluctance of the parents to
                    part with their daughter, placed him in a situation of embarrassment, as he was
                    neither disposed to relinquish the professorship nor the young lady. He however
                    adopted the former alternative; and having married Elizabeth Stevenson, he
                    resigned his chair, and finally settled in Edinburgh, where he speedily found
                    himself engaged in very extensive practice. He acquired the reputation of a very
                    skilful practitioner, and indeed his name became more celebrated than that of
                    any other physician then residing in Great Britain. In addition to his more
                    ordinary employment, he received frequent consultations from England, and even
                    from Holland.</p>
                <p>With this extensive practice his time was so much occupied, that it did not leave
                    him any abundant leisure for other pursuits. He however continued to gratify his
                    taste by the composition of Latin verses, which were alike calculated to please
                    his friends, and to expose his enemies. His satirical propensities, added to his
                    unrivalled success in a lucrative profession, rendered his enemies somewhat
                    numerous. The violence of his prejudices as a Jacobite and an episcopalian must
                    have had no tendency to recommend him to the best supporters of the existing
                    government. But his friends were likewise numerous; and he pursued his career
                    with great alacrity, and apparently with a great disregard of personal
                    animadversion.</p>
                <p>He was fiercely attacked in a little volume, published under the title of “<hi
                    rend="italic">Apollo</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathematicus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> or the Art of Curing Diseases by the Mathematicks, according to the

                    according to the Principles of the same Author.”. Printed in the year 1695, 8vo.
                    This sarcastic work, according to the statement of Dr Oliphant, was the
                    production of Dr, afterwards Sir Edward Eyzat.<note anchored="true"

                    and spelling, not to know that it is Dr Eyzat’s.”</p></note> It was speedily
                    followed by “Tarrugo Unmasked; or an Answer to a late Pamphlet intituled <hi
                    rend="italic">Apollo</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathematicus,</hi> by George Hepburn,
                    M.D. and Member of the Colledge of Phisicians at Edinburgh. To which is added by
                    Doctor Pitcairne, the Theory of the internal Diseases of the Eye demonstrated
                    mathematically.” Edinb. 1695, 4to. This title bears an allusion to “Tarugo’s
                    Wiles, or the Coffee-House, a Comedy,” written by Thomas Sydserf, or St Serfe,
                    and printed at London in the year 1668. The author of the first tract escaped
                    without any censure from the College of Physicians, of which he was likewise a
                    fellow; but Dr Hepburn, who had been Pitcairne’s pupil, and who then resided in
                    Haddington, was not treated with the same degree of forbearance. On the 7th of
                    November a committee was appointed to examine his pamphlet, and on the 3d of
                    December he was suspended from the exercise of his right to sit and vote as a
                    fellow. The proceedings against him appear to have been very arbitrary and
                    irregular: “though a day was allowed him to answer a libel to be given him, and
                    six free days to see it, yet before any libel was given him, or the day of
                    compearance come,’ they hastened to pass a vote of suspension. During the
                    interval, namely on the 18th of November, Dr Pitcairne had tendered a protest
                    against the admission of certain fellows, one of whom was Eyzat, as having been
                    conducted in an irregular manner. It was then referred to a committee, who on
                    the 22d delivered a report, “that the protestation given in and subscribed by Dr
                    Pitcairn was a calumnious, scandalous, false, and arrogant paper ;” and the
                    meeting having unanimously approved of this report, did thereupon suspend him
                    “from voting in the college, or sitting in any meeting thereof.” It was even
                    proposed to prohibit him from the practice of physic. At the meeting which
                    suspended Dr Hepburn, four fellows, Melville, Eccles, Oliphant, and Smelholme,
                    were ordered “to compear next day, to hear and see themselves suspended, for
                    adhering to the protestation presented by Dr Pitcairn.” The object of all this
                    indecent violence was to deprive them of the right of voting at the ensuing
                    election; “but they having presented a bill of advocation, and obtained a sist
                    for some days, in which the day of election was included, that project was
                    baulked.” A double election ensued: Dr Trotter was re-elected president by his
                    adherents, while the opposite party elected Sir Archibald Stevenson. The meeting
                    was attended by one of the bailies; and Pitcairne was removed by the
                    town-officers, after having protested against this unwarrantable interference.
                    He and his friends withdrew to Stevenson’s house, and there elected the
                    president and other officebearers for the ensuing year. These violent
                    animosities produced several applications to the privycouncil and the court of
                    session. Another fierce contention arose from the question of publishing a
                    Dispensatory, which had been prepared under the sanction of the college.
                    Stevenson’s party opposed its publication, on the ground of its being “barely a
                    transcript of the London one, ill copied, and worse explained.” Dr Pitcairne was
                    attacked in a virulent pamphlet, which charged him with the inconsistency of
                    having written a commendatory preface to a book which he afterwards represented

                    of the seven were disposed to avail themselves of this second opportunity. On
                    the 4th of January 1704 an act of oblivion was proposed by the president, Dr
                    Dundas, and was received with unanimous approbation. It was confirmed at two
                    subsequent meetings, held on the 11th and 12th of the same month. After this
                    period Pitcairne resumed his seat in the college; but after the 6th of March

                <p>Other learned bodies had treated him with more respect. On the /th of August 1699
                    the university of Aberdeen conferred upon him the degree of Μ. D. On the 16th of
                    October 1701 the College of Surgeons admitted him a fellow. This last honour,
                    which was unsolicited, had never been bestowed upon any other physician. He was
                    gratified by so unusual a mark of respect, and attended the meetings of the
                    college. He appears to have retained his station as a professor in the
                    university. After the appointment of Carstares to the office of principal, which
                    took place in the year 1703, he was regular in his attendance when the Latin
                    oration was annually delivered at the opening of the session. Between the
                    principal and the professor there was no sympathy of political feeling; but
                    Pitcairne “used to observe that when Mr Carstares began to address his audience,
                    he could not help fancying himself transported to the forum in the days of
                    antient Rome.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Sir Robert Sibbald was one of those who chiefly felt the edge of his sarcastic
                    humour. He was a man considerable for his learning, and is still remembered as
                    an industrious labourer in the department of Scotish antiquities: but he was
                    neither conspicuous for the strength of his judgment nor the elegance of his
                    taste; and with the weapons of wit and sarcasm he was but an unequal match for
                    Dr Pitcairne. He was a member of the committee which prepared so strong a report
                    against the protest; and he incurred the suspicion of having had some concern in
                    the publication of Apollo Mathematicus. In the preface to Dr Hepburn’s answer,
                    he is designated in a manner sufficiently intelligible: “W hoever Tarrugo be,
                    yet it’s known that the papers which I call Tarrugo’s were revised, corrected,
                    and approven by one who twice in one year changed his religion, upon how honest
                    and religious principles, I doe not determine.” During the reign of the late
                    popish king, Sibbald had been induced by the earl of Perth, lord chancellor, to
                    change his religion; but having more maturely studied the controversy between
                    the two churches, he returned to the profession of the faith which he had
                    renounced.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Burnet’s

                    following allusion:</p>
                <p>Dum procul a Geneva se summovet inclyta Roma, Quod quam sit longum scit Cyphianus
                    iter.</p>
                <p>Sibbald, who is thus styled Cyphianus in allusion to his villa of Kipps, was a
                    man of too much candour and moderation to approve of all the violent measures
                    which brought so much discredit on the College of Physicians; and when the
                    president, Dr Sinclair, and only five fellows, had in a very summary manner
                    suspended Stevenson and several others, he concurred with Sir Thomas Burnet in
                    preparing a formal declaration against such unwarrantable proceedings. It is
                    dated on the 20th of Novembér 1699. In the year 1684 he had published a folio
                    volume entitled “Scotia Illustrata, sive Prodromus Historiae Naturalis.” This
                    work was attacked, with sufficient violence, in a tract of nearly a hundred
                    pages, « Archibaldi Pitcarnii Dissertatio de Legibus Historiae Naturalis.”
                    Edinb. 1696, 8vo. As this title includes the author’s name at length, it is not
                    easy to explain the origin of Dr Webster’s statement that the work was published
                    anonymously. Charges of plagiarism, ignorance, and something little short of
                    stupidity, are plentifully scattered through the dissertation. Nor is the knight
                    of Kipps the only individual who is here subjected to his animadversion: he has
                    likewise bestowed some castigation on Dr Cockburn, of whose treatise on the
                    animal economy he avers, that it contains nothing new but what the author has
                    either borrowed from Bellini or himself, although he has never mentioned the
                    name of the one or of the other. After a long interval appeared “A Letter from
                    Sir R</p>
                <p>S to Dr Archibald Pitcairn.” Edinb. 1709, 8vo.</p>
                <p>The author, whoever he may have been, attacks various positions in the medical
                    dissertations of his antagonist. This publication was speedily followed by “A
                    Letter from Dr James Walkinshaw to Sir Robert Sibbald.” Lond. 1709, 8vo. The
                    writer’s name is known to be supposititious; and, according to a contemporary
                    notice preserved in a copy of the pamphlet, it was understood to be written by
                    Dr Bower with the assistance of Dr Pitcairne. The internal evidence is
                    sufficient to convince us that the other tract was not written by Sibbald, of
                    whose name it exhibits the initials. This answer ascribes it in the most
                    unequivocal terms to Dr Cockburn, of whose reputation as a medical writer it
                    indeed contains a zealous defence. Both tracts include various topics of
                    mathematical controversy. Sibbald at length interfered in the controversy, by
                    publishing “Vindiciae Scotiae Illustratae, sive Prodromi Naturalis Historiae
                    Scotiae, contra Prodromomastiges, sub larva Libelli de Legibus Historiae
                    Naturalis latentes.” Edinb. 1710, fol. According to a statement contained in
                    this work, Dr Pitcairne’s dissertation had been so carefully suppressed, that
                    for twelve years after its first impression, his antagonist was unable to
                    procure a copy either for love or money. He mentions it as the joint production
                    of several individuals; and moreover avers, what is pointedly denied in a
                    private letter,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    letter accompanied a copy of Sibbald’s Vindiciae, sent to Dr Gray of London:

                    ever saw. ‘ Scribit et in tergo, necdum finivit.’ The author gave me 3 copies in

                    to prefix a parenetic ode, not very poetical, in which the talents of Pitcairne
                    are mentioned in terms of no parcimonious commendation.</p>
                <p>Dr Pitcairne had published seven medical dissertations in a separate form; and to
                    these he added another, and collected them into a volume, bearing the title of
                    “Archibald! PitcarniiDissertationes Medicae.” Roterodami, 1701, 4to. The volume,
                    dedicated to Bellini, was inaccurately printed in consequence of the author’s
                    distance from the press. Not long afterwards it was assailed in a “Dissertatio
                    de Salute quam ferunt Aegrotantibus Dissertationes Archibald! Pitcarnii.” Edinb.
                    1702, fol. This anonymous dissertation, it was sufficiently ascertained, was the
                    production of Dr Oliphant, whom he had formerly ranked among his friends. An
                    answer, written in English, was immediately published by some individual, who
                    conceals his name, and exhibits the initials J. J. The author of the
                    dissertation replied without delay, nor did his adversary leave him in

                    letter which Dr Drummond addressed to him soon after the death of Pitcairne, we
                    find the subsequent passage: “I cannot but admire and applaud your steady and
                    constant adherence to him in his greatest difficulties, and in the weakness and
                    infirmities of old age. What excellent things you have done in his defence, are
                    particularly known to me; and if they are as well understood by the learned
                    world, they would certainly set your true merits in a clear light, and eternally
                    recommend your unspotted fidelity and friendship.” These expressions are
                    evidently applicable to unavowed services, and they appear too strong to be
                    merely applicable to his pamphlet against Cockburn. The two tracts in
                    controversy with Oliphant bear internal evidence of having been written by a
                    mathematician. On the same occasion, another tract was written by Dr Cheyne, who

                <p>About this period of his life, he was involved in proceedings of a different
                    nature. In a private letter addressed to his friend Dr Gray, a physician in
                    London, he had testified his Jacobitical zeal by giving a highly-coloured and
                    exaggerated statement of some transactions connected with a petition for
                    assembling a parliament. This letter appears to have been intercepted, and to
                    have been transmitted to the crown lawyers, who prosecuted the writer before
                    that anomalous tribunal the privy council, on a charge of “leising making.”
                    According to the record, “he falsely represents that the said address for the
                    parliament goes on unanimously throw the whole nation, and that only a few
                    courtiers and presbyterian ministers oppose it, but in vain, and that twice so
                    many have signed since the proclamation anent petitioning as signed it before;
                    and bids him take notice that there is one sent to court with a title different,
                    to beguile the elect of the court, if it were possible; and that all the
                    corporationes and all the gentlemen have signed the address, and himselfe among
                    the rest; and, by Jove, it would, produce a nationall and universali</p>
                <p>This blank, it is subsequently stated, “cannot from such premisses be construed
                    to have a less import then a nationall and universali overturning.” On the 25th
                    of January 1700 he appeared before the board, attended by David Dalrymple, David
                    Cunningham, and James Nasmyth, his counsel learned in the law. The lord advocate
                    and solicitor general were likewise present. A petition was presented by the
                    defendant, “acknowledging his fault and folly in writing the letter lybelled
                    upon, and declaring it was in cups, and without any design either against</p>
                <p>. his Majesty or the government, and absolutely submitting to the privy
                    councill.” He received a reprimand from the lord chancellor; and having
                    recovered the bond which he had previously given for his peaceable behaviour,
                    and for his appearance, whenever he should be required, before the privy
                    council, under the penalty of two hundred pounds sterling, he escaped from any
                    further consequences of this frivolous prosecution.</p>
                <p>In another action he appeared in the character of plaintiff. James Webster, one
                    of the ministers of Edinburgh, and Robert Freebairn, an eminent printer and
                    bookseller, “being accidentally in company of the magistrates, Mr Webster
                    complained that Freebairn in his auctions sold wicked and prohibited books, and
                    particularly Philostratus’s life of Apollonius Tyanaens, wherein that vile
                    impostor and magician is equalised, if not preferred to our blessed Saviour and
                    his miracles, and which were greedily bought up by atheists and deists; and Mr
                    Freebairn bidding him condescend, Mr Webster answered, Such as Doctor Pitcairn,
                    who is known to be a professed deist; and for farther proof of it, in that same
                    auction, many striving for that infamous book, one regretted that there were
                    none bidding for the Bible, the doctor scoffingly answered, that it was no
                    wonder it stuck in their hands, for ‘ verbum Dei manet in aeternum which was a
                    direct ridiculing the scriptures, and the Christian religion.” When the
                    bookseller communicated this information to Pitcairne, he lost no time in
                    bringing an action against Webster before the sheriff, “for the redress of that
                    atrocious injury, as tending to make him odious to all who own a God and
                    revealed religion, and to ruin and break his employment.” The action was removed
                    by advocation to the court of session; and on the 18th of July 1712, “the Lords
                    considered this process was managed with much zeal [apparently meaning heat, or
                    animosity], and that Mr Webster was willing to give reasonable satisfaction;
                    therefore, they recommend to the Justice Clerk, ordinary in the cause, to
                    endeavour to settle the parties amicably.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>These judicial records furnish sufficient confirmation of the traditionary
                    account, which imputes to Pitcairne the character of a profane jester. Dr
                    Hutcheson has thought proper to supply us with another example of his indecent
                    levity. “Many an orthodox Scotch presbyterian, which sect few accuse of
                    disregard for the holy scriptures, has been put to it to preserve his gravity,
                    upon hearing the application of scripture made by his countryman Dr Pitcairn, as
                    he observed a croud in the streets about a mason, who had fallen along with his
                    scaffold, and was over-whelmed with the ruins of the chimney which he had been
                    building, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500915" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0915-0756"/>and
                    which fell immediately after the fall of the poor mason; ‘ thessed are the dead
                    which die ip the Lord, for they rest from their labours, and their works follow
                    them.’”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hutcheson’s

                    on him who made, or who thus repeats the jest. “For the honour of the learned
                    physician’s memory,” says Dr Beattie, “I hope the story is not true. Such
                    wantonness of impiety, and such barbarity of insult, is no object of laughter,
                    but of horror. And I confess, I should have no good opinion of any presbyterian,
                    or of any person, who could find it difficult to preserve his gravity on hearing
                    it.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Beattie’s Essay on

                <p>From these unedifying details, we return to the prosecution of his literary
                    history. His next publication was an ingenious lucubration, bearing the title of
                    “Epistola Archimedis ad Regem Gelonem, Albae Graecae reperta anno aerae
                    Christianae 1688.” This tract, consisting of 48 pages in octavo, has no imprint;
                    but a copy belonging to the library of the College of Physicians contains in
                    manuscript, “Amstelodami, typis Georgii Gallet, 1706.” After this period he
                    occupied himself with the preparation of a new edition of his dissertations; but
                    before he could finish his task, his health was so much impaired, that he found
                    himself incapable of effecting all that he intended. The edition was however
                    published a few months before his death: “Archibald! Pitcarnii Scoti
                    Dissertationes Medicae, quarum multae nunc primum prodeunt. Subjuncta est Thomae
                    Boeri, Μ. D. ad Archibaldum Pitcarnium Epistola, qua respondetur Libello
                    Astrucii Franci.” Edinb. 1713, 4to. This volume contains fourteen dissertations.
                    Prefixed is a dedication which the Jacobites must doubtless have construed in
                    their own way: “Deo suo et Principi opus hoc consecrat Archibaldus Pitcarnius
                    Scotus.” The author’s speculations on the subject of digestion had been
                    controverted by Astruc; and here he receives an elaborate answer from Dr Bower,
                    professor of mathematics in King’s College, Aberdeen. The writer was evidently a
                    man of learning, and Pitcairne has mentioned him in terms of particular
                    friendship. The preface to the volume contains an extract of a letter from the
                    second James Gregory, relating to the subject of contraction and compression, as
                    discussed by Astruc. Of these dissertations an English translation was soon
                    afterwards published by Dr Sewell and Dr Desaguliers.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Dr Pitcairne died on Friday the 20th of October 1713, in the sixty-first year of
                    his age. His remains were interred in Greyfriars churchyard, where his monument,
                    a plain stone, was repaired in 1800. By his second wife, who survived till the
                    year 1734, he left a son and four daughters. Before he attained the age of
                    majority, the son engaged in the rebellion of 1715; and having been imprisoned
                    in the Tower, he obtained his release in consequence of Dr Mead’s very earnest
                    intercession with Walpole. His letter, which mentions the father in terms of
                    high admiration and gratitude, appears to have been entrusted to the distressed
                    mother. Her son entered into the Dutch service; and, “on account of his own
                    merit, and the memory of his father, he would probably have arrived at great
                    promotion, had he not died soon after.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Four years after the death of the author, appeared “Archibald!, Pitcarnii Medici

                    Hagae Com. 1718, 4to. Of the first book the concluding chapter had already been
                    printed at the end of the Praxis Medica Boer-haaveana. The entire volume was
                    “printed from a copy compiled out of the notes that had been taken by some of
                    his pupils, together with some rough draughts taken from his papers, which, as
                    they were never revised by him, he was always very careful to suppress during
                    his life-time.” It is therefore evident that this work was produced under very
                    unfavourable circumstances. A collection of all his works in Latin prose, with
                    the addition of a few poems, was afterwards published, under the title of
                    “Archibald! Pitcarnii, Medici celeberrimi Scoto-Britanni, Opera omnia Medica.”

                <p>A posthumous production of a different class is commonly ascribed to the same
                    learned author: “The Assembly; a Comedy. By a Scots Gentleman.” Loud. 1722, 8vo.
                    After an interval of many years, the same drama was again printed, and without
                    any reference to a former edition: “The Assembly; or, Scotch Reformation; a
                    Comedy, as it was acted by the Persons in the Drama. Done from the original
                    manuscript, written in the year 1692.” Edinb. 1766, 12mo. This edition contains
                    a long preface, omitted in the first. Of the two editions, the Biographia
                    Dramatica, vol. ii. p. 40, has made two distinct comedies. The preface
                    represents this comedy as the composition of more than one author. “This play
                    was begun just after the king of France took Mons, as is clearly intimated in
                    the first scene; but, by reason of some gentlemens going to the country, who
                    were concerned in it, it lay dormant four months; then it was set about again,'
                    and was very soon compleated. We confess it was hastily huddled together; for we
                    were not a fortnight about the whole work, by reason of multitude of business
                    the authors were entangled in.” According to this account, Pitcairne is only
                    entitled to a share in the honour or discredit of such a production. It is a
                    rabid effusion of Jacobitism, less remarkable for wit and humour than for
                    ribaldry and profanity. He is likewise supposed to be the author of another
                    work, which has recently been edited by Mr Kinloch: “Babell; a Satirical Poem,
                    on the Proceedings of the General Assembly in the year <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >m.dc.xcii.”</hi> Edinb. 1830, 4to. The manuscript copies, of which several have
                    been preserved, bear the initials of his name. The poem relates to the same
                    subject as the comedy, and it evinces the same spirit of animosity to the Whigs
                    and presbyterians. The author’s rhymes are sufficiently familiar and
                    negligent.</p>
                <p>As a writer of Latin verses, he appears to much more advantage. Many of his poems
                    were printed in a fugitive form, but not published by himself. There is however

                    allusions to circumstances of too private a nature to admit of easy explanation,
                    after an interval of more than a century. Some of the allusions are explained by
                    himself, in a curious paper which has recently been printed for the first time;
                    others by Lord Hailes, in an article communicated to a periodical work.<note

                    was founded on very accurate and critical scholarship, entertained the design of
                    publishing an edition of Pitcairne’s Latin poems, with annotations; and some of
                    the materials which he collected have fortunately been preserved in this form.
                    Several of those poems were written in the name of Walter Danistone, who appears
                    to have been one of the author’s friends. His epitaph on Viscount Dundee was
                    translated by Dryden. Another of his poems became very conspicuously known by
                    the easy and elegant paraphrase of Prior, whom Dr Drummond has described as his
                    old comrade. It commences with these verses:</p>

                <p>The personal character of Dr Pitcairne has been variously represented. That he
                    was a man of a liberal and benevolent disposition, is sufficiently established
                    by the testimony of his contemporaries. “In the business of his profession,”
                    says Dr Sewell, “he was always ready to serve every one to the utmost of his
                    power, and even to contribute to their health at the danger of his own. He was a
                    man of too good sense to be a humourist in physic, or refuse attendance out of
                    pique, or prejudice, or affectation: he understood the value of life too well to
                    sacrifice it to caprice and humour. There is one thing more remarkable of him;
                    that he was not at all concerned about fees, and frighted from his duty by the
                    sight of poverty in his patient; nay, he went with greater chearfulness to those
                    from whom he could expect nothing but good will, than to persons of the highest
                    condition. Besides, in cases which seemed to require that assistance, he not
                    only gave away his skill and medicines, but extended his generosity for the
                    provision of other conveniences for the sick, and left the marks of his charity,
                    as well as of the liberality of his art, behind him. The virtue of charity was
                    really so much his own, in the use of it, that he contrived a most secret and
                    decent manner of conveying his benevolence, and relieved many who knew not their
                    benefactor. In short, he was one of the greatest and most useful men in his
                    profession this age has produced; of a free and universal genius, a good orator,
                    poet, and philosopher. He was of a pleasant, engaging humour. Life sate very
                    easy upon him in all its circumstances. He despised many, but hated none. He
                    loved his friends, and laughed at his enemies.” This characteristic account,
                    written in 1715, is confirmed by Dr Drummond, who soon after the death of
                    Pitcairne wrote in the following terms to their mutual friend Dr Bower: “Though
                    he got much money by his extraordinary skill and practice in physic, yet he did
                    not hoard up riches, but dealt liberally to his poor friends and relations, and
                    also gave frankly and generously to young men of good spirits, who were in
                    narrow circumstances. So he was not only a learned man, but a Maecenas too, and
                    an encourager of learning through the whole course of his life. His great care
                    and commiseration of the poor ought not to he omitted. He not only gave them
                    medicine freely, but money too, for their relief and support; and this kind of
                    charity is one of the best effects of pure and undefiled religion. Besides, he
                    did not spend all his money on his pleasure and freaks, but erected a most noble
                    library, which, for the great variety and excellent collection of books, is one
                    of the finest I have seen belonging to any private man in the kingdom.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Drummond’s letter may be
                    found in Mr Kinloch’s preface to Babell, p. îv.</p></note> After his death, his
                    library was purchased by the czar of Muscovy. In his personal habits, he appears
                    to have been somewhat inclined to jovialty. At that period, professional men
                    were more accustomed to frequent taverns than they are at present; and his poems
                    contain various allusions to bis social haunts and companions. Of the levity of
                    his conversational wit we have already seen more than one specimen. His profane
                    jests exposed him to the most injurious imputations, and he was very frequently
                    represented as a professed unbeliever. But whatever doubts might be entertained
                    as to the soundness of his creed, they are completely removed by his verses
                    written on Christmas-day; and Dr Drummond has stated that, during his last
                    illness, he continued in the greatest tranquillity of mind, and evinced just
                    apprehensions of God and religion. His political sentiments do not here seem to
                    require much notice. It is not easy to admire the political wisdom or moral
                    perception of a man whose heroes were King James, Viscount Dundee, and Sir
                    George Mackenzie.</p>
                <p>As a medical practitioner, he attained to much more extensive and lucrative
                    employment than any former physician resident in Scotland. He left behind him a
                    reputation which was not confined to his native country. He belongs to the
                    mathematical and mechanical school of physic; and, in the annals of medicine,
                    his name is honourably mentioned with those of Borelli, Bellini, and other great
                    masters of the -mathematicomedical art.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    He made some advances in completing Harvey’s speculations on the circulation of
                    the blood, and in explaining the process of secretion. He laboured with great
                    energy to explode the errors of former writers, who maintained the chemical
                    doctrines of a corrosive menstruum in the stômach, and a certain acidity in the
                    blood that required to be corrected by an alkali. If he relied too much on the
                    aid of mathematics as an instrument of medical science, he at least contributed,
                    by his conspicuous example, to recommend a clear and concise mode of reasoning,
                    to which preceding writers did not usually attain. Boerhaave, the most
                    illustrious of his successors in the chair at Leyden, bestowed very high
