                <p><label type="entry">PATRONAGE</label> is a real or heritable right, of a peculiar
                    nature, connected with ecclesiastical benefices,and of which the main privilege
                    is that of presenting a person to the bishop, presbytery, or other competent
                    ecclesiastical functionaries, in order to his being admitted, according to the
                    rules of the church, to the ecclesiastical office to which the benefice is
                    attached, and of being thereby inducted into the possession of the benefice.
                    This right had its origin in the choice by particular churches, or the
                    appointment by the prince on their application, of defenders of their rights and
                    patrimony. These were at first chosen from scholastics or lawyers, and
                    afterwards from nobles and men of arms, and were termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >patroni, defensores, et advocati</hi><hi rend="italic">ecclesiae,</hi> from
                    which last title comes the namejws <hi rend="italic">advocationis</hi> or
                    advowson, still applied to the right. Originally the privilege of presenting
                    formed no part of the right of the patrons, who were chiefly guardians of the
                    property of the church, with a certain interest in the funds, termed <hi
                    rend="italic">patronagium.</hi> In time, founders of churches, or those who
                    acquired right to be so considered by adding to the building or to the
                    endowment, came to be regarded as patrons; and the fourth council of Toledo, in
                    the seventh century, gave to the descendants of founders a right to see that the
                    incumbents did not embezzle or alienate the funds, to which the ninth council
                    (691) added the right of nominating the successor, confining this privilege,
                    however, to the original founder himself, without extending it to his heirs. The
                    office of patron soon became hereditary, but it would appear, from the Novels of
                    Justinian, that in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492972"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-2972-0145"/>his time the right of presentation was only
                    allowed to the descendants of founders in the case of oratories or private
                    chapels <hi rend="italic">(Nov.</hi> 123, c. 18), the privilege in regard to
                    churches being apparently confined to the original founder <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Nov.</hi> 57, c. 2). Subsequently, however, the right of presenting was
                    allowed to descendants in regard to churches also, which gradually became almost
                    universally patronale; and ultimately a rule was introduced into the canon law,
                    that where no right of patronage could be shown to exist, the benefice was to be
                    deemed subject to that of the pope as universal patron. The general character of
                    the right of patronage was the same in all the kingdoms where the canon law was
                    received; and although some partial modifications may have been admitted since
                    the Reformation in particular countries, its principal features remain
                    unchanged. We shall content ourselves with a sketch of it as it exists in the
                    northern portion of this island, which presents some peculiarities not
                    unattended with interest.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, as in the other countries of Christendom, the system of patronage,
                    as it existed under the canon law, became universally prevalent; but it is not
                    thought to have been introduced earlier than the tenth century. Before the
                    Reformation, however, a very great change had taken place in the condition of
                    the parochial benefices. A large proportion of these were from time to time
                    annexed or appropriated, by grant of the patrons, to bishoprics, abbacies,
                    priories, and other religious establishments. The benefices thus appropriated
                    were termed patrimonial, and were no longer the subjects of the right of
                    patronage. Such benefices were permanently filled by the bishops or religious
                    houses, who drew the tithes as titular rectors, whilst the cures were served
                    either by a member of the religious community to which the benefice was annexed,
                    or by a chaplain or curate having a salary paid him for his services, or at
                    times by a proper vicar drawing vicarage tithe, though in many cases the
                    vicarages also became appropriated as well as the parsonages. A check was
                    attempted to be opposed to this practice of annexation by a statute in the reign
                    of James III. (1471, c. 43); but so general had it been, that at the period of
                    the Reformation there were in Scotland only 262 non-appropriated parochial
                    benefices out of the whole number, consisting of about 940. These 262 were of
                    course the only patronale parochial benefices, and they were partly of laic
                    patronage and partly subject to that of bishops or other ecclesiastics. On the
                    Reformation, the benefices were generally retained by the Roman Catholic
                    incumbents; and in regard to abbacies and other prelacies (as the greater
                    benefices were termed), these were assumed to have fallen to the crown on the
                    abolition of the religious bodies to which they belonged, and were gradually
                    gifted by the crown, first by temporary titles, and ultimately by permanent
                    grant and erection into temporal lordships, to the nobles and persons of
                    influence about the court. The annexed churches of these prelacies were in
                    general totally unprovided for, the obligation to maintain a stipendiary
                    substitute, incumbent upon the religious establishment to which the benefice was
                    attached, not being fulfilled by the new lay proprietors. To provide a
                    maintenance to the ministers serving the cures of these churches, which
                    constituted the greater proportion of the whole parochial churches, the third of
                    the rents of all benefices, including abbacies and other prelacies, was directed
                    to be levied, to form a fund, out of which special grants might be made to such
                    ministers; but this fund of “thirds” was so misapplied, that in reality the
                    ministers were for many years dependent mainly on the voluntary contributions of
                    their congregations, or of individual proprietors in their parishes. For a
                    considerable period these stipendiary cures remained free from patronage; but
                    James VI., notwithstanding the remonstrances of the church, gradually erected
                    them into benefices, subject to the patronage of the respective lords of
                    erection, though, as Sir George Mackenzie, a high prerogative Iawyer of the
                    reign of Charles II., observes, “nothing could be so unjust or illegal as these
                    patronages were.”</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile, as far as regarded the patronale parochial benefices, it had
                    been enacted by a statute, passed in 1567, alongst with a series of acts
                    abolishing Popery and recognising the reformed church, that, whilst the
                    examination and admission of ministers were declared to be in the kirk, the
                    presentation of <hi rend="italic">laic</hi> patronages should be reserved to the
                    just and ancient patrons. There was no reservation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ecclesiastic</hi> patronages, and the lay patron was required, within six
                    months after he should come to the knowledge of the vacancy, to present a
                    qualified person to the superintendent or others having commission of the kirk
                    (who then executed the functions subsequently devolved upon presbyteries),
                    otherwise the right of presenting was to fall to the kirk. It was further
                    provided, that if the superintendent refused to admit the person presented by
                    the patron, the latter might appeal to the superintendent and ministers of the
                    province, in other words, to the provincial synod, and from them to the General
                    Assembly, “by whom,” the act bears, “the cause being decided, shall take end as
                    they decern and declare.” Small as was the number of unappropriated parochial
                    benefices or parsonages to which ministers might be appointed as rectors, these
                    were, in a great many instances, conferred upon persons not in the function of
                    the ministry at all; and, even in 1592, it is set forth in a statute of that
                    year, that these benefices had been generally “disponed to bairns and other
                    persons altogether unable for the said office and function.” To remedy th is
                    evil, all gifts of such benefices “to sik persons as are not in the function of
                    the ministry, or able to discharge the duty thereof,” are by the act declared to
                    be null, with an exception as to those conferred on senators of the College of
                    Justice (the judges of the supreme civil court); and by another statute of the
                    same year, establishing the presbyterian form of church government as it at
                    present exists, presentations were appointed to be directed to presbyteries,
                    which had been generally erected in 1581, with power to them to give collation;
                    but providing always, that they should be bound to receive and admit whatever
                    “qualified minister” should be presented by the king or laic patrons. The same
                    act provided that a previous statute of 1584, declaring the king’s supremacy
                    over all estates, as well V spiritual as temporal,” and that he and his councils
                    were judges competent over all persons spiritual or temporal, and in “all
                    causes,” should in no way be prejudicial “to the privilege that God has given to
                    the spiritual officebearers of the kirk,” in regard, amongst other matters, to
                    the “collation and deprivation of ministers.” In 16Í2 presbytery was abolished,
                    episcopal government restored, and the king’s supremacy in all matters spiritual
                    or temporal again unqualifiedly declared; and at the same time it was provided,
                    that if the bishop, to whom presentations were now to be directed, should refuse
                    to admit a “qualified minister” presented by the lawful patron, not only might
                    the patron retain the fruits of the benefice in his own hands, but letters of
                    horning might be obtained to compel the bishop, by the usual executorials of the
                    law, “to do his duty” in admitting the person presented. The remedy thus
                    provided applied only to the case of presentees who had been already admitted to
                    the function of the ministry, as appears also to have been the intent of the
                    provision as to the corresponding obligation on presbyteries to receive
                    presentees, contained in the act 1592, and the privilege of retaining the
                    stipend, provided also for the case of the presbytery’s refusal to admit a
                    qualified “minister,” in another act of the same year, which is generally viewed
                    as merely an additional clause of that termed the charter of presbytery; so that
                    there does not appear to have been any remedy for refusal to admit a pre <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193492985" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2985-0146"/> sentee not
                    already in orders, nor any compulsitor to compel even the bishops (who were
                    subject to legal diligence to enforce admission of a party ordained) to grant
                    ordination.</p>
                <p>In 1638 presbytery was restored, and the king’s supremacy in matters spiritual
                    disclaimed; and in 1642 his majesty agreed, that as to all crown patronages, he
                    would present one out of a list or leet, to be furnished by the presbytery, and
                    which they were to make up with the advice and consent of the greater part of
                    the parishioners. The practical result of this method was, that in all parishes
                    subject to the patronage of the crown, the particular individual for whom the
                    parish declared a preference generally obtained the presentation; and in 1649
                    patronage was altogether abolished by an act of the estates of parliament. By
                    this statute it was declared, that “whosoever should, upon the suit and calling
                    of the congregation, after due examination of their literature and conversation,
                    be admitted by any presbytery unto the exercise and function of the ministry in
                    any parish within this kingdom,” should, without any presentation, but simply
                    “by virtue of their admission,” be entitled to the stipend, manse, and glebe;
                    and in order that the proper interests of congregations and presbyteries, and
                    what should be accounted the congregation having such interest, might be
                    determined, it was recommended to the General Assembly “clearly to determine the
                    same, and to condescend upon a certain standing way for being a rule therein for
                    all time coming.” The General Assembly accordingly established a directory,
                    which in substance provided that the session of the congregation were to elect a
                    person, whom they were to nominate to the congregation; that if the people
                    acquiesced and consented, the matter was to be reported to the presbytery, who
                    were to take the party chosen on trials, and, if found qualified, to admit him;
                    that if the major part of the congregation dissented, the matter should in like
                    manner be reported to the presbytery, who were to order a new election, unless
                    they found the dissent to be founded on “causeless prejudices ;” but that if
                    only a minority dissented, the presbytery were, notwithstanding, to proceed to
                    the trials and settlement, unless relevant exceptions were verified to them.
                    Under this arrangement matters continued till the Restoration, when episcopacy,
                    the king’s supremacy in matters spiritual, and absolute patronage, were
                    re-established. These, again, were all done away at the Revolution, when the
                    presbyterian church government was restored, and the matter of the appointment
                    of ministers placed on a totally new footing. By the act 1690, c. 23, patrons
                    were deprived of the right of presentation, in consideration of a sum of six
                    hundred merks Scots (L.33. 6s. 8d. sterling), and of a right to all tithes in
                    the parishes of which they were patrons, to which no one else could show a
                    title. The six hundred merks were to be paid by the heritors of the parish, who
                    were entitled to consign the money, and compel the patron to execute a formal
                    renunciation; whilst the patron, on the other hand, had efficient remedies
                    afforded him for enforcing payment of the compensation. The patron’s right to
                    present, however, ceased from the date of the act, and the privilege became
                    competent to the new parties who were now to be intrusted with it, whether the
                    compensation was paid or not. These consisted of the heritors of the parish,
                    being Protestants, and the elders, who were jointly to propose a person to the
                    congregation, “to be either approven or disapproven by them and if the
                    congregation disapproved, the disapprovers were to give in their reasons to the
                    presbytery, by whose judgment the “calling and entry” of the minister was to be
                    determined. Under this statute only three or four parishes paid the compensation
                    money, and obtained renunciations from the patrons. The heritors and elders
                    being in possession of their privilege without payment, and not anticipating the
                    repeal of a statute considered as an essential part of the Revolution
                    settlement, naturally did not press payment of the sum, small though it was;
                    whilst the patrons, entertaining the hope of at some favourable opportunity
                    recovering their power, of course refrained from compelling payment, and
                    granting renunciations, and thereby, for a consideration so trifling, cutting
                    off that hope. The expectations of the patrons proved just, and in 1711, the
                    10th of Queen Anne, restoring their former rights, was passed. This measure,
                    which originated with the opponents of the protestant succession, was hurried
                    through the House of Commons before the members of the church were aware of it.
                    A deputation was, however, immediately despatched by the commission of Assembly,
                    who presented a remonstrance to the House of Lords, and offered every opposition
                    in their power, but unsuccessfully; and no subsequent efforts to obtain its
                    repeal, which were repeatedly renewed by the church, were of any avail. The
                    assembly for many years inserted in their instructions to their commission an
                    injunction to seize any favourable opportunity of applying to parliament for a
                    repeal of this statute; but in 1784, the practice of inserting such injunction
                    was discontinued, the majority of the clergy, now for a long period introduced
                    by means of patronage, having become favourable to its subsistence; and the
                    right still continues to rest upon the footing on which it was placed by the
                    10ch of Queen Anne. By that statute, patrons, with the exception of the few
                    cases where the six hundred merks had been paid, and renunciations obtained, had
                    their former privileges restored, whilst they were also allowed to retain the
                    rights to tithes granted them by the act 1690, as part of the compensation for
                    the privilege then taken from them; and the sovereign, in addition to the proper
                    crown patronages, acquired right to all those which had belonged to the bishops
                    and archbishops, having previously at the Revolution, without any statutory
                    authority, assumed possession, <hi rend="italic">jure coronae,</hi> of all the
                    tithes and property belonging to these dignitaries.</p>
                <p>The right of patronage, as now existing, is an heritable right, which may be
                    feudalized, and it may be united to and pass along with lands; whilst in regard
                    to all patronages to which no legal title can be shown, the king is held to be
                    patron, being deemed by lawyers to have succeeded in that privilege to the pope.
                    The patron is allowed six months after each vacancy to present; and the period,
                    by the 10th of Queen Anne, runs, not from the time when he may come to the
                    knowledge of the vacancy, as under the act 1567, but from the date of the
                    vacancy itself. If the patron “neglect or refuse” to present within the six
                    months, the presbytery of the bounds become entitled to exercise the privilege
                    <hi rend="italic">jure</hi><hi rend="italic">devoluto</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but if he have executed a presentation, and taken all requisite steps
                    for having it lodged with the moderator or clerk of presbytery within the proper
                    time, he will not be held to have “neglected or refused,” so as to admit the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus</hi><hi rend="italic">devolutum,</hi> although, from causes
                    over which he has no control, the presentation may not actually have been so
                    lodged; as, for instance, if the patron of a church in Orkney, residing in
                    Edinburgh, should execute and despatch a presentation in amply sufficient time
                    to reach its destination under ordinary circumstances, but it should not arrive
                    in consequence of an unusual prevalence of storms till the six months have
                    expired. Where a presentee has been rejected by a presbytery as disqualified, or
                    on other legal ground, the patron is allowed as long a period to present a
                    second time, as remained unexpired of the six months when his first presentation
                    was lodged. If, however, he have presented a minister already holding a cure, or
                    a party who will not take the oaths to government, or one who shall not within
                    the six months accept or declare his willingness to accept, his presentation of
                    such a party will not stop the currency of the six months; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193492998" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2998-0147"/>but if the presentation shall
                    through any cause become ineffectual, and the six months have expired, theyws
                    <hi rend="italic">devolutum</hi> will take effect, as if no presentation had
                    been offered. This provision was introduced by the 5th Geo. I. c. 29, mainly for
                    the purpose of preventing patrons from keeping benefices vacant by the
                    presentation of parties who either were disqualified, or would not accept, or
                    whose acceptance was dependent, as in the case of ministers already settled, on
                    the will of the church courts. Although, usually, there is only room for the
                    exercise of the patron’s right when a vacancy occurs, the law, in special
                    circumstances (where the presbytery are satisfied of the necessity of the
                    proceeding, from the age or permanent illness of the incumbent), sanctions a
                    presentation during his life to an assistant and successor, who, on being
                    admitted and ordained by the presbytery, immediately becomes colleague in the
                    pastoral charge, though he cannot enter into possession of any of the rights of
                    the benefice till the death of the incumbent. In such cases a provision is
                    always required by the presbytery to be made for the assistant and successor,
                    either by the incumbent, or by obligation on the part of the parishioners, or
                    certain of their number. The patron, before presenting, must take the usual
                    oaths to government for persons in public trust; and if suspected of Popery he
                    may be required to purge himself, by signing a special formula framed for that
                    purpose. Any patron refusing to take the oaths, or to subscribe this formula,
                    when required, forfeits his right of presenting for that time to the crown; and
                    in the event of failure by the crown to present within six months, the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus</hi><hi rend="italic">devolutum</hi> accresces to the
                    presbytery. Whether this disability can be evaded by the disqualified patron
                    nominating a commissioner who can take the oaths, &amp;c. seems not to be
                    determined.</p>
                <p>Originally there was no restriction on the patron’s choice in regard to the
                    persons from among whom he might select his presentee, provided always that on
                    trial the presentee should be found qualified. By a series of
                    legislative-enactments, however, on the part of the church, a special class of
                    persons has been constituted, from among whom alone (or ordained ministers
                    previously taken from the same class) the patron must select his presentee.
                    These are denominated expectants or probationers, or more generally, at the
                    present day, licentitaes. They are required to go through a preparatory train of
                    study, including a full university course of philosophy, and a course of
                    theology, consisting of four years regular or six years irregular attendance on
                    the professors of theology, in one or other of the universities. They are then
                    taken on trials by the presbytery, that judicatory having previously satisfied
                    themselves that the candidate is of “good report, sound in his principles,
                    pious, sober, grave, and prudent in his behaviour; of a peaceable disposition,
                    and well affected to the happy constitution established in this kingdom, both in
                    church and state.” The trials consist of examination into the candidate’s
                    knowledge of the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages, philosophy, theology, and
                    church history, and the delivery of an exegesis in Latin on some controverted
                    head of divinity, and three discourses in English, on which he may also be
                    specially examined. If the presbytery be satisfied, and the candidate subscribe
                    a formula acknowledging the Confession of Faith, and the presbyterian order of
                    church government, and promising to submit himself to the judicatories of the
                    church, they enrol him as a probationer, and grant him a license to preach the
                    gospel. Though the party thus licensed possesses the privilege of preaching, and
                    of leading in public worship, he holds no office in the church, he cannot
                    administer the sacraments or marry, and is only considered as a recognised
                    candidate on probation for the office of the ministry.</p>
                <p>When a presentation in favour of a party qualified to accept of it in manner
                    above mentioned, accompanied with his letter of acceptance, and certificate of
                    his, and also of the patron’s, having taken the oaths to government, is lodged
                    with the presbytery, if there be any legal objections to it, or if another party
                    dispute the right of presentation, the presbytery generally delay procedure till
                    the question raised be disposed of by the civil courts; but if there be no legal
                    objection, and no competition, they usually pronounce a deliverance sustaining
                    the presentation (though in certain presbyteries no special deliverance is ever
                    pronounced on the presentation), and proceed with the steps towards forming the
                    pastoral relationship between the presentee and congregation, admitting him to
                    the benefice, and ordaining him to the office of the ministry, if not already an
                    ordained minister. The first step is to appoint the presentee to preach to the
                    congregation one or more times as the presbytery may see fit, and to fix
                    thereafter a day for moderating in a call, as it is technically termed, in his
                    favour; that is to say, appointing the presbytery to meet at the parish church
                    on a particular day, or commissioning one of their number to attend on that day,
                    to moderate in or preside over a meeting of the congregation, summoned for the
                    purpose of giving a call to the presentee to be their pastor. On this occasion,
                    after public worship, and a sermon by the minister appointed to preside, the
                    heritors, elders, and parishioners present are invited to subscribe a written
                    call, addressed to the presentee, which, after getting forth that the parties
                    subscribing are destitute of a pastor, and have sufficient assurance of his
                    piety, literature, abilities, and suitableness to their capacities, proceeds
                    thus: “We heartily invite, call, and entreat you to undertake the office of a
                    pastor among us, and the charge of our souls, promising you, upon your accepting
                    this our call, all dutiful respect, encouragement, and obedience in the Lord.”
                    Tire call being subscribed by as many as incline, the presbytery take it into
                    consideration; and before proceeding to the trial of the qualifications of the
                    presentee, they uniformly pronounce a deliverance, sustaining or concurring with
                    the call. As this proceeding presents a marked peculiarity unknown in England,
                    and as the question in regard to the competency of the church courts refusing to
                    settle a presentee in respect of the absence of what they may consider a
                    sufficient number of signatures to the call, or of the positive dissent from it
                    by a majority of the congregation, or of the male heads of families in communion
                    with the church, has given rise to keen discussion and most important
                    consequences to the welfare of the church in past times, and has again become
                    the subject of most anxious consideration, in a form which seems likely to lead
                    to momentous results as regards the interests of the Church of Scotland, a short
                    notice of its origin and history will probably be interesting and useful.</p>
                <p>The Scottish reformers, in framing their scheme of church polity, adopted, in
                    regard to the appointment of ministers, the principle confessedly acted on in
                    the primitive ages of the church, when pastors were elected by the common
                    consent of the clergy and people; and they allowed to the people that potential
                    voice which they considered them to have enjoyed in the earliest times, prior to
                    the introduction of those limitations and restrictions, which they conceived to
                    have been imposed by the clergy at an after period, though still antecedently to
                    the existence of patronage. Accordingly, in the First Book of Discipline,
                    adopted in 1560, treating of “vocation,” or calling to the office of the
                    ministry, which, used in a large and general sense, is said to consist of
                    “election, examination, and admission,” our reformers declared, that “it
                    appertaineth to the people and to every several congregation to elect their
                    minister.” For this purpose the congregation were allowed forty days, and if
                    they failed within that time to present<pb break="no" facs="nls:193493011"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-3011-0148"/> a person for examination, the superintendent,
                    with his council (who exercised the functions now devolved on the presbytery),
                    might present a person to them. It was, however, provided, that if, before the
                    superintendent and his council, or superior church as it is termed, had thus
                    offered them a minister, the inferior church or congregation had agreed upon a
                    person who on examination should be found qualified, the latter was to be
                    preferred to the party nominated by the superintendent and his council; but, on
                    the other hand, if the congregation still failed to offer a person for
                    examination, then they were to be judged unreasonable if they refused the party
                    offered by the superintendent and his council, and might be compelled to receive
                    him, by the censures of the church. In the Second Book of Discipline, agreed to
                    by the church in 1578, it would rather appear, though that has been doubted,
                    that the initiative was intended to be with the presbytery; but at all events
                    the consent of the people was equally required; and it cannot be disputed that,
                    in the intention of the framers of this book, the refusal to consent, though
                    without reasons assigned and judged sufficient by the presbytery, was considered
                    a fatal defect in the vocation to the pastoral office. Such being the system
                    prescribed by the church, it so happened, from the peculiar state of matters in
                    regard to the parochial cures, that for many years after the Reformation it
                    became in practice the general rule for the appointment of ministers. As already
                    noticed, the unannexed parochial benefices, which alone afforded an opportunity
                    for the exercise of patronage, were comparatively few; these were not vacated by
                    the Roman Catholic clergy, but only gradually fell by the death of the
                    subsisting incumbents, when in most cases they were conferred <hi rend="italic"
                    >pleno</hi><hi rend="italic">pire,</hi> by the crown and other patrons, on
                    parties not in the function of the ministry at all. As to the remaining
                    churches, constituting by far the larger proportion of the whole, there was no
                    right of maintenance attached to them; and the ministers of these were
                    appointed, not to a benefice, but simply to a cure of souls, with a chance of
                    procuring a pension out of the general fund of “thirds,” by special grant from
                    the Exchequer, or otherwise being left to be supported by the contributions of
                    their flocks. Of these cures, while they remained in this condition, there was
                    of course no patronage, and thus, in by far the greater number of cases, there
                    was no obstacle of the nature of a right of presentation to obstruct the rules
                    prescribed by the church from being freely acted upon. Accordingly there is
                    evidence that in general ministers were appointed during the first period after
                    the Reformation, either by the direct choice of the people, or with their full
                    consent. The manner of appointment was not always uniform, and the voice of the
                    congregation was expressed in diverse ways; but still their voice was required
                    and given; and this is stated by an author intimately acquainted with the
                    records of the times (the late learned Dr M‘Crie) to have been the case even
                    where there existed a right of patronage.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Life of Melville, vol. i. note EE, p. 467.</p></note></p>
                <p>When the congregation themselves elected, their wishes appear to have been
                    expressed in the form of a call or invitation, of which the very first election
                    of a pastor amongst the reformers (the choice of Knox as colleague to John Rough
                    by the congregation in the castle of St Andrews) affords an example, or rather
                    the model, agreeably to which the after-practice was fashioned. In accordance
                    with a prior agreement, Rough, after sermon, addressed himself to Knox in these
                    words, as recorded in Knox’s own history: “Brother, ye shall not be offended
                    albeit I speak unto you that which I have in charge, even from all those that
                    are here present, which is this: In the name of God and of his Son Jesus Christ,
                    and in the name of those that presently <hi rend="italic">call</hi> you by my
                    mouth, I charge you that ye refuse not this holy vocation; but as ye tender the
                    glory of God, the increase of Christ’s kingdom, the edification of your
                    brethren, and the comfort of me, whom ye understand well enough to be oppressed
                    by the multitude of labours, that ye take upon you the public office and charge
                    of preaching, even as ye wish to avoid God’s heavy displeasure, and desire that
                    he shall multiply his graces with you.” And in the end, he said to those that
                    were present, “Was not this your charge unto me? And do ye not approve this
                    vocation.” They answered, “It was, and we approve it.” In general, it would
                    appear that the congregation usually expressed their wishes by commissioners
                    deputed by them to the presbytery, or others having commission to examine and
                    admit, and at times in the form of a letter; but in either way their election
                    assumed substantially the form of a call directed to the party chosen through
                    the presbytery, or others having the power for the time of examination and
                    admission; and, in whatever mode expressed, the consent of the people was in
                    practice a constant requisite to admission. Thus, it was over a church in which,
                    from the absence of patronage in most instances, consequent on the want of
                    benefices, either proper or stipendiary, the practice of admitting the people to
                    an effective voice, in accordance with the polity recognised by the church
                    courts, had already been established, that patronage was gradually extended. By
                    the more effective restriction of presentations in the case of proper benefices
                    to persons who were really to exercise the function of the ministry, and the
                    gradual increase of patronages by the erection of stipendiary benefices by the
                    king, the right of presentation was by degrees again extended over nearly the
                    whole churches of the kingdom. This, however, was not a sudden or violent
                    change, but a progressive superinduction of a right of patronage over churches
                    in which the practice of requiring the consent of the people was already fixed
                    and universally prevalent; and, accordingly, as might have been expected, it
                    continued to co-exist, although there is doubtless a deficiency of evidence in
                    regard to the actual effect on the right of presentation in patronale churches.
                    That the right of presenting on the part of the patron, and the privilege on the
                    part of the people of their consent being required, did, to a certain extent,
                    run counter to each other, and create some obstruction in the settlement of
                    ministers, may fairly be inferred from an act of assembly in 1596, by which it
                    was enacted, that any one seeking a presentation without consent of the
                    presbytery, should be deemed <hi rend="italic">reus ambitus,</hi> and as such
                    should be rejected; and that effect was in use to be given to this enactment, is
                    clear from a recorded instance in 1602, regarding the parish of Aberlady, in
                    which, while the presentee was found not to have been <hi rend="italic">reus
                    ambitus,</hi> he having been in ignorance that a presentation was applied for on
                    his behalf, he was obliged to subscribe an obligation, placing his presentation
                    in the hands of the presbytery, and was only sent to the congregation on a leet
                    with others, the privilege of the people in this instance being allowed to
                    supersede in a great measure the right of the patron. By this time, too, the
                    independence of the church had been very nearly extinguished; and, shortly
                    afterwards, episcopacy’, with its absolute patronage, was introduced. Even
                    during its subsistence, however, and while the bishops might be compelled by
                    legal diligence to admit a presentee in orders, the people appear to have
                    persisted in claiming a voice, though, as may be supposed, generally without
                    effect; evincing, however, how strongly the previous practice had been rooted in
                    their <pb break="no" facs="nls:193493024" xml:id="kp-eb0717-3024-0149"/>habits.
                    During all the previous period, and from the restoration of presbytery in 1638,
                    down to the abolition of patronage in 1649, it would rather seem that there was
                    no such form as that of “moderating” in a call. The congregation appear to have
                    met by themselves, without the presbytery or a member of presbytery to moderate
                    in or preside over their proceedings. When, however, the directory of 1649
                    vested the election in the session, as that body, during a vacancy, was without
                    a moderator, and so incapable of acting as a session unless a moderator were
                    supplied, the directory specially provided that one of the presbytery should be
                    appointed to attend and moderate in the session at their act of election; and
                    this is the origin of the peculiar phrase to “moderate in a call,” which is
                    still retained, although the meeting is of the congregation, and the presbytery
                    as a body now usually attend themselves. Under this directory the election of
                    the minister was vested in the elders of the congregation, at that time
                    popularly chosen; and the voice of the people was subjected to this
                    qualification, that the presbytery might disregard the dissent of a majority if
                    they found it to be grounded on causeless prejudices. Under the act 1690, the
                    heritors were joined with the elders, and the qualification enacted as to the
                    voice of the people was more strict, the disapprovers of the person proposed
                    being required to give in their reasons, to be judged of by the presbytery. The
                    right of the heritors and elders under this statute was truly of the nature of a
                    right of presentation, though in the act it was described as the right of
                    “calling” a minister; a phraseology adopted, as is supposed, to render it more
                    palatable to those most hostile to patronage. It was totally different, however,
                    from the proper call by the congregation, although, undoubtedly, for some time
                    after the act 1690 was repealed, a tendency to view the call with reference to
                    that practice is apparent. For several years after the repeal of that act, in
                    1711, the exercise of the right of patronage was not attempted; and even when
                    presentations began to be issued, they were usually in favour of a party who was
                    likely to be preferred by the people; and the settlements in such cases
                    uniformly proceeded on the call, without the slightest notice of the
                    presentation. In like manner, for many years presentees never ventured to accept
                    unqualifiedly a presentation; and the first instance of unqualified acceptance
                    is said to have occurred in 1731. In the immediately preceding year a presentee
                    had been for the first time since the passing of the 10th of Queen Anne settled
                    in a parish by judgment of the Assembly, in virtue of a presentation, in
                    opposition to the dissent of a majority of the people; and this judgment, which
                    was an adherence to a sentence of the commission, was not rested on the merits
                    of the cause, but was founded on the plea that the sentence of the commission
                    was final and conclusive. After, however, such a settlement had once been
                    accomplished, the Assembly proceeded avowedly on the ground of refusing effect
                    to such dissents; and though several cases subsequently occur in which
                    presentees were refused to be settled in consequence of dissents from the call,
                    or deficiency of signatures to it, the general course of decisions was to
                    sustain the call, without regard to the number of signatures or the extent of
                    opposition (giving occasion to the two great secessions from the Church), till
                    at last, towards the end of the century, the question as to the sufficiency of
                    the call was rarely raised. In all cases, however, down to the present day, the
                    invariable practice has been, that before proceeding to take the presentee on
                    trials, a call is moderated in, and a judgment pronounced by the presbytery
                    sustaining that call. Recently the disputes on this subject have been again
                    revived; and, with a view to establish a definite rule for determining on the
                    validity of the call, the church have passed an enactment, which sets out with a
                    declaration that it is a fundamental law of the church that no pastor be in
                    truded on a congregation contrary to the will of the people, and provides, that
                    if the major part of the male heads of families in communion with the church,
                    and members of the congregation, shall dissent from the call, the presentee
                    shall be rejected. The legal effect of this provision, when acted on by a
                    presbytery, is at present the subject of discussion in the courts of law.</p>
                <p>Whatever may ultimately be determined on this point, it is the undisputed
                    privilege of the congregation to give in, at the moderating in the call,
                    specific objections to the presentee, which are not limited to his moral
                    character and doctrine, nor to his talents or learning, but extend to every
                    personal quality, of whatever nature, which may affect his fitness for the
                    charge of the particular parish, viewed with reference to its peculiar
                    characteristics and necessities. At any time, also, during the period allowed
                    for trying the qualifications of the presentee, any of the communicants may
                    proceed against him by libel, on any charge affecting his soundness in doctrine
                    or his moral character; and, finally, when the trials are completed, and the
                    presbytery are assembled for the purpose of ordination, any of them may appear
                    in answer to the edict published to that effect, and demand to be allowed <hi
                    rend="italic">instanter</hi> to verify sufficient objections to the presentee’s
                    life or doctrine. In the mean time, the presbytery have subjected him to trials
                    of a nature similar to those prescribed for licentiates; and if they are
                    satisfied, and no valid objections have been offered, they ordain him to the
                    office of the ministry, and admit him as pastor of the parish.</p>
                <p>Besides the right of presentation, the patron was entitled, in the event of a
                    wrongful refusal of his presentee, to retain the stipend in his own band. By
                    various statutes, however, he was subjected to the obligation of expending it on
                    pious uses within the parish, though such a latitude was given in the
                    interpretation of “pious uses” as to render the disposal of the stipend a matter
                    of some interest to the patron. A recent statute, however, 54 Geo. III. c. 169,
                    has transferred the vacant stipend to the fund for providing annuities to the
                    widows of the clergy. Patrons also, in virtue of the act 1690, c. 23, are, as
                    such, titulars or impropriators of all tithe in their parishes to which no one
                    else can show right; this being a part of the compensation given them for the
                    right of presentation thereby taken from them, and allowed to be retained by
                    them after the right was restored; and, finally, if also heritors in the parish,
                    they have right to the first choice of a family seat in the division and
                    allotment of the area of the church. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r r.r r.)</hi></p>
