                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PEEBLESSHIRE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Tweeddale</hi></label>,
                    a county in Scotland, situated between 55. 24. and 55. 50. north latitude, and
                    between 2. 45. and 3. 23. west longitude from Greenwich. It is bounded on the
                    north by Mid-Lothian or Edinburghshire, on the east by the county of Selkirk, on
                    the south by Dumfriesshire, and on the west by Lanarkshire. Its greatest extent
                    from north to south is about thirty miles, and its greatest breadth from east to
                    west about twenty-two; the contents being 229,778 English acres, of which only
                    about a tenth part is fit for cultivation. It is divided into sixteen parishes,
                    twelve of which form the presbytery of Peebles, and four belong to that of
                    Biggar, but all are under the synod of Lothian and Tweeddale.</p>
                <p>The surface of this county is hilly, and towards the south mountainous, several
                    of the high grounds in that quarter, such as Hartfield, Harstane, Broadlaw, and
                    Dollarlaw, being from 2800 to nearly 3000 feet above the level of the sea. The
                    general elevation of the pasture lands is about 1200 feet; yet, with few
                    exceptions, the hills are covered with green herbage, heath being almost
                    confined to a few of the highest ridges on the south-east. On the banks of its
                    streams are many pleasant and fertile spots; but, from the want of wood, the
                    general appearance is naked and uninteresting; though of late great attention
                    has been paid to planting, and it is estimated that there are now nearly 7000
                    acres under wood. The soil of the cultivated land, lying chiefly on the sides of
                    the lower hills and the banks of the streams, is for the most part a light loam,
                    with clay, moss, and moor on the high grounds. Coal, limestone, and freestone
                    abound in the parishes of Linton and Newlands, on the north side of the county,
                    and in the latter ironstone is also found. Limestone and freestone are worked
                    profitably in the parish of Linton; but the coal formerly obtained from Newlands
                    has been abandoned, as not repaying the cost of outlay. Lime, however, may still
                    be purchased at Magbiehill, the coal for burning which is brought from Linton.
                    At Stobo, slate of a good quality is quarried, and sold with advantage to the
                    proprietor. In the parish of Traquair there is also a slate quarry in active
                    operation. The river Tweed, from which this district is often called Tweeddale,
                    rises from a well of the same name, in the parish of Tweedsmuir, in the
                    south-western extremity of the county, about 1500 feet above the level of the
                    sea, and, flowing first north-east and then east, dividing the county into two
                    nearly equal parts, it passes into Selkirkshire at Gatehaup Burn, after a
                    winding course of about thirty-six miles. The Annan and the Clyde have their
                    source in the same hill. Of the other streams, here called <hi rend="italic"
                    >waters,</hi> the most considerable are Biggar, Lyne, Peebles or Eddlestone,
                    Leithan, Mannor, and Q,uair, which fall into the Tweed; and the North and South
                    Esks, which pursue their course into Mid-Lothian. The lakes or loehs are St
                    Mary’s, Waterloch, and Slipperfield. These, as well as the rivulets, abound in
                    the common fresh-water fish, and most of the streams are occasionally frequented
                    by salmon; but salmon are not found in such numbers, even in the Tweed, within
                    the bounds of this county, as to afford a fishery that will pay rent.</p>
                <p>The climate of Peeblesshire, owing to its elevation and want of shelter, is
                    perhaps more rigorous than that of any other of the southern counties of
                    Scotland. Cold easterly winds prevail in spring, and greatly retard vegetation;
                    whilst in summer frosts often occur, which injure the potato and other crops;
                    and the winters are frequently so severe as to destroy turnips, the snow lying
                    so deep and so long as sometimes to occasion great loss amongst the flocks.</p>
                <p>As this is almost exclusively a pastoral country, the farms are in general large,
                    most of them being from 1000 to 4000 acres. On the arable land they are small,
                    the greater number being below 100 acres. These are in general held on leases
                    for nineteen years, as in other parts of Scotland. Taking the extent and rental
                    as before stated, the average would be nearly five shillings the English aere.
                    This is chiefly derived from live stock, especially sheep, of which there may be
                    about 120,000. These were formerly of the black-faced heath variety, sometimes
                    called Tweeddale sheep, from the name of the county, or Linton sheep, from the
                    name of a village on the northern side of the district, where great fairs are
                    held for the sale of them; but of late years the Cheviot breed, which bears a
                    much more valuable fleece, has been established on many of the lower hills, and
                    the majority of those now fed in the county are of this variety. The crops are
                    the same as in other parts of Scotland, excepting that wheat is cultivated only
                    upon a very small scale. A variety of oats called the <hi rend="italic">red
                    oat,</hi> and sometimes the <hi rend="italic">Mag-</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193493297" xml:id="kp-eb0717-3297-0170"/><hi rend="italic">biehill
                    oat,</hi> from its being first cultivated here on that estate, is very well
                    adapted to high and exposed situations, both because it ripens earlier than the
                    common kind, and is less liable to be beaten out by wind, whilst on good land it
                    is found to be highly productive.</p>
                <p>Many of the proprietors have seats distinguished either for their antiquity or
                    their beauty; but the Earl of Traquair is the only nobleman who now resides in
                    the county. Peeblesshire, in 1811, was divided into about eighty estates, many
                    of them large, but not valuable in proportion. The valuation of the whole is
                    L.51,937.13s. 10d. Scotch; and the real rent, as assessed for the property-tax
                    that year, was, for the lands L.57,382 sterling, and for the houses L.2568. Two
                    thirds of the estates are valued under L.500 Scotch, a sum which may indicate
                    pretty nearly their present yearly value in sterling money; and little less than
                    two thirds of the whole are entailed.</p>
                <p>In the county there are several remains of Roman camps. Drochil Castle in the
                    parish of Newlands, and Nedpath Castle in the parish of Peebles, are the only
                    two which are in tolerable preservation; but vestiges of ancient castles or
                    towers abound in the whole valley of the Tweed. The remains of the Castle of
                    Tinnes or Thanes are six feet in thickness, and the mortar is as hard as the
                    stone.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants are generally educated, intelligent, and attentive to religious
                    duties, though few of the labouring classes or shepherds consider poaching as in
                    any degree criminal, and accordingly practise it to a considerable extent, both
                    by land and water. To this they are tempted by the abundance of the game, which
                    in some districts is most destructive to the poor. The principal towns or
                    villages in Peeblesshire are, Peebles, Linton, Eddlestone, Skirling, Broughton,
                    and Innerleithen. At this latter place, Lord Traquair, the proprietor of the
                    village, has erected a neat building with corridor over a mineral well, which
                    for some years past has attracted numerous visitors to the village during the
                    summer.</p>
                <p>The royal burgh of Peebles formerly joined with Selkirk, Lanark, and Linlithgow,
                    in returning a member for the burghs; but since the passing of the reform act,
                    the burgh is merged in the county, and both united return a member to serve in
                    parliament; the qualification to vote for a candidate being the same in the
                    burgh as in the county, viz. ten pounds property, or fifty pounds rental per
                    annum. At the passing of the reform act there were, of old constituency
                    forty-seven, new constituency 300; but, in consequence of the creation of votes
                    for party purposes, there are now 760 electors on the poll-books.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Peebles,</hi> the county-town, is not distinguished for any
                    particular trade or manufacture. The majority of the operatives are hand-loom
                    weavers, whose wages do not average more than from five to seven shillings per
                    week; the remainder of their living being procured by fishing, harvestwork,
                    &amp;c. It is not known when Peebles was erected into a royal burgh; but in 1357
                    the burgh sent two members to parliament. The property of the burgh, consisting
                    of lands, mills, &amp;c. yields an annual revenue of L.1343. Ils. 2d., which is
                    expended in salaries to teachers, in paving and lighting the streets, supplying
                    the town with water, and other useful purposes. The whole matters of police are
                    regulated by a provost, two bailies, a treasurer, dean of guild, and twelve
                    councillors, chosen by the inhabitants. Considerably more property was secured
                    to the burgesses and inhabitants by charter of James VI. dated the 10th of
                    November 1621; but, as in most of the other burghs, this was dissipated by the
                    members of the corporation. Peebles is divided into the old and the new town;
                    and it is bounded on the south by the Tweed, and on the north by the Eddlestone
                    Water. It is worthy of remark, that the Tweed runs almost from due west to east,
                    whilst the Eddlestone Water, on the other side of the town, flows exactly in the
                    contrary direction. The population returns for the burgh and parish were, in
                    1811, 2485; in 1821, 2701; and in 1831, 2750. The real value is estimated at
                    L.9255. Peebles is distant twenty-two miles south of Edinburgh.</p>
