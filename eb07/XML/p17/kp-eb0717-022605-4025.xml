                <p><label type="entry">PENTATEUCH</label>, a word derived from the Greek ∏s∣∕- <hi
                    rend="italic">τατεxχος,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">vεντε, five,</hi> and
                    τsuxog, an <hi rend="italic">instrument</hi> or vo- <hi rend="italic">lume,</hi>
                    and signifying the collection of the five instruments or books of Moses, which
                    are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.</p>
                <p>Some modern critics have disputed Moses’s right to the authorship of the
                    Pentateuch. They observe that he always speaks in the third person. “Now the man
                    Moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.”
                    “The Lord spake unto Moses, saying,” &amp;c. “Moses said to Pharaoh,” &amp;c.
                    They think that he would never have thus spoken of himself, but would at least
                    sometimes have mentioned himself in the first person. Besides, according to
                    these critics, the author of the Pentateuch sometimes abridges his narration
                    like a writer who collected from some ancient memoirs, and sometimes he
                    interrupts the thread of his discourse, as, for example, when he makes Lamech
                    the bigamist say, “Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech;
                    for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt,” without
                    informing us before-hand to whom this is related. Again, when he says, “And the
                    Canaanite was then in the land,” these observations cannot be reconciled to the
                    age of Moses, since the Canaanites continued to be the masters of Palestine
                    during the lifetime of the Jewish legislator. The passage from the book of the
                    wars of the Lord, quoted in the book of Numbers (xxi. 14), is supposed to have
                    been inserted afterwards, as also the opening verses of Deuteronomy. The account
                    of the death of Moses, which is at the end of the same book, cannot possibly
                    belong, to this legislator; and the same judgment may be formed of other
                    passages, in which it is said that the places mentioned lay beyond Jordan, that
                    the bed of Og was at Ramah to this day, and that the havoth of Jair, or the
                    cities of Jair, were known to the author, though probably they did not receive
                    that name till after Moses’s time.</p>
                <p>It is also observed, that in the text of the Pentateuch there are some places
                    which are defective; for example, in Exodus (xii. 8) we find Moses speaking to
                    Pharaoh, but the author has omitted the beginning of his discourse. The
                    Samaritan inserts in the same place what is wanting in the Hebrew. In other
                    places the same Samaritan text adds what is deficient in the Hebrew; and what it
                    contains more than the Hebrew seems to be so well connected with the rest of the
                    discourse, that it would be difficult to separate them. Lastly, the same critics
                    believe that they observe certain strokes in the Pentateuch which can hardly
                    have proceeded from Moses, who was born and bred in Egypt; as, for example, what
                    he says of the earthly paradise, of the rivers which watered it and ran through
                    it, of the cities of Babylon, Erech, Resen, and Calnch, of the gold of Pison, of
                    the bdellium, and of the stone of Sohem, or onyx-stone, which was to be found in
                    that country. These particulars, observed minutely, are supposed to prove that
                    the author of the Pentateuch lived beyond the Euphrates; and the same conclusion
                    may be deduced from what he says concerning the ark of Noah, of its
                    construction, of the place where it rested, of the wood with which it was built,
                    of the bitumen of Babylon, and other matters. But in answer to all these
                    objections, we may observe in general, that these books are by the most ancient
                    writers, ascribed to Moses; and it is confirmed by the authority of heathen
                    writers themselves, that they are of his writing. Besides, we have the unanimous
                    testimony of the whole Jewish nation, ever since Moses’s time, to the same
                    effect. Direct texts of the Pentateuch imply that it was written by Moses; the
                    book of Joshua, and other parts of Scripture, import the same thing; and though
                    some passages have been thought to imply the contrary, yet this is but a modern
                    opinion, and has been sufficiently confuted by several learned men. The
                    Samaritans receive no other Scriptures but the Pentateuch, rejecting all the
                    other books which are still contained in the Jewish canon.</p>
