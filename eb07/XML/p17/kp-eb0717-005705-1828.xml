                <p><label type="entry">PARAGUAY</label>, formerly a province of the viceroyalty of
                    Buenos Ayres, in South America, but declared an independent republic first in
                    1816, and again in 1826. It is bounded on the north by the province of Matto
                    Grosso, in Brazil, from which it is separated partly by a river, and partly by a
                    mountain ridge, its most northerly point being between the twentieth and
                    twenty-first degrees of south latitude. The river Parana constitutes its
                    boundary on the east, southeast, and south, with the exception of a
                    comparatively small tract of country, called the Missions, which lies to the
                    eastward, on the right bank of the Parana; and along the whole of the western
                    side of the country flows the Paraguay, the confluence of which with the Parana,
                    in latitude 27. 27. south, marks the limits of the country in this direction. In
                    longitude it extends from 54.40. to 58.30. west from Greenwich, and comprehends
                    an area of above 25,000 square miles, which is about half the superficies of
                    England, exclusive of Wales.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    groans.</p></note></p>
                <p>The history of Paraguay, from the time of its discovery until it unfurled the
                    standard of independence, along with the other provinces, and shook itself free
                    from European domination, presents but little except the usual story of the
                    oppression and aggrandisement of the whites, with the fierce struggles and the
                    ultimate submission of the Indians. But its annals since the revolution, when
                    its destinies were intrusted to Dr Francia, one of the most remarkable men of
                    his time, are replete with events equally interesting and instructive. According
                    to Techo, the word Paraguay signifies the Crowned River; a name which it
                    obtained from the Indians who inhabited the shores of the river wearing coronets
                    made of feathers. Dr Southey, however, is of opinion that it is the same word as
                    Paraguazu, or Great River; and this is supported by the fact, that the same word
                    for a river is observed in the Para and the Parana. On the other hand, Azara
                    informs us that the river and country of Paraguay derive their name from the
                    Payaguas, who formerly inhabited that part of Brazil through which the river
                    flows in the early part of its course, and are now the most domesticated and
                    useful of all the Indian tribes, with the exception of the Guaranis. This name
                    was altered a little by the Spaniards, who, substituting one letter for another,
                    made it Paraguay instead of Payaguay. The country was discovered in 1526, by
                    Sebastian Cabot, who was then in the service of Spain. This intrepid navigator
                    ascended the Paraguay thirty-four leagues above its junction with the Parana,
                    and there met an agricultural people, inhabiting the banks, but found them too
                    fierce, warlike, and sagacious to be ensnared by promises, or induced to come to
                    terms. After five years of fruitless attempts at negotiation, he was compelled
                    to abandon the enterprise; and for some time the country remained almost
                    unnoticed. In the year 153(&gt;, however, the Spaniards, after a sanguinary
                    struggle with the natives, succeeded in forming a settlement; and in memory of
                    the event, as well as in honour of the Virgin Mary, they called their fortified
                    port Assumption. This was the origin of the capital city of that name, which
                    increased so rapidly, that in eleven years afterwards it was considered as of
                    sufficient importance to be constituted the seat or see of a bishop. The history
                    of the country for fifty years after the first settlement presents merely a
                    series of acts of hypocrisy and violence. The Guarani tribes, who inhabited
                    Paraguay, and some other parts, were a brave but docile people; and though many
                    lives were lost before the superiority of the Spanish power was acknowledged,
                    yet, of all the tribes, the Guaranis, who were the most numerous, proved in the
                    end the most easily and effectually reduced to obedience. But, satisfied with
                    their subjugation, the Spaniards did little or nothing for their improvement;
                    and it was not until towards the end of the sixteenth century that the Jesuits
                    brought all the zeal and influence of their order to the task of civilizing the
                    Guaranis, or, in other words, reducing them from a state of savage independence
                    to one of civilized but complete subjugation. In the year 1586, the first
                    settlement or mission of the Society of Jesus was formed in Guayra; and so
                    rapidly did these settlements increase, that, in the year 1629, they amounted to
                    twenty-one in number. These communities were of a threefold character, namely,
                    religious, military, and manufacturing; for, whilst the Jesuits instructed the
                    Indians in the elements of education and the truths of religion, they likewise
                    trained them to habits of industry, and even taught them the art of
                    self-defence. Each of the settlements was a considerable town laid out with
                    straight streets. The houses, generally consisting of earth, where whitened,
                    covered with tiles, and provided with verandas on either side, to preserve them
                    from the sun and the rain. Each mission had a mother church, which was generally
                    built of stone, and magnificently ornamented. Two curates, both Jesuits, were
                    the only ecclesiastics who exercised parochial functions, and at the same time
                    acted as inspectors of all civil economy.</p>
                <p>In attempting to extend their spiritual conquest still further, the Jesuits were
                    compelled by the Paulistas to fall back to the south of the Serra Maracaju, and
                    concentrate their establishments between the Parana and Uruguay, in that part
                    where these rivers approximate most closely. But at a subsequent period the
                    Jesuits acquired an ascendency in Paraguay, as far as ecclesiastical authority
                    was concerned,; and for more than a century their influence remained unshaken.
                    In the year 1752, when seven of the Jesuit missions were detached from Spain and
                    annexed to Portugal, so averse were the Indians to this separation, that they
                    had recourse to arms, and a war ensued, which is known by the name of the War of
                    the Seven Settlements. But, after five years of hostility and bloodshed, they
                    were entirely subdued, and their spiritual teachers, who had at first vainly
                    urged them to submission, resumed their beneficent sway. The Jesuits, it is well
                    known, were finally expelled from Brazil in 1760, under circumstances of
                    unexampled cruelty; and in 1768, this was followed by their complete expulsion
                    from Paraguay, as we learn from Cazal and the despatches of Bucarelli. During
                    more than thirty years after this event the affairs of the country continued in
                    a state of frightful disorder; cruelty, plunder, and misery in various forms
                    prevailed; and the population of the Reductions, from having been upwards of
                    100,000, sunk to less than half that number.</p>
                <p>With the change of masters which followed this event, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193491841" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1841-0058"/>the spell that bound the
                    Indians was broken; and by the new plan of government there was established in
                    the Guarani towns a system which in a few years led to the total ruin of the
                    Jesuits’ establishments. The successors of these missionaries appear to have
                    been thoroughly embued with the worst spirit of religious bigotry, and to have
                    possessed none of their redeeming qualities. Doblas, one of the administrators
                    of the new system, and by far the most enlightened and efficient of their
                    number, as well as the able historian of the Missions of Paraguay, strenuously
                    urged the Spanish government to sanction such a change of management as would
                    insure their preservation; and ultimately the king of Spain showed a disposition
                    to adopt his suggestion. But it was then too late. The depopulation of the
                    Missions was complete; and, in many places, the ruins of their churches and
                    buildings are all that now remain to attest their having ever existed. The
                    Jesuits have often been attacked and unsparingly calumniated by those who were
                    interested in destroying the reputation of that celebrated order; but some
                    authentic documents recently published will probably go far to correct many of
                    the erroneous impressions which have thus been produced in disfavour of that
                    body. It must always be kept in view, however, that, excepting the truly
                    impartial testimony of Doblas, the records alluded to are the productions of
                    decided partisans of the company of Jesus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>These religionists, who acted as missionaries in Paraguay,
                    were certainly not so bad as their enemies represented them, and yet by no means
                    so philanthropic and disinterested as their friends have described them.
                    Aggrandisement for themselves, and complete dependence upon the part of the
                    Indians, were the undeviating principles of their government. Uniform and
                    constant labour was exacted from their subjects on the one hand; and a humane,
                    mild, paternal, and wise rule was exercised in return; in tact, the chains of
                    the Indians sat so lightly upon them as to be wholly imperceptible to their
                    simple and guileless minds.</p></note></p>
                <p>From the commencement of the present century until the year 1810, the country
                    continued tranquil; but when the tocsin of revolt was sounded throughout South
                    America and Mexico an attempt upon the part of Buenos Ayres to supplant the
                    governor of Paraguay led ultimately to the establishment of an independent
                    government in that country. In the month of October 1810 the junta of Buenos
                    Ayres despatched a thousand men under the command of Manuel Belgrano,for the
                    purpose of vindicating their authority in Paraguay, and attaching it to the
                    republic of the United Provinces. This army penetrated without interruption into
                    the heart of the country, and halted within about two days’ march of Assumption,
                    the capital. In the mean while the Paraguayans collected together a force of
                    from five to six thousand armed men, and the hostile forces came in sight of
                    each other at the village of Paraguany. A battle ensued, in which Belgrano was
                    defeated, and obliged to enter into a capitulation, in virtue of which he
                    ultimately withdrew from the province. But during the conferences which took
                    place, both before and after the capitulation, Belgrano so infected the
                    Paraguayan officers with notions of independence, that at length these took full
                    effect on their minds. This short but triumphant appeal to arms had given them a
                    consciousness of the possession of strength, of which they were not previously
                    aware; and seeing that the number of Spaniards in Paraguay was small, and being
                    also stimulated by the example of neighbouring states, by the recollection of
                    former wrongs, by the instinct of independence, and by the hope of gain, the
                    principal Creoles began more and more to detach themselves from the government
                    of Old Spain, until at last, in the course of the year 1811, they resolved to
                    make common cause against it.</p>
                <p>A plan for achieving independence was consequently organized, but so badly
                    concerted, that the secret began to transpire, when some of the officers, more
                    courageous than the rest, resolved on taking a decisive step, before detection
                    had destroyed all their hopes. They proceeded to the residence of the governor,
                    Señor Velasco, and having entered it, pistols in hand, arrested that
                    functionary. So rapidly were matters arranged, that the same morning two of the
                    chiefs of the revolution, Don Fulgencio Yegros and Don Pedro Cavallero, were
                    united with him in the government, and a congress was called. After this body
                    had met, the members proceeded in a regular manner to depose the governor, and
                    supply his place by a junta, which, in imitation of that established at Buenos
                    Ayres, professed to act in the name of Ferdinand VII. But it proceeded with much
                    more alacrity than any similar body in the other dependencies of Spain, and did
                    not hesitate at once to proclaim the disjunction of Paraguay from the mother
                    country. The junta consisted of a president, two assessors, and a secretary. The
                    person appointed to the latter office was the celebrated Don Joseph Gaspar
                    Rodriguez de Francia, since well known by the name of the Dictator of
                    Paraguay.</p>
                <p>Francia, although merely secretary of the government, not only controlled and
                    ruled it with nearly absolute sway, but with a petulance inherent in his temper,
                    and inseparable from his impatience of contradiction or restraint. The excesses
                    which soon followed the revolution, and which, after being long fostered in the
                    bosom of Francia, were brought to light, year after year, as his power ripened
                    and his jealousy matured, are too well attested by numerous and impartial
                    witnesses to admit of dispute. He entered into office a stern and unrelenting
                    tyrant. His fixed and unalterable resolution was to obtain power, absolute and
                    uncontrolled; and, like other despots, he disregarded not the commission of
                    crime in any shape, if calculated to insure his object. It was only to make his
                    ultimate success more certain that he opened up his schemes gradually, and
                    increased his cruelties by successive steps; and he was really the more
                    formidable to his victims, that his sphere of action was so limited, as to bring
                    within the ken of his quick and jealous eye every individual of the petty
                    population of his groaning country. His colleagues in office, Yegros and
                    Cavallero, were men of mean capacity; and whilst they were exhausting in parade
                    the pleasure of newly-attained power, the man destined to become dictator of
                    Paraguay was planning, in secret, those designs which not only overthrew all
                    competitors for office, and deposed his partners in the government, but left him
                    the sole possessor of that iron sceptre with which he has ruled his people, and
                    overthrown every presumptuous aspirant after liberty. From the moment of his
                    attaining the rank of consul, he paid the closest attention to business. His
                    first care was to organize a body of men called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarteleros,</hi> from being shut up within the only barrack, or <hi
                    rend="italic">quartel,</hi> in the town. He also organized a body of militia for
                    the defence of the country against external invasion. He pulled down the
                    monastic institutions, because he knew well the influence of the priests over
                    his bigoted countrymen; and influence, in his estimate of it, was crime. Every
                    man of education was turned out of the civil department, and replaced by
                    low-born and uneducated tools of the dictator. The Inquisition was abolished,
                    because it carried the semblance of an <hi rend="italic">imperium in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">imperio.</hi> No holy processions, no night services in the
                    churches, were permitted, because Francia deemed none so likely to foster
                    treason, or to arm the hand of the assassin against the enemy of the church. At
                    length he entirely threw aside the mask which had hitherto imperfectly concealed
                    the real ferocity of his disposition. Whilst he was yet consul, and only
                    dictator <hi rend="italic">pro tempore,</hi> he had contented himself with
                    immuring his victims in prisons, from which he in no instance released them; but
                    now not only were the jails insufficient to contain the unhappy objects of his
                    suspicion, but the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193491854"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1854-0059"/>scaffold began to stream with blood, and to afford
                    him an easier and quicker mode of ridding himself of every one whom he chose to
                    consider as a political culprit. Vague and remote conjecture, the villanous
                    tales of informers, nay, even an inauspiciously-interpreted look or action,
                    entailed banishment or death upon the suspected or denounced individual. He
                    founded a settlement, to which he gave the name of Tevego; and thither he
                    banished, upon the most trivial pretext, or slightest suspicion, all his least
                    formidable enemies. This place, which forms the Botany Bay of Paraguay, is 120
                    leagues above Assumption; except Bourbon, it is the most northerly point of that
                    country; and being situated on a marsh,, it is not only a hot-bed of malaria and
                    mosquitos, but destitute of every thing capable of rendering existence
                    tolerable. The original object of selecting such a spot for banishment was that
                    of gratifying absolute cruelty of disposition; the collateral one, that of
                    establishing a colony of outcasts sufficient to resist the incursions of the
                    indomitable and ferocious tribe of the Mbayà Indians. The unsettled state of the
                    neighbouring provinces caused many of their inhabitants to seek refuge in
                    Paraguay; but the dictator, ever jealous of new-comers, sent most of them to
                    languish as exiles in Villa Real and Tevego.</p>
                <p>The dictator, proceeding on his worse than Chinese principles of excluding
                    intercourse with all foreign states, laid prostrate the commerce of the country;
                    and having thus crushed the energies, and cut off the resources, of thousands of
                    his countrymen, he found it necessary to turn their attention to agriculture,
                    and the manufacture of cloth from the native cotton of the country. This was
                    pretty much as if the Tartar sovereign of China should prohibit the manufacture
                    and exportation of <hi rend="italic">tea,</hi> and set his subjects on the
                    exclusive cultivation of rice and cotton for their own consumption. Less
                    scrupulous than the head of the Celestial Empire, Francia did what the other has
                    never attempted. He said, You shall have no intercourse with foreign countries;
                    let the growth of the Paraguay tea, the cultivation of the Paraguay tobacco, the
                    interminable forests which furnish timber, and the sugar-cane plantations which
                    enrich your estates, be disregarded; and every man of you turn his attention
                    towards deriving his means of subsistence from his own lands, and his means of
                    clothing from his own looms. The merchant who had before made L.500 a year by
                    the exportation of his commodities, was now ground down to L.50 at most,
                    derivable from the cultivation of his estate. Ships rotted upon the beach;
                    produce mouldered to decay in the warehouses; the inhabitant of a spacious house
                    was reduced to a mud cottage; and this system Francia called an encouragement of
                    agriculture. Having destroyed the spirit of the country, Francia now succeeded
                    in laying prostrate its natural resources. Attempts were from time to time made
                    to bring down the haughty authority of this despotic chief; but they were all in
                    vain. Every conspiracy was detected, and every such detection conducted more
                    numerous victims to the gallows, chains, dungeons, imprisonment, or banishment
                    to Tevego. The towns of the whole country were placed under the most rigid
                    discipline; every inhabitant of every house felt as if his father, brother, or
                    wife, might be a spy; the whole land groaned and lay in abasement, under a
                    trembling awe of its relentless governor. Bonpland, the enterprising companion
                    of Humboldt, was detained nine years a prisoner, because he had dared to form an
                    establishment for the manufacture and exportation of tea; and he was released at
                    the end of that term, not from any latent spark of humanity on the part of the
                    dictator, but because he had acquired not only great popularity in that part of
                    the country where he was fixed, but a considerable property, of the whole of
                    which he was stripped, when thrust forth at a moment’s notice from his home. He
                    was allowed to take with him barely as much as sufficed to carry him to Buenos
                    Ayres. He only left Paraguay in the year 1831.</p>
                <p>The British subjects who had been detained by the arbitrary will of the dictator
                    were released some years previously, by a happy interference on the part of Sir
                    Woodbine Parish, then (1826) consul-general of Buenos Ayres. Francia’s great
                    desire was to establish a direct diplomatic intercourse with England, and he
                    fancied that by releasing his <hi rend="italic">detenus</hi> he would accomplish
                    his purpose. In this he was mistaken; and upon finding himself afterwards
                    disappointed, he gave vent to an ungovernable fit of rage.</p>
                <p>Paraguay, with the exception of the part which faces the north, appears to be
                    wholly enclosed by the rivers Parana and Paraguay; and these noble streams
                    constitute the most remarkable physical features of the country. There are,
                    besides, a great number of smaller currents of water, affluents of the large
                    rivers, which traverse the country from east to west and from west to east,
                    falling respectively into the Paraguay and the Parana. The country is thus
                    abundantly supplied with water for the purposes of agriculture; and, with regard
                    to navigation and commerce, the breadth and depth of the two great rivers by
                    which it is nearly surrounded place it almost on an equality with an island of
                    the ocean. Generally speaking, the face of the country is level; and, though
                    sometimes undulating, and here and there studded with hills, it is destitute of
                    any mountain ranges, notwithstanding that, upon most maps, a cordillera,
                    apparently of great extent, is made to traverse the country,.having a general
                    bearing from north to south. These elevations, which are situated considerably
                    nearer the Parana than the Paraguay, are not deserving of the name of mountains.
                    The rocks chiefly found in the country are arenaceous, not calcareous, and they
                    vary in hardness and in grain. There are here no mines of the precious metals,
                    and the minerals which belong to it do not so materially differ from those found
                    in many parts of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata as to require
                    specific mention. There are no salt marshes or brooks of any size, such as are
                    common in this region of America; but a substitute for them is found in the
                    earth called barrero, which consists of a mixture of clay and salt. This is
                    devoured with such avidity by all animals, that they cannot be driven from it by
                    blows, and have been known to die in consequence of swallowing too much of it.
                    Salt is obtained in Paraguay by collecting the white efflorescence which is
                    found in some valleys during the dry season. This is dissolved, filtered, and
                    subjected to evaporation, when the crystals of salt are formed; but the quantity
                    produced is so small that Paraguay is dependent on Buenos Ayres for supplies of
                    this necessary article. The soil of Paraguay is invariably fertile, and of the
                    same quality throughout.</p>
                <p>The climate, although hot compared with that of Great Britain, is highly
                    salubrious. Azara, whose account of the country, although half a century old, is
                    still the best which we have, found the heat throughout the summer to average
                    85° of Fahrenheit at Assumption, the capital. This was in his chamber; but on
                    very warm days the thermometer stood at 100°. In winter it descended to 45°,
                    which may be taken as the medium temperature of this season; but Azara says,
                    that, in extraordinary seasons, he found water congealed in the court of the
                    house which he occupied, although this statement has been questioned. It is
                    generally observed in the country, that it is always cold when the wind blows
                    from the south or from the south-east, and warm when it blows from the north. In
                    fact, the heat and the cold seem to depend much more on the winds than on the
                    situation or the declination of the sun. The most common winds, and these
                    invariably hotones, blow from the east and the north. Those from the south and
                    southwest are much less frequent, though invariably cool and refreshing. A west
                    wind is scarcely known. The climate is moist; and a considerable quantity of
                    rain falls during the summer months (which in this quarter of the globe <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193491867" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1867-0060"/> correspond to
                    those of our winter), accompanied by terrible storms of thunder and
                    lightning.</p>
                <p>In the abundance and variety of its vegetable productions, Paraguay equals the
                    most prolific portions of South America; and in one tree, that which supplies
                    the celebrated <hi rend="italic">maté,</hi> it stands unrivalled. Not that it is
                    solely confined to this country, for it is found more or less over the whole
                    table-land; but it is produced there in the highest perfection, and in the
                    greatest quantities. The <hi rend="italic">yerbamaté</hi> grows to a goodly
                    size, and is cut to supply the market in every state, from that of a shrub to
                    that of a full-grown tree. It resembles the tea-plant of China, and being in
                    fact a species of wild tea, it is commonly known in commerce by the name of
                    “Paraguay tea.” The leaves and thin stalks are cut off every two or three years,
                    that period being necessary for its reproduction. The small branches, when
                    gathered, are dried by means of fire; the leaves are then roasted and partially
                    bruised, after which they are packed up in hides, and sent to the different
                    markets of South America. This leaf constitutes the principal article of export
                    from Paraguay. The beverage which is produced from it by infusion has a bitter
                    flavour, not unlike Bohea; and in some parts of the continent the use of it is
                    said to have prevailed amongst the Indians from time immemorial.</p>
                <p>Every variety of wood is extremely abundant in Paraguay; the territory of this
                    republic being in fact as remarkable for the extent and excellence of its
                    forests, as that of Buenos Ayres is for the total want of them. The vessels
                    which are built here are extremely durable. Some species of the wood of Paraguay
                    are so hard as to resist the best tempered axe. The hapacho, especially, is a
                    wood of the hardest and most durable kind, equal, if not superior, to the best
                    of our oak. Of the hapacho, vessels are built which live on the waters for fifty
                    years, and rafters are made which support the roofs of houses for double that
                    time. So hard and close is the grain of this wood, that no worm can penetrate
                    it, and no rot can ever assail it. The carts of Buenos Ayres are made of this or
                    similar woods; the algar-robo, theurundey-pita, and the urundey-iray, being
                    amongst the strongest. The last, being very handsome, is likewise used for
                    furniture; and when polished, it is equal in beauty to rosewood, but of a
                    lighter colour. The other trees the timber of which is in general use are,
                    timbo, and the tatayiba or wild mulberry; lance-wood, and the orange tree, of
                    which gun-stocks and parts of carriages are made; caran-dey, alarge palm-tree,
                    yielding a very hard wood; the tatare, strong, and much used in the construction
                    of vessels and machinery, as is also the yberaro; with the cedar and others.
                    There is a tree found here which grows in a very singular manner, the trunk
                    being composed of several stems closely twined round one another, thus forming
                    to appearance one solid mass. The bark of the cebil and curupahi, found in
                    Paraguay and Corrientes, is used for tanning. There are also several trees and
                    plants which the natives make use of for dyeing their linen. A large tree called
                    palo santo, or holy wood, produces an odoriferous gum, which is extracted by
                    boiling pieces of the wood, and is used as a perfume. The incense tree, so
                    called from the gum which it produces, is used in the churches as incense. The
                    man-gaysy produces gum elastic, of which a very durable sort of match is made.
                    There are many other trees in the country which yield different kinds of gum,
                    and some arc reputed to possess great medicinal powers. With these a Jesuit made
                    numerous experiments upon the Indians, during a residence of forty years amongst
                    them; and having himself lived to the age of a hundred and twelve years, his
                    medical aphorisms were held in high veneration. Rhubarb jalap is amongst the
                    numerous medicinal plants which grow in Paraguay. Thecordage used inthevessels
                    is mostlymade from the fibres of plants which are found in the country. Tobacco,
                    coffee, sugar, and cotton, are all cultivated here; and maize grows to great
                    perfection, being much used as an article of diet. Rice, indigo, cotton, and the
                    vine, which thrives but indifferently, are also cultivated to a great extent. A
                    root called aipim or pompin is sometimes made use of as a substitute for bread.
                    Honey and wax, vegetables, and tropical fruits of various kinds, are abundant.
                    Indeed Paraguay has always been held in the highest estimation for the
                    abundance, variety, and value of its productions. The animal kingdom is as
                    extensive and various as the vegetable. Most of the animals belonging to this
                    part of South America are found in Paraguay; amongst which may be mentioned the
                    cougars, jaguars, tapirs, and the water-wolf. The feathered tribes in particular
                    have long been celebrated for their number and their beauty; including the
                    ostrich, parrot, vulture, turkey, humming-bird, duck, and other game. Boas,
                    rattle-snakes, lizards, and other animals, are plentiful; and ants, locusts, and
                    other insects, are numerous and troublesome, sometimes very destructive. Immense
                    herds of cattle roam in the vast plains of Paraguay, and their hides and tallow
                    constitute considerable articles of export.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of this country are now almost wholly engaged in agricultural
                    operations, a portion only giving such attention to manufactures as the wants of
                    the whole demand. Before the non-intercourse system of Francia was intrQduced,
                    the population of the country was chiefly employed on articles of export; the
                    yerba-maté, tobacco, lumber of every kind, sugar, rum, tanned hides, &amp;c. But
                    when, under Francia’s rule, these became useless as exports, his own policy, as
                    well as the natural wants of the people, turned the industry of the labouring
                    masses into new channels. The importation of cotton was superseded by the great
                    additional growth of the native plant. Rice, maize, the yucca root, and various
                    leguminous and succulent plants, shared an equal cultivation with the
                    sugar-cane. The breeding of horses and of cattle was enjoined and encouraged;
                    and Francia’s whole power was employed to realize his boast, that he would make
                    the people dependent on themselves, and not on foreigners.</p>
                <p>Such have been a few of the results of the anti-social policy of Dr Francia. He
                    has changed the richest and most commercial province in the old viceroyalty,
                    Buenos Ayres excepted, into perhaps the poorest, notwithstanding the prodigal
                    hand with which nature has scattered over the country her most luxuriant
                    productions. He has arrested the progress of civilization, and forced the
                    inhabitants of Paraguay to retrograde towards barbarism. He has demoralized an
                    active, hospitable, open-hearted, and simple-minded people, and converted them
                    into a ferocious soldiery or a mass of spies on the one hand, and a
                    terror-striken, slavish multitude, on the other. And to these miserable results
                    he has waded through the blood of innumerable victims, who have either perished
                    on the scaffold, or sunk to the grave in the noisome dungeon and the
                    pestilential swamp, where a slower but not less certain death awaited them.</p>
                <p>Before the reign of Francia commenced, the trade of Paraguay with her
                    neighbouring provinces, and particularly with Buenos Ayres, was very
                    considerable. About eighty square-rigged vessels were constantly employed in the
                    trade, besides a great number of river craft, under the names of ga-randumbas,
                    piraguas, balsas, and chalanas. The exports consisted of about 40,000 bales,
                    containing 8,000,000 lbs. of yerba-maté, 7000 to 8000 peracones of tobacco,
                    containing 1,000,000 lbs.; and these two articles produced about one million two
                    hundred thousand dollars annually; whilst lumber, rum, sugar, tanned hides, and
                    a variety of minor articles, produced about half a million more.</p>
                <p>Before Francia assumed the reins of government, the Paraguayans never thought of
                    extending their care to the cultivation of any other article than the

                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1880-0061"/>sugar-cane, cotton, and the yucca-root. Maté,
                    which grows without any aid from art, in the vast forests of the north and east,
                    engaged almost all hands. Melons, oranges, Indian corn, and other fruits,
                    together with rice, maize, and the two sorts of yucca-root, were now cultivated
                    upon a more extended scale, and with much greater diligence; and vegetables,
                    which were hitherto unknown in Paraguay, now cover the plains. During 1819, that
                    destructive insect the locust, which visits Paraguay every five or six years in
                    such multitudes as even to obscure the sun, spread devastation over a
                    circumference of more than eighty leagues of country. A scarcity seemed
                    inevitable, for the preceding harvest had been unusually bad; but, to prevent
                    this calamity, the dictator ordered the farmers to sow, a second time, a
                    considerable portion of the land which had been laid waste. The experiment was
                    completely successful, and the second harvest proved one of the most abundant
                    that had ever been known. The proprietors had never before dreamed of reaping a
                    double crop in one year. Artisans also sprung up under the auspices of the
                    despot; and out of rude blacksmiths, shoemakers, and masons, he contrived, by an
                    indefatigable, and in many cases personal superintendence, to create a double
                    number of expert whitesmiths, saddlers, and architects. Of the amount of the
                    trade of Paraguay no data from which to form an estimate have been obtained. The
                    two great resources of the country are the forests of timber for building, and
                    the herb of Paraguay; and these form the staple articles of export. But,
                    besides, there are still sent out of the country tobacco, sugar, cotton,
                    sweetmeats, tapioca, rum, wax, tallow, and hides. The imports are not numerous;
                    for it has been the constant aim of the dictator to render his country, if
                    possible, altogether independent of any other.</p>
                <p>It must be very evident, from what has been said, that the whole power of
                    government is centred in the dictator. There are, indeed, in imitation of the
                    Spanish system, a minister of finance, a secretary of state assisted by an under
                    secretary, and a remnant of the ancient cabildo, consisting of two alcaldes,
                    stationed at Assumption; conciliators, and commissioners of police, together
                    with a “faithful executioner,” an inspector of markets, weights, measures, and
                    some others; and, lastly, “an advocate of minors,” whose duty it is to watch
                    over the interests of minors and of slaves. But the highest of these officers is
                    little better than a head clerk, who merely acts under the orders of the
                    dictator. The republic is divided, as in former times, into twenty sections or
                    <hi rend="italic">comandancias,</hi> four of which have for their capitals
                    respectively the towns of Neembucu or Villa del Pilar, Villa Rica, Yquamandiu or
                    Villa de San Pedro, and Villa Real de la Concepcion; the only towns in the whole
                    country, besides Assumption, which is distinguished by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ciudad,</hi> the Spanish for city, the others being called villas.
                    But since the suppression of their cabildos, which were charged with the local
                    administration of justice, these towns no longer enjoy any exclusive privileges.
                    Each section is under the authority of a commandant, who executes the orders of
                    the dictator, directs the operations of the police, decides on minor offences,
                    and exercises the functions of conciliator. He has under his orders some
                    inferior officers of police; and there is also in each section a receiver of
                    taxes. The laws by which Paraguay ought to be governed are those made in the
                    time of the Spaniards; but they have been so altered, first by the junta, and
                    subsequently by the dictator, that the will of the latter may be said to be the
                    law of the country. Justice is administered in civil cases by the parties
                    appearing before the commandant or one of the alcaldes, according as the place
                    of trial is in the capital or in the country, and by their pleading their cause
                    in person. This appears to be a court of conciliation similar to that which is
                    established in Norway. If the attempt at adjustment prove unsuccessful, the
                    cause goes in the first instance before one of the alcaldes, who pronounces a
                    judgment, from which the parties have the right of appeal to the dictator. In
                    criminal cases he is generally the judge himself; and he always proceeds in a
                    summary manner. With regard to punishments we can only speak generally. They are
                    severe, death being the award of crimes which in Great Britain would only be
                    visited by a few weeks’ confinement; and execution is made to follow the
                    sentence as quickly and surely as the thunder-peal follows the flash of
                    lightning. There are two kinds of prisons, namely, the public prison and the
                    state prison, and both are kept in a wretched condition. The prisoners are
                    treated with the utmost severity, and attempts to escape from these horrid
                    places of confinement are punished by death. The police is exercised in Paraguay
                    by all those in office, from the dictator down to the lowest functionaries,
                    called zeladores. All the officers of government, including a train of spies,
                    and also the regular troops and the militia, constitute one great body of
                    police, which exercises a surveillance much stricter than that of France under
                    Fouché. Passports are not only necessary to a person who wishes to quit the
                    country, but also before he can travel twenty leagues from his residence. The
                    whole population is thus kept in a sort of captivity. The post-office is also
                    strictly looked after; and indeed the system of police is a source not only <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> great annoyance, but often of great loss, to the
                    inhabitants. There is kept up a regular army of about 3000 men; and the body of
                    militia, which is entirely under the orders of the dictator, is 10,000 strong.
                    Every native of Paraguay must enter the service as a private soldier, and learn
                    the military exercises; and with regard to the militia, the name of every free
                    man in the republic who has arrived at the age of seventeen, and is capable of
                    bearing arms, is inserted in the rolls. There is, besides, a troop of artillery,
                    and a small naval force.</p>
                <p>The revenues of the state arise from tithes, a tax upon shops and storehouses in
                    the capital, an import and export duty, the sale-duty, stamps, postage of
                    letters, fines, confiscations, “droits d aubaine,” and the produce of the
                    nationaldomains. The tithes are the most productive source of the public
                    revenue; they are levied upon all species of agricultural produce, upon flocks
                    and herds, and even upon poultry. The import and export duties can be received
                    only at the custom-house at Assumption, and both are very heavy. The duty upon
                    all sorts of goods brought into the country is nineteen per cent, <hi
                    rend="italic">ad valorem</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the duty is calculated
                    on the retail price, and there is an additional impost of four per cent, as
                    sale-duty, so that the import-duty cannot be less than thirty per cent. The
                    saleduty is levied upon every thing that changes owners, except agricultural
                    produce, and even for this there is a charge made at Assumption. On articles
                    exported the duty levied is nine per cent, <hi rend="italic">ad valorem.</hi>
                    The other branches of the revenue, such as the stamp-duty and the tax upon
                    letters, yield annually a considerable sum. The national domains of Paraguay
                    extend over almost the half of its territory, consisting of pasturage-lands and
                    forests, the Jesuit Missions, the possessions of other religious corporations,
                    and a great number of country houses and farming establishments confiscated by
                    the dictator. The revenue must therefore be very considerable; but of its actual
                    amount no one except the dictator has any idea.</p>
                <p>When Dr Francia assumed the reins of government, he placed himself at the head of
                    the church as well as of the state. The bishop, who opposed the revolution, was
                    superseded by his vicar-general, Pay Montiel, a creature of the dictator’s.
                    Religious corporations were suppressed, and the clergy were secularized, chiefly
                    by reason of the dictator’s inextinguishable hatred of all institutions which
                    bore any semblance of independence. In short, from the contempt<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193491893" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1893-0062"/> in which he held the monks,
                    he did every thing in his power to throw ridicule upon the monastic order. In
                    Paraguay, as well as in the rest of South America, the education of youth was
                    formerly intrusted exclusively to the monks, who established schools in the
                    convents. Subsequently elementary schools, taught by lay masters, were
                    established in all the districts, and a college of theology was founded at
                    Assumption. The latter was suppressed by the dictator in 1822; but he allowed
                    the elementary schools to remain, without, however, taking any steps to improve
                    them. Butas no obstacles were thrown in the way of establishing private
                    seminaries, several of these have been opened in the capital, and education is
                    rather on the advance. With regard to literature, in the ordinary acceptation of
                    that term, it may be said to be wholly unknown in Paraguay. In 1827 there was
                    nota printing-press in the country; but since then, this instrument of
                    civilization in a free country, and of oppression in an enslaved one, has been
                    established, and of course exclusively used by the dictator.</p>
                <p>The population of Paraguay has been variously estimated, by those who have
                    visited the country, at from 300,000 to 500,000 souls; but the Weimar Almanac
                    for 1835, without giving any authority, states the number as high as 600,000.
                    The great mass of the inhabitants are Creoles; the Indians composing about one
                    tenth, and the mixed race and the black about two tenths, of the whole
                    population. The'natives of Paraguay are gifted with considerable natural
                    talents, and are of a mild, hospitable, and generous disposition, but careless,
                    unsteady, and as easily swayed to evil as prompted to good. In regard to morals,
                    their minds maybe said to hang in even balance between virtue and vice, and
                    readily to take an inclination either way. Hence the remarkable influence which
                    the Jesuits had over them; hence also the scenes of anarchy and bloodshed which
                    followed their expulsion; and hence, lastly, the secret of Dr Francia’s system
                    of despotism. Although not possessed of the ardour of the inhabitants of the
                    torrid zone, they support the greatest fatigue with courage and perseverance;
                    but at other times they will remain whole months in a state of the most complete
                    inaction. They are proud of their ancestors, as having been the founders of the
                    first establishment formed in South America, and they have always been
                    distinguished from the other Creoles by their national spirit. In Paraguay the
                    conquerors have adopted the language of the conquered, and very many of the
                    Creoles are perfectly ignorant of Spanish, particularly the female part of the
                    rural population. In the mixed races of Indian and black, the child follows the
                    condition of the mother, and is free or servile accordingly. Although the men of
                    colour are in a great measure free, yet they have always been supposed to be
                    unfit for office; and notwithstanding that, since the revolution, some of them
                    have been admitted to places of trust, the ancient Spanish prejudice is not the
                    less strong against them. The blacks are very few in number.</p>
                <p>That part of Paraguay which is known under the name of the Missions is governed
                    in a somewhat different manner from the rest of the country. It extends over a
                    surface of 600 square leagues, on the right bank of the Parana, to the
                    south-east of Assumption. The population consists of eight tribes of Indians,
                    and some thousands of whites, who obtained land from the government, and
                    established themselves there, after the expulsion of the Jesuits. The white
                    population is governed by the commandants, as in the other parts of the country;
                    but the Indians attached to the soil, and condemned to work on the state lands,
                    have peculiar officers, who, under the name of administrators, manage these
                    lands, besides exercising the functions of commandants. These two classes of
                    functionaries are under a lieutenant of the government, who has the chief
                    command of all the country of the Missions, but without any control over matters
                    of finance. Several other villages inhabited by Indians in the interior of the
                    country, and which formerly belonged to the Jesuits or other religious
                    communities, have also managers set over them, and are subjected to the
                    authority of the commandant in whose section they happen to be situated. The
                    condition of the Guarani Indians, who are still in the Missions, is inferior to
                    that of the slaves. In the time of the Jesuits, the Guaranis were tolerably well
                    fed and partially clothed; and the fathers, by allowing them processions,
                    dancing, and music, upon holidays, contrived to reconcile them to a state of
                    dependence, and ameliorated their condition whilst they profited by their
                    labour. But after the expulsion of the Jesuits, the managers who succeeded them
                    were chiefly occupied in pillaging the settlements, overworking the Indians, and
                    rendering their fate still more wretched by the utter destitution in which they
                    were held. Since the year 1823, however, the power of the managers has been
                    contracted by the dictator, and neither purchases nor sales have been allowed to
                    be made without his permission. He also employed the Indians in the service of
                    the government.</p>
                <p>Assumption, the capital city of the republic of Paraguay, is built in the form of
                    an amphitheatre, on a rising ground, on the left bank of the river Paraguay, in
                    latitude 25.17.15. south, and longitude 58. 5. west from Greenwich. It has been
                    so completely altered by the dictator, that little of the ancient city remains.
                    But the idea of rebuilding it in a more regular manner occurred to him in the
                    year 1820, upon the discovery of a conspiracy against his life. Its streets were
                    crooked, irregular, and the greater number of them so narrow as to deserve only
                    the name of lanes. The houses, consisting only of one floor, generally stood
                    apart from each other, and being interspersed with trees, little gardens,
                    brushwood, and patches of verdure, they presented the aspect of a village rather
                    than that of a city. Numerous springs issued from the ground in every part of
                    the town, end formed streams, or stagnated into pools; whilst the rain furrowed
                    and cut up almost all the sloping streets. The dictator commenced his
                    architectural reformations by tracing out, in the least populous parts of the
                    city, longitudinal streets, from north-west to south-east, crossed by others at
                    right angles, all of which were ordered to be made from thirty-five to forty
                    feet in width. These new streets served him as a model for the others which were
                    to be opened throughout the city. They were distant from each other one hundred
                    paces; but whenever a public building interfered, the space was either
                    diminished or augmented, in order to leave it standing. The proprietors of
                    houses which interfered with the new line of street were ordered to demolish
                    them; other buildings were pulled down by the mandate of the dictator, and their
                    materials employed in levelling the ground. In short, he completely destroyed
                    the old city; and as he had only to issue his commands to insure obedience, a
                    new one soon rose in its stead. The owners of the dwellings which were thus
                    demolished were not indemnified for their loss, and many rich proprietors were
                    compelled to build mansions on sites pointed out to them. The dictator paid only
                    the master workmen, whose plans were executed by some hundreds of prisoners. The
                    various divisions of the country were obliged to supply all the materials
                    gratuitously; and if the buildings carrying on were outside the capital, the
                    owners of them were also bound to furnish a certain number of workmen. It was in
                    this manner that the fortresses on the frontiers, and several barracks and other
                    edifices at Neembucu, at Assumption, and at Villa Real, were constructed. New
                    roads were also opened through the woods, and others which had been broken up by
                    the rains were widened and repaired. Forty houses were built and let for the
                    benefit of the state; and at every step in the progress of these operations the
                    country people were called upon either for their personal <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193491906" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1906-0063"/>services or for the use of
                    their cattle. The result has been a perfectly renovated city, containing a
                    number of spacious public buildings, large streets, and handsome private
                    mansions. Assumption is the seat of government and the residence of the
                    dictator; and here are all the different offices for the transaction of public
                    business. The number of inhabitants may be estimated at 12,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Paraguay,</hi> a great river of South America, which forms
                    the western boundary of the republic just described. Its head waters are formed
                    by a great number of streams which rise in those mountainous ridges called
                    Sierra del Pary, or Paraguay, a portion of the extensive Paricis, situated in
                    the Brazilian province of Matto Grosso, in latitude 13.30. south. A little below
                    the last of a series of seven lakes, called the Sete Lagoas, which communicate
                    with each other by narrow outlets, the Paraguay flows for a short distance
                    through a swampy country in a northerly direction; it then winds round by the
                    west, and takes a southerly course, which it maintains to its confluence with
                    the river Parana, at the south-western extremity of Paraguay. The first large
                    stream that joins it is the Xauru, which originates in the campos of the Serra
                    Paricis, and after flowing a long way southward, bends to the east-south-east,
                    and falls into the Paraguay in latitude 16. 25. Father Quiroga informs us, that,
                    below the Xauru, the Paraguay separates into two considerable branches, the
                    principal one running in a narrow but deep channel through the Xarayes, and the
                    other branch flowing some leagues to the westward. The Xarayes is an immense
                    lake formed by the abundant rains which fall during the months of November,
                    December, January, and February. At this season the streams and rivers which
                    feed the Paraguay become prodigiously swelled; and the latter river, unable to
                    continue in its legitimate channel, inundates the country for many leagues on
                    both sides. A great part of the beds of the St Lourenço, Tacoary, and Mondego,
                    and other tributaries on the eastern side, as well as the small lakes on the
                    western side, which appear to remain permanently, become portions of this
                    periodical Caspian; and the elevated lands assume the appearance of islands,
                    inhabited by an accumulation of birds and wild beasts. Whilst the floods
                    continue, it is customary to navigate over the plains where the current is less
                    rapid, traversing prodigious plantations of rice annually reproduced by nature
                    without any human assistance, or sustaining any damage from the waters, because
                    it grows as they increase, always presenting, besides the ear, a considerable
                    portion of the stalk above the flood. As the quantity of rain which falls is
                    much greater in some years than in others, the size of the Xarayes
                    varies^accordingly; and as its figure or contour depends on the nature of the
                    country over which it spreads, it is also extremely irregular, and cannot be
                    accurately described. Azara, who is always to be depended upon, thus speaks of
                    this great lake. “It commences before the seventeenth degree of latitude, and it
                    may have in this place twenty leagues of breadth to the east of the river
                    Paraguay. It preserves nearly the same size until the twenty-second degree, that
                    is to say, during more than one hundred leagues, without speaking of the Sugar
                    Loaf, Pau-de-Azucar, and other little mountains which it surrounds with its
                    waters. To the west of the same river the lake commences at 16. 30. and
                    continues to 17. 30., immersing many leagues of the province of Chiquitos. From
                    17. 30. to 19.30. its extent is inconsiderable; but afterwards, to the
                    twenty-third degree, it continues to extend much in the Chaco, and still more in
                    the country of the Chiquitos. We may, by approximation, estimate its length at
                    one hundred and ten leagues, and its breadth at forty.” During a great part of
                    the year it remains perfectly dry, and covered with the corn-flag and other
                    aquatic plants. There are several other lakes of the Paraguay, of much the same
                    nature as the Xarayes, such as that of Aguara-caty, about the twenty-fifth
                    degree of latitude; those which are found to the north and south of the lake
                    Ypoa, situated under the twenty-sixth parallel; those of Neembucu, under the
                    twenty-seventh; and a multitude of others, situated on the eastern margin of the
                    Paraguay, and on all the streams which flow into it.</p>
                <p>The affluents of this great river are very numerous. The Porrudas, or St
                    Lourenço, joins it in latitude 17. 52., some writers say nearly a degree farther
                    south; and the Tacoary, in latitude 19. 15., in front of a square mass of an
                    elevated range, called Serra Albuquerque. Still further south are the mouths of
                    the Mondego, thirty-five miles below which are two high mounts, fronting each
                    other, upon the banks of the Paraguay. On the western mount is built Fort
                    Coimbra. The Tepoti flows into the great river, in latitude 21. 45.; and this is
                    nearly the limit between what is called the High and the Low Paraguay. The
                    following is the order in which the rivers fall in, according to Father Quiroga,
                    who navigated the Paraguay from the mouth of the Xauru to the confluence of the
                    Parana. The embouchure of the Corrientes is in latitude 22. 2.; that of the
                    Guarambari, in 23. 8.; that of the Ipaneguazu, in 23. 28.; that of the
                    Ipanimini, in 24. 4.; that of the Xexui, in 24. 7.; that of the Quarepoti, in
                    24. 23.; that of the Ibobi, in 24. 29.; that of the Mboicaé, in 24. 56.; and
                    that of the Salado, in 25. 1. A little below the city of Assumption, the
                    Pilcomayo runs into the Paraguay by three mouths, after a very long course, its
                    origin being amongst the mountain ridges where the city of Potosi is situated.
                    The mouth of the Tebiquari is in 26. 35. The Bermijo, sometimes denominated the
                    Rio Grande, joins in latitude 26. 54., eleven leagues of direct distance from
                    the city of Corrientes, where the magnificent junction of the Parana and
                    Paraguay takes place, in latitude 27. 27. and longitude 58. 22. west of
                    Greenwich. The combined rivers bear the name of Parana till the confluence of
                    the Uruguay, when all these appellations are sunk in that of the Rio de la
                    Plata. The Spaniards, however, sometimes call the river by the latter name as
                    far up as the junction of the Pilcomayo. Of these tributaries of the Paraguay,
                    by far the largest and most important are the rivers Pilcomayo and the Bermijo.
                    They offer great advantages to a commercial people; but, from the scanty
                    population of the country through which the greater part of their course lies,
                    these have not been turned to proper account. Both rise in Bolivia, the first,
                    as has been mentioned, near the city of Potosi, and the second in the vicinity
                    of Tarija. They descend at first with considerable velocity from the heights
                    where they originate; but after they reach the level country, they flow in a
                    tranquil and majestic current. According to the best information, they possess
                    no inconvenience except their numerous windings, which arise from the want of
                    fall in the ground of the Gran Chaco, through which they run, and which is the
                    most level tract of country in all South America.</p>
                <p>The Paraguay is navigable for vessels of a hundred to a hundred and thirty tons,
                    provided they do not draw more than ten or at most eleven feet of water. One
                    ship, indeed, of three hundred tons burthen, called the Primera, was built at
                    Villa Real, and floated down the stream to the ocean. To obtain correct ideas of
                    the breadth and depth of the Paraguay, Azara measured it at a time when it was
                    lower than it had ever been known to fall in the memory of man. The breadth in
                    several parts was found to be 1332 French feet; and from soundings made to
                    ascertain its depth, and experiments to prove the velocity of its current, Azara
                    calculated that it discharged, when at the very lowest, 98,303 cubic toises of
                    water per hour. The mean quantity, he supposed, would be double this at least,
                    if not more; so that, according to his estimate, the Paraguay <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193491919" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1919-0064"/>discharges throughout the
                    year, at the city of Assumption, nearly two hundred thousand cubic toises of
                    water per hour. So little does the country slope in this part of the South
                    American continent, that it has been calculated that the Paraguay in its course
                    from north to south does not fall above one foot between the eighteenth and
                    twenty-second degrees of latitude. At the capital the waters of the Paraguay are
                    always clear; for the rains which fall either above or below that city are not
                    sufficient to trouble so large a stream. The periodical increase of the river
                    commences at Assumption in the end of February, and the augmentation continues
                    with admirable equality till the end of June. It then begins to decrease in the
                    same regular manner, and this continues during an equal space of time. This
                    periodical increase is much greater in some years than in others; and at
                    Assumption the waters sometimes rise five or six toises above their ordinary
                    level, thus inundating a great part of the country; yet there is little
                    variation at the commencement or at the end. This increase of the river, which,
                    singularly enough, does not begin till the rains have ended, appears to be thus
                    produced. All the rain which falls is first collected in the great natural
                    reservoir Xarayes; and it is not until this is full to overflowing that it
                    discharges itself into the river Paraguay. We find that the Parana, which has no
                    basin of this description to collect the periodical rains, is at its greatest
                    height in December, about a month after the rainy season has set in; so that by
                    this singularly happy arrangement, the rivers Parana and Plata are kept during a
                    great part of the year at a very considerable size. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r.
