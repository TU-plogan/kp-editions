                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">PHILO</label>, an ancient Greek writer, descended of a noble
                    family amongst the Jews, flourished at Alexandria during the reign of Caligula.
                    He was the chief of an embassy sent to Rome about the year forty-two, to plead
                    the cause of the Jews against Apion, who had been sent by the Alexandrians to
                    charge them with neglecting the honours due to Caesar. Caligula, however, would
                    not allow him to speak, and behaved<pb break="no" facs="nls:193495676"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-5676-0353"/> to him in such a manner that Philo was in
                    considerable danger of losing his life. Others, again, tell us that he was
                    heard, but. that lais demands were refused. He afterwards went to Rome in the
                    reign of Claudius, and both Eusebius and Jerome inform us that he became
                    acquainted with St Peter, with whom he lived on terms of friendship. Photius
                    adds, that he became a Christian, but afterwards, from some motive of
                    resentment, recanted. All this, however, is uncertain, because the precise
                    period at which St Peter visited Rome has not been ascertained.</p>
                <p>Philo was educated at Alexandria, and made very great progress in eloquence and
                    in philosophy. After the fashion of the time, he cultivated, like many of his
                    nation and faith, the philosophy of Plato, whose principles he so. thoroughly
                    imbibed, and whose manner he so well imitated, that it became a common saying,
                    <hi rend="italic">Aut Plato philonizat, aut Philo platonizat.</hi> Josephus
                    describes him as a man “eminent on all accounts and Eusebius represents him as
                    “copious in speech, rich in sentiments, and sublime in the knowledge of Holy
                    Writ.” He was, however, so much immersed in philosophy, particularly the
                    Platonic, that he neglected the Hebrew language, and also the rites and customs
                    of his own people. Scaliger alleges, that Philo knew no more of Hebrew and
                    Syriac than a Gaul or a Scythian. Grotius is of opinion that he is not fully to
                    be depended on in what relates to the manners of the Hebrews; and Cudworth
                    declares that, though a Jew by nation, he was yet very ignorant of Jewish
                    customs. But Fabricius thinks differently; for although he admits the
                    inadvertencies and errors of Philo in regard to these matters, he does not
                    discover sufficient reason to justify charging so illustrious a doctor of the
                    law with ignorance. He allows, however, that Philo’s passion for philosophy had
                    made him more than half a Pagan. It led him to interpret the whole of the law
                    and the prophets upon Platonic ideas, and to admit nothing as truly interpreted
                    which was not agreeable to the principles of the Academy. Besides, he turned
                    every thing into allegory, and deduced the darkest meanings from the plainest
                    words. This pernicious practice Origen is known to have imitated, and thus
                    exposed himself to the scoffs of Celsus and of Porphyry. Philo’s writings abound
                    with high and mystical, as well as subtile, far-fetched, and abstracted notions;
                    and indeed the doctrines of Plato and Moses are so promiscuously blended, that
                    it is not easy to assign to each his peculiar prerogatives. In his works,
                    however, there are certainly many excellent things. Though he is continually
                    plato-nizing and allegorizing the Scriptures, he abounds with fine sentiments
                    and lessons of morality; and his morals are rather the morals of a Christian
                    than those of a Jew. History, as well as his own writings, give us every reason
                    to believe that he was a man of great prudence, constancy, and virtue.</p>
                <p>His works were first published in Greek by Turnebus, at Paris, 1552; and to these
                    a Latin translation, executed by Gelenius, was afterwards added. The Paris
                    edition of 1640, in folio, is the best that was published for a century; a
                    circumstance which led Cotelerius to observe, that Philo was an author who
                    deserved to have a better text and a better version. This, however, was
                    accomplished, in 1742, when a handsome edition of his works was published at
                    London, by Dr Mangey, In two vols. folio. In 1797, Jacob Bryant published the
                    Sentiments of Philo Judaeus concerning the <hi rend="italic">Logos</hi> or Word,
                    in order to prove that Philo borrowed his sentiments and expressions relative to
                    the second person of the adorable Trinity from the apostles. But it is to be
                    observed here, that Philo’s authority had repeatedly before been founded on by
                    various writers in favour of the fundamental principle of the existence of a
                    Divine Unity in a Trinity of Persons; particularly by Dr Allix in his Judgment
                    of the Jewish Church, 1699, and also by Mr Whitaker in his Origin of Arianism.

                    Vossius to have been born in the tenth year of the reign of Tiberius, <hi

                    gained considerable reputation as a writer both of history and grammar; but his
                    name has come down to us chiefly as the translator of a history which
                    Sanchoniathon had written in the Phoenician language. Eusebius has preserved
                    several fragments of the preface of Philo, and also of this history. This
                    fragment has called forth the ingenuity of many modern writers, but more
                    particularly of Mr Dodwell, who has written a very learned dissertation on the
                    subject. Fourmont also makes it the text of a work which he entitled <hi

                    of Byzantium, and flourished in the year 160, being the contemporary of
                    Ctesibius and Hero. He was the author of a work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poliorcetica,οη</hi> the method of attacking and defending towns, of which the
                    fourth and fifth books have been preserved. The first treats of the manner of
                    preparing arrows, balistae, catapultae, and other warlike engines. Amongst other
                    inventions, he mentions a machine of Ctesibius which discharged weapons by means
                    of compressed air, upon the same principle, no doubt, as our air-gun. ‘ In the
                    second book he treats of the manner of fortifying and provisioning cities, and,
                    amongst other things, recommends that the provisions and water be poisoned if
                    there be danger of the place falling into the hands of an enemy. This work has
                    been published, with a Latin translation, in a collection entitled <hi
