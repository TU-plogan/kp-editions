                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    rend="smallcaps">Fabri,</hi> born in 1580, was descended from an ancient and
                    noble family, which had been originally established at Pisa in Italy. At ten
                    years of age he was sent to Avignon, where he spent five years in the Jesuits’
                    college, studying what in Scotland and on the Continent is called <hi
                    rend="italic">humanity.</hi> From Avignon he was, in 1595, removed to Aix, and
                    entered upon the study of philosophy. In the interim, he attended the proper
                    masters for dancing, riding, and handling arms, in all which, though he
                    performed the lessons regularly, it was with reluctance; for this being done
                    only to please an uncle, whose heir he was to be, he never practised by himself,
                    esteeming all the time lost which was not spent in the pursuits of literature.
                    During this period, his father being presented with a medal of the Emperor
                    Arcadius, which had been found at Belgenser, Peiresc begged the favour of it;
                    and, charmed with deciphering the characters in the exergue, and reading the
                    emperor’s name, he carried the medal, in a transport of joy, to his uncle, who
                    for his encouragement gave him two more, together with some books upon the
                    subject. This is the epoch of his application to antiquities, for which he
                    became afterwards so famous. In 1596, he was sent to finish his course of
                    philosophy under the Jesuits at Tournon, where he turned his attention
                    particularly to cosmography, as being necessary to the understanding of history;
                    abating, however, nothing of his application to antiquity, in which he was
                    assisted by Petrus Rogerus, one of the professors, and a skilful medallist. Nor
                    did he neglect the study of humanity in general, in which he was the master and
                    instructor of a brother who lived with him. But to do all this he was obliged to
                    sit up late at night; and as he was naturally of a feeble constitution, so much
                    labour and attention increased the weakness of his stomach, formerly contracted,
                    and for which he had used a kind of digestive powder. Being recalled by his
                    uncle in 1597, he returned to Aix, and there entered upon the study of the law.
                    which he prosecuted, however, so as to find leisure to visit and converse
                    frequently with Bagarr, a most skilful antiquary, who was afterwards master of
                    the jewels to Henry IV.</p>
                <p>The following year he went again to Avignon, to carry on his course of law under
                    one David, who being also well skilled in antiquities, was pleased to see
                    Peiresc join this study to that of the law. But Ghibertus of Naples, auditor to
                    Cardinal Aquaviva, fed his curiosity the most, in showing him some rarities,
                    such as he had never seen before. Having now spent almost three years in Italy,
                    he began to prepare for his departure, and in the end of 1602, having packed up
                    all the rarities, gems, and other articles which he had procured, and despatched
                    them to Marseilles, he left Padua, and, crossing the Alps of Geneva, proceeded
                    to Lyons. From Lyons he went to Montpellier, to improve himself in law under
                    Julius Parius. From Montpellier he despatched more rarities to his uncle, and
                    arrived at Aix in November; but having brought Parius along with him, he
                    obtained leave to return in a few days to Montpellier. He accompanied Parius
                    back again, and under him continued pursuing his legal studies till the end of
                    1603, when he returned to Aix, at the earnest request of his uncle, who, having
                    resigned to him his senatorial dignity, had ever since the beginning of the year
                    laboured to get the king’s patent. The degree of doctor of laws was a necessary
                    qualification for this dignity. Peiresc, therefore, having performed the usual
                    exercise, took that degree, in January 1604, when the patent was given to the
                    senate, and ordered to be recorded; yet Peiresc procured leave not to be
                    presently entered into the list of senators. The bent of his inclination was not
                    so much to business as to advancing arts and sciences, and assisting all the
                    promoters of learning. For this purpose, he resolved to lead a single life; so
                    that when his father had concluded a match for him with a respectable lady, he
                    begged to be excused.</p>
                <p>In the year 1605 he accompanied Varius, first president of the senate at Aix, who
                    was very fond of him, to Paris, whence, having visited every thing curious, he,
                    in 1606, crossed the Channel to England, in company with the king’s ambassador.
                    He was very graciously received by King James I.; and having seen Oxford, and
                    visited Camden, Sir Robert Cotton, Sir Henry Saville, and other learned men, he
                    passed over to Holland. After visiting the several towns and universities, with
                    the literati in each, he passed through Antwerp to Brussels, and thence returned
                    to Paris to witness the ceremony of the Dauphin’s baptism, which was solemnized
                    on the 24th of August 1606.</p>
                <p>In 1629 he began to be much tormented with strangury and haemorrhoids; and in
                    1631, having completed the marriage of his nephew Claudius with Margaret
                    Al-resia, a noblewoman of the county of Avignon, he bestowed upon him the barony
                    of Rians, together with a grant of his senatorial dignity, only reserving the
                    function to himself for three years. But the parliament not waiting for his
                    surrender of it, he resented that affront so heinously, that in 1632 he procured
                    letters patent from the king to be restored to the exercise of his office during
                    five years longer, which happened to be till the time of his death; for, being
                    seized, in June 1637, with a fever, which brought on a stoppage of urine, this
                    put an end to his life, in the fifty-seventh year of his age.</p>
