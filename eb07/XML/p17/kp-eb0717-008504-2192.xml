                <p><label type="entry">PARLIAMENT</label>, the grand assembly of the three estates
                    of the kingdom, summoned together by the king’s authority, to consider of
                    matters relating to the· public welfare, and particularly to enact and repeal
                    laws.</p>
                <p>The original institution of parliament is one of those matters which lie so far
                    hidden in the obscurity of antiquity, that the tracing of it out is a task
                    difficult in itself, and not likely to be productive of any satisfactory result.
                    The term <hi rend="italic">parliament</hi> itself is comparatively of modern
                    date, being derived from a French word, and signifying the place where they met
                    and conferred together. It was first applied to ‘general assemblies of the
                    states under Louis VII. in France, about the middle of the twelfth century. But
                    it is certain that, long before the introduction of the Norman language into
                    England, all matters of importance were debated and settled in the great council
                    of the realm; a practice which seems to have been universal amongst the northern
                    nations, particularly the Germans, and which was carried by them into all the
                    countries of Europe which they overran at the dissolution of the Roman empire.
                    Relics of this constitution, under various modifications and changes, are still
                    to be met with in the diets of Poland, Germany, and Sweden.</p>
                <p>In England, however, this general council has been held immemorially, under the
                    several names of <hi rend="italic">michel-</hi><hi rend="italic">synoth,</hi> or
                    great council; <hi rend="italic">michel∙gemote,</hi> or great meeting; and more
                    frequently <hi rend="italic">wittena-gemote,</hi> or the meeting of wise men. It
                    was also styled in Latin, <hi rend="italic">commune concilium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">regni,</hi><hi rend="italic">magnum concilium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">regis,</hi><hi rend="italic">curia</hi><hi rend="italic">magna,

                    rend="italic">communitas regni</hi><hi rend="italic">Angliae.</hi> We have
                    instances of its meeting to order the affairs of the kingdom, to make new laws
                    and to amend the old, or, as Fleta expresses it, <hi rend="italic">novis
                    injuriis emersis</hi><hi rend="italic">nova</hi><hi rend="italic">constituere
                    remedia,</hi> as early as the reign of Ina king of the West Saxons, Offa king of
                    the Mercians, and Ethelbert king of Kent, in the several realms of the
                    heptarchy. But, after their union, the Mirrour informs us that Alfred ordained
                    as a perpetual usage, that these councils should meet twice in the year, or
                    oftener if need be, to treat of the government of God’s people, and how they
                    should keep themselves from sin, live in quiet, and receive right. The
                    succeeding Saxon and Danish monarchs held frequent councils of this sort, as
                    appears from their respective codes of laws, the titles of which usually
                    indicate that they were enacted, either by the king with the advice of his <hi
                    rend="italic">wittena-gemote</hi> or wise men, as, <hi rend="italic">Haec

                <p>There is also no doubt that these great councils were occasionally held under the
                    first princes of the Norman line. Glanvil, who wrote in the reign of Henry II.
                    speaking of the particular amount of an amercement in the sheriff’s court, says
                    it had never yet been ascertained by the general assize or assembly, but was
                    left to the custom of particular counties. Here the general assize is spoken of
                    as a meeting well known, and its statutes or decisions are referred to in
                    manifest contradistinction to custom or to the common law. And in the time of
                    Edward III. an act of parliament, made in the reign of William the Conqueror,
                    was pleaded in the case of the Abbey of St Edmund’s Bury, and judicially allowed
                    by the court.</p>
                <p>Hence it indisputably appears that parliaments or general councils were coeval
                    with the kingdom itself. How those parliaments were constituted and composed is
                    another question, which has been matter of great dispute amongst our learned
                    antiquaries; and, particularly, whether the Commons were summoned at all, or, if
                    summoned, at what period they began to form a distinct assembly. But without
                    entering into controversies of this kind, it may be sufficient to observe here,
                    that it is generally agreed, that, in the main, the constitution of parliament,
                    as it now exists, was marked out as long ago as the seventeenth year of King
                    John, 1215, in the Great Charter granted by that monarch, in which he promises
                    to summon all archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons,
                    personally, and all other tenants in chief under the crown, by the sheriff and
                    bailiffs, to meet at a certain place, upon forty days’ notice, to assess aids
                    and scutages when necessary. And this constitution subsisted at least from the
                    year 1266, or the 49th of Henry III., there being still extant writs of that
                    date, to summon knights, citizens, and burgesses, to attend parliament. We
                    proceed therefore to inquire wherein consists this constitution of parliament as
                    it now stands; and, in the prosecution of this inquiry, we shall consider,
                    first, the manner and time of its assembling; secondly, its constituent parts;
                    thirdly, the laws and customs relating to parliament; fourthly, the methods of
                    proceeding, and of enacting statutes, in both houses; and, lastly, the manner of
                    the paiĭiament’s adjournment, prorogation, and dissolution.</p>
                <p>1. The parliament is to be regularly summoned by the king’s writ or letter,
                    issued out of chancery, by advice of the privy council, at least forty days
                    before it begins to sit. It is a branch of the royal prerogative that no
                    parliament can be convened by its own authority, or by the authority of any
                    excepting the king alone; and this prerogative is founded upon very good reason.
                    For, supposing.it had a right to meet spontaneously, without being called
                    together, it is impossible to conceive that all the members, and each of the
                    houses, would agree unanimously upon the proper time and place of meeting; and
                    if half of the members met, and half absented themselves, who could determine
                    which was really the legislative body, the part assembled, or that which staid
                    away? It is therefore necessary that the parliament should be called together at
                    a determinate time and place, and it is highly becoming its dignity and
                    independence that it should be called together by none but one of its own
                    constituent parts; but, of the three constituent parts, this office can only
                    appertain to the king, as he is a single person, whose will may be uniform and
                    steady, the first person in the nation, being superior to both houses in
                    dignity, and the only branch of the legislature which has a separate existence,
                    and is capable of performing any act at a time when no parliament is in being.
                    Nor is it an exception to this rule, that, by some modern statutes, on the
                    demise of a king or a queen, if there be then no parliament in being, the last
                    parliament revives, and is to sit again for six months, unless dissolved by the
                    successor; for this revived parliament must have been originally summoned by the
                    crown.</p>
                <p>It is true indeed that the Convention Parliament, which restored Charles II., met
                    above a month before his return, the Lords by their own authority, and the
                    Commons in pursuance of writs issued in the name of the keepers of the liberty
                    of England by authority of parliament; and that the said parliament sat till the
                    29th of December, fully seven months after the Restoration, and enacted many
                    laws, several of which still remain in force. But this was from the necessity of
                    the case, which supersedes all law; for if they had not so met, it would have
                    been morally impossible that the kingdom could have been settled in peace. The
                    first thing, however, which was done after the king’s return, was, to pass an
                    act declaring this to be a good parliament, notwithstanding the defect of the
                    king’s writ; so that as the royal prerogative was chiefly wounded by their so
                    meeting, and as the king himself, who alone had a right to object, consented to
                    waive the objection, this cannot be drawn into an example in prejudice of the
                    rights of the crown. Besides, we should also remember, that there existed at
                    that time great doubt amongst the lawyers, whether even this healing act made it
                    a good parliament; and indeed it was held by many in the negative, though this
                    seems to have been too nice a scruple. But, out of abundant caution, it was
                    thought necessary to confirm its acts in the next parliament, by statute 13 Car.
                    II. c. 7 and c. 14.</p>
                <p>It is likewise true, that at the time of the Revolution in 1688, the Lords and
                    Commons, by their own authority, and upon the summons of the Prince of Orange,
                    afterwards William HL, met in a convention, and therein disposed of the crown
                    and kingdom. But it must be remembered, that this assembling was held upon a
                    similar principle of necessity as at the Restoration, that is, upon a full
                    conviction that James II. had abdicated the government, and that the throne was
                    thereby vacant; and this supposition of the individual members was confirmed by
                    their concurrent resolution when they actually came together. In such a case as
                    the palpable vacancy of a throne, it follows, <hi rend="italic">ex necessitate
                    rei,</hi> that the form of the royal writs must be laid aside, otherwise no
                    parliament could ever meet again. For let us put another possible case, and
                    suppose, for the sake of argument, that the whole royal line should at any time
                    fail and become extinct, which would indisputably vacate the throne; in this
                    situation it seems reasonable to presume that the body of the nation, consisting
                    of Lords and Commons, would have a right to meet and to settle the government.
                    But upon this and no other principle did the Convention assemble in 1688. The
                    vacancy of the throne preceded their meeting without any royal summons, and was
                    not a consequence of it. They did not assemble without writ, and then declare
                    the throne vacant; but, the throne being previously vacant by the king’s
                    abdication, they assembled without writ, as they must have done if they
                    assembled at all. Had the throne been full, their meeting would not have been
                    regular; but, as it was really empty, such meeting became absolutely necessary.
                    Accordingly, it is declared by statute (1 William and Mary, stat. i. c. 1), that
                    this Convention was really the two houses of parliament, notwithstanding the
                    want of writs, or other defects of form; so that, notwithstanding these two
                    capital exceptions, which were justifiable only on a principle of necessity, and
                    each of which, by the way, induced a revolution in the government, the rule laid
                    down is in general certain, that the king only can convoke a parliament.</p>
                <p>And this, by the ancient statutes of the realm, he is bound to do every year, or
                    offener if need be. Not that he is, or ever was, obliged by these statutes to
                    call a new parliament every year; but only to permit a parliament to sit
                    annually for the redress of grievances, and the despatch of business, if need
                    be. These last words are so loose and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492218"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-2218-0087"/>vague, that such of our monarchs as were inclined
                    to govern without parliaments neglected the convoking of them, sometimes for a
                    very considerable period, under pretence that there was not need of them. But,
                    to remedy this, by the statute 16 Car. II. c. 1, it is enacted, that the sitting
                    and holding of parliaments shall not be intermitted above three years at the
                    most; and by the 1st of William and Mary, stat, ii, c. 2, it is declared to be
                    one of the rights of the people, that, for the redress of all grievances, and
                    for the amending, strengthening, and preserving of the laws, parliaments ought
                    to be held frequently. And this indefinite frequency is again reduced to a
                    certainty by statute 6 William and Mary, c. 2, which enacts, as the statute of
                    Charles II. had before done, that a new parliament shall be called within three
                    years after the determi-</p>
                <p>. nation of the former.</p>
                <p>2. The constituent parts of a parliament are, the king’s majesty, sitting there
                    in his royal political capacity; and the three estates of the realm—the Lords
                    Spiritual, and the Lords Temporal, who sit together with the king in one house,
                    and the Commons, who sit by themselves in another. The king and these three
                    estates taken together form the great corporation or body politic of the
                    kingdom, of which the king is said to be <hi rend="italic">caput,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">principium,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >finis.</hi> For upon their assembling, the king meets them, either in person or
                    by representation, without which there can be no beginning of a parliament; and
                    he alone possesses the power of dissolving them.</p>
                <p>It is highly necessary, for preserving the balance of the constitution, that the
                    executive power should be a branch, though not the whole, of the legislature.
                    The total union of them, we have seen, would be productive of tyranny; the total
                    disjunction of them, for the present, would in the end produce the same effects,
                    by causing that union against which it seems to provide. The legislature would
                    soon become tyrannical, by making continual encroachments, and gradually
                    assuming to itself the rights of the executive power. Thus the long parliament
                    of Charles I., whilst it acted in a constitutional manner, with the royal
                    concurrence, redressed many heavy grievances, and established many salutary
                    laws. But when the two houses assumed the power of legislation, exclusively of
                    the royal authority, they soon afterwards assumed the reins of administration;
                    and, in consequence of these united powers, overturned both church and state,
                    and established a worse oppression than any they pretended to remedy. To prevent
                    any such encroachments, the king is himself a part of the parliament; and as
                    this is the reason of his being so, the share of legislation which the
                    constitution has placed in the crown consists in the power of rejecting rather
                    than resolving, this being sufficient to answer the end proposed. For we may
                    apply to the royal negative, in this instance, what Cicero observes of the
                    negative of the Roman tribunes, that the crown has not any power of doing wrong,
                    but merely of preventing wrong being done. The crown cannot begin of itself any
                    alterations in the established law; but it may approve or disapprove of the
                    alterations suggested and consented to by the two houses. The legislature,
                    therefore, cannot abridge the executive power of any rights which it now has by
                    law, without its own consent, since the law must perpetually stand as it now
                    does, unless all the powers agree to alter it; and herein consists the true
                    excellence of the British government, that all its parts form a mutual check
                    upon each other. In the legislature, the people are a check upon the nobility,
                    and the nobility a check upon the people, by the mutual privilege of rejecting
                    each what the other has resolved; whilst the king is a check upon both, which
                    preserves the executive power from'encroachments. But this very executive power
                    is again checked and kept within due bounds by the two houses, through the
                    privilege they possess’of inquiring into, impeaching, and punishing the conduct
                    of evil and pernicious counsellors. Thus every branch of our civil polity
                    supports and is supported, regulates and is regulated, by the rest. For the two
                    houses naturally drawing in two directions of opposite interest, and the
                    prerogative in another different from them both, they mutually keep each other
                    from exceeding their proper limits; whilst the whole is prevented from
                    separation, and artificially connected together, by the mixed nature of the
                    crown, which is part of the legislature, and the sole executive magistrate. Like
                    three distinct powers in mechanics, they jointly impel the machine of government
                    in a direction different from what either, acting by itself, would have done;
                    but at the same time in a direction partaking of each separate impulsion, and
                    formed out of all, constituting the true line of the liberty and happiness of
                    the community.</p>
                <p>3. The power and jurisdiction of parliaments, says Sir Edward Coke, is so
                    transcendent and absolute, that it cannot be confined either ;for causes or
                    persons within any bounds; and of this high court, he adds, it may be truly
                    said, <hi rend="italic">Si</hi><hi rend="italic">antiquitatem spectes, est
                    vetustissima; si dignitatem, est honoratissima; si jurisdictionem, est
                    capacissima.</hi> It has sovereign and uncontrollable authority in making,
                    confirming, enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviving, and
                    expounding laws, concerning matters of all possible denominations,
                    ecclesiastical or temporal, civil, military, maritime, or criminal; this being
                    the depository where that absolute power, which must in all governments reside
                    somewhere, is intrusted by the constitution of these kingdoms. All mischiefs and
                    grievances, operations and remedies, which transcend the ordinary course of the
                    laws, are within the reach of this extraordinary tribunal. It can regulate or
                    new-model the succession to the crown, as was done in the reigns of Henry VIII.
                    and William III. It can alter the established religion of the land, as was done
                    in a variety of instances in the reigns of Henry VIII. and his three children.
                    It can change and create afresh even the constitution of the kingdom and of
                    parliaments, as was done by the act of Union, and the several statutes for
                    triennial and septennial elections. It can, in short, do everything that is not
                    naturally impossible; and therefore some have not scrupled to call its power, by
                    a figure rather too bold, the “omnipotence of parliament.” True it is, however,
                    that what the parliament does, no authority upon earth can undo; so that it is a
                    matter most essential to the liberties of this kingdom, that such members be
                    delegated to this important trust as are most eminent for their probity, their
                    fortitude, and their knowledge. For it was a known apophthegm of Lord Treasurer
                    Burghley, that «England could never be ruined but by a parliament; and, as Sir
                    Matthew Hale observes, this being the highest and greatest court, over which
                    none other can have jurisdiction in the kingdom, if by any means a misgovernment
                    should anyway fall upon it, the subjects of this kingdom are left without any
                    manner of remedy. To the same purpose Montesquieu, though we trust too hastily,
                    presages, that as Rome, Sparta, and Carthage, have lost their liberty and
                    perished, so the constitution of England will in time lose its liberty and
                    perish; it will perish, says he, whenever the legislative power shall become
                    more corrupt than the executive.</p>
                <p>To prevent the mischiefs which might arise by placing this extensive authority in
                    hands that are either incapable or unfit to manage it, it is provided by the
                    custom and law of parliament, that no one shall sit or vote in either house,
                    unless he be twenty-one years of age. This is also expressly declared by statute
                    7 and 8 William III. c. 25. With regard to the House of Commons, doubts have
                    arisen, from some contradictory judgments, whether or not a minor was
                    incapacitated from sitting in that house. It is also enacted<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193492231" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2231-0088"/> by statute 7 Jac. I. c. 6,
                    that no member shall be permitted to enter the House of Commons till he has
                    taken the oath of allegiance before the Lord Steward or his deputy; and by 30
                    Car. II. st. ii., and 1 Geo. I. c. 13, it is provided that no member shall sit
                    or vote in either house, till he has, in the presence of the house, taken the
                    oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, and subscribed and repeated the
                    declaration against transubstantiation, the invocation of saints, and the
                    sacrifice of the mass. Aliens, unless naturalized, were likewise by the law of
                    parliament incapable of serving therein; and it is enacted by statute 12 and 13
                    William III. c. 2, that no alien, even though he be naturalized, shall be
                    capable of being a member of either house of parliament. But these are not the
                    only standing incapacities. If any person be made a peer by the king, or elected
                    to serve in the House of Commons by the people, yet may the respective houses,
                    upon complaint of any crime committed by such person, and proof thereof, adjudge
                    him disabled and incapable to sit as a member; and this by the law and custom of
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>For as every court of justice has laws and customs for its direction, some the
                    civil and canon, some the common law, others their own peculiar laws and
                    customs, so the high court of parliament has also its own peculiar law, called
                    the <hi rend="italic">lex</hi><hi rend="italic">et consuetudo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">parliaments</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a law which, Sir Edward
                    Coke observes, is <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">omnibus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quaerenda,</hi><hi rend="italic">a multis ignorata, a paucis
                    cognita.</hi> It will not therefore be expected that we should enter into the
                    examination of this law with any degree of minuteness; since, as the same
                    learned author assures us, it is much better to be learned from the rolls of
                    parliament and other records, and by precedents and continual experience, than
                    can be expressed by any one man. It will be sufficient to observe, that the
                    whole of the law and custom of parliament has originated from this one maxim,
                    “that whatever matter arises concerning either house of parliament, ought to be
                    examined, discussed, and adjudged in that house to which it relates, and not
                    elsewhere.” Hence, for instance, the Lords will not suffer the Commons to
                    interfere in settling the election of a peer in Scotland; the Commons will not
                    allow the Lords to judge of the election of a burgess; nor will either house
                    permit the subordinate courts of law to examine the merits of either case. But
                    the maxims upon which they proceed, together with the method of proceeding, rest
                    entirely in the breast of the parliament itself, and are not defined or
                    ascertained by any particular or stated laws.</p>
                <p>The privileges of parliament are likewise very large and indefinite; and
                    therefore,when in the 31st of Henry VI. the House of Lords propounded a question
                    to the judges concerning them, the chief justice, Sir John Fortescue, in the
                    name of his brethren, declared, “That they ought not to make answer to that
                    question; for it hath not been used aforetime that the justices should in
                    anywise determine the privileges of the high court of parliament; for it is so
                    high and mighty in its nature that it may make law, and that which is law it may
                    make no law; and the determination and knowledge of that privilege belong to the
                    lords of parliament, and not to the justices.” Privileges of parliament were
                    principally established in order to protect its members, not only from being
                    molested by their fellowsubjects, but more especially from being oppressed by
                    the power of the crown. If therefore all the privileges of parliament were once
                    to be set down and ascertained, and no privilege to be allowed but what was so
                    defined and determined, it were easy for the executive power to devise some new
                    case not within the line of privilege, and under pretence thereof to harass any
                    refractory member, and to violate the freedom of parliament. The dignity and
                    independence of the two houses are therefore in a great measure preserved by
                    keeping their privileges indefinite. Some, however, of the more notorious
                    privileges of the members of either house are, privilege of speech, of person,
                    of their domestics, and of their lands and goods. As to the first, the privilege
                    of speech, it is declared by the statute 1 William and Mary, st. ii. c. 2, as
                    one of the liberties of the people, “that the freedom of speech, and debates,
                    and proceedings in parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any
                    court or place out of parliament and this freedom of speech is particularly
                    demanded of the king in person by the speaker of the House of Commons at the
                    opening of every new parliament. So likewise are the other privileges of person,
                    servants, lands, and goods, which are immunities as ancient as Edward the
                    Confessor, in whose laws we find this precept: <hi rend="italic">Ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">synodos venientibus, sive</hi><hi rend="italic">summoniti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sint, sive</hi><hi rend="italic">per se quid agendum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">habuerint,</hi><hi rend="italic">sit</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >summa</hi><hi rend="italic">pax</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and so too in the
                    old Gothic constitutions, <hi rend="italic">Extenditur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >haec pax</hi><hi rend="italic">et securitas</hi><hi rend="italic">ad
                    quatuor</hi><hi rend="italic">decim dies,</hi><hi rend="italic">convocato regni
                    senatu.</hi> This formerly included not only privilege from illegal violence,
                    but also from legal arrests and seizures by process from the courts of law; and
                    still to assault by violence a member of either house, or his menial servants,
                    is a high contempt of parliament, and there punished with the utmost severity.
                    It has likewise peculiar penalties annexed to it in the courts of law by the
                    statutes 5 Henry IV. c. 6, and 11 Henry VI. c. 11. Nor can any member of either
                    house be arrested and taken into custody without a breach of the privilege of
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>But all other privileges which derogate from the common law are now at an end,
                    save only as to the freedom of the member’s person; which in a peer, by the
                    privilege of peerage, is for ever sacred and inviolable, and in a commoner, by
                    the privilege of parliament, for forty days after every prorogation, and forty
                    days before the next appointed meeting, which is now in effect as long as the
                    parliament subsists, since it is seldom prorogued for more than eighty days at a
                    time. As to all other privileges which obstruct the ordinary course of justice,
                    they were restrained by the statutes 12 William III. c. 3, 2 and 3 Anne, c. 18,
                    and 11 Geo. II. c. 24, and are now totally abolished by statute 10 Geo. III. c.
                    50, which enacts, that any suit may at any time be brought against any peer or
                    member of parliament, their servants, or any other person entitled to privilege
                    of parliament; and that it shall not be impeached or delayed by pretence of any
                    such privilege, except that the person of a member of the House of Commons shall
                    not thereby be subjected to any arrest or imprisonment. Likewise, for the
                    benefit of commerce, it is provided by statute 4 Geo. III. c. 33, that any
                    trader, having privilege of parliament, may be served with legal process for any
                    just debt to the amount of L.100; and, unless he make satisfaction within two
                    months, it shall be deemed an act of bankruptcy; and commissions of bankruptcy
                    may be issued against such privileged traders, in like manner as against any
                    other.</p>
                <p>The only way by which courts of justice could anciently take cognizance of
                    privilege of parliament was by writ of privilege, in the nature of a <hi
                    rend="italic">supersedeas,</hi> to deliver the party out of custody when
                    arrested in a civil suit. For when a letter was written by the speaker to the
                    judges to stay proceedings against a privileged person, they rejected it, as
                    contrary to their oath of office. But since the statute 12 William III. c. 3,
                    which enacts, that no privileged person shall be subject to arrest or
                    imprisonment, it has been held that such arrest is irregular <hi rend="italic"
                    >αb initio,</hi> and that the party may be discharged upon motion. It is to be
                    observed, that there is no precedent of any such writ of privilege, but only in
                    civil suits; and that the statute of 1 Jac. I. c. 13, and that of William HL,
                    which remedy some inconveniences arising from privilege of parliament, speak
                    only of civil actions. Therefore the claim of privilege has usually <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193492244" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2244-0089"/> been guarded with
                    an exception as to the case of indictable crimes; or, as it has been frequently
                    expressed, of treason, felony, and breach of the peace. Hence it seems to have
                    been understood that no privilege was allowable to the members, their families,
                    or servants, in any crime whatsoever; for all crimes are treated by the law as
                    being <hi rend="italic">contra</hi><hi rend="italic">pacem domini regis.</hi>
                    Instances have not been wanting in which privileged persons have been convicted
                    of misdemeanors, and committed, or prosecuted to outlawry, even in the middle of
                    a session; proceedings which have afterwards received the sanction and
                    approbation of parliament. To this it may he added, that the case of writing and
                    publishing seditious libels was resolved by both houses not to be entitled to
                    privilege; and the reasons upon which that case proceeded extended equally to
                    every indictable offence. Thus the chief, if not the only privilege of
                    parliament, in such cases, seems to be the right of receiving immediate
                    information of the imprisonment or detention of any member, with the reason for
                    which he is detained; a practice that is daily used upon the slightest military
                    accusations, preparatory to a trial by a court martial, and which is recognised
                    by the several temporary statutes for suspending the <hi rend="italic">habeas
                    corp&gt;us</hi> act, by which it is provided, that no member of either house
                    shall be detained, till the matter of which he stands suspected be first
                    communicated to the house of which he is a member, and the consent of the said
                    house obtained for his commitment or detaining. But ever since the Revolution
                    the usage has uniformly been to make the communication subsequently to the
                    arrest.</p>
                <p>4. For the despatch of business, each house of parliament has its speaker. The
                    speaker of the House of Lords, whose office it is to preside there, and manage
                    the formality of business, is the Lord Chancellor, or keeper of the king’s great
                    seal, or any other appointed by the king’s commission; and if none be so
                    appointed, the House of Lords may elect their own speaker. The speaker of the
                    House of Commons is chosen by the house, but must be approved by the king. And
                    herein the usage of the two houses differs. The speaker of the House of Commons
                    cannot give his opinion or argue any question in the house; but the speaker of
                    the House of Lords, if a lord of parliament, may do so. In each house the act of
                    the majority binds the whole; and this majority is declared by votes openly and
                    publicly given, not, as in Venice, and many other senatorial assemblies,
                    privately or by ballot. The latter method may be serviceable, to prevent
                    intrigues and unconstitutional combinations; but it is impossible to be
                    practised with us, at least in the House of Commons, where every member’s
                    conduct is subject to the future censure of his constituents, and therefore
                    should be openly submitted to their inspection.</p>
                <p>5. It now only remains to add a word or two concerning the manner in which
                    parliament may be adjourned, prorogued, or dissolved.</p>
                <p>An adjournment is no more than a continuance of the session from one day to
                    another, as the word itself signifies; and this is done by the authority of each
                    house separately every day, and sometimes for a fortnight or a month together,
                    as at Christmas or Easter, or upon other particular occasions. But the
                    adjournment of one house is no adjournment of the other. It has also been usual,
                    when his majesty has signified his pleasure, that both or either of the houses
                    should adjourn themselves to a certain day, to obey the king’s pleasure so
                    signified, and to adjourn accordingly. Otherwise, besides the indecorum of a
                    refusal, a prorogation would assuredly follow, and would often be very
                    inconvenient both to public and to private business. For prorogation puts an end
                    to the session; and then such bills as are only begun and not perfected must be
                    resumed <hi rend="italic">de novo,</hi> if at all, in a subsequent session;
                    whereas, after an adjournment, all things continue in the same state as at the
                    time of the adjournment, and may be proceeded in without any fresh
                    commencement.</p>
                <p>A prorogation is the continuance of the parliament from one session to another,
                    as an adjournment is a continuation of the session from day to day. This is done
                    by the royal authority, expressed either by the Lord Chancellor in his majesty’s
                    presence, or by commission from the crown, or frequently by proclamation. Both
                    houses arc necessarily prorogued at the same time, it not being a prorogation of
                    the House of Lords or Commons, but of the parliament. The session is never
                    understood to be at an end until a prorogation takes place; although, unless
                    some act be passed, or some judgment given in parliament, it is in truth no
                    session at all. Formerly the usage was, for the king to give the royal assent to
                    all such bills as he approved, at the end of every session, and then to prorogue
                    the parliament, though sometimes only for a day or two, after which all business
                    then depending in the houses was to be begun again. This custom obtained so
                    strongly, that it once became a question, whether giving the royal assent to a
                    single bill did not of course put an end to the session. But though it was then
                    resolved in the negative, yet the notion was so deeply rooted, that the statute
                    1 Car. I. c. 7, was passed to declare that the king’s assent to that and some
                    other acts should not put an end to the session; and even as late as the reign
                    of Charles II. we find a proviso frequently tacked to a bill, that his majesty’s
                    assent thereto should not determine the session of parliament. But it seems to
                    be allowed, that a prorogation must be expressly made, in order to determine the
                    session; and if, at the time of an actual rebellion, or imminent danger of
                    invasion, the parliament shall be separated by adjournment or prorogation, the
                    king is empowered to call them together by proclamation, on fourteen days’
                    notice of the time appointed for their re-assembling.</p>
                <p>A dissolution is the civil death of the parliament; and this may be effected in
                    three ways.</p>
                <p>The first is, by the king’s will, expressed either in person or by
                    representation. For as the king has the sole right of convening the parliament,
                    so also it is a branch of the royal prerogative, that he may, whenever he
                    pleases, prorogue the parliament for a time, or put a final period to its
                    existence. If no one had a right to prorogue or dissolve a parliament but
                    itself, it might happen to become perpetual; and this would be extremely
                    dangerous, if at any time it should attempt to encroach upon the executive
                    power, as was fatally experienced by the unfortunate Charles I., who, having
                    unadvisedly passed an act to continue the parliament then in being till such
                    time as it should please to dissolve itself, at last fell a sacrifice to that
                    inordinate power which he had himself consented to give them. It is therefore
                    extremely necessary that the crown should be empowered to regulate the duration
                    of these assemblies, under the limitations which the English constitution has
                    prescribed; so that, on the one hand, they may frequently and regularly meet
                    together for the despatch of business and redress of grievances, and, on the
                    other, may not, even with the consent of the crown, be continued to an
                    inconvenient or unconstitutional length.</p>
                <p>Secondly, a parliament may be dissolved by the demise of the crown. This
                    dissolution formerly happened immediately upon the death of the reigning
                    sovereign; for he being considered in law as the head of the parliament <hi
                    rend="italic">(pa-put,</hi><hi rend="italic">principium,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">finis'),</hi> when that failed, the whole body was
                    held to be extinct. But the calling a new parliament immediately on the
                    inauguration of the successor being found inconvenient, and dangers being
                    apprehended from having no parliament in being in case of a disputed succession,
                    it was enacted by the statutes 7 and 8 William III. c. 15, and 6 Anne, c. 7,
                    that the parliament in being should continue for six months after the death of
                    any king or <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492257" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2257-0090"
                    />queen, unless sooner prorogued or dissolved by the successor; that if the
                    parliament, at the time of the king’s death, had been separated, by adjournment
                    or prorogation, it should notwithstanding assemble immediately; and that if no
                    parliament was then in being, the members of the last parliament should assemble
                    and be again a parliament.</p>
                <p>Lastly, a parliament may be dissolved or expire by mere length of time. If the
                    legislative body were perpetual, or if it lasted during the life of the prince
                    who convened it, as formerly, and were to be supplied, by occasionally filling
                    up the vacancies with new representatives; in these cases, were it once
                    corrupted, the evil would be past all remedy: but when different bodies succeed
                    each other, if the people see cause to disapprove of the present, they may
                    rectify its faults in the next. A legislative assembly, also, which is sure to
                    be separated, and its members to become private men, subject to the full
                    operation of the laws which they have enacted for others, will think themselves
                    bound in interestas well as in duty to make only such laws as are good. The
                    utmost extent of time that the same parliament] was allowed to sit, by the
                    statute 6 William and Mary c. 3, was three years; after the expiration of which,
                    reckoning from the return of the first summons, the parliament was to have no
                    longer continuance. But by the 1st of Geo. I. stat. ii. c. 38, professedly
                    enacted to prevent the great and continued expenses of frequent elections, and
                    the violent heats and animosities consequent thereupon,and for the peace and
                    security of the government, then just recovering from the effects of a
                    rebellion, this term was prolonged to seven years; and, what alone is an
                    instance of the vast authority of parliament, the very same house which was
                    chosen for three years, enacted its own continuance for seven. As the
                    constitution now stands, therefore, the parliament must expire, or die a natural
                    death, at the end of every seventh year, if not sooner dissolved by the royal
                    prerogative.</p>
                <p>We shall conclude this article with an account of some general forms not noticed
                    under any of the preceding heads.</p>
                <p>In the House of Lords, the princes of the blood sit by themselves on the sides of
                    the throne; and at the wall, upon the king’s right hand, the two archbishops sit
                    by themselves on a form. Below them, the bishops of London, Durham, and
                    Winchester, and all the other bishops sit according to the priority of their
                    consecration. On the king’s left hand the Lord Treasurer, Lord President, and
                    Lord Privy Seal, sit upon forms above all dukes, except those of the royal
                    blood; then the dukes, marquises, and earls according to their creation. Across
                    the room are wool sacks, continued from an ancient custom; and the Chancellor or
                    Keeper, being of course the speaker of the House of Lords, sits on the first
                    wool sack before the throne, with the great seal or mace lying by him; and below
                    these there are forms for the viscounts and barons. On the other wool sacks are
                    seated the judges, masters in chancery, and king’s counsel, who are only to give
                    their advice in points of law; but they all stand up till the king gives them
                    leave to sit.</p>
                <p>The Commons sit promiscuously, only the speaker has a chair at the upper end of
                    the house, and the clerk and his assistant sit at a table near him. When a
                    member of the House of Commons speaks, he stands up uncovered, and directs his
                    address to the speaker only. If what he says be answered by another, he is not
                    allowed to reply the same day, unless personal reflections have been cast upon
                    him; but when the Commons, in order to have greater freedom of debate, have
                    resolved themselves into a committee of the whole house, every member may speak
                    to a question as often as he thinks necessary. In the House of Lords they vote,
                    beginning at the puisne or lowest baron, and so up orderly to the highest, every
                    one answering <hi rend="italic">content</hi> or <hi rend="italic">not
                    content.</hi> In the House of Commons they vote by <hi rend="italic">yeas</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">nays;</hi> and if it be dubious which are the greater
                    number, the house divides. If the question be about bringing any thing into the
                    house, the <hi rend="italic">yeas go</hi> out, but if it be about any thing the
                    house already has, the <hi rend="italic">nays go</hi> out. In all divisions the
                    speaker appoints four tellers, two of each opinion. In a committee of the whole
                    house, they divide by changing sides, the <hi rend="italic">yeas</hi> taking the
                    right and the <hi rend="italic">nays</hi> the left of the chair; and then there
                    are but two tellers. If a bill pass one house, and the other demur to it, a
                    conference is demanded in the painted chamber, where certain members are deputed
                    from each house; and here the Lords sit covered, whilst the Commons stand bare,
                    and debate the case. If they disagree, the affair is null; but if they agree,
                    this, with the other bills which have passed both houses, is brought down to the
                    king in the House of Lords, who comes thither clothed in his royal robes. Before
                    him the clerk of the parliament reads the title of each bill, and as he reads,
                    the clerk of the crown pronounces the royal assent or dissent. If it be a public
                    bill, the royal assent is given in these words, <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">roy</hi><hi rend="italic">le veut,</hi> The king will have it so;
                    if a private bill, <hi rend="italic">Soit</hi><hi rend="italic">fait</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">comme il est</hi><hi rend="italic">desire,</hi> Let the request be
                    complied with: but if the king refuse the bill, the answer is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">roy</hi><hi rend="italic">s'avisera,</hi> The king
                    will think of it; and if it be a money bill, the answer is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">roy</hi><hi rend="italic">remercie ses loyaux sujets,
                    accepte leur</hi><hi rend="italic">benevolence,</hi><hi rend="italic">et aussi
                    le veut,</hi> The king thanks his loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence, and
                    therefore grants his consent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">High Court of</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Parliament</hi>
                    is the supreme court in the kingdom, not only for the making, but also for the
                    execution of laws, by the trial of great and enormous offenders, whether Lords
                    or Commoners, in the method of parliamentary impeachment. As for acts of
                    parliament to attaint particular persons of treason or felony, or to inflict
                    pains and penalties, beyond or contrary to the common law, in order to serve a
                    special purpose, we speak not of them; they are to all intents and purposes new
                    laws, made <hi rend="italic">pro re</hi><hi rend="italic">nota,</hi> and by no
                    means an execution of such as are already in being. But an impeachment before
                    the Lords by the Commons of Great Britain in parliament, is a prosecution of the
                    already known and established law, and has been frequently put in practice;
                    being a presentment to the highest or supreme court of criminal jurisdiction by
                    the most solemn grand inquest of the whole kingdom. A commoner cannot, however,
                    be impeached before the Lords for any capital offence, but only for high
                    misdemeanors; but a peer may be impeached for any crime. In the case of an
                    impeachment of a peer for treason, the Lords usually address the crown to
                    appoint a lord high steward, for the greater dignity and regularity of their
                    proceedings; and this high steward was formerly elected by the peers themselves,
                    though he was generally commissioned by the king; but it has latterly been
                    strenuously maintained, that the appointment of a high steward in such cases is
                    not indispensably necessary, and that the house may proceed without one. The
                    articles of impeachment are a kind of bills of indictment, found by the House of
                    Commons, and afterwards tried by the Lords, who in cases of misdemeanors are
                    considered not only as their own peers, but likewise as the peers of the whole
                    nation. This is a custom derived from the constitution of the ancient Germans,
                    who, in their great councils, sometimes tried capital accusations relating to
                    the public: <hi rend="italic">Licet apud concilium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >accusare quoque, et discrimen capitis intendere.</hi> And it has a peculiar
                    propriety in the English constitution, which has much improved upon the ancient
                    model imported hither from the Continent. For although the union of the
                    legislative and judicial powers ought in general to be most carefully avoided,
                    yet it may happen that a subject, intrusted with the administration of public
                    affairs, may infringe the rights of the people, and be guilty of such crimes as
                    the ordinary magistrate either dares not or cannot punish. Of these the
                    representatives <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492270" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2270-0091"
                    /><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the people, or the House of Commons, cannot properly
                    judge, because their constituents are the parties injured, and can therefore
                    only impeach. But before what court shall this impeachment be tried? Not before
                    the ordinary tribunals, which would naturally be swayed by the authority of so
                    powerful an accuser. Reason therefore suggests that this branch of the
                    legislature, which represents the people, must bring its charge before the other
                    branch, which consists of the nobility, who have neither the same interests, nor
                    the same passions, as popular assemblies. The constitution of our island enjoys
                    this vast superiority over those of the Grecian and Roman republics, where the
                    people were at the same time judges and accusers, and where the accused were
                    continually liable to become the victims of popular prejudice, passion, and
                    resentment. It is therefore proper that the nobility should judge, to insure
                    justice to the accused, as it is proper that th e^p copic should accuse, to
                    insure justice to the commonwealth. Amongst other extraordinary circumstances
                    attending the authority of this court, there is one of a very singular nature,
                    which was insisted on by the House of Commons in the case of the Earl of Danby
                    in the reign of Charles I., and is now enacted by statute 12 and 13 William III.
                    c. 2, that no pardon under the great seal shall be pleadable to an impeachment
                    by the Commons of Great Britain in parliament.</p>
