                <p><label type="entry">PETTY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir William</hi></label>, a man
                    eminently distinguished for his learning, mechanical ingenuity, and political
                    writings, was the eldest son of Antony Petty, a clothier at Rumsey, in
                    Hampshire, where he was born on the 16th of May 1623. Petty, when a boy, was
                    noted for the pleasure he took in observing mechanics at work, and the facility
                    with which he comprehended the nature of their employments and the use of their
                    tools. He received the rudiments of his education at the grammar-school of
                    Rumsey, where, before the age of fifteen, he had acquired a competent knowledge
                    of the Latin, Greek, and French languages, and made himself master of the common
                    rules of arithmetic, as well as of the elements of geometry, dialling, and
                    navigation. He then removed to the University of Caen, in Normandy, taking with
                    him a small stock of merchandise, which he disposed of to so much advantage,
                    that he maintained himself out of the profits of his traffic, and at the same
                    time perfected himself in Latin and French, acquired enough of Greek “to serve
                    his turn,” studied the arts, and extended his knowledge of the mathematics. Even
                    at this early period the prevailing bias of his mind displayed itself; and in
                    the student of Caen we discover the father of the man who, holding that there
                    are few ways in which a person may be more harmlessly employed than in getting
                    money, afterwards realized a very great fortune. On his return from France, he
                    was appointed to the navy, though in what capacity is not known. In this
                    situation he remained for some time, and having saved about L.60, he determined
                    to bid adieu to the navy, and travel for further improvement. Having made choice
                    of physic as a profession, he, in 1643, visited Leyden, Utrecht, and Paris,
                    where ’he studied anatomy, and read Vesalius with Hobbes, whom he in turn
                    assisted by drawing diagrams for the philosopher, who was then writing on
                    optics. whilst at Paris he appears to have been reduced to great straits from
                    want of money; but his’ ingenuity and industry extricated him from all his
                    difficulties; and, in 1646, he returned home a richer man than when he had set
                    out, although he had maintained his brother Antony as well as himself.</p>
                <p>Petty was not a man to remain inactive or slothful. It appears indeed that, on
                    the 6th of March 1647, a patent was granted him by parliament for an invention
                    which would now be termed a copying-machine, but which he calls an instrument
                    for double writing. In an advertisement prefixed to his Advice to Mr Samuel
                    Hartlib, he describes it as an instrument of small bulk and price, easily made,
                    and very durable, by means of which “any man, even at the first sight and
                    handling, may write two resembling copies of the same thing at once, as
                    serviceably and as fast as by the ordinary way ;” and Rushworth informs us that
                    it might be learned in an hour’s practice, and was calculated to be of great
                    advantage to lawyers, scriveners, merchants, scholars, registrars, clerks, and
                    Others, by saving the labour of examination, and discovering or
                    preventing-falsification. But this machine having been found not to promote
                    expedition in writing, the principal advantage proposed to be attained by it,
                    Petty did not reap much profit by his invention; but, although it failed of its
                    object in this respect, it served to make him acquainted with the leading men of
                    the times. His next production was a pamphlet entitled Advice to Mr Hartlib for
                    the Advancement of Learning, containing some sensible remarks on national
                    education, particularly in as far as regards the more useful branches of
                    knowledge, which he justly conceived were too much neglected. In 1648 he went to
                    Oxford, where he gave instructions in anatomy as a private teacher; became
                    assistant to Dr Clayton, the professor of anatomy, . who had an insurmountable
                    aversion to the sight of a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193495429"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-5429-0334"/>mangled corpse; and also practised physic with
                    considerable success. Here he acquired such reputation, that the philosophical
                    meetings which led to the institution of the Royal Society were for the most
                    part held at his lodgings; and, by a parliamentary recommendation, he obtained a
                    fellowship in Brazen-nose College, and was created doctor of physic on the 7th
                    of March 1649. In June 1650, he was admitted a member of the College of
                    Physicians; and the same year he was concerned in the recovery of a woman, named
                    Anne Green, who had been hanged at Oxford for the supposed murder of her bastard
                    child. In the beginning of 1651, he was appointed professor of anatomy, and soon
                    afterwards professor of music, at Gresham College; and in 1652, he went to
                    Ireland as physician to the army in that country, where he served under three
                    successive lords-lieutenant, namely, Lambert, Fleetwood, and Henry Cromwell.</p>
                <p>Some time after his settlement in Ireland, Dr Petty observing that the forfeited
                    lands adjudged to the soldiers, after the suppression of the rebellion of 1641,
                    were very inaccurately measured, represented the matter to the persons then in
                    power; and a contract, dated the 11th of December 1654, was in consequence
                    granted him, by which he was authorized to make the admeasurements anew, a duty
                    which he appears to have discharged with exactness and fidelity. By this
                    contract he gained a very considerable sum,of money; for, besides the twenty
                    shillings a day which he received during its performance, he had also, by
                    agreement with the soldiers, a penny an acre for the lands measured by him; and
                    by an order of government, dated the 19th of March 1655, it appears that he had
                    then surveyed 2,008,000 acres, which, at the rate stipulated, must have yielded
                    him about L.8400 sterling. He was likewise one of the commissioners for
                    allocating the lands to the soldiers after they had been surveyed. In 1655,
                    Henry Cromwell assumed the lord-lieutenancy of Ireland, and soon afterwards
                    appointed Dr Petty his secretary; in 1657, the viceroÿ further appointed him
                    clerk of the council, and got him elected to serve as burgess fór West Love, in
                    Cornwall, in Richard Cromwell’s parliament, which assembled on the 27th of
                    January 1658. But this last honour speedily involved him in trouble. On the 28th
                    of March following he was impeached of high crimes and misdemeanours in the
                    execution of his office, and obliged to proceed to England. On the 19th of April
                    he appeared in the House of Commons, and answered to the charge on the 21st; the
                    prosecutors then replied, after which the matter was adjourned, and never came
                    to an issue, as the parliament was suddenly dissolved the next day. He soon
                    afterwards returned to Ireland, where, some further attempts being made to bring
                    on a prosecution, he published two pamphlets; the one giving an account of the
                    proceedings in the impeachment, and the other containing reflections on some
                    persons and things in Ireland. Finding the latter country getting too hot for
                    him, he crossed over to England, provided with a warm application in his favour
                    by the lord-lieutenant; but, notwithstanding this intercession, he was in June
                    removed from all his employments.</p>
                <p>The charges brought against him were six in number. He was accused of having
                    received or taken great bribes; of having made a trade of buying debentures,
                    contrary to the statute; of having obtained by fraud large sums of money and
                    extensive tracts of land; of having employed many foul practices, as surveying
                    and setting out lands; of having, along with his fellow-commissioners, placed
                    some debentures in better situations than they could claim, and denied right to
                    others; and, lastly, he and his fellowcommissioners were accused of having
                    totally disposed of the army’s security for payment, whilst the debt still
                    remained chargeable on the state. Petty’s answer to these charges is abundantly
                    curious. Instead of trying to refute them in detail, he labours to show that,
                    without ever intermeddling with the surveys of the Irish lands, he <hi
                    rend="italic">might</hi> have acquired as large a fortune by other means; and,
                    certainly, whatever may be thought of such a defence to specific charges of
                    malversation and fraud, the statement itself must be allowed the praise of
                    ingenuity.</p>
                <p>In 1659, the republican spirit not being yet extinct in Petty, he became a member
                    of the Rota Club, which met at Miles’s coffee-house, in New Palace-yard,
                    Westminster. This club received its name from the strange practice it was
                    intended to support, namely, that all officers of state should be chosen by
                    ballot, that the time for holding their places should be limited, and that a
                    certain number of members of parliament should be annually changed by rotation.
                    But the star of the commonwealth wasjiow waxing dim, and, not long after
                    Christmas, Petty went to Ireland. At the Restoration, however, he came back to
                    England, where he was graciously received by Charles II., and, having resigned
                    his professorship at Gresham College, was appointed one of the commissioners of
                    the Court of Claims. In April 1661, he received the honour of knighthood, with
                    the grant of a new patent constituting him surveyor-general of Ireland; and he
                    was at the same time chosen a member of the Irish parliament. Being one of the
                    founders of the Royal Society, he was elected a member of the first council; and
                    although he had left off the practice of physic, his name appears in the list of
                    fellows of the College of Physicians in 1663. About this time he invented a
                    double-bottomed ship, which was to sail against both wind and tide, though we
                    are not told by what means; and, in 1665, he communicated to the Royal Society,
                    along with a model of his invention, a Discourse about the Building of Ships,
                    which being supposed to contain matter too important to be divulged, was taken
                    away by the president, Lord Brounker, who kept it in his possession till 1682,
                    and probably till his death, which happened not long afterwards.</p>
                <p>In 1666, Sir William Petty drew up his treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Verbum
                    Sapienti,</hi> containing an account of the wealth and expenditure of England,
                    showing the method of raising taxes in the most equal manner, and endeavouring
                    to prove, that England could bear a charge of four millions per annum, when the
                    exigencies of the government required it. The same year he suffered a
                    considerable loss by the fire of London, the greater part of his house and
                    gardens having been destroyed by that terrible conflagration. In 1667, he
                    married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Hardresse Waller, and widow of Sir Maurice
                    Fenton. This matrimonial connection, however, did not for a moment distract his
                    attention from his favourite pursuit of making money; for immediately afterwards
                    he established iron-works and a pilchard-fishery, opened lead mines, and
                    commenced a trade in timber at Kerry, all of which turned to good account. To
                    vary his pursuits, he also composed a piece of Latin poetry, which he
                    subsequently published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Colloquium Davidis
                    cum Anima sua.</hi> In 1680, he gave to the world his Politician Discovered,
                    intended to expose the sinister practices of the French; and afterwards wrote
                    several essays on Political Arithmetic, in which, from considering the natural
                    resources of England and Ireland, he shows how both may be strengthened,
                    improved, and rendered superior to all their rivals or enemies. He assisted at
                    the formation of the Dublin Philosophical Society, and in November 1684 was
                    chosen president of that association. On this occasion he drew up a Catalogue of
                    Cheap and Simple Experiments, which was soon afterwards followed by his <hi
                    rend="italic">Suppellex</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophica,</hi> containing a
                    description of forty instruments which he deemed necessary to carry forward the
                    design of the institution. But the ultimate term of all his projects and
                    pursuits was now approaching. A gangrene in his foot, occasioned by the swelling
                    of the gout, having resisted every mode of treatment, at length <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193495442" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5442-0335"/>put a period to his life, on
                    the 16th of December 1687, in the sixty-fifth year of his age. He died at his
                    house in Piccadilly, and his remains were interred at Rumsey, near those of his
                    parents. His will is perhaps the most curious and characteristic composition of
                    the kind in our language, illustrating at once the habits of thinking and
                    feeling peculiar to the man, and the mode in which he realized the enormous
                    fortune which he left to his descendants.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>As a specimen of this extraordinary composition, we shall
                    take leave to introduce here the following extract, which appears to us to be
                    eminently characteristic: “As for legacies for the poor, I am at a stand; as for
                    beggars by trade and election, I give them nothing; as for impotents by the hand
                    of God, the public ought to maintain them; as for those who have been bred to no
                    calling or estate, they should be put upon their kindred; as for those who can
                    get no work, the magistrate should cause them to be employed, which may be well
                    done in Ireland, where is (are) fifteen acres of improvable land for every head;
                    prisoners for crime, by the king; for debts, by their prosecutors; as for those
                    who compassionate the sufferings of any object, let them relieve them, and
                    relieve themselves by relieving such sufferings, that is, give them alms pro re
                    nαtα, and for God’s sake relieve those several species above mentioned, where
                    the above-mentioned obligera fail in their duties: Wherefore I am contented that
                    I have assisted all my poor relations, and put many in a way of getting their
                    own bread, and have laboured in public works, and by inventions have sought out
                    real objects of charity; and do hereby conjure all who partake of my estate,
                    from time to time to do the same at their peril. Nevertheless, to answer custom,
                    and to take the surer side, I give L.20 to the most wanting of the parish
                    wherein I die.” Here we have the domain of charity laid out by a political
                    economist; and after the exclusion of the various classes above specified, it
                    must be confessed that enough will scarcely remain to render it discernible on
                    the map of the moral duties; though, “to answer custom and to take the surer
                    side, a prudent Dives may, out of his enormous wealth, leave some L.20 to the
                    most destitute of the parish wherein death separates him from all his earthly
                    possessions.</p></note></p>
                <p>A few particulars of the personal history of Sir William Petty may be gleaned
                    from Aubrey, who appears to have lived with him op terms of intimacy. He
                    possessed strong, shrewd, natural good sense, flavoured with a tincture of
                    humour, and had a most convenient way of shaking himself rid of the trammels of
                    party when it suited his interest to do so, changing sides with a facility that
                    is altogether edifying. His qualifications were indeed various and peculiar. He
                    was an excellent droll, as he showed by proposing to Sir Jerome Sankey, who had
                    challenged him, to fight in a dark cellar with carpenters’ axes; a proposal in
                    which the knight, though he had <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> been a soldier, did
                    not deem it prudent to acquiesce. He would also preach extempore, which Aubrey
                    says he did “incomparably,” and that too in almost any style, “either in the
                    presbyterian way, independent, capucin friar, or Jesuit.” He had “an admirable
                    inventive head, and practical parts,” which he turned to good account as far as
                    his own interest was concerned; and, like his friend Hobbes, he boasted that he
                    had read but little since he was twenty-five, declaring, that “had he read as
                    much as some men have, he had not known so much as he does, nor should have made
                    such discoveries and improvements.” He told Aubrey that he had “hewed out his
                    fortune for himself,” and he even managed to obtain a patent of nobility as Earl
                    of Kilmore, which, however, he suppressed to avoid envy. The variety of pursuits
                    in which he was engaged shows that he had talents capable of achieving any thing
                    to which he chose to apply them; and it is certainly not a little remarkable,
                    that a man of such an active and enterprising disposition should have found time
                    to write so much as he did in the course of his busy life.</p>

                    >Philosophica,</hi> already mentioned. There are many of Sir William Petty’s
                    manuscripts in the British Museum, amongst which is a sort of confession of his
                    faith, corresponding with the concluding passage of his will, in which he says,
                    “I die in the profession of that faith, and in the practice of such worship, as
                    I find established by the law of my country,” a very honest and candid
                    declaration on his part. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
