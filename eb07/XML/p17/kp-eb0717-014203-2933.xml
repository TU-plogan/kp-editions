                <p><label type="entry">PATRICK, <hi rend="smallcaps">St</hi></label>, the apostle of
                    Ireland, and the second bishop of that country. He was born on the 5th of April
                    373, of a good family, at Kirkpatrick, near Dumbarton, in what is now called
                    Scotland, but was then comprehended under the general denomination of Britain.
                    His baptismal name signified, in the British language, valiant in war. During
                    some inroad of certain exiles from Ireland, he wa⅛ taken prisoner, and carried
                    into that kingdom, where he continued six years in the service of Milcho, who
                    had bought him of three different persons, whence Patrick acquired the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Cothraig,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ceathar-Tigh,</hi> that
                    is, <hi rend="italic">four families.</hi> Here he made himself master of the
                    Irish language, and at last, having effected his escape, returned home on board
                    a ship. About two years afterwards, he formed the design of converting the
                    Irish; and, the better to qualify himself for this undertaking, he travelled on
                    the Continent, where he continued thirty-five years, pursuing his studies under
                    the direction of his mother’s uncle, St Martin, bishop of Tours, who ordained
                    him deacon, and afterwards under St German, bishop of Auxerre, who ordained him
                    priest, and gave him his third name of Mawn or Maginim.</p>
                <p>An ancient author, Henricus Antisioderensis, who wrote a book concerning the
                    miracles of St German, considers it as the highest honour of that prelate to
                    have been the instructor of St Patrick. “As the glory of a father shines in the
                    government of his sons,” says he, “out of the many disciples in religion who are
                    reported to have been his sons in Christ, suffice it briefly to mention one by
                    far the most famous, as the series of his actions shows, Patrick the particular
                    apostle of Ireland, who being under his holy discipline eighteen years, derived
                    no little knowledge in the inspired writings from such a source. The most godly
                    divine pontiff, considering him alike distinguished in religion, eminent for
                    virtue, and stedfast in doctrine; and thinking it absurd to let one of the best
                    labourers remain <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492946"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-2946-0143"/>inactive in the Lord’s vineyard, recommended him
                    to Pope Celestine, by his presbyter Segetius, who was to carry to the apostolic
                    see a testimonial of the ecclesiastical merit of this excellent man. Approved by
                    his judgment, supported by his authority, and confirmed by his blessing, he set
                    out for Ireland; and being peculiarly destined to that people as their apostle,
                    instructed them at that time by his doctrine and miracles; and now does and will
                    for ever display the wonderful power of his apostleship.” Lastly, Pope Celestine
                    consecrated him bishop, at the same time giving him his most familiar name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Patricius,</hi> expressive of his honourable descent, and to
                    impart lustre and dignity to the commission which he now charged him withal for
                    converting the Irish. Palladius had been there a year before him upon the same
                    errand, but with little success; and the saints Kieran, Ailbe, Declan, and Ibar,
                    were precursors both of Palladius and of Patrick. But the great office of
                    apostle of Ireland was reserved for our prelate, who landed in the country of
                    the Evolein, or at Wicklow, in the year 431. His first convert was Sinell,
                    eighth in descent from Cormac king of Leinster; but not meeting with
                    encouragement, he proceeded to Dublin, and thence to Ulster, where he founded a
                    church, afterwards the famous abbey of Saul, in the county of Down. After
                    labouring seven years indefatigably in this great work, he returned to Britain,
                    which he delivered from the heresies of Pelagius and Arius; he then engaged
                    several eminent persons to assist him, and visited the Isle of Man, which he
                    converted in 440, when the bishopric was founded; in the year 448, he returned
                    to the see of Armagh, which he had founded three years before; and in thirteen
                    years more completed the conversion of the whole island. After giving an account
                    of his commission at Rome, he once more returned to Ireland, and spent the
                    remainder of his life between the monasteries of Armagh and Saul, superintending
                    and enforcing the great plan of doctrine and discipline which he had
                    established. After having established schools, and an academy, he closed his
                    life and ministry at Saul Abbey, in the 120th year of his age, on the 17th of
                    March 493, and was buried at Down, in the same grave with St Bridget, and St
                    Columba the apostle of the Picts. Respecting his burial-place, however, there
                    have been great disputes; and it has been a subject of as much debate with the
                    religious, as Homer’s birth-place formerly was amongst the cities of Greece.
                    Those of Down lay claim to it, upon the authority of the following verses:</p>
                <p>These three in Down lie in tomb one, Bridget, Patricius, and Columba pious.</p>
                <p>Those of Glastonbury, in England, found on the old monuments of their church; and
                    some Scotch writers affirm that he was both born and buried at Glasgow. His
                    genuine works were collected and printed by Sir James Ware, 1656. His immediate
                    successor in his see was St Binen or Begnus.</p>

                    institution which was founded in Ireland in the year 1783. On the 5th of
                    February in that year, the king ordered letters patent to be passed under the
                    great seal of the kingdom of Ireland, for creating a society or brotherhood, to
                    be called “knights of the illustrious order of St Patrick,” of which his
                    majesty, his heirs and successors, were to be sovereigns, and his majesty’s
                    lieutenant-general and general governor of Ireland for the time being to
                    officiate as grand master; and also for appointing Prince Edward, and several of
                    the prime nobility of Ireland, knights companions of the said illustrious
                    order.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Patkick,</hi><hi rend="italic">Simon,</hi> a learned English
                    bishop, was born at Gainsborough in Lincolnshire in 1626. In 1644 he was
                    admitted into Queen’s College, Cambridge, and entered into holy orders. After
                    being for some time chaplain to Sir Walter St John, and vicar of the church at
                    Battersea in Surrey, he was preferred to the rectory of St Paul’s, Covent
                    Garden, London, where he continued all the time of the plague in 1665 amongst
                    his parishioners. In 1668 he published his Friendly Debate between a Conformist
                    and a Nonconformist. This was answered by the Dissenters, whom he had much
                    exasperated; but by his moderation and candour towards them afterwards they were
                    perfectly reconciled to him, and he brought over many of them to the communion
                    of the Established Church. In 1678 he was made dean of Peterborough, where he
                    was much beloved. In 1682, Dr Lewis de Moulin, who had been professor of history
                    at Oxford, and had written many very bitter books against the Church of England,
                    sent for Dr Patrick upon his sick bed, and made a solemn declaration of his
                    regret on that account, which he signed, and it was published after his death.
                    During the reign of King James, the dean’s behaviour showed that he had nothing
                    more at heart than the Protestant religion, for which indeed he ventured all
                    that was dear to him, by preaching and writing against the errors of the Church
                    of Rome. In 1687 he published a prayer composed for that difficult time, when
                    persecution was expected by all who stood firm to their religion. The year after
                    the Revolution, the dean was appointed Bishop of Chichester, and was employed
                    with others of the new bishops to settle the affairs of the Church in Ireland.
                    In 1691 he was translated to the see of Ely, in the room of the deprived Bishop
                    Turner. He died in 1707, after having published various works, amongst which are
                    his Paraphrases and Commentaries on the Holy Scriptures, in three vols. folio,
                    which, with Lowth on the Proverbs, Arnold on the Apocrypha, and Whitby on the
                    New Testament, form a regular and continued commentary in English on all the
                    sacred books. <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi></p>
