                    very ancient people, of whom the historical inquirers in the Augustan age could
                    find no trace amongst any race then subsisting, and about whom so many opposite
                    opinions have been confidently maintained, and so much learning unprofitably
                    accumulated, that it is difficult, if not impossible, to arrive at any distinct
                    or satisfactory conclusion.</p>
                <p>Disregarding that spurious philology which raises pretensions to knowledge
                    concerning races whose annals have long since perished, we may, however,
                    observe, that the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193493388"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-3388-0177"/>people known by the name of Pelasgians are
                    supposed to have originally occupied Greece, and to have penetrated into central
                    Italy long before the establishment of the Hellenic colonies in Magna Graecia,
                    that is, the southern portion of the Italian peninsula. Thus much seems to be
                    admitted on all sides, because it is borne out by the concurring testimonies of
                    ancient authors, who are agreed in almost nothing else, respecting either the
                    origin or the migrations of this primitive race. The questions that have been
                    most keenly agitated amongst the learned are, whether the Pelasgians were a
                    different nation from the Hellenes, or the same people under a different
                    denomination; and whether they were Scythians or Goths, as Mr Pinkerton
                    contends, or a branch of some other distinctive race of men, as others have
                    maintained. The discussion of these matters, we are well aware, is rather a
                    subject of antiquarian research and learned curiosity than one calculated to
                    afford either amusement or instruction to the generality of readers; but as it
                    has called forth displays of profound erudition, and elicited much ingenuity, a
                    concise and comprehensive view of the actual state of the dispute may not be
                    altogether out of place in a work which has for its object to embrace the whole
                    cycle of human knowledge and research, even without reference to the secondary
                    considerations of immediate interest or utility.</p>
                <p>Mr Pinkerton, in strict accordance with his general theory, maintains.that the
                    Pelasgians were Scythians, and also that the Hellenes or Greeks were Pelasgians,
                    or, in other words, of Scythian or Gothic origin. He argues, that as the
                    Pelasgians certainly descended from the north-east into Greece, and thus came
                    from, or at least through, a country which had been overspread by the Scythians
                    long before the period of their descent into Hellas, it maybe inferred that they
                    were of the same origin and race with the inhabitants of Thrace, Thessaly, and
                    the other countries where they first made their appearance; a conclusion, we may
                    observe, which, whether it be well or ill founded, does not necessarily follow
                    from the premises, because the circumstance of a roving or migratory tribe
                    passing through a particular country in its progress towards other settlements,
                    by no means warrants the supposition either of identity or diversity of origin
                    with reference to the prior inhabitants of such country. Mr Pinkerton, however,
                    contends, that at a very early period Pelasgian settlements were established on
                    the Hellespont; that, in the days of Homer, and even much later, a district in
                    Thessaly was named Pelasgia; that the people of Macedonia were anciently called
                    Pelasgians; that the Thracians, who, under Eumolpus, colonized Attica, were by
                    Herodotus denominated Pelasgians; and that Plutarch describes the same people as
                    a roving or migratory race, who, having subdued the inhabitants, settled in the
                    countries they had conquered,—a description which,Tie thinks, can only apply to
                    the Scythians. Besides, Herodotus, Thucydides, and Strabo, all state that the
                    Pelasgians came originally from Thessaly into Greece; and as Thessaly was
                    anciently accounted a part of Thrace, Mr Pinkerton thence concludes that the
                    Pelasgians were Thracians, that is, Scythians or Goths. According to him,
                    ancient Pelasgia included Macedonia, Epirus, and afterwards the. country which
                    in later times was called Hellas or Greece; and he follows the opinion of the
                    majority of the learned in holding that <hi rend="italic">Pelasgi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ax\å Hellenes</hi> were but different names for one and the same
                    people.</p>
                <p>This assumed identity necessarily implies, that if the Pelasgians were Scythians
                    or Goths, so also were the Hellenes. Mr Pinkerton, however, devotes a separate
                    section to the discussion of this point, and accumulates a number <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> authorities in support of his position, that the Hellenes
                    were Scythians. That the Hellenes were originally a small tribe in Thessaly, is,
                    he conceives, proved by the authority of Thucydides, which is confirmed by that
                    of Herodotus and Strabo. The same authors make it equally clear that the
                    Thessalians were Thracians, a people who extended as far down as Phocea; whilst
                    later authorities state, that all the people south of the Hellespont, including
                    the Macedonians and Greeks, were of Scythian origin. Besides, the language and
                    manners of the whole of Hellas, from Thrace to the Ionian Sea, were, according
                    to Pinkerton, Thracian or Scythian, that is, Gothic. No ancient writer has
                    mentioned, nor even hinted at, any diversity of speech, save as to refinement,
                    between Peloponnesus, Attica, Epirus, Thessaly, Macedonia, and Thrace. In
                    Homer’s time the name of barbarians was not applied to the Thracians, who appear
                    to have spoken the same language with the Hellenes; and Diodorus Siculus states
                    that the <hi rend="italic">Scythae</hi><hi rend="italic">Hyperborei,</hi> or
                    most distant Scythians, used a form of speech akin to that of Athens and Delos,
                    in other words, Pelasgic or Gothic. Anacharsis, the Scythian philosopher, who
                    had learned the language and studied the manners of the Greeks, pronounced them
                    Scythian;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    testimony to the accuracy of this judgment. The similarity between the Greek and

                    Salmasius, Junius, Casaubon, Ihre, Jamieson, and many other learned scholars and
                    antiquaries, have pronounced the Greek and the Gothic to be merely dialects of
                    the same original language, though some of them have fallen into the mistake of
                    deriving the latter from the former. In corroboration of the same general view,
                    Bibliander states, that in the German, which is a dialect of the Gothic, eight
                    hundred out of two thousand radicals are common to the Greek and Latin, as well
                    as the German; and as to the Latin, every scholar knows that, originally, it was
                    merely the Aeolic dialect of the Greek. But of all marks or proofs of the origin
                    of nations, that of language is the most certain; and from this remarkable
                    coincidence in radical structure, taken in connection with the other
                    circumstances adverted to by him, Mr Pinkerton concludes, that the Pelasgians,
                    the ancestors of the Greeks, afterwards called Hellenes, from the leader of the
                    last tribe that arrived, were originally settled in Macedonia and Thessaly; that
                    they were Thracians, and that the Thracians were all Scythians or Goths.</p>
                <p>The Pelasgians or Hellenes were, according to our author, much improved by the
                    situation of Greece, their new settlement, which, being surrounded by the sea on
                    every side except the north, proved a centre of attraction for small colonies
                    from Egypt and Phoenicia, countries celebrated for their early civilization.
                    Letters were imported, tillage was introduced, and the arts of life began to be
                    cultivated. But the colonies to which this branch of the Scythians were mainly
                    indebted for these advantages appear to have all adopted the Pelasgic or
                    Hellenic language, and conformed to the Pelasgic or Hellenic rites and customs;
                    and it might even be shown that the Greek mythology was only an improved version
                    of that which obtained in ancient Scythia, the gods being mostly deified heroes
                    or princes. Many ideas of the Greek mythology may also be found in the Gothic,
                    though in a form far less polished and refined. The most ancient Greek poets, it
                    is well known, were the sole teachers of the people; they were the first who, by
                    blending allegory with popular superstition and legendary ro-mance, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193493401" xml:id="kp-eb0717-3401-0178"/>composed systems
                    of theogony and’my thology. But these early poets and teachers were all of
                    Thrace. Linus, Orpheus, Musaeus, Thamyris, and Eumolpus, were Thracians, and
                    consequently Scythians or Goths, familiar with the ancient traditions of the
                    race to which they belonged. This circumstance has been remarked by Eustathius,
                    and it is certainly not a little singular, in reference to the subject before
                    us. In a word, it appears that the Greeks originally “Scythicised,” as
                    Anacharsis called it, that is, followed the customs, manners, and traditions of
                    the Scythians; but being improved by the introduction of foreign arts and the
                    admixture of foreign settlers, they soon assumed a character quite distinct from
                    that of their northern progenitors, and at length attained to the highest degree
                    of civilization and refinement.</p>
                <p>Such is a condensed abstract of Mr Pinkerton’s system, which, whether it be well
                    founded or not, has at least the peculiar merit of being clear, distinct, and
                    intelligible. We cannot say as much, however, for the speculations of almost any
                    other writer who has treated of this subject, and least of all for those of
                    Niebuhr, whose chapter on the Pelasgians is the most obscure, and therefore the
                    least interesting, in his History of Rome. The fact seems to be, he had no
                    settled views on the subject; and though he discusses his authorities with great
                    ability, he has somehow failed to extract from them any definite or general
                    results. We shall endeavour, as we best can, however, to give the reader some
                    general notion of what this celebrated author has written respecting a race
                    which has a double claim to attention, from its connection with the ancient
                    history of both Greece and Italy.</p>
                <p>According to Niebuhr, the Pelasgians were a different nation from the Hellenes,
                    and had a language of their own, which was peculiar, and not Greek. This is his
                    general principle, to which he repeatedly recurs, though without explaining how
                    he arrived at such a conclusion. Yet, notwithstanding the difference here
                    supposed, he thinks it probable that there was an essential affinity between
                    them, from the ease with which so many Pelasgian nations ripened into Hellenes,
                    and from the Latin containing an element which is half Greek, and admitted to
                    have been of Pelasgic origin. But it is not easy to see how this total
                    difference and essential affinity are to be reconciled, or how Latin could have
                    contained an element half Greek and of Pelasgic origin, if the language of the
                    Pelasgians was peculiar, and not Greek. Herodotus says that in process of time
                    they came to be accounted Greeks, and that from them the Grecian theology was
                    derived; circumstances which certainly serve to indicate the essential affinity
                    to which Niebuhr refers. But the difficulty still remains to account for the
                    diversity in nation and language which is predicated of the same people. It is
                    perfectly true, as Niebuhr remarks, that the Pelasgians, in that part of history
                    to which our monuments and traditions reach, were in a state of ruin and decay.
                    They seemed a race that had outlived a period of other forms, looking like
                    strangers left to languish in an altered world; and this is the reason why their
                    history is shrouded in such obscurity. The old traditions spoke of them as a
                    race pursued by the heavenly powers with never-ending calamities; and the traces
                    of their abode in widely-distant regions probably gave rise to the notion that
                    they roamed about from land to land in order to escape from these afflictions.
                    But, surrendering to the poets the fable of their wanderings, Niebuhr thinks
                    that he who rightly interprets the scattered hints of tradition, and searches
                    for traces of their diffusion, will recognise in this singular people one of the
                    very greatest nations of ancient Europe, who in the course of their migrations
                    spread themselves almost as widely as the Celts, though in a manner still less
                    known, and leaving even fewer memorials of their existence.</p>
                <p>The learned historian, however, has not thought fit to apply his erudition and
                    critical sagacity to the elucidation of this important point, which would have
                    been a thousand times more instructive and interesting than the most elaborate
                    discussion of authorities. He seems to have been perplexed with the
                    discrepancies he encountered, and the difficulties with which he was beset,
                    especially in reference to the Pelasgian tribes which originally penetrated into
                    Italy; but having adopted no hypothesis, and hit upon no general principle, he
                    has left the origin and history of the Pelasgians as obscure as ever; nor has he
                    even succeeded in disentangling that part of the question which relates to their
                    settlement in Italy, whither they are said to have carried the language of
                    Greece in its most ancient or Aeolic form. The boldness of speculation by which
                    his disquisitions on other parts of his subject are characterized, is here
                    altogether awanting. Instead of grappling at once with the difficulty, like
                    Pinkerton, and thus imparting method and system to his investigations, he
                    fritters away the whole question in detail; leaving no distinct impression on
                    the mind, and disappointing the expectations which he had himself raised. The
                    only leading ideas we have been able to detect are those which we have already
                    mentioned. The important considerations of language and race enter not as
                    elements into the investigation; and he at last concludes by reiterating the
                    paradox with which he had commenced.</p>
                <p>“The facility,” says he, “with which they were moulded into Greeks, is a
                    characteristic of the Pelasgian tribes, and a main cause of the dissolution and
                    extinction of the nation. It is natural to view it as resulting from the
                    affinity between the two races, which yet were not on that account the less
                    essentially different; and such I believe to have been the case: yet we may
                    observe a magical power exercised by the Greek language and national character
                    over foreign races that came in contact with them, even where no such affinity
                    can be conceived. The inhabitants of Asia Minor hellenized themselves from the
                    time of the Macedonian conquest, almost without any settlements amongst them of
                    genuine Greeks; Antioch, though the common people spoke a barbarous language,
                    became altogether a Greek city; and the entire transformation of the Syrians was
                    averted only by their oriental inflexibility. Even the Albanians, who have
                    settled as colonies in modern Greece, have adopted the Romaic by the side of
                    their own language, and in several places have forgotten the latter. It was in
                    this way only that the immortal Suli was Greek; and the noble Hydra itself, the
                    destruction of which we shall perhaps have to deplore, is an Albanian
                    settlement.”</p>
                <p>This is, no doubt, very ingenious; but is it sound? To say nothing of the
                    difficulty of conceiving the co-existence of an essential affinity with an
                    essential difference, the cases here put are those of more refined nations in
                    contact with such as are less so, and the consequent influence of the former
                    upon the latter. But where is the evidence that the Greeks stood in this
                    relation to the Pelasgians? Has it been shown by our author that the latter were
                    really a different people from the Hellenes? Or, if so, which was the more
                    ancient? Were there Greeks, properly so called, in Greece anterior to the
                    arrival and settlement of the Pelasgians in that country? The latter have
                    generally been supposed the most ancient inhabitants of the country; and it is
                    certain that the name of Hellenes or Greeks is of later origin. The alleged
                    facility with which the Pelasgian tribes were moulded into Greeks must therefore
                    be explained on some principle different from that assumed by Niebuhr from
                    inapplicable analogies. According to Pinkerton, this facility arose from the
                    simple circumstance that the Pelasgians and Hellenes were in reality one and the
                    same people. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.) ,</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193493414"
