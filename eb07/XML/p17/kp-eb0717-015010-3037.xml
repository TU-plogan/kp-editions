                    with xxii. 24, 27, it may be inferred, that as the chief captain knew Paul to be
                    a native of Tarsus, and yet was ignorant of his Roman citizenship, these two
                    were not necessarily conjoined.</p></note> and it is with great probability
                    supposed, that the cloak and parchments which he so earnestly charged Timothy to
                    bring with him to Rome, were the Roman toga and the certificates of his
                    citizenship, which he expected might be of use to him in his anticipated trial
                    before the emperor. The name <hi rend="italic">Saul</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    of his parents, and that his birth was viewed by them as an answer to many
                    prayers; that he was not, however, their only child, is apparent from Acts,
                    xxiii. 16, where mention <pb break="no" facs="nls:193493050"

                    the sect of the Pharisees, probably devoted him from his infancy to the service
                    of religion; and with this view he seems to have received such education as
                    appeared most calculated to fit him for the duties to which he was destined. At
                    that time Tarsus was eminently distinguished for its cultivators of philosophy,
                    and every other department in the circle of instruction (σπoυ3⅛ ngò¢ « <hi

                    future apostle of Christianity was indebted to the labours of such teachers for
                    his early education, no means are left us of judging. It is probable that his
                    obligations were not very great; for as his ultimate destination was to the
                    office of an expounder of the Jewish law and traditions, it does not appear
                    likely that he would be sent by his parents to occupy himself with the
                    literature and philosophy of those whom the Jews despised as outcasts, as well
                    from the light as from the favour of heaven. At the same time, it cannot be
                    denied that his residence in a city where the study of the liberal sciences was
                    so assiduously and successfully prosecuted as to place it upon a par with
                    “Athens, Alexandria, or any other place that could be named in which schools and

                    received. At an early age, in his twelfth or fourteenth year, as is

                    Jerusalem at this time, or whether he returned to Tarsus at all before his
                    conversion, are points on which no certain information can now be obtained. In

                    the occasion of the martyrdom of Stephen, he appears in the capacity of an
                    abettor, and in some respects a sort of superintendent, of the act; and
                    immediately after this, he, as if rendered more ferocious by the blood he had
                    assisted in shedding, kindled the flames of a relentless and unsparing
                    persecution, in which all, without respect of age or of sex, who had professed
                    the hated religion, were compelled to blaspheme the name of Jesus, or obliged to
                    endure the utmost indignities and the most condign punishments.<note

                    11.</p></note> It was whilst engaged in these cruel efforts of a dark and
                    bigoted zeal that he was made to experience that extraordinary change of opinion
                    and feeling which gave a new direction to all his energies, and led him to
                    devote his life to the advancement of that cause which he at first deemed it
                    serviceable to God to oppose and destroy. Having obtained from the rulers of his
                    nation a commission to go to Damascus, in which city the Jews were very
                    numerous, and where also the new religion had obtained a footing, for the
                    purpose apparently of arresting such of the Christians as had fled to that city,
                    and bringing them back bound to Jerusalem, he was himself arrested by a higher
                    power, and made to feel his utter impotency when attempting to oppose the cause
                    of Christ. Whilst crossing the plain to the south of Damascus, about noon-day,
                    and at a short distance from that city, he was suddenly surrounded by a
                    miraculous light from heaven, which had the effect of so paralyzing him, that he
                    fell to the ground, whilst a voice addressed to him the thrilling question,
                    “Saul, Saul, why persecutes! thou <hi rend="italic">me</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >?”</hi> In answer to the inquiry which he made in return, the voice said, “I am
                    Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest; but arise and go into the city, and it
                    shall be told thee what to do.” Confounded, humbled, and agitated, he obeyed the
                    heavenly vision; and as the brilliancy of the light had obscured his vision, he
                    was led by his astonished attendants into the city, where he remained in a state
                    of deep dejection for three days and nights, during which he tasted neither meat
                    nor drink. From this painful condition he was relieved by the visit of a man
                    named Ananias, who, at the command of Christ, sought him out, welcomed him as a
                    brother, and baptized him into the profession of Christianity.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Acts, ix. 1-18. The
                    conversion of such a man, at such a time, and by such means, furnishes one of
                    the most complete proofs that have ever been given of the divine origin of our
                    holy religion. That Saul, from being a zealous persecutor of the disciples of
                    Christ, became all at once a disciple himself, is a fact which cannot be
                    controverted, without overturning the credit of all history. He must therefore
                    have been converted in the miraculous manner in which he himself said he was,
                    and of course the Christian religion be a divine revelation; or he must have
                    been either an impostor, an enthusiast, or a dupe to the fraud of others. There
                    is not another alternative possible.</p><p>If he was an impostor, who declared
                    what he knew to be false, he must have been induced to act that part by some
                    motive. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Miracle.)</hi> But the only conceivable
                    motives for religious imposture are, the hopes of advancing one’s temporal
                    interest, credit, or power; or the prospect of gratifying some passion or
                    appetite under the authority of the new religion. That none of these could be St
                    Paul’s motive for professing the faith of Christ crucified, is plain from the
                    state of Judaism and Christianity at the period of his forsaking the former and
                    embracing the latter faith. Those whom he left were the disposers of wealth, of
                    dignity, of power, in Judea; those to whom he went were indigent men, oppressed,
                    destitute of all means of improving their fortunes. The certain consequence,
                    therefore, of his taking the part of Christianity, was the loss not only of all
                    that he possessed, but of all hopes of acquiring more; whereas, by continuing to
                    persecute the Christians, he had hopes rising almost to a certainty of making
                    his fortune by the favour of those who were at the head of the Jewish state, to
                    whom nothing could so much recommend him as the zeal which he had shown in that
                    persecution. As to credit or reputation, could the scholar of Gamaliel hope to
                    gain either by becoming a teacher in a college of fishermen? Could he flatter
                    himself, that the doctrines which he taught would, either in or out of Judea, do
                    him honour, when he knew that “they were to the Jews a stumbling block, and to
                    the Greeks foolishness?” Was it, then, the love of power that induced him to
                    make this great change? Power! over whom? over a flock of sheep whom he himself
                    had assisted to destroy, and whose very Shepherd had lately been murdered?
                    Perhaps it was with the view of gratifying some licentious passion, under the
                    authority of the new religion, that he commenced a teacher of that religion.
                    This cannot be alleged; for his writings breathe nothing but the strictest
                    morality, obedience to magistrates, order, and government, with the utmost
                    abhorrence of all licentiousness, idleness, or loose behaviour, under the cloak
                    of <pb corresp="kp-eb0717-3063-0152" xml:id="pbn7152"/>religion. We nowhere read
                    in his works, that saints are above moral ordinances; that dominion is founded
                    in grace; that monarchy is despotism which ought to be abolished; that the
                    fortunes of the rich ought to be divided amongst the poor; that there is no
                    difference in moral actions; that any impulses of the mind are to direct us
                    against the light of our reason and the laws of nature; or any of those wicked
                    tenets by which the peace of society has been often disturbed, and the rules of
                    morality often broken, by men pretending to act under the sanction of divine
                    revelation. He makes no distinctions, like the impostor of Arabia, in favour of
                    himself; nor does any part of his life, either before or after his conversion to
                    Christianity, bear any mark of a libertine disposition. As amongst the Jews, so
                    amongst the Christians, his conversation and manners were blameless. It has been
                    sometimes objected to the other apostles, by those who were resolved not to
                    credit their testimony, that having been deeply engaged with Jesus during his
                    life, they were obliged, for the support of their own credit, and from having
                    gone too far to return, to continue the same professions after his death; but
                    this can by no means be said of St Paul. On the contrary, whatever force there
                    may be in that way of reasoning, it all tends to convince us that St Paul must
                    <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> have continued a Jew, and an enemy to Christ
                    Jesus. If <hi rend="italic">they,</hi> were engaged on one side,∙½e was as
                    strongly engaged on the other. If shame withheld them from changing sides, much
                    more ought it to have stopped him, who, from his superior education, must have
                    been vastly more sensible to that kind of shame than the mean and illiterate
                    fishermen of Galilee. The only other difference was, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >they,</hi> by quitting their Master after his death, might have preserved
                    themselves; whereas <hi rend="italic">he,</hi> by quitting the Jews, and taking
                    up the cross of Christ, certainly brought on his own destruction.</p><p>As St
                    Paul was not an impostor, so it is plain he was not an enthusiast. Heat of
                    temper, melancholy, ignorance, and vanity, are the ingredients of which
                    enthusiasm is composed; but from all these, except the first, the apostle
                    appears to have been wholly free. That he had great fervour of zeal, both when a
                    Jew and when a Christian, in maintaining what he thought to be right, cannot be
                    denied; but he was at all times so much master of his temper, as, in matters of
                    indifference, to “become all things to all men;” with the most pliant
                    condescension bending his notions and manners to theirs, as far as his duty to
                    God would permit; a conduct compatible neither with the stiffness of a bigot nor
                    with the violent impulses of fanatical delusion. That he was not melancholy, is
                    plain from his conduct in embracing every method which prudence could suggest to
                    escape danger and shun persecution, when he could do it without betraying the
                    duty of his office or the honour of his God. A melancholy enthusiast courts
                    persecution, and when he cannot obtain it, afflicts himself with absurd
                    penances; but the holiness of St Paul consisted only in the simplicity of a
                    godly life, and in the unwearied performance of his apostolical duties. That he
                    w⅛ ignorant, no man will allege who is not grossly ignorant himself; for he
                    appears to have been master not only of the Jewish learning, but also of the
                    Greek philosophy, and to have been very conversant even with the Greek poets.
                    That he was not credulous, is plain from his having resisted the evidence of all
                    the miracles performed on earth by Christ, as well as those that were afterwards
                    worked by the apostles; to the fame of which, as he lived in Jerusalem, he could
                    not possibly have been a stranger. And that he was as free from vanity as any
                    man that ever lived, may be gathered from all that we see in his writings, or
                    know of his life. He represents himself as the least of the apostles, and not
                    meet to be called an apostle. He says that he is the chief of sinners; and he
                    prefers, in the strongest terms, universal benevolence to faith, and prophecy,
                    and miracles, and all the gifts and graces with which he could be endowed. Is
                    this the language of vanity or enthusiasm? Did ever fanatic prefer virtue to his
                    own religious opinions, to illuminations of the Spirit, and even to the merit of
                    martyrdom?</p><p>Having thus shown that St Paul was neither an impostor nor an
                    enthusiast, it remains only to be inquired, whether he was deceived by the fraud
                    of others; but this inquiry needs not be long, for who was to deceive him? A few
                    illiterate fishermen of Galilee? It was <hi rend="italic">morally</hi>
                    impossible for such men to conceive the thought of turning the most enlightened
                    of their opponents and the most cruel of their persecutors into an apostle, and
                    to do this by a fraud in the very instant of his greatest fury against them and
                    their Lord. But could they have been so extravagant as to conceive such a
                    thought, it was <hi rend="italic">phytic ally</hi> impossible for them to
                    execute it in the manner in which we find his conversion to have been effected.
                    Could they produce a light in the air which at mid-day was brighter than the
                    sun? Could they make Saul hear words from out of that light which were not heard
                    by the rest of the company? Could they make him blind for three days after that
                    vision, and then make scales fall off from his eyes, and restore him to sight by
                    a word? Or, could they make him and those who travelled with him believe that
                    all these things had happened, if they had not happened? Most unquestionably no
                    fraud was equal to all this.</p><p>Since, then, St Paul was neither an impostor,
                    an enthusiast, nor deceived by the fraud of others, it follows that his
                    conversion was miraculous, and that the Christian religion is a divine
                    revelation. See Lyttleton’s “Observations on the Conversion of St Paul a
                    treatise to which it has been truly said, that infidelity has never been able to
                    fabricate a specious answer, and of which this note is a very short and
                    imperfect abridgement.</p></note></p>

                    Christ,” and where in solitude and quiet he was doubtless engaged in training
                    himself for the work in which he was about to engage. On his return to Damascus,
                    he openly appeared as a preacher of Christianity, a circumstance which the Jews
                    felt to be so injurious to their cause, that they sought, by the aid of the
                    governor, who was in all probability himself a Jew, to put him to death. Having
                    by the aid of his Christian brethren escaped their malice, he betook himself to
                    Jerusalem, where, after the fears of the brethren, who remembered his former
                    enmity, but had not heard of his subsequent conversion to Christianity, had been
                    removed by the testimony of his friend and companion Barnabas, he was gladly
                    welcomed amongst them, and permitted to occupy that rank to which Christ had

                    residence. After being fifteen days in Jerusalem, he went to Caesarea, and
                    thence to his native city Tarsus, where he abode for several years.<note

                    the mean time, Christianity, which had hitherto been preached only to the Jews,
                    had received some adherents from amongst the Gentiles at Antioch; and this led
                    to the mission of Barnabas from Jerusalem, for the purpose of instructing and
                    regulating the church that had been formed there. Barnabas, after some time,
                    finding the need of assistance and counsel, went to Tarsus, and returned with
                    Paul to Antioch, where they abode for a year, occupied in united efforts for the
                    promulgation of Christianity. At the close of that period, they were sent to
                    Jerusalem by the</p>
                <p>Christians at Antioch, with the contributions which had been made by them on
                    behalf of their brethren in Judea, who were suffering from the effects of a
                    dearth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. xi.
                    22-30.</p></note> This was Paul’s <hi rend="italic">second</hi> visit to
                    Jerusalem since his conversion. After some months, they again returned to
                    Antioch, accompanied by John Mark, the nephew of Barnabas. The cause of
                    Christianity by this time had begun to flourish in that city, and several
                    persons had been received into the church who were qualified to act as teachers
                    to the rest This rendered it the less necessary that Paul and Barnabas should
                    remain any longer with them; and accordingly, shortly after their return, the
                    church received a special command from heaven to set them apart to general
                    missionary work. In obedience to this command, they were sent forth; and,
                    accompanied by John Mark, who, however, soon deserted them and returned to
                    Jerusalem, they visited Seleucia, Cyprus, Perga in Pamphylia, Antioch in
                    Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia (at the former of which,
                    in consequence of Paul’s curing a cripple, the people were on the point of
                    offering him and his companion divine honours, under the impression that the
                    gods had come down in the likeness of men, but were restrained by the vehement
                    expostulations of those for whom these impious honours were designed; and in a
                    few days after, they had so completely changed their minds, that, at the
                    instigation of the Jews, they stoned Paul, and left him for dead); and then
                    retracing their steps, they returned by way of Attalia, a city of Pamphylia, by
                    sea to Antioch, where they rehearsed to the church all that God had <pb

                    This formed the apostle Paul’s <hi rend="italic">first</hi> great missionary
                    tour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Acts, xiii.
                    xiv.</p></note></p>
                <p>After some time spent at Antioch, he and Barnabas again went up to Jerusalem, for
                    the purpose of consulting the apostles and elders in regard to some dissensions
                    which had occurred in the church at Antioch, as to the obligation on Gentile
                    converts of the Mosaic ceremonial. This gave occasion to the holding of a
                    council at Jerusalem, at which, after much disputing, it was at length agreed
                    unanimously, at the suggestion of the apostle James, that they should lay no
                    stumbling-block in the way of their Gentile brethren, by requiring of them more
                    than simply that they should abstain from meats offered to idols, from
                    uncleanness, from things strangled, and from blood, whether pure or mixed with
                    anything else. A letter to this effect was written to the church at Antioch in
                    the name of the church at Jerusalem; and with this, two of the members of this
                    church, Judas and Silas or Silvanus, were appointed to accompany Paul and
                    Barnabas to Antioch.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>/Ibid. XV. 1-31.</p></note> By these means the difference of opinion amongst
                    the brethren was removed, and the church restored to peace. This led Paul to
                    propose to Barnabas another missionary tour, to which that faithful
                    fellowlabourer having consented, they were on the verge of departure, when an
                    unhappy contention, arising out of a determination on the part of Barnabas to
                    take with them his nephew John Mark, a step which Paul firmly resisted, on the
                    ground of Mark’s former conduct in deserting them, produced a rupture between
                    these two eminent individuals, and led to their prosecuting a separate
                    course.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. XV.
                    36-41.</p></note> Whilst Barnabas, in company with his nephew, went to Cyprus,
                    Paul, attended by Silas, went towards the east, and, passing through Syria and
                    Cilicia, revisited the scenes of his former labours and sufferings in Lycaonia.
                    At Lystra he found Timothy, a young man who had been probably converted to
                    Christianity on the occasion of the apostle’s former visit, and who was so
                    highly commended by the church in that place that Paul selected him as the
                    companion of his travels, having previously ordained him by the imposition of
                    the hands of the presbytery.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Tim. iv. 14.</p></note> Accompanied by him and Silas, the
                    apostle next passed through the regions of Phrygia and Galatia, and avoiding
                    Asia strictly so called, which he was forbidden by the Holy Spirit to enter, as
                    well as Bithynia, they came by way of Mysia to Troas, a city and port on the
                    borders of the Hellespont. Here he was directed by an apparition in a vision to
                    go into Macedonia; and accordingly, with his companions, having crossed to
                    Samothracia, and thence to Neapolis, a seaport of Thrace, he arrived in due
                    course at Philippi. Here they remained for some time, and made many converts,
                    amongst others the jailor of the prison, into which Paul and Silas had been
                    thrust after having been scourged, in consequence of a charge which had been
                    brought against them as disturbers of the peace of the city, by a set of
                    impostors whose trade they had destroyed by expelling an evil spirit from a
                    female slave who brought them much gain by her skill in soothsaying. From
                    Philippi they passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, cities of Macedonia, to
                    Thessalonica, where, though they abode only a short time, they preached the
                    gospel with great success. A tumult having arisen at the instigation of the
                    Jews, the Christian converts, fearing for their safety, sent them by night to
                    Berea, another city of Macedonia, about forty miles west of Thessalonica, where
                    they were favourably received by their Jewish brethren, until a party which had
                    followed them from Thessalonica stirred up a persecution against them. This
                    determined Paul to go to Athens, whilst Timothy and Silas, as less ob noxious to
                    the Jews, remained at Berea. It does not appear to have been the apostle’s
                    intention in the first instance in visiting Athens to preach the gospel there,
                    at least until Timothy and Silas, to whom he had sent a message on his arrival,
                    requiring them to join him, should have arrived; but as he waited for them, the
                    sight of a city like that of Athens, entirely given to idolatry, so stirred and
                    excited his spirit that he could no longer refrain; and accordingly, in the
                    synagogues he disputed with the Jews, and in the market-place with such as he
                    met This led to his coming into contact with certain Stoic and Epicurean
                    philosophers, by whom he was contemptuously invited to unfold his new doctrines,
                    and describe the strange deities of which they supposed him to be the votary;
                    and for this purpose he was taken to the Areopagus, where, with admirable tact,
                    he exposed the follies of their idolatry, and commended to them the worship of
                    the one living and true God, in the midst of avast assemblage of people, on many
                    of whom a favourable impression was produced by his address.<note

                    retaining the latter in his company, or despatching him to some other quarter,
                    he himself passed over to Corinth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    himself by his labours as a tent-maker, in company with a pious couple named
                    Aquila and Priscilla, who had taken refuge in Corinth after having been expelled
                    from Rome by an edict of Claudius Caesar against the Jews; and at the same time
                    he availed himself of every opportunity of urging the gospel of Christ upon the
                    acceptance both of Jews and Greeks. Here he was rejoined by Silas and Timothy,
                    with whom he continued a year and a half in active exertion for the advancement
                    of Christianity. By the persevering enmity of his former opponents the Jews, he
                    was again compelled to leave Corinth, and betake himself, along with Aquila and
                    Priscilla, to Ephesus. Here he abode at this time only a few days, having been
                    commissioned by a divine revelation to go up to Jerusalem in time for the
                    approaching feast of the passover. On this journey, which ended in his paying
                    his <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> visit to Jerusalem since his conversion, he
                    was accompanied by Barnabas, with whom his former friendship had been
                    re-established, and Titus, a Greek, who seems to have been a convert of
                    Barnabas. After a brief residence there, he returned to Antioch, and so finished
                    his second great apostolic tour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Acts, xviii. 1-22.</p></note></p>
                <p>At Antioch he abode for some time, and then commenced another extensive tour,
                    accompanied, as is supposed, by Titus. Passing through Phrygia and Galatia,
                    where he revisited the churches he had formerly planted, he arrived at Ephesus.
                    This city stood in the same relation to the region of Hither Asia in which
                    Jerusalem stood to Palestine, Antioch to Syria, Corinth to Achaia, and Rome to
                    the west; and accordingly the apostle made it his head-quarters for three years,
                    during which time he was occupied in making converts in the city, and in paying
                    short visits to the surrounding places, and to Crete and other islands of the
                    adjoining archipelago. With so much success were his labours attended in
                    Ephesus, that the revenues of those who were interested in the support of the
                    idolatrous worship of the tutelar goddess of the city, Diana, began to be
                    affected; and at the instigation of one of these, by narΛe Demetrius, a
                    silversmith, who carried on an extensive manufacture of miniature
                    representations of the famous temple of Diana at Ephesus, a popular tumult was
                    excited against the apostle, which was with difficulty appeased by the calm and
                    sagacious conduct of the <hi rend="italic">γ%αμματεhς,</hi> or town-clerk, who,
                    along <pb break="no" facs="nls:193493089" xml:id="kp-eb0717-3089-0154"/>with
                    others of the chief men in the place, seems to have been friendly towards Paul.
                    Whether this tumult had any effect in quickening the apostle’s determination to
                    leave Ephesus, is uncertain; it is clear, however, that he had come to that
                    determination before it happened.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    resolved to go to Macedonia; and accordingly, shortly after the tumult, he
                    departed from Ephesus, and went by way of Troas to Philippi. There he seems to
                    have remained a considerable while, for, during his residence at Philippi as his
                    head-quarters, he preached the gospel in all the surrounding districts, even as
                    far as to Illyricum, on the eastern shore of the Adriatic.<note anchored="true"

                    paid a second visit to Corinth, where he abode three months, and then returned
                    to Philippi, having been frustrated in his intention of proceeding through Syria
                    to Jerusalem by the malice of the Jews. From Philippi he sailed for Troas, where
                    he abode seven days; thence he journeyed on foot to Assos; and thence he
                    proceeded by sea to Miletus, having visited several of the intermediate places.
                    At Miletus he had an affecting interview with the elders of the church at
                    Ephesus, to whom, in the prospect of seeing them no more, he gave a solemn and
                    impressive charge, and bade them farewell. From Miletus he sailed for Syria,
                    and, after visiting several intermediate ports, landed at Tyre, where he
                    remained seven days. Thence he journeyed by way of Ptolemais and Caesarca to
                    Jerusalem, which he visited on this occasion for <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi>

                <p>At Jerusalem he recounted to the whole church the events connected with the
                    progress of Christianity of which he had been witness, and, apparently to quiet
                    the scruples of some Jewish converts, who thought he had too lax and incorrect a
                    view of the obligation of the Mosaic ritual, he united himself, at the
                    suggestion of the apostle James, to four persons who had taken upon them the
                    vows of Nazarites, and, entering with them into the temple, signified to the
                    priest that he would pay the cost of the sacrifices which were necessary to
                    absolve them and him from the vow. Whatever effect this compliance had on the
                    minds of his scrupulous brethren, it procured for him no mitigation of the
                    hatred with which he was regarded by the unconverted Jews. On the contrary, so
                    eager was their zeal against him, that, before his vow was accomplished, they
                    seized him in the temple, and would have put him to death, had not Lysias,
                    commander of the Roman cohort in the citadel adjoining the temple, brought
                    soldiers to his rescue. By his permission, and under his protection, Paul
                    addressed to the infuriated mob an apology for himself, in which he set forth
                    the main circumstances of his life from the beginning up to the period when he
                    opened his commission to the Gentiles. At first he was listened to with
                    attention, but as soon as he spoke of placing the Gentiles on a par with the
                    Jews, they interrupted him with execrations, and shouted, “away with such a
                    fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he should live.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Acts, xxii. 22.</p></note>
                    The Roman commander seeing these demonstrations of popular resentment, and being
                    ignorant of what Paul had been saying, from the address having been uttered in
                    the Hebrew tongue, imagined that he must be some execrable criminal, and gave
                    orders that he should be brought into the fort, in order that he might by
                    scourging compel him to confess his crime. From this indignity Paul saved
                    himself by asserting his privileges as a Roman citizen, to bind or scourge whom
                    was strictly forbidden by law. Next day the chief captain brought him before the
                    Sanhedrim, for the purpose of hearing what it was that was urged against him;
                    and here Paul again entered into a defence of his conduct, in the course of
                    which he professed his attach-, ment to the doctrine of a corporeal
                    resurrection, and there by stirred up a fierce controversy between the two
                    parties composing the Sanhedrim, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, the former of
                    whom maintained, whilst the latter denied, this doctrine. So angry and vehement
                    did this discussion become, that the chief captain, fearing for the safety of
                    his prisoner, whom, as a Roman citizen, he was bound to protect, commanded his
                    soldiers to go down and remove him from amongst the combatants, into the fort.
                    Upon the day following, above forty of the Jews entered into a solemn engagement
                    neither to eat nor drink until they had killed Paul, and for this purpose
                    proposed to the chief priests to invite him to a conference, in the hope that
                    they might have an opportunity of assaulting him on his way from the fort. This
                    scheme was rendered abortive by intelligence of it having been conveyed to
                    Lysias by Paul’s sister’s son, who, alongst with his mother, seems to have been
                    an early· convert to Christianity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    this desperate aspect, Lysias determined to bring the whole under the
                    consideration of the procurator; and, accordingly, placing Paul under the
                    protection of a sufficient escort; he sent him to Caesarea, with a letter to
                    Felix, explaining the reasons of this step. After five days, Felix held a court,
                    at which Paul and his accusers were brought together, and both parties heard at
                    fall length. The defence of the apostle was triumphant; but Felix, unwilling to
                    offend the. Jews, remanded him, under the pretence of obtaining farther
                    information from Lysias. Some days afterwards, he summoned him again to his
                    tribunal, in order that he and his wife Drusilla, who was a daughter of Herod
                    Agrippa, might hear him “concerning the faith in Christ on which occasion, the
                    apostle, with all that fearless zeal and faithfulness for which he was
                    distinguished, expostulated so forcibly with the procurator in regard to those
                    vices for which he was notorious, that Felix trembled, and hastily dismissed him
                    from his presence. Shortly after this, Felix was removed from his office, and
                    was succeeded by Porcius Festus, before whom the Jews again brought their
                    charges against Paul. When both parties came to be heard, Paul perceived so
                    evident a disposition in the new governor to favour the Jews, that he felt
                    constrained to avail himself of the privilege which, as a Roman citizen, he
                    possessed, of removing his cause from the province to the metropolis, by
                    appealing to the emperor. This led to his being sent to Rome, but not before he
                    had been again heard by Festus, attended by King Agrippa and his wife Bernice,
                    by whom he was adjudged to have done nothing worthy of death or of bonds, so
                    that he might have been set at liberty had he not appealed unto Caesar. His
                    voyage to Rome was long and disastrous. After coasting along Syria as far as
                    Sidon, they struck across to Myra, a port of Lysia, having passed under Cyprus;
                    thence they sailed slowly towards Cnidus, and thence, in consequence of the wind
                    being contrary, to Crete, where they with difficulty put into a port on the
                    southern side of that island, called the “The Fair Haven,” near the city of
                    Lasea. The season being now far advanced, Paul advised the centurion to proceed
                    no farther; but the place not being suitable for wintering in, and the weather
                    promising favourably, his advice was disregarded, and they again set sail,
                    intending to reach Phoenice, a port in the same island, and there to winter.
                    Scarcely, however, had they ventured to sea when the apostle’s prediction was
                    verified; for a boisterous wind arose and drove them at its mercy across the
                    Mediterranean. In this state they continued for fourteen days, at the close of
                    which they were shipwrecked on the coast of Malta, but without any loss of life.
                    Here the apostle and his company remained for three months, during which time he
                    was actively employed in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193493102"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-3102-0155"/>instructing the inhabitants, and performed many
                    miracles ' for their benefit. On the approach of spring, they availed themselves
                    of a ship of Alexandria that had wintered in the island, and set sail for
                    Syracuse, where they remained three days; thence they crossed to Rhegium, and
                    thence along the coast to Puteoli, from which place he journeyed by land to the
                    imperial city. Here he was delivered by the centurion in whose charge he had
                    come from Caesarea, to the captain of the guard, who, with great lenity,
                    permitted him to dwell in his own hired house, under the charge of a
                    soldier.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Acts, xxi. 16;
                    xxviii. 31.</p></note></p>
                <p>The sacred historian closes his narrative by informing us that Paul continued in
                    this state of easy imprisonment for “two years, receiving all that came to him,
                    preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord
                    Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.” Of the subsequent
                    events of the apostle’s life, consequently, we have much less direct and certain
                    information; and from this has arisen much diversity of opinion on the subject.
                    By many it is supposed that this his first imprisonment at Rome was his last,
                    and that he perished in the persecution which Nero excited against the
                    Christians, by representing them as the agents in the burning of the city;
                    whilst others contend that he was set at liberty before that event, and that he
                    set out on another great missionary tour to the west, in the course of which he
                    preached the gospel throughout Spain, and, according to some, in Britain
                    also;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Bishop

                    over to Crete, returned to Ephesus, passed through Troas into Macedonia, thence
                    to Nicoolis in Epirus, Dalmatia in Illyricum, and back again to Asia, when he
                    was apprehended and conveyed to Rome the second time, where he suffered
                    martyrdom. By some who hold this latter opinion the order of places visited is
                    completely reversed, and Paul is supposed to have commenced his tour in Asia,
                    and ended it in Spain. It would require a much larger space than this article
                    can be permitted to occupy, to enter into any examination of the arguments and
                    evidence on both sides of this question. Suffice it to remark, that whilst the
                    whole subject is involved in much uncertainty, and whilst little more than
                    probable conjecture can be furnished for the details of either hypothesis, the
                    preponderance seems to be in favour of the latter. Our readers will probably be
                    satisfied of this by a reference to what has been written on it by Mr Greswell
                    and Professor Neander; the former of whom contends for it with all the zeal of
                    an advocate, whilst the latter admits it with all the deliberation of a cautious
                    and impartial judge.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In the above sketch of the principal events of the apostle’s life no attempt has
                    been made to assign to each its proper date. This has resulted from the great
                    perplexity in which this part of the subject is involved, and the consequent
                    inexpediency of adopting any particular chronology without assigning the reasons
                    on which it is founded; a course which would have extended this article greatly
                    beyond its proper bounds. We have deemed it preferable, therefore, to present,
                    in the first instance, the leading facts in the history of Paul in the order of
                    their occurrence, and shall now furnish a table of the dates assigned to the
                    more important of these in those systems of chronology which are most deserving
                    of notice, leaving it with our readers to consult the works in which they are
                    unfolded, for the arguments by which they are respectively supported.</p>

                <p>During the brief intervals of comparative ease which the apostle enjoyed amid his
                    arduous and almost incessant exertions as a preacher of Christianity, he wrote
                    several treatises, more or less elaborate, both of a doctrinal and a practical
                    nature, in the shape of epistles to different churches. Of these, thirteen,
                    avowedly of his composition, and one that is with great probability ascribed to
                    him (the Epistle to the Hebrews)<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    have come down to us; and there is good reason to believe that in these we have
                    the whole of those compositions which, as an apostle of Jesus Christ, he gave to
                    the church. It is supposed, indeed, by many distinguished biblical critics, that
                    there is evidence in the first of his extant epistles to the Corinthians, of his
                    having written one to that church antecedently to either of these; but the basis
                    of evidence on which this rests is at best very slender, and the support which
                    it lends to what is raised on it very doubtful.<note anchored="true"

                    argument in favour of the generaI correctness of that scheme which, with

                <p>Neander regards the Epistle to the Hebrews as of uncertain authorship, but deems
                    it probable that it was written about the period of the apostle’s martyrdom, by
                    “some apostolic man of the Pauline school.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In perusing the history and the writings of St Paul, it is impossible not to be
                    struck with the amazing energy of thought and action by which he was
                    characterized. The conception of <hi rend="italic">power</hi> is impressed upon
                    the mind by every view of his history, and the study of every page of his
                    writings. The ease with which he threw off the prejudices of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193493115" xml:id="kp-eb0717-3115-0156"/>Judaism, notwithstanding the
                    deep hold which these had taken of his mind; the rapidity with which he expanded
                    his thoughts to embrace the vast conceptions unfolded by the free offers and
                    unbounded claims of Christianity, so different from the narrow sectarianism of
                    his former religion; the accuracy with which he received into his mind, almost
                    instantaneously, and in all their multiplicity, the mutual bearings and
                    relations of the old economy and the new; the dauntless intrepidity with which,
                    from the very commencement of his Christian profession, he entered into
                    discussion with the advocates of Judaism, and vanquished them with their own
                    weapons; the unflinching perseverance with which, in spite of danger, suffering,
                    contumely, persecution from enemies, ingratitude and desertion from friends, he
                    prosecuted his arduous and exhausting labours; the unwearying assiduity with
                    which he watched over the churches of which he had the care, and the promptitude
                    and accuracy with which he adopted and executed measures for their advantage,
                    widely scattered and variously circumstanced though they were; the resistless
                    force of his arguments, the persuasiveness of his appeals, the bitterness of his
                    irony; all conspire to show that he possessed, in a high degree, those
                    capacities for command by which men are fitted to be the leaders and directors
                    of their fellows in enterprises of importance to the interests of the race. But
                    it was not by attributes of strength and power alone that the mind of Paul was
                    characterized. The sternness of these was relieved and softened by others of a
                    more amiable and gentle cast. A vein of tenderness and sensibility flowed
                    through his soul, which, whilst it made him the more susceptible of suffering
                    from ingratitude or persecution, rendered him at the same time gentle and
                    compassionate to the feelings of others. With all his freedom from Jewish
                    prejudices, he never lost his reverence for the country and institutions of his
                    fathers; and with all his zeal for rectitude, and all his firmness in rebuking
                    error, he never forgot what was due to the imperfections of his brethren, or
                    deemed that truth could be made attractive if divorced from charity. Removed
                    alike from the extremes of fanaticism on the one hand and apathy on the other,
                    his whole life was a noble instance of the consecration, on sound and elevated
                    principles, of the highest powers, and the most indefatigable energies, to a
                    work in which he had no personal interest apart from that of his fellow
                    Christians, and from the honour which was to accrue from his exertions to that
                    Master whom it was his high ambition to serve in life, and his∙ animating
                    expectation to join at death. Apart altogether from his character as an apostle
                    of Christ, his labours in the cause of human amelioration entitle him to
                    veneration as one of the greatest benefactors of the species; whilst in his
                    peculiar capacity as one of the founders of the Christian church, and an
                    inspired expositor of divine truth, he stands without a rival in his claims upon
                    our gratitude and reverence. His history is a standing evidence of the truth of
                    our religion; to his labours we are indebted mainly for the rapid extension of
                    Christianity both in the East and in the West; and in his writings are contained
                    those treasures of heavenly doctrine which it has been the chosen occupation of
                    some of the greatest minds of subsequent ages to explore and to unfold. With
                    these irresistible claims, the more his life, character, and writings are
                    studied, the deeper will be the veneration in which he will be held, and the
                    more sincere will be the gratitude of every pious mind to the Author of all
                    good, for having, in so remarkable a manner, supplied the church with a teacher
                    so eminently qualified to advance its’ best interests, and establish, to the end
                    of time, the faith, efficiency, and enjoyment of its members. <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Paul,</hi><hi rend="italic">Father,</hi> whose name, before
                    he entered into the monastic state, was Peter Sarpi, was born at Venice, on the
                    14th of August 1552. His father followed merchandise, though with so little
                    success, that at his death he left his family very ill provided for, but under
                    the care of a mother whose piety was likely to bring the blessing of Providence
                    upon them, and whose wise conduct supplied the want of fortune. Happily for
                    young Sarpi, she had a brother, master of a celebrated school, under whose
                    direction he was placed by her; and here he lost no time, but cultivated his
                    abilities, which were naturally of the first rate, with unwearied application.
                    He was born for study, having a natural aversion to pleasure and gaiety, and a
                    memory so tenacious that he could repeat thirty verses after once hearing them.
                    Proportional to his capacity was his progress in literature. At the age of
                    thirteen, having made himself master of school learning, he turned his attention
                    to philosophy and the mathematics, and entered upon logic under Capella of
                    Cremona, who, though a celebrated master of that science, confessed that in a
                    very little time he found himself unable to give his pupil any further
                    instructions.</p>
                <p>As Capella was of the order of the Servites, his scholar was induced by him to
                    engage in the same profession, although his uncle and his mother represented to
                    him the hardships and austerities of that kind of life, and advised him with
                    great zeal against it. But he was steady in his resolutions, and in 1566 took
                    the habit of the order, being then only in his fourteenth year; a time of life
                    with most persons very improper for such engagements, but in him attended with
                    such maturity of thought, and such a settled temper, that he never seemed to
                    regret the choice which he then made, and afterwards confirmed it by a solemn
                    public profession in 1572.</p>
                <p>At a general chapter of the Servites which was held at Mantua, Paul, being then
                    only twenty years old, distinguished himself so much in a public disputation, by
                    his genius and learning, that William duke of Mantua, a great patron of letters,
                    solicited the consent of his superiors to retain him at his court, and not only
                    made him public professor of divinity in the cathedral, and reader of
                    casuistical divinity and canon law in that city, but honoured him with many
                    proofs of his esteem. But Father Paul finding a court life not agreeable to his
                    temper, quitted it two years afterwards, and retired to his beloved privacy,
                    being then not only acquainted with the Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Chaldaic
                    languages, but with philosophy, the mathemàtics, canon and civil law, all parts
                    of natural philosophy, and chemistry itself; for his application was
                    unintermitted, his head clear, his apprehension quick, and his memory
                    retentive.</p>
                <p>Being made priest at twenty-two, he was by the illustrious Cardinal Borromeo
                    honoured with his confidence, and employed by him on many occasions, not without
                    the envy of persons of inferior merit, who were so far exasperated as to lay a
                    charge against him before the Inquisition, for denying that the Trinity could be
                    proved from the first chapter of Genesis; but the accusation was too ridiculous
                    to be entertained. After this he passed successively through the dignities of
                    his order, and having been chosen provincial for the province of Venice at the
                    age of twenty-six, he discharged the duties of his office with such ability,
                    that in 1579 he was appointed, with two others, to draw up new regulations and
                    statutes for its government. This he éx-ecuted with great success; and when his
                    office of provincial expired, he retired for three years to the study of natural
                    and experimental philosophy and anatomy, in which he is said to have made some
                    useful discoveries. In the intervals-of his employment he applied himself to his
                    studies with an extensive capacity, which left no branch of knowledge<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193493128" xml:id="kp-eb0717-3128-0157"/> untouched.
                    Acquapendente, the great anatomist, confesses that he Iearned from Paul how
                    vision was performed; and there are proofs that he was not a stranger to the
                    circulation of the blood. He frequently conversed on astronomy with
                    mathematicians, on anatomy with surgeons, on medicine with physicians, and on
                    the analysis of metals with chemists, not as a superficial inquirer, but as a
                    complete master. He was next chosen procurator-general of his order; and, during
                    his residence at Rome, he was not only greatly esteemed by Pope Sixtus V., but
                    also contracted an intimate friendship with Cardinal Bellarmine and other
                    eminent persons.</p>
                <p>But the hours of repose, which he employed so well, were interrupted by a new
                    information in the Inquisition, where a former acquaintance produced a letter
                    written by him in ciphers, in which he said, “that he detested the court of
                    Rome, and that no preferment was obtained there but by dishonest means.” This
                    accusation, however dangerous, was passed over on account of his great
                    reputation; but it made such an impression on that court, that he was afterwards
                    denied a bishopric by Clement VIII. After these difficulties were surmounted,
                    Father Paul again retired to his solitude, where he appears to have turned his
                    attention more to improvement in piety than to learning. Such was the care with
                    which he read the Scriptures, that, it being his custom to draw a line under any
                    passage which he intended more nicely to consider, there was not a single word
                    in his New Testament but was underlined. The same marks of attention appeared in
                    his Old Testament, Psalter, and Breviary.</p>
                <p>But the most active scene of his life commenced about the year 1615, when Paul
                    V., exasperated by some decrees of the senate of Venice which interfered with
                    the alleged rights of the church, laid the whole state under an interdict. The
                    senate, filled with indignation at this treatment, forbade the bishops to
                    receive or publish the pope’s bull; and, convening the rectors of the churches,
                    commanded them to celebrate divine service in the accustomed manner, with which
                    most of them readily complied; but the Jesuits and some others, having refused,
                    were by a solemn edict expelled the state. Both parties having proceeded to
                    extremities, employed their ablest writers to defend their measures. On the
                    pope’s side, Cardinal Bellarmine entered the lists, and, with his confederate
                    authors, defended the papal claims with great vehemence of expression, and very
                    sophistical reasonings; which were confuted by the Venetian apologists in much
                    more decent language, and with greater solidity of argument. On this occasion
                    Father Paul was eminently distinguished by his Defence of the Rights of the
                    Supreme Magistrate, and his Treatise of Excommunication, translated from Gerson,
                    with an Apology, and other writings. For these he was cited before the
                    Inquisition at Rome; but it may easily be imagined that he did not obey the
                    summons.</p>
                <p>The Venetian writers, whatever might be the abilities of their adversaries, were
                    at least superior to them in the justice of their cause. The propositions
                    maintained on the side of Rome were, that the pope is invested with all the
                    authority of heaven and earth; that all princes are his vassals, and that he may
                    annul their laws at pleasure; that kings may appeal to him, as he is temporal
                    monarch of the whole earth; that he can discharge subjects from their oaths of
                    allegiance, and make it their duty to take up arms against their sovereign; that
                    he may depose kings without any fault committed by them, if the good of the
                    church requires it; that the clergy are exempt from all tribute to kings, and
                    are not accountable to them even in cases of high treason; that the pope cannot
                    err; that his decisions are to be received and obeyed on pain of sin, though all
                    the world should judge them to be false; that the pope is the vicegerent of God
                    upon earth; and that to call his power in question is to call in question the
                    power of God; maxims which it did not require the abilities and learning of
                    Father Paul to prove to be false and destructive. It may easily be imagined,
                    that such principles were quickly overthrown, and that no court but that of Rome
                    thought it for its interest to favour them. The pope, therefore, finding his
                    authors confuted and his cause abandoned, was willing to terminate the affair by
                    a treaty; which, by the mediation of Henry IV. of France, was concluded upon
                    terms very much to the honour of the Venetians. But the defenders of the
                    Venetian rights, though comprehended in the treaty, were excluded by the Romans
                    from the benefit of it. Some, upon various pretences, were imprisoned; others
                    were sent to the galleys; and all were excluded from preferment. But their
                    malice was chiefly aimed against Father Paul, who soon felt the effects of it;
                    for, as he was going one night to his convent, about six months after the
                    accommodation, he was attacked by five ruffians armed with stilettoes, who gave
                    him no less than fifteen stabs, three of which wounded him in such a manner that
                    he was left for dead. The murderers fled for refuge to the nuncio, and were
                    afterwards received into the pope’s dominions; but they were pursued by divine
                    justice, all, except one man who died in prison, having perished by violent
                    deaths.</p>
                <p>This, and other attempts upon his life, obliged him to confine himself to his
                    convent, where he engaged in writing the History of the Council of Trent; a work
                    unequalled for the judicious disposition of the matter, and the skilful texture
                    of the narration. It is commended by Dr Burnet as the completest model of
                    historical writing, and celebrated by Mr Worton as equivalent to any production
                    of antiquity; a work in which the reader finds “liberty without licentiousness,
                    piety without hypocrisy, freedom of speech without neglect of decency, severity
                    without rigour, and extensive learning without ostentation.”</p>
                <p>In this, and other works of less consequence, he spent the remaining part of his
                    life, until the beginning of the year 1622, when he was seized with a cold and
                    fever, which he neglected till it became incurable. He languished more than
                    twelve months, which he spent almost wholly in preparation for his passage into
                    eternity; and amongst his prayers and aspirations he was often heard to repeat,
                    “Lord, now let thy servant depart in peace.” Throughout the whole course of his
                    illness, to the last hour of his life, he was consulted by the senate in public
                    affairs, and returned answers in his greatest weakness with such presence of
                    mind as could only arise from the consciousness of innocence.</p>
                <p>On the day of his death he had the passion of our blessed Saviour read to him out
                    of St John’s Gospel, and spoke of the mercy of the Redeemer, and his confidence
                    in his merits. As his end approached, the brethren of his convent came to
                    pronounce the last prayers, with which he could only join in his thoughts, being
                    able to pronounce no more than the words <hi rend="italic">Esto</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">perpetua,</hi> which was understood to be a prayer for the
                    prosperity of his country. He died in the seventy-first year of his age, hated
                    by the Romans as their most formidable enemy, honoured by all the learned for
                    his abilities, and esteemed by the good for his integrity.</p>
