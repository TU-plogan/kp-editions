                    It will neither give fire with steel, nor ferment with aquafortis; but it
                    calcines very freely and readily into a fine plaster, the use of which in
                    building and casting statues is well known.</p>
                <p>The method of representing a face truly in plaster of Paris is this. The person
                    whose figure is designed is laid on his back, with any convenient thing to keep
                    off the hair. Into each nostril is conveyed a conical piece of stiff paper, open
                    at both ends, to allow of respiration. These tubes being anointed with oil, are
                    supported by the hand of an assistant; then the face is lightly oiled over, and
                    the eyes being kept shut, alabaster fresh calcined, and tempered to a thinnisħ
                    consistence with water, is by spoonfuls nimbly thrown all over the face, till it
                    lies near the thickness of an inch. This matter grows sensibly hot, and in about
                    a quarter of an hour hardens into a kind of stony concretion; which being gently
                    taken off, represents, on its concave surface, the minutest part of the original
                    face. In this a head of good clay may be moulded; and therein the eyes are to be
                    opened, and other necessary amendments made. This second face being anointed
                    with oil, a second mould of calcined alabaster is made, consisting of two parts
                    joined lengthwise along the ridge of the nose; and herein may be cast, with the
                    same matter, a face extremely like the original.</p>
                <p>If finely powdered alabaster, or plaster of Paris, be put into a basin over a
                    fire, it will, when heated, assume the appearance of a fluid, by rolling in
                    waves, yielding to the touch, and steaming, all which properties it again loses
                    on the departure of the heat; and being thrown upon paper, it will not at all
                    wet it, but immediately discover itself to be as motionless as before it was set
                    over the fire; wherefore it appears, that a heap of such little bodies as are
                    neither spherical nor otherwise regularly shaped, nor small enough to be below
                    the discernment of the eye, may, without fusion, be made fluid by a sufficiently
                    strong and various agitation of the particles which compose it, and may lose its
                    fluidity when the agitation is discontinued.</p>
                <p>Two or three spoonfuls of burned alabaster, mixed up thin with water, in a short
                    time coagulate into a hard lump at the bottom of a vessel full of water.
                    Artificers observe, that the coagulating property of burned alabaster will be
                    very much impaired or lost if the powder be kept too long, especially in the
                    open air, before it is made use of; and when it has been once tempered with
                    water, and suffered to grow hard, they cannot, by any new burning or powdering
                    of it, make it serviceable for their purpose as before.</p>
                <p>This matter, when wrought into vessels, or other forms, is still of so loose and
                    spongy a texture, that the air finds an easy passage through it. Mr Boyle, in
                    relating his experiments<pb break="no" facs="nls:193501448"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1448-0797"/> with the air-pump, gives an account of his
                    preparing a tube of this plaster, closed at one end and open at the other; and
                    on applying the open end to the cement, as is usually done with the receivers,
                    it was found utterly impossible to exhaust all the air out of it; for fresh air
                    from without pressed in as fast as the internal air was exhausted, although the
                    sides of the tube were of considerable thickness. A tube of iron was then put on
                    the engine, so that being filled with water, the tube of plaster of Paris was
                    covered with it; and on using the pump, it was immediately seen that the water
                    passed through into it as easily as the air had done when that was the ambient
                    fluid. After this, trying it with Venice turpentine instead of water, the thing
                    succeeded very well; the tube might be perfectly exhausted, and would remain in
                    that state for several hours. But on pouring some hot oil upon the turpentine,
                    the case was much altered; for the turpentine melting, became a thinner fluid,
                    and in this state was capable of passing like water into the pores of the
                    plaster. On taking away the tube, however, it was remarked that the turpentine,
                    which had pervaded and filled its pores, rendered it transparent, in the manner
                    that water gives transparency to that singular stone called <hi rend="italic"
                    >oculus mundi.</hi> In this manner, the weight of air, under proper management,
                    becomes capable of making several sorts of glues penetrate plaster of Paris; and
                    not only so, but also baked earth, wood, and all other bodies porous enough to
                    admit water.</p>
