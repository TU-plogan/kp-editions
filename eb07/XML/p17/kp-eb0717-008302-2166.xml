                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Park,</hi><hi rend="italic">Mungo,</hi> a celebrated
                    traveller, was born at Fowlshiels, near Selkirk, on the 10th of September 1771.
                    His father occupied the farm of Fowlshiels, under the Duke of Bucclcuch. He
                    appears to have bestowed uncommon attention on the education of his children;
                    and he even employed a tutor to reside in his house, an expense which was then
                    supposed to exceed the resources of an ordinary farmer. Young Park made a good
                    figure at school. His general demeanour was reserved and thoughtful; yet
                    occasional sparks of ambition broke forth, indicative of that adventurous spirit
                    which lay concealed under a somewhat cold exterior. This thoughtful disposition
                    led his friends to consider the church as the profession best suited to his
                    character; but as he himself preferred physic to theology, his wishes were
                    acquiesced in; and he spent three years at the University of Edinburgh, in the
                    studies necessary to qualify him for that profession.</p>
                <p>At Edinburgh Park studied with ardour and success; and in particular he imbibed a
                    fondness for botany, which served to give a strong colour to his future life. It
                    strengthened his natural connection with his brother-in-law, Mr <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193492179" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2179-0084"/>James Dickson, who,
                    notwithstanding many disadvantages, attained such skill in that science, that,
                    on going as a gardener to Hammersmith, he obtained a large share of the
                    patronage and favour of Sir Joseph Banks. This connection induced Mr Park to
                    repair to London. He was introduced to Sir Joseph, who was so much pleased with
                    him that he obtained for him the appointment of assistant-surgeon to the
                    Worcester East Indiaman. In this capacity Mr Park performed a voyage to
                    Bencoolen, where he made some collections and observations in botany and natural
                    history, which were submitted to the Linnaean Society, and an account of them
                    printed in the third volume of their Transactions.</p>
                <p>The African Association were now anxiously looking out for a successor to Major
                    Houghton, their unfortunate missionary, who had perished in the attempt to
                    penetrate to the Niger and Timbuctoo. This opening, although foreign to any of
                    Mr Park’s former pursuits except that of natural history, was immediately
                    embraced by him with an ardour which showed how congenial it was to the
                    character of his mind. Without hesitation, he offered himself for this arduous
                    and perilous service, and, being supported by the recommendation of Sir Joseph
                    Banks, he was at once accepted.</p>
                <p>Park spent about two years in and near London, acquiring the qualifications
                    necessary for his mission. In May 1795 he set sail, and on the 21st of June
                    following arrived at Jillifree, near the mouth of the Gambia. After spending
                    some months with Dr Laidley at Pisania, in acquiring the Mandingo language, he,
                    on the 2d of December 1795, departed on his grand expedition. It would be
                    superfluous to enter here into a detail of events which are so generally known,
                    and which excited so deep an interest, as his captivity amongst the Moors, his
                    almost miraculous escape, his discovery of the course of the Niger, and of the
                    African capital of Sego, his journey through Bambarra, and the train of peril
                    and difficulty through which he effected his return. He arrived, after the
                    length of his absence, and the want of intelligence respecting him, had nearly
                    extinguished all hopes of his safety. Reaching London early in the morning of
                    Christmas 1797, he went to pass the time before breakfast in the gardens of the
                    British Museum, where, by a singular chance, he met Mr Dickson, who embraced his
                    friend as one returned from the grave. An extraordinary interest in his
                    adventures was immediately excited amongst the African Institution, its friends,
                    and the public in general. Major Rennell drew up an important memoir, showing
                    the new light thrown by his journey upon African geography, which, with an
                    abstract of his narrative by Mr Bryan Edwards, was speedily offered, to satisfy
                    the curiosity of the public. In the spring of 1799, Mr Park presented the public
                    with a full narrative from his own pen. Major Rennell’s memoir was appended, and
                    a considerable part of Mr Edwards’ abstract was incorporated verbatim; upon
                    which circumstance alone seems to have been built the rumour of that gentleman
                    having been the actual writer of the volume. The work was read with an avidity
                    proportioned to the novelty and importance of the information contained in it,
                    and to the interesting and agreeable manner in which the events were
                    narrated.</p>
                <p>Having finished this task, Mr Park seems to have resolved to retire into domestic
                    and professional life. In 1799, he married Miss Anderson of Selkirk, daughter of
                    the gentleman with whom he had served his apprenticeship as a surgeon. In
                    October 1801, he embraced an opportunity which offered, of commencing a
                    professional career at Peebles, and soon found himself in respectable practice.
                    His situation now seemed sufficiently comfortable, being happy in domestic life,
                    possessed of a competence, and surrounded by respectable society; but his active
                    mind was not to be so satisfied, and was secretly panting after a higher sphere
                    of exertion.</p>
                <p>Important as were his discoveries, their effect had been, not to satisfy, but to
                    excite still farther, the public curiosity. The course of the Niger through the
                    unknown and central parts of the continent could not fail to excite peculiar
                    interest. This was strongly felt, not only by the scientific world, but by some
                    intelligent members of administration, who, on the conclusion of the peace in
                    1801, determined to fit out an expedition on a great scale, to effect the
                    discovery of the termination of this great river. In autumn 1803, Lord Hobart,
                    afterwards Earl of Buckinghamshire, who was then colonial secretary, offered the
                    command of it to Mr Park, who, though he asked a short interval to consult his
                    friends, seems never in his own mind to have hesitated as to its acceptance. To
                    those who represented to him the dangers that were to be incurred, he urged,
                    that the hardships attendant on the obscure exercise of his profession, his
                    journeys to distant patients, his long and solitary rides over “cold and lonely
                    heaths,” and over “gloomy hills, assailed by the wintry tempest,” would tend as
                    effectually to shorten life as the journey now in contemplation.</p>
                <p>In this new undertaking, Mr Park was amply supplied with every thing which could
                    insure success. Thirty soldiers, and nearly the same number of carpenters and
                    artificers, were placed under his command; arms, beasts of burden, and
                    commodities to trade with, were amply supplied; and he was empowered to draw
                    upon the treasury to the extent of L.5000. Everything, therefore, seemed to
                    augur a still more brilliant issue to his present than to his former journey.
                    But a dark destiny impended over it, and rendered abortive all human means and
                    efforts.</p>
                <p>It would be superfluous to enter into a detail of that afflicting train of
                    events, with which the public are already but too well acquainted.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Narrative of this journey
                    was published in 1815, in 4to, with a very interesting biographical memoir and
                    preface, by Mr Wishaw. It may not be amiss to notice here a singular oversight
                    in Park’s Journal, lately observed by Μ. Walckenaer. A 31st day is counted in
                    April (p. 7); and as all the days before and after are accounted for, there can
                    be no doubt that all the following dates are one day behind. This, as Mr Bowdich
                    has shown, is not so trifling an error as at first sight it appears; for a false
                    declination being thus taken, an error, greater or less, and sometimes not
                    inconsiderable, is committed in the calculation of all the subsequent
                    latitudes.</p></note> That Park perished in his voyage down the Niger, may be
                    considered as long since fully established; and we need not swell our pages with
                    the rumours which have been circulated respecting an event which has for many
                    years ceased to be doubtful.</p>
                <p>Park has been pronounced by some the first of modern travellers. Without
                    altogether adopting this opinion, we may observe, that the problem of the course
                    of the Niger, which he had the fortune partially to solve, was one which had
                    involved in error almost all former geographical systems on Africa. D’Anville,
                    indeed, had stated it correctly; but as he had not communicated the grounds upon
                    which his conclusion rested, the opposite opinion, which represented the Niger
                    as flowing westward, and joining the ocean by the channel of the Senegal,
                    continued still prevalent. This point, finally decided, fixed the geographical
                    character of the continent. In Bambarra, also, a name as yet scarcely heard of
                    by Europeans, Park found a kingdom much farther advanced in populousness and
                    civilization than had yet been supposed to exist in the heart of Africa.</p>
                <p>Mr Park’s literary, though not equal to his active qualifications, were
                    nevertheless respectable. But notwithstanding his knowledge of botany, he cannot
                    be considered as a scientific traveller. We see not in him that varied and
                    splendid science which, in Humboldt, illustrates and adorns, though it sometimes
                    overlays the main subject. But with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492192"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-2192-0085"/>regard to the general aspect of nature, and the
                    forms~of human society, his observations are careful, accurate, and judicious.
                    Nothing can be more lively than the idea which we receive from him of the
                    African forests and deserts, the cities of Bambarra, the stream of the Niger or
                    Joliba, and the regions watered by that river. The spirit, joined to the
                    unpretending simplicity, of his narrative, has rendered his work one of the most
                    popular of its kind in the English language.</p>
                <p>Mr Park’s bodily frame was well fitted for the arduous enterprises in which he
                    engaged. He was six feet in height, his limbs were well proportioned, and his
                    whole frame was active and robust. His countenance was prepossessing, and his
                    manners always retained their native plainness and simplicity. But this was
                    combined with a natural coldness and reserve, which rendered his conversation
                    less interesting than was expected by those who considered his general talents
                    and extensive opportunities of observation. His conduct in all the relations of
                    private life was highly exemplary. He left a widow, three sons, and a daughter,
