                <p><label type="entry">PETRARCH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Francis</hi></label>, one of
                    the greatest poets and most celebrated men of whom Italy can boast, was born at
                    Arezzo on the 20th of July 1304. He saw the light amidst the rage of contending
                    factions. His father, the friend of Dante, and, like him, of the Ghibelin party,
                    had been banished from Florence, where he filled a respectable situation
                    confided to him by the republic; and having taken refuge in Pisa, he committed
                    the primary tuition of his son, then in his seventh year, to an old grammarian
                    of that city named C&lt;mvennole da Prato. Two years afterwards, when the death
                    of the Emperor Henry VII. had destroyed the hopes of the Ghibelins, the father
                    of Petrarch removed his family to Avignon, whither Clement V. had transferred
                    the pontifical court, and his son resumed his studies at Carpentras, under his
                    former master. It was •then that the youthful pupil of Convennole visited for
                    the first time the fountain of Vaucluse; and the rural beauties 'of this
                    celebrated spot left an indelible impression upon his mind. In that age, the
                    study of law was almost the only pursuit that led to fortune. Petrarch
                    accordingly passed four years at the university of Montpellier, where, instead
                    of immersing himself in the hazy erudition of the schools, he devoted his days
                    and his nights to Cicero and to Virgil. At the same time he made himself
                    familiar with the compositions of the troubadours, and, if we may credit Gariel,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Idea of Montpellier,</hi> retouched the romance of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pierre de Provence</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >la belle Maguelone,</hi> writtch in 1178 by the canon Bernard de Tri vies. But
                    whilst engaged in these seducing pursuits, he was disturbed by the arrival of
                    his father, who, greatly incensed at what he conceived to be a gross
                    misapplication of time, consigned to the flames the little library of his son,
                    and was with difficulty induced to restore to him Cicero and Virgil, after they
                    had been half consumed. Being now sent to the university of Bologna, to receive
                    the instructions of John d’Andrea, the most learned canonist of that age,
                    Petrarch soon formed a connection there with Cino de Pistoia, a Florentine, like
                    himself, whom Bartolo cites as his master in the science of law, and who
                    deserved to become that of Petrarch and Boccacio in poetry. If the young legist
                    did not long retain the lessons of the jurisconsult, he at least remembered
                    those of the poet; and at a later period he did not disdain to consecrate to the
                    memory of Laura several verses borrowed from the bard of Selvagia. At the age of
                    twenty-two he lost his father, and being ruined by faithless tutors, he returned
                    to Avignon, where he took up his residence, appeared with distinction in the
                    most brilliant society, and found himself at liberty to apply to his favourite
                    pursuits. The mathematics, which were then in their infancy, history and
                    antiquities, philosophy with its innumerable systems, especially those which
                    related to the science of ethics, occupied, each in its turn, a mind thirsting
                    for knowledge. The first poetical attempts of Petrarch, like those of Dante,
                    were made in the Latin language; but, happily, his muse soon ventured to confide
                    her inspirations to the vulgar tongue, the only one, besides, which the women
                    understood.</p>
                <p>About this time, he renewed his acquaintance with one of his school companions,
                    James Colonna, the youngest son of Stephen Colonna, the head of the illustrious
                    family of that name. By the elevation of his mind, and his passion for letters,
                    this young Roman was every way worthy to become the friend of Petrarch, and he
                    continued to be so until the period of his death. Cardinal John Colonna, the
                    eldest brother of James, desired also to share the friendship of Petrarch; and,
                    in the society of these eminent individuals, the poet became known to the most
                    illustrious strangers who visited the pontifical city; whilst the noble
                    frankness of his manner, his mild yet sprightly physiognomy, the graces of his
                    mind, and his unaffected anxiety to please, secured him a remarkable ascendency
                    in this select circle. Colonna, the father, took a particular pleasure in
                    recounting to him the events of his life, as well as in developing his projects;
                    and it was in these conversations that Petrarch imbibed a new love of Italy, and
                    a stronger aversion for every thing calculated to prolong its misfortunes or to
                    obscure its glory. When James Colonna was called to the bishopric of Lombez, his
                    friend accompanied him to his diocese, and in their way they stopped at
                    Toulouse, where, a few years before (in 1324), Arnauld Vidal had been honoured
                    with the poetical eglantine. The seven Maintainers of the gay Science were then
                    beginning to diffuse a taste for the vulgar poetry, and to bring into notice
                    those little effusions of song unknown to the ancients, and some of which have
                    still remained peculiar to the literature of the troubadours. A submissive and
                    unfortunate lover, Petrarch, like them, sought to console himself by singing at
                    once the charms and the cruelty of bis beloved. On the 6th of April 1327, on
                    holy Monday, at <pb break="no" facs="nls:193495312" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5312-0325"
                    />six o’clock in the morning, he had seen, in a church of Avignon, the daughter
                    of Audibert de Novis; and the passion he conceived for this lady occupied the
                    remainder of his life, over which it diffused an air of poetry and romance.
                    Laura was united to Hugues de Sade, a young patrician, and a native of Avignon;
                    but, faithful to her duties as a wife and a mother, she forbade Petrarch to
                    indulge the slightest hope. Incessantly haunted with this beautiful vision, the
                    poet visited in succession the south of France, Paris, and the Low Countries;
                    the forest of the Ardennes re-echoed in turn his verses and his lamentations; he
                    traversed Burgundy, the Lyonnais, Dauphiné, and, after an exile of eight months,
                    returned to bury himself in the delightful solitude of Vaucluse.</p>
                <p>Pope John XXII. was then meditating a new crusade, and, to further his object, he
                    led the Romans to hope that he would re-establish the chair of St Peter in
                    Italy. This double project excited the imagination of Petrarch, and inspired his
                    beautiful ode to the Bishop of Lombez, <hi rend="italic">0 as-pettatα in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ciel,</hi> &amp;c. The following year, 1335, we find him
                    expressing, in beautiful Latin verses addressed to Benedict XII. his earnest
                    desire to see the Holy See re-established in the eternal city; and to this
                    patriotic aspiration the pope replied by appointing him canon of Lombez, with
                    the hopes of a prebend. The same year was marked by an event unique in the life
                    of Petrarch. A recent and close connection attached him to the interests of Azon
                    de Corregio, one of the principal lords of Italy, who was then prosecuted before
                    the papal courts at the instance of the family of the Rossi. In the hope of
                    serving his friend, the poet resolved to plead his cause at the bar; and this he
                    did with so eminent success, that it proved to both a day of triumph. Since he
                    had first beheld Laura, he sought occupation everywhere, without being able to
                    fix himself anywhere. A vague disquietude of mind led him to visit Rome, where,
                    however, the friendship of the Colonnas could not detain him; and he returned to
                    Avignon, from which, although he had no desire to establish himself in that
                    city, he could not for any length of time stay away. Finding himself in this
                    unsettled state of mind, he now shut himself up in his retreat at Vaucluse,
                    without friends and without domestics, as if solitude could have extinguished a
                    passion which increased in spite of all his efforts to subdue it. The
                    country-house of the Bishop of Cavaillon adjoined that which he occupied. This
                    prelate was Philip de Cabassole, whom the poet himself calls a little bishop and
                    a great man. Petrarch could not refuse his consolations, and soon reckoned the
                    good bishop amongst his friends.</p>
                <p>About this time the lover of Laura seems to have been occupied with a great
                    literary conception. He had commenced writing in Latin the history of Rome from
                    the foundation of the city to the reign of Titus. But in collecting materials
                    for this work, he was much struck with the grandeur of the events which had
                    marked the termination of the second Punic war; and suddenly conceived the
                    design of giving to his age a regular epic, of which Scipio should be the hero.
                    His plan was hastily traced; some portions of the projected poem were written
                    under the first access of inspiration; and, before the end of the year, the poet
                    was in a condition to submit to his friends the greater part of his work, which
                    they received with the most flattering encomiums, and, having exhausted the
                    language of eulogy, styled the author <hi rend="italic">sublime</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">divine.</hi> But a more grateful distinction awaited him. His
                    sonnets and his <hi rend="italic">Canzoni</hi> had filled France and Italy with
                    the name of Laura and that of her lover; in fact, these pieces were universally
                    read and admired. Of the impression produced by his poetical genius he had soon
                    the most convincing evidence. On the 23d of August 1340, he received at Vaucluse
                    two letters, one from the Roman senate, which invited him to accept the poetical
                    laurel, and be crowned in the capitol, and the other from the chancellor of the
                    University of Paris, which offered him the same triumph. It is a mistake,
                    however, to give the credit of this proceeding to the learned corporation here
                    mentioned. The most careful researches made in the registers have not detected a
                    single trace of the deliberation which must necessarily have preceded the
                    transmission of such a letter as that written by the chancellor; and every thing
                    inclines us to believe that Robert de Barde, who then held that office, a
                    Florentine, and the personal friend of Petrarch, had written him without
                    consulting his colleagues, trusting to inspire them with his own admiration,
                    whenever the poet should appear in Paris. The choice of Petrarch, however, was
                    already made. He had long coveted the poetic laurel, and even made known his
                    wishes to Robert of Anjou, king of Naples, whose influence had stimulated the
                    admiration, and hastened the decision, of the Roman senators. This prince
                    cultivated letters with enthusiasm, and protected them in a manner worthy of a
                    king. Wishing to appear indebted to him for the crown which had been offered to
                    him, Petrarch embarked for Naples, carrying with him his epic poem, which he had
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Africa.</hi> The king and the poet had repeated
                    conferences upon the subjects of poetry and history; but not thinking these
                    sufficient, the latter demanded a more rigorous trial of his qualifications and
                    acquirements, and offered to reply, during three days, to all the questions that
                    might be proposed to him upon history, literature, and philosophy. In this
                    public examination he acquitted himself to the admiration of all. Robert
                    solemnly declared him worthy of the promised triumph; and at his audience of
                    leave, the king, divesting himself of his robe, put it on Petrarch, at the same
                    time requesting him to wear it on the day when he was to receive the laurel
                    crown.</p>
                <p>He then repaired to Rome, and, on Easter-day (the 8th of April 1341), ascended
                    the capitol, in the midst of the principal citizens, preceded by twelve youths
                    selected from the most illustrious families, who declaimed his verses. After a
                    short harangue he received the crown from the hands of the senator Orso, count
                    de l’Anguillara, and then recited a sonnet upon the heroes of ancient Rome,
                    whose place he then appeared to occupy. Descending from the capitol, he was
                    conducted, by the same cortège, amidst the acclamations of a crowd eager to
                    witness so novel a spectacle, to the church of St Peter, where he deposited on
                    the altar the laurel which encircled his brow; after which he set out for
                    Avignon by land, as if to enjoy more leisurely his renown. He carried with him
                    the title of almoner to the king of Naples, and letters-patent giving him, as
                    well by the authority of King Robert as by that of the senate and people of
                    Rome, full and free permission to read, vindicate, and explain the ancient
                    books, to make new ones, compose poems, and on every occasion to wear the crown
                    of laurel, ivy, or myrtle, at his pleasure.</p>
                <p>Azon de Corregio having just usurped the sovereignty of Parma, on the pretext of
                    freeing it from thraldom, urgently pressed Petrarch to spend some time with him;
                    and, captivated by the attentions paid to him, the poet soon accepted the
                    situation of archdeacon of the church of Parma, caused a house to be built
                    there, and then employed himself in completing his poem of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Africa.</hi> Glory had now begun to console him for his labour and anxiety,
                    when envy, awakened by unexampled success, attempted to disturb his repose; and
                    at the same time the hand of death had stricken the Bishop of Lombez, his best
                    friend and warmest admirer. The accession of Clement VI. to the triple crown, in
                    1342, revived in the mind of Petrarch hopes which had already been twice
                    disappointed. At the request of the Romans, he accompanied to Avignon the
                    deputation they had sent for the purpose of soliciting the new pope to fulfil
                    the promises made by John XXII., and, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193495325"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-5325-0326"/>in this matter, he acted as the organ of the
                    deputation. The pontiff received him with marked distinction, appointed him
                    prior of Migliorino, in the diocese of Parma, and treated him with the greatest
                    familiarity, but made no answer to the petition of the deputation, beseeching
                    him to remove to Italy. At the same time, however, his holiness, anxious to
                    testify the confidence he reposed in Petrarch, intrusted him with a delicate
                    mission, namely, that of obtaining from the regency of Naples a recognition of
                    the rights of the Holy See, during the minority of Jane, granddaughter of King
                    Robert. The young queen conversed several times with Petrarch, who, besides,
                    received public testimony of the esteem she entertained for letters; but the
                    candour of the poetical negotiator rendered him the most unfit person in the
                    world to control the selfish policy of the councillors by whom that princess was
                    governed. He fled with horror from a barbarous and corrupt court, which sought
                    relaxation from its debaucheries, in the depraving spectacle of gladiatorial
                    combats. He crossed the Apennines, made no stay at Parma, and, eager to escape
                    from Italy, then a prey to all the fury of contending factions, he returned to
                    his beloved retreat at Vaucluse, where he remained several months. But a
                    circumstance occurred which soon recalled him to Italy. Rienzi, having made
                    himself master of Rome, cited kings to appear before him, and loudly proclaimed
                    that his fellow-citizens were about to resume, in the fourteenth century, their
                    ancient dominion over the world. All the illusions of Petrarch immediately
                    brightened into realities. An ardent defender of the tribune even in the midst
                    of the pontifical court, he now felicitated the popular leader on his success,
                    exhorted him to persevere, and, impatient to counsel him on the spot, set out
                    immediately for Italy. The news of the massacre of the Colonnas reached him at
                    Genoa, and struck him with consternation; but still he felt disposed to pardon
                    Rienzi, provided Rome had become republican. The sway of the tribune, however,
                    was short-lived, and with his fall disappeared that wild phantom of liberty
                    which had deceived Petrarch.</p>
                <p>Scarcely a year had elapsed when the poet had to bewail a loss still more
                    painful. Laura was no more. The pestilence of 1348, which Boccacio has described
                    with such terrible truth, and which desolated all Europe, had carried her off on
                    the 6th of April that year, on the same day, in the same month, and at the same
                    hour, in which her lover had seen her for the first time. The last half of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Canzoniere</hi> is an immortal monument of the long regret of
                    Petrarch. But although his verses had not made us aware of the sincerity of his
                    grief for his mistress, the touching note which he inscribed upon his copy of
                    Virgil would still attest the profane homage which he paid to her memory.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The authenticity of this note
                    is still disputed by those who wish to overturn the whole history of Laura. Mr
                    Whyte, a learned Englishman, who discovered at Florence an inedited life of
                    Petrarch, written soon after his death, by Luigi Peruzzi, who had known him,
                    also rejects the evidence of this note. But it is written in a tone which ought
                    to silence incredulity, because feigned emotions never bear the stamp of nature
                    and reality. The Virgil of Petrarch has long been in the royal collection at
                    Paris.</p></note> Yielding to the repeated instances of Luigi Conrado, lord of
                    Mantua, Petrarch now repaired to his princely residence, in the hope of finding
                    consolation in the native country of the most sensitive and affecting of all
                    poets; and it was during his stay there that he addressed to the Emperor Charles
                    IV. an eloquent letter, in which he exhorted him to restore peace to Italy. The
                    publication of the jubilee in 1350 drew almost all Christian Europe to Rome.
                    Petrarch, participating in this pious impulse, set out for Rome, and in passing
                    through Florence, visited Boccacio, one of those whom he had particularly
                    noticed at the court of Naples, and who now became his friend. At Rome he found
                    the jubilee commenced, and this grand and consoling solemnity made a deep
                    impression on his mind. His habits became more grave, his manners more austere;
                    and from this time his thoughts assumed a character of severity, the impress of
                    which is visible in his later compositions. At the same time he everywhere
                    received honours which had never before been bestowed on any private individual.
                    The principal citizens of Arezzo conducted him with pride to the house where he
                    was born, assuring him that nothing had been changed in it; and, in fact, the
                    town had obliged the proprietors, into whose hands this house had passed, to pay
                    the most religious respect to the place consecrated by his birth.</p>
                <p>The friendship of the Carraras having induced Petrarch to visit Padua, he had
                    scarcely arrived when Boccacio came to announce to him, in the name of the
                    senate of Florence, that he had been re-established in his rights as a citizen,
                    as well as in the patrimony of his family, and also to offer him the
                    directorship of the university recently founded in the first city of Tuscany.
                    This honourable appointment, however, had no attraction for Petrarch. His books
                    awaited him in his transalpine Parnassus, as he called Vaucluse; and his
                    cisalpine Parnassus was his house at Parma. He accordingly declined accepting
                    the proffered appointment, and hastened to bury himself in his favourite
                    retreat. At this time Rome, filled with robberies and assassinations, occupied
                    all the pontifical solicitude, with a view to repress these disorders; and
                    Clement VI. invoked the counsels of Petrarch respecting the measures most proper
                    to be adopted. Petrarch, however, replied like a poet rather than a counsellor.
                    He spoke of the ancient rights of the Roman people, of excluding strangers from
                    public offices, of restoring to the senate its dignity, and declared that he saw
                    no safety except in the establishment of the republic upon the principles of
                    equality and justice. About the same time, Rienzi, having fallen into the hands
                    of the emperor, was delivered up to the pope, and brought before a judicial
                    commission, against the legality of which he vehemently protested. It is said
                    that Petrarch wrote to the Roman people, warmly exhorting them to interpose in
                    favour of his old friend; and, in fact, this exhortation is found in his works.
                    But there is nothing to show that it was sent according to its address; on the
                    contrary, almost every circumstance leads us to believe that his imagination
                    alone had prompted him to write this letter, rather to console than to save
                    Rienzi. Nevertheless, from a superstition indicative at once of the ignorance
                    and the knowledge of a semi-barbarous age, those judges, so impatient to punish
                    a factious chief whom they believed unworthy of the ordinary benefit of the law,
                    hesitated as soon as they learned that he was a poet, and feared to condemn a
                    man belonging to an order which Cicero had pronounced “sacred.” But the peril of
                    the modern Gracchus was not the only vexation which Petrarch experienced. The
                    physicians by whom the pope was surrounded, and whose ridiculous ignorance he
                    had denounced to the holy father, combined against him. To suppose himself
                    wounded by arrows which fell short of their mark, was no doubt an error on the
                    part of the poet, and, under its influence, he humbled himself so far as to
                    borrow the arms of his adversaries, in order to repel their attacks.</p>
                <p>On his return to Vaucluse, that tranquil retreat inspired him with an answer more
                    worthy of himself. This was his Epistle to Posterity, in which he gives an
                    account of the principal events of his life, until his departure from Italy,
                    about the middle of the year 1351.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Epistle to Posterity was written in 1352, and not in 1372.</p></note> Some
                    months afterwards, Innocent VI. was called to the government of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193495338" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5338-0327"/> church; a man of
                    an irreproachable life, but of little knowledge, and the only pontiff from whom
                    Petrarch did not receive some mark of favour. The poet, after having twice,
                    under Clement IV. refused the office of apostolical secretary, was now suspected
                    of magic by his successor, and he took no pains to dispel the prejudices of the
                    new pontiff. His regret for Italy was only increased; and he repassed the Alps,
                    uncertain where to fix his abode, although prepared to adopt as his country any
                    place where he might live in tranquillity and independence. He had long wished
                    to visit Milan, and, on this occasion, he proceeded no farther. Charmed with the
                    reception he met with from a man of power, who knew well how to exhibit himself
                    to the poet in an amiable light, and admitted to the counsels of .John Visconti,
                    Petrarch accepted a mission having for its object to bring about a
                    reconciliation between the republic of Genoa, which had just given itself up to
                    Visconti, and that of Venice, elated by recent and apparently decisive
                    successes. Three years before, Petrarch had endeavoured to prevent a war which
                    presaged long and bloody divisions in Italy. Connected with the Doge Andrea
                    Dandolo, one of the greatest men of this age, in politics, in war, and in
                    letters, the poet appealed to the patriotism of his friend, and the latter
                    replied by praising the eloquence of Petrarch, but without deferring to his
                    counsels. Hence this new attempt proved not more fortunate than the previous
                    one; but events soon showed on which side lay the want of foresight. Venice was
                    reduced to the necessity of purchasing peace; Dandolo died of grief, and
                    Visconti survived him little more than a month. Nevertheless, after a silence of
                    three years, the emperor replied to the letter in which Petrarch had called upon
                    him to restore peace to his country, an appeal which he had several times
                    renewed. But the avarice of Charles IV. furnished a more powerful motive to
                    appear in Lombardy than the patriotic addresses of Petrarch. By his orders, the
                    poet proceeded to meet him at Mantua, full of confidence in his wisdom, and
                    hoping that, as the friend of the Holy See, he would for ever banish from Italy
                    the names of Guelf and Ghibelin, which had caused the effusion of so much blood,
                    and fomented such fierce animosities. But in this monarch he discovered Only a
                    weak and avaricious prince, who mistook treachery for talent, and exhibited the
                    strange spectacle of an emperor of Germany in the pay of the Venetians. The poet
                    presented him with some rare and valuable medals of Augustus, of Trajan, and the
                    Antonines. “These,” said he, “are the great men whose place you occupy, and who
                    ought to be your models.” During eight days which he spent in familiar
                    intercourse with the emperor, Petrarch discovered the mean, narrow, and
                    grovelling character of his mind, and refused to enter Rome in his train, or to
                    be a witness of his coronation. He then attached himself more than ever to the
                    nephews of John Visconti, whom the emperor had loudly menaced, with the view of
                    enhancing the price to be afterwards exacted for confirming them in the
                    usurpations of their uncle. At this period, the public hatred had accused them
                    of fratricide. Petrarch, afflicted with a rumour which he could not believe,
                    repaired to Pavia, where he was employed by Galeas, a friend of letters, to
                    dissuade Charles IV. from undertaking a new expedition beyond the Alps. "This
                    embassy proved more successful than the former, apparently because the
                    proceedings of the malcontents in Germany had produced a change in the versatile
                    policy of the emperor. On his return to Milan, the ambassador received from him
                    the diploma of Count Palatine, in a gold box of considerable value. Petrarch
                    accepted this new honour, but returned the box to the chancellor of the
                    empire.</p>
                <p>Fatigued with the agitation of courts, the poet now fixed upon a new retreat on
                    the banks of the river Adda, in a pretty country-house, which he called
                    Linterno, in honour of his hero Scipio. Literary projects and researches,
                    religious exercises, and frequent visits to the charterhouse of Milan, now
                    occupied his leisure. All the great lords of Italy had disputed with pontiffs
                    and kings the honour of his presence and conversation. But a goldsmith of
                    Bergamo, named Capra, solicited and obtained a sort of preference. At the
                    approach of Petrarch all Bergamo went out to meet him, whilst Capra received him
                    with a magnificence almost royal, and proved by his enthusiasm, not less than by
                    the number and quality of his books, that he was worthy of his guest. In 1360 a
                    new diplomatic mission led Petrarch to France, whither he went to compliment
                    King John on the recovery of his liberty; and this prince, who had formerly made
                    vain attempts to prevent his return to Italy, now renewed his efforts to retain
                    him. But the envoy of Galeas returned to Milan, without suffering himself to be
                    moved either by the presents of the monarch or by the entreaties of the dauphin;
                    and those of the emperor, backed by the transmission of a gold cup of curious
                    workmanship, found him equally inflexible. But never had a residence in Italy
                    presented fewer attractions. The foreign companies who infested that land of
                    discord, forced him to seek an asylum at Padua, whence he was soon afterwards
                    expelled by the pestilence. He proceeded to Venice, accompanied with his books,
                    which he always carried along with him, and, on his arrival, he presented his
                    library to that hospitable republic, by a writing dated in 1362, on condition
                    that so rare a collection should neither be divided nor sold. By a decree of the
                    senate, a palace was assigned for the reception of Petrarch and his books; and
                    it is, doubtless, this circumstance which has made him be regarded as the
                    original founder of the celebrated library of St Mark.<note anchored="true"

                    mistaken in supposing that all these manuscripts had perished. Tomasini, who
                    made a search for them in the year 1635, discovered them in a small dark
                    chamber, situated near the four bronze horses; and there they remained until the
                    year 1739, when permission was at length given to the public to consult
                    them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Several of these

                    Petrarcha Redivivus (p. 65), gives a list of those which, in 1635, were found in
                    good condition. Amongst these he remarked a Polyglot Vocabulary in Latin,
                    Persian, and Turkish {Comanicum), written in the year 1303, of which he
                    transcribed a small specimen.</p><p>Morelli, in the work already referred to,
                    gives a detail of several of these manuscripts, which are still to be seen in
                    the library of St Mark, and accounts for the oblivion into which they had been
                    allowed to fall during so long a period, from the enthusiasm which the
                    acquisition of the Greek manuscripts of Cardinal Bessarion excited in the
                    fifteenth century.</p></note></p>
                <p>This residence at Venice, indeed, is doubly memorable in the life of Petrarch. It
                    was here that, when driven by the plague from Florence, Boccacio came to share
                    his asylum, and presented to him Leontius Pilatus of Thessalonica, who was then
                    teaching him Greek. The lover of Laura had formerly studied that language under
                    Barlaam, a monk, the ambassador of the Emperor Andronicus to Benedict XII., but
                    he had studied it only in the dialogues of Plato; and, from the short stay of
                    the monk at the court of Avignon, there is some reason to believe that, under
                    Barlaam, he learned more Platonism than Greek. But however this may have been,
                    he availed himself of the opportunity thus afforded him to resume the study of
                    that language; and though now past sixty, he found, even in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193495351" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5351-0328"/>difficulties which opposed
                    his progress, sufficient enjoyment to mitigate the affliction caused by the loss
                    of many valued friends. It was the fortune of Petrarch to survive all those whom
                    he loved. In the course of fifteen years, death had deprived him of Cardinal
                    John Colonna, James of Carrara, lord of Padua, and several other friends who
                    were not less dear to him, but who are now less known; and this second
                    pestilence bereft him of almost all those who remained, particularly of Azon de
                    Corregio, and two other gentlemen who had shared with him the friendship of the
                    Bishop of Lombez, and who are so often mentioned in his letters under the names
                    of Laelius and Scipio. His grief was profound, and, under the depression it
                    occasioned, he became more sensitive to the criticisms which, notwithstanding
                    his reputation, were freely made on his Latin eclogues, and on some parts of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Africa.</hi> It was then that the poet wept over his laurels,
                    and, in the bitterness of a wounded spirit, confessed that his crown had been to
                    him a crown of thorns.</p>
                <p>The homage which was paid to him at Venice might, however, have afforded him some
                    consolation, had not a new revolt in the island of Candia created serious alarm
                    in the mother country. The senate, confiding in the military reputation and
                    experience of Luchino del Verme, a Milanese general, the friend of Petrarch,
                    appointed him to the command of the expedition fitted out against the rebels;
                    and the poet consented to support the application made by the doge to that
                    officer. Luchino put down the insurrection; and Petrarch had a place assigned
                    him, on the right hand of the doge, at the equestrian games which were
                    celebrated, in the ma'nner of the ancients, in honour of this victory. Urban V.,
                    a virtuous and enlightened pontiff, now attempted to recall the poet to his
                    court, by conferring upon him a canonship at Carpentras; a favour which he
                    repaid by urging the holy father, in a long and vehement letter, to put an end
                    to celibacy in the Roman Catholic church. Meanwhile, the cry of hatred raised
                    everywhere against the Visconti had armed against them the new pontiff, and with
                    him the half of Italy, now menaced by their ambition. Much less alarmed at this
                    danger, however, than apprehensive of a war which would expose his country to
                    the ravages of a foreign soldiery, Petrarch was employed by Galeas Visconti to.
                    endeavour to avert the storm; and this, which proved the last, was also the most
                    fruitless of all his missions. But the warmth with which he defended the
                    Visconti family in no degree diminished the favour he enjoyed at Rome. Urban
                    wished to see him; and Petrarch was preparing to respond to an invitation
                    conceived in terms the most urgent and flattering, when he was seized with a
                    terrible malady at Ferrara. But though saved by the care of the Este family, who
                    governed that country, he did not recover sufficient strength to continue his
                    journey; and having returned to Padua, reclining upon a couch in a boat, he
                    established himself four leagues from that city, at the village of Arqua,
                    situated in the Euganean hills, so celebrated by the Romans for the salubrity of
                    the air, the richness of the pasturages, and the beauty of the orchards. There
                    the poet resumed, with his labours, all the imprudence of his usual course of
                    life. Employing at once as many as five secretaries, he exhausted himself with
                    austerities, restricted himself to a single repast composed of fruits or pulse,
                    abstained from wine, fasted often, and, on days of abstinence, allowed himself
                    only bread and water. An unforeseen event also served to retard his
                    convalescence. Urban V., preferring the peaceful abode of Avignon to the
                    tumultuous agitations of Rome, had returned to die in France. He was succeeded
                    by Gregory XI., who, equally well affected towards Petrarch, chose, as his
                    legate in Italy, Philip de Cabassole, now cardinal and archbishop of Jerusalem.
                    But this prelate died soon after reaching Perugia, and Petrarch never more
                    beheld the beloved friend of his youth. The poet, however, appeared to revive on
                    receiving a libel published by a French monk against his letter of
                    congratulation to Pope Urban, and he once more humbled himself so far as to
                    reply to an invective by abuse.</p>
                <p>Francesco de Carrara, abandoned by his allies, had just concluded a humiliating
                    peace with Venice. Being obliged to send his son to ask pardon and swear
                    fidelity to the republic, he entreated Petrarch to accompany the youth, and
                    address the senate in his behalf. Though sick and old, the poet only recollected
                    his ancient friendship for the lords of Padua, and repaired with young Carrara
                    to Venice. The day after their arrival they had an audience; but the old man,
                    overcome with fatigue, and perhaps awed by the majesty of the assembly, could
                    not utter a word. The following day, however, he took courage, and his harangue
                    was warmly applauded. But this effort proved his last; it was the song of the
                    swan when dying. He returned to Arqua, feeble, exhausted, and as indocile to the
                    counsels of physicians as ever. Boccacio, who now seemed to supply the place of
                    all the friends he had lost, having sent him the Decameron, which had just been
                    completed, Petrarch read it with enthusiasm; got by heart the novel of
                    Griseldis, which he translated into Latin; and transmitted to Boccacio this
                    version, accompanied with a letter, which appears to have been the last he ever
                    wrote. On the 18th of July 1374, he was found dead in his library, with his head
                    resting upon an open book, an attack of apoplexy having seized him <hi
                    rend="subscript"> iι</hi> in that attitude. All Padua came to assist at his
                    obsequies. Francesco de Carrara conducted the funeral ceremonies, attended by
                    the nobility and the people; and the family of the poet caused a mausoleum of
                    marble to be erected to his memory before the gate of the church of Arqua.<note

                    in the life of the poet, the reader will find some curious information in those

                <p>The illustrious subject of this notice was connected with all the celebrated men
                    of the fourteenth century; he took part in almost every event by which that
                    memorable age was distinguished; and in a life so full of trouble and agitation,
                    the only reproach which he incurred constitutes <pb break="no"

                    character. He was born a poet, and always continued so, in his studies, his
                    political missions, his love, his conversation, and his letters. The love of his
                    country was no doubt in him little more than a poetical dream, but it was the
                    dream of his whole life. In the intoxication of glory, as well as in the midst
                    of the most cruel afflictions, ancient Italy was ever present to his thoughts.
                    In the glorious recollections of the past he sought to console himself for the
                    disorders of his own age, and from his worship of antiquity he derived generous
                    inspirations and innocent illusions. That these illusions sometimes misled him
                    in the choice of his friends, cannot reasonably be questioned. His candour
                    exposed him without defence to the calculations of an astute policy, which,
                    masking its real designs under the captivating name of Italy, completed the
                    deception by the interested benefits which it conferred upon letters; but he
                    passed through the courts of the petty Italian tyrants without any one having
                    impeached his character, or cast a shade of suspicion on his memory. His morals
                    were not entirely pure, but they were never corrupt. In his youth he had a
                    natural daughter, near whom he died ’ soon after her marriage; and his son, whom
                    he survived, was cherished with an affection and bewailed with a sorrow that
                    long served to keep alive the regret which the remembrance of his weaknesses had
                    left in his mind. The lover of Laura was impressed with a deep sense of
                    religion; and, amongst the habits of a simple and studious life, it is related
                    that he rose regularly at midnight for prayer. Superior to the pedantry which
                    then and long afterwards clung to learning, this great poet was also an amiable
                    man. His conversation was confiding and animated; his manners were frank and
                    polished. His soul, ardent, but open to all the gentler affections, had a
                    natural craving for friendship, which was to him a necessary of life; and he had
                    many friends, all <hi rend="italic">of</hi> whom appear to have been faithful to
                    him, arid equally swayed by the double authority of his counsel and his example.
                    Boccacio, whose benefactor he had been, and who had previously been little else
                    than a man of pleasure, became irreproachable, if not austere, in bis morals,
                    after his acquaintance with Petrarch. Acciaiuoli, grand seneschal of Naples,
                    having become embroiled with another friend of Petrarch, the latter wrote to
                    both a letter which was only to be opened and read in common, and the
                    consequence was, that they parted mutually reconciled. It was by means of his
                    friends that Petrarch exercised a kind of literary dictatorship in France, in
                    Spain, and in England; it was through his friends that he was enabled to carry
                    on that European correspondence which everywhere rekindled the study and
                    admiration of the ancients. This long supremacy, scarcely disturbed by some
                    clamours which envy had excited, and the honours paid to his memory throughout
                    all Italy, gave a general impulse to the minds of men. He represented in his own
                    person the republic of letters, and bis life forms a grand epoch in their
                    history. The elevation of his character made them be respected by the great;
                    whilst his writings contributed powerfully to purify them from that strange
                    alloy with which ignorance had debased them.</p>
                <p>He studied with diligence alchemy, astrology, scholastic theology, and Aristotle,
                    with his interpreter Averroes, who had then even more authority than the great
                    master before whom philosophy is said to have stood dumb. Even at the time when,
                    by his advice, Galeas Visconti founded the university of Pavia, he himself
                    directed the course of study, and formed the mind of Malpighino, who afterwards
                    became so famous amongst the restorers of letters by the name of John of
                    Ravenna. His letters <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Scriptis Veterum
                    Indagandis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Libris
                    Ciceronis</hi> attest the extent of the researches he made to recover
                    manuscripts of the ancient authors, which he then copied with his own hand, not
                    venturing to intrust them to the ignorance of vulgar scribes. It was thus that
                    he restored to the literary world the Oratorical Institutions of Quinctilian,
                    though incomplete and mutilated, and the letters of Cicero, the manuscript of
                    which is preserved in the Laurentian Library at Florence, with the copy which he
                    had made from it. He equally recovered some of Cicero’s orations which had been
                    lost; and it is further known that he had preserved the famous treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De Gloria;</hi> but having lent it to his master Convennole, this
                    old man sold it for subsistence, and Petrarch afterwards attempted in vain to
                    trace it out, as well as the Antiquities of Varro, which he had seen in his
                    youth, and a book of letters and epigrams ascribed to Augustus. It was he also
                    who first made Sophocles known in Italy; and his avidity for manuscripts had
                    become so generally understood, that he received from Constantinople a complete
                    copy of the poems of Homer, without having even asked for it. After the gift
                    which he made to Venice, as already mentioned, he lost no time in forming
                    another library. In an age when chronology and geography were still unknown, he
                    had made a chronological collection of imperial medals, and got together a very
                    considerable number of geographical charts. He himself was the author of a map
                    of Italy, which continued to be consulted a century after his death; and all his
                    biographers have mentioned his researches respecting the island of Thule. In a
                    word, his name, which is inseparable from those of Dante and Boccacio, would
                    alone be sufficient to refute the assertion, too often repeated, that the
                    revival of letters was a consequence of the capture of Constantinople by the
                    Turks in the year 1453.</p>
                <p>It is no doubt true, that the rest of Europe did not then possess men who had
                    attained the same splendour and universality of fame. France, which had received
                    from her troubadours the oldest modern literature, could only boast of a few
                    learned men; such as Nicoas Oresme, who enjoyed the esteem of Petrarch, but is
                    better known by his translations, and by a discourse in which he denounced to
                    the pope himself the scandals of the pontifical court; and Pierre Berchoire,
                    author of a kind of encyclopaedia, coin-piled in the spirit and style of the
                    schools, and which he appears to have composed at Avignon. King John, and after
                    him Charles V. collected the first volumes of the Royal Library; and Froissart,
                    who by his simple and artless history does so much honour to the literature of
                    France, commenced, under the latter prince, that series of French poets which
                    has never since been interrupted. The praises of Laura diffused amongst the
                    women a taste for Italian poetry; and one lady, whose name still survives in
                    literary history, Justina de Levis, addressed a sonnet to Petrarch, which
                    elicited from his gallantry or judgment warm commendation. Chaucer, who was
                    preparing to found a literature in England, saw him in Italy, and was perhaps
                    indebted to him for the acquaintance of Boccacio, whom he has so frequently
                    imitated in his works. Another Englishman, Richard de Bury, one of the
                    correspondents of Petrarch, founded a library at Oxford, and diffused throughout
                    his country a taste for books. As yet Spain had only her early historical
                    romances, and some theologians; but two centuries later, the poetical admirer of
                    Laura found in Boscan an imitator at the court of Castille, whilst Bembo,
                    Tarsia, Moisa, and many others, opened in Italy the dangerous school of the
                    Petrarchists.</p>
                <p>The Letters of Petrarch, which were printed for the first time in 1484, though
                    without the name of the place, are now regarded as the most curious portion of
                    his Latin works. These letters, which were not written exclusively for his
                    friends, contain valuable details in regard to his life, as well as the manners
                    and the history, literary and political, of the fourteenth ceptury. The court of
                    Avignon is by no means spared; and the author was too good an Italian not in
                    some instances to overcharge a little his portraits. ‘ His <pb break="no"

                    not always natural, and his prose often betrays the poet. His books of moral
                    philosophy somewhat resemble those common-places which were treated by the Greek
                    rhetoricians of the middle age. That which he has entitled Remedies against both
                    kinds of Fortune has for its object to show, that earthly goods are perishable,

                    rend="italic">of</hi> St Augustin appears to have suggested to him the most
                    singular of all his compositions, namely, the three dialogues, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Contemptu</hi><hi rend="italic">Mundi,</hi> to which
                    he attached so much importance as to call them “his secret.” The author communes
                    with St Augustin on his own character, tastes,and weaknesses; he confesses his
                    faults with the simplicity of childhood, and, on the other hand, St Augustin
                    lectures him with an authority tempered by mildness, and a dignity softened by
                    sympathizing benevolence.</p>
                <p>The harangues of Petrarch are not always exempt from declamation, and, more than
                    any of his other productions, betray the influence of the false taste against
                    which he so successfully strove. But his Latin poetry has particular claims to
                    the attention of men of letters. His poem of <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi> has
                    been compared to those pictures and statues, the productions of the infancy of
                    art, which, without augmenting its glory, may be examined with advantage by
                    those who desire to study its progress. It is a detailed recital of the second
                    Punic war, but almost always cold and colourless. It is a chronicle rather than
                    a poem, and appears as if it had been left unfinished. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >mens</hi><hi rend="italic">divinior</hi> is wanting; invention there is none;
                    and we are astonished to find that the poetry of Virgil produced so little
                    inspiration. His eclogues, like those of Boccacio, are almost always satirical
                    allegories, having reference to contemporaneous events. The tenth is consecrated
                    to the memory of Laura. In his three books of Epistles, versified with more
                    facility than might have been expected in that iron age, there are some
                    interesting and instructive details. In fact, the Latin diction of Petrarch,
                    though generally superior to the bald and rude style of his contemporaries, is
                    nevertheless far below that of his models. His composition is vigorous without
                    being harsh, and on some occasions he is deficient neither in elegance nor in
                    energy; but he more frequently reminds us of St Augustin than of Cicero, whom he
                    professed not only to admire, but to imitate. Still, it was on his Latin works
                    that Petrarch founded his claims to distinction as an author; and, what is not a
                    little remarkable, this was also the error of Boccacio. These misjudgments of
                    genius, of which we have examples both in Homer and in Milton, as well as in the
                    two illustrious men we have just named, would form a curious subject of literary
                    speculation, were this the place in which it could with propriety be
                    discussed.</p>
                <p>But Petrarch’s best title to distinction rests upon his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canzoniere.</hi> It is there that he shows himself truly inspired, and displays
                    in profusion all the riches of his original genius. The ancient erotic poets,
                    strangers to any ennobling sentiment, had celebrated pleasure rather than love.
                    That respect for women which had so long existed amongst the nations of the
                    North; that worship of beauty, ennobled by the still recent recollections of
                    chivalry; those feats of valour which were days of triumph to the ladies; all
                    this was wanting to pagan society. Petrarch, therefore, stands alone, because
                    his passion resembled nothing which the ancients had known. The early songs of
                    the troubadours had embodied the natural expression of the manners of chivalry.
                    The examples which they had presented, the traditions which they had left, as
                    well as the unfortunate refinements of the Italians, their imitators, and the
                    idle subtleties of the courts of love, a sad parody of the forms, and often of
                    the obscurities, of the schools, had created amongst the moderns a language to
                    which rhyme added its shackles; a language which was no longer the vulgar
                    language, but yet was not that of poetry. To this the lover of Laura imparted
                    all that the superiority of his genius had taught him. We have seen that he had
                    studied Plato. But although his mind had, unaided, divined the disciple of
                    Socrates, yet that union of souls which the philosopher had sometimes dreamed of
                    was as remote from the sentiment which inspired Petrarch as the domestic manners
                    of the Greeks differed from those of the fourteenth century. It was not Platonic
                    love which had animated the poet; it was love such as Christianity and chivalry
                    had made it. This love, which the corruption of our age has pronounced
                    supernatural, is poetical in a very different sense from that which inspired
                    Propertius and Ovid. It no doubt wants movement and variety; but it has a true
                    and penetrating warmth, an elevation which rises to the sublime, and a purity
                    which has in it something almost celestial. Petrarch was the first, and for a
                    long time the only poet, who made a virtue of love. The Italian, created by
                    Dante, had even after his time retained somewhat of that harshness which is
                    still apt to shock the reader in some parts of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inferno.</hi> Petrarch formed for himself a language, as Dante had done; his
                    turns of expression are almost as bold; above all, he reproduced those graces of
                    colouring and that delicious harmony with which Dante had related the
                    misfortunes of his Francesea; and, after the publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Canzoniere,</hi> the Italian idiom ceased to have in it any thing
                    barbarous. When we read the verses of Petrarch, we can almost fancy that we hear
                    the sound of his lyre, from which, on every occasion, he extracts sounds of an
                    ineffable sweetness. In the first part, where he celebrates the perfections of
                    Laura, his expression becomes dreamy or ecstatic; in the second, where he
                    laments his mistress, his song has a solemn and penetrating accent. Sometimes he
                    lends his lute to chant the lessons of philosophy; at other times it is the
                    Hebrew harp resounding the maledictions of the prophets, or a Roman muse
                    bewailing the debasement and misfortunes of her country. Those who <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193495390" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5390-0331"/> love comparisons
                    and coincidences have remarked, that the sonnets, from their form, remind us of
                    some of the smaller odes of Horace, and, for grace as well as simplicity of
                    details, recall the manner of the poet of Teos. For this kind of poetry Petrarch
                    was indebted to his predecessors; but it was he who rendered these little poems
                    more perfect and more difficult; and the laws which his example prescribed have
                    not yet been abrogated.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Canzoni</hi> of Petrarch, which have been improperly
                    rendered <hi rend="italic">Chansοηs</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">yy</hi> Voltaire,
                    are odes the form of which he borrowed from the troubadours, whilst to the
                    substance he imparted the elevation and dignity of epic composition. The
                    Italians have exhausted all the prescriptive terms of admiration upon those
                    which Petrarch appears to have preferred, and which he called the Three Sisters,
                    odes which his commentators have since named the Three Graces. The eyes of Laura
                    form the subject of these three odes, which are the eighteenth, nineteenth, and
                    twentieth of the collection. But whatever may be the perfection of style for
                    which they are distinguished, a reader of the present day will always find
                    difficulty in comprehending the long literary superstition of which they have
                    been the object. Graver readers will no doubt prefer the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canzone</hi> on the crusade, which is the fifth in the collection, and that
                    magnificent ode, so truly national, in which the poet retraces, <hi
                    rend="italic">en traits de feu,</hi> the oppression of his beloved Italy, and
                    shows her bleeding and mutilated, yet still full of glory, and capable of
                    recovering from her wounds; compositions so little known to those superficial
                    <hi rend="italic">litterateurs</hi> who have mistaken a man of the
                    greatest⅛enius, who formed a language and created a literature, for á mere
                    grinder of madrigals. All those who know the language of Petrarch have cited,
                    amongst the monuments of his love, the celebrated sonnets,</p>
                <p>Solo e pensoso i più deserti campi</p>
                <p>Vo misurando a passi tardi e lenti; E gli occhi porto, per fuggire, intenti Dove
                    vestigio uman la rena stampi, being the twenty-eighth of the first part; and</p>
                <p>Levommi il mio pensier in parte ov’era Quella ch’ io cerco e non ritrovo in
                    terra: Ivi fra lor che ’ 1 terzo cerchio serra, La rividi più bella, e meno
                    altera, which is the thirty-fourth of the second part; besides many other <hi
                    rend="italic">Canzoni</hi> not less admired, amongst which it would be difficult
                    to make a selection. We shall only refer our readers to the twenty-seventh, the
                    first strophe of which has been so happily imitated by Voltaire. The latter,
                    however, has not been equally fortunate in his judgment of Petrarch; and
                    Sismondi, without indulging in the same levity, has shown himself almost equally
                    severe. But the monotony with which Petrarch has been reproached is perhaps
                    rather a defect inherent in the particular species than one peculiar to the
                    poet. The lover of Laura bewails himself, since complain he must, and this
                    eternal lamentation is without doubt sometimes fatiguing; but love rejoices in
                    such repetitions; and Petrarch has varied as much as possible this uniformity,
                    by pictures of rustic life full of natural grace and simplicity, or by high and
                    ennobling religious contemplations. We do not say, however, that his poems, and
                    especially his sonnets, have escaped all tincture of the prevailing taste of his
                    age. On the contrary, he is often more ingenious than natural, and more
                    elaborate than correct; but a re-perusal of the second half of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Canzomere,</hi> which is very generally preferred to the first,
                    must satisfy any reader that nothing short of extreme injustice or inveterate
                    prejudice can construe into a mere play of words or sport of ingenuity a grief
                    which is stamped with all the characteristics of truth, deep feeling, and
                    sincerity.</p>
                <p>The most complete edition of the works of Petrarch is that of Basel, 1581, in
                    folio, which wants only a certain number of Letters, comprised in that of
                    Geneva, 1601. The most ancient edition of his Latin works also bears the name of
                    Basel, where it appeared in 1496, in folio. But it is in the libraries of Italy
                    that his Letters and his Autograph Manuscripts must be sought for. The treatise
                    De Remediis utriusque Fortunae was printed at Cologne, 1471, in 4to, and has
                    been thrice translated into French; and the historical work entitled Vite de <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Pontefici et Impera-dori Romani, which has now become
                    exceedingly scarce, appeared at Florence, 1478, in folio, and is still much
                    sought after, as one of the most ancient monuments of Italian prose. In later
                    times, his Italian poems alone have bech reprinted. The first edition,
                    containing the Sonetti and the Trionfi, is that of Venice, 1470, in large 4to.
                    Amongst the subsequent editions, the most esteemed are, 1. Le Cose Volgari, by
                    Aldus Manutius, Venice, 1501, in 8vo; 2. Il Petrarca, Lyons, 1574, in 16to; 3.
                    Le Rime di Petrarca, Padua, 1722, in 8vo; 4. A reprint of the same, with notes
                    by Muratori, Venice, 1727, in 4to; 5. The editions of Bodoni, 1799, in two vols.
                    folio and 8vo; 6. That of Morelli, the librarian, with Remarks by Beccadelli,
                    Verona, 1799, in two small vols. 8vo; 7. That which forms part of the Biblioteca
                    Poetica Italiana, published by But-tura, and printed by Didot the elder, Paris,
                    in three small vols.; and, 8. The edition, with Commentaries, published by
                    Biagioli in 1822, in 8vo. Petrarch is said to have been the subject of
                    twenty-five distinct biographies, exclusive of the sketches of his life given in
                    collections. Of these lives, the most copious, though by no means the most
                    accurate, is that of the Abbé de Sade; and as to Lord Woodhouselee’s Historical
                    and Critical Essay on the Life and Character of Petrarch, published in 1810,
                    Lord Byron has dryly remarked, “Thanks to the critical acumen of a Scotchman, we
                    know as little of Laura as ever.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
