                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Plastic</hi><hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi> a certain power,
                    by which, as an instrument, many philosophers, both ancient and modern, supposed
                    that the great motions in the corporeal world, and the various processes of
                    generation and corruption, were perpetually carried on.</p>
                <p>Amongst the philosophers of Greece, such a power was almost universally admitted.
                    It seems, indeed, to have been rejected only by the followers of Democritus and
                    Epicurus, who talk as if they had thought gravity essential to matter, and the
                    fortuitous motion of atoms, which they held to have been from eternity the
                    source, not only of all the regular motions in the universe, but also of the
                    organization of all corporeal systems, and even of sensation and intellection in
                    brutes and in men. It is needless to say, that those men, whatever they might
                    profess, were in reality atheists; and Democritus, it is universally known,
                    avowed his disbelief of a God.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the philosophers who held the existence of a plastic nature,
                    considered it not as an agent in the strict sense of the word, but merely as an
                    instrument in the hand of the Deity; although even amongst them there were some
                    who held no superior power, and were of course as gross atheists as Democritus
                    himself. Such was Strato of Lampsacus, a man originally of the peripatetic
                    school, over which he presided many years, with no small degree of reputation
                    for learning and eloquence. He was the first and chief asserter of what has been
                    termed <hi rend="italic">līylo-zoic Atheism</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a
                    system which admits of no power superior to a certain natural or plastic life,
                    essential, ungenerated, and incorruptible, inherent in matter, but without sense
                    and consciousness. That such was his doctrine we learn from Cicero, who makes
                    Velleius the Epicurean say, “Nec audiendus Strato qui Physicus appellatur, qui
                    omnem vim divinam in Natura sitam esse censet, quae causas gignendi, augendi,
                    minuendive habeat, sed careat omni sensu.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Natura Deornm, lib. i. cap. 13.</p></note> That Strato, in
                    admitting this plastic principle, differed very widely from Democritus, is
                    apparent from the following account of him by the same author: “Strato
                    Lampsacenus negat opera deorum se uti ad fabricandum mundum; quaecunque sint,
                    docet omnia esse effecta naturae, nec ut ille, qui asperis, et levibus, et
                    hamatis uncinatisque corporibus concreta haec esse dicat, interjecta inani;
                    somnia censet haec esse Democriti, non docentis sed optantis.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Qnoest. Acad. lib. iv. cap.
                    38.</p></note></p>
                <p>That the rough and smooth, the hooked and crooked, atoms of Democritus, were
                    indeed dreams and dotages, is a position which no man will controvert; but
                    surely Strato was himself as great a dreamer when he made sensation and
                    intelligence result from a certain plastic or spermatic life in matter, which is
                    itself devoid of sense and consciousness. To use the emphatic language of
                    Cudworth, it is indeed inconceivable “how any one in his senses should admit
                    such a monstrous paradox as this, that every atom of dust has in itself as much
                    wisdom as the greatest politician and most profound philosopher, and yet is
                    neither conscious nor intelligent.” It is likewise to be observed of Strato,
                    that though he attributed a certain kind of life to matter, he by no means
                    allowed of one common life as ru.- ing over the whole material universe. He
                    supposed the several parts of matter to have so many several plastic lives of
                    their own, and appears<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    have attributed something to chance in the production and preservation of the
                    mundane system.</p>
                <p>In denying the existence of a God, perpetually directing his plastic principle,
                    and in supposing as many of these principles as there are atoms of matter,
                    Strato deviated far from the doctrine of Aristotle. The great founder of the
                    peripatetic school, as well as his apostate disciple, taught that mundane things
                    are not effected by fortuitous mechanism, but by such a nature as acts regularly
                    and artificially for certain ends; yet he never considers this nature as the
                    highest principle, or supreme <hi rend="italic">Numen,</hi> but as subordinate
                    to a perfect mind or intellect; and he expressly affirms, that “mind, together
                    with nature, formed or fashioned this universe.” He evidently considers mind as
                    the principal and intelligent agent, and nature as the subservient and executive
                    instrument. Indeed, we are strongly inclined to adopt the opinion of Mosheim,
                    who thinks that by nature Aristotle meant nothing more than that <hi
                    rend="italic">ϑ</hi><hi rend="italic">εgμοτης</hi><hi rend="italic">ψ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">υχικη,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">animal heat,</hi> to which he
                    attributes immortality, and of which he expressly says<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>De Generatione Animalium, lib. üi. c.
                    11.</p></note> that all things are full. Be this as it may, he always joins
                    together God and nature, and affirms that they do nothing in vain. The same
                    doctrine was taught before him by Plato, who affirms that “nature, together with
                    reason, and according to it, orders all things.” It must not, however, be
                    concealed, that Plato seems to have attributed intelligence to the principle by
                    which he supposed the world to be animated; for Chalcidius, commenting on the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tirnaeus,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Sect 53.</p></note> thus expresses himself: “Haec est illa
                    rationabilis anima mundi, quae gemina juxta meliorem naturam veneratione tutelam
                    praebet inferioribus, divinis dispositionibus obsequens, providentiam nativis
                    impertiens, aeter-norum similitudine propter cognationem beata.” Apuleius, too,
                    tells us,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>De Dogmate
                    Platonis.</p></note> “Illam coelestem animam, fontem animarum omnium, optimam

                <p>The doctrine of Plato has been adopted by many moderns of greateminence both for
                    genius and for learning. Thecelebrated Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne, after
                    describing Plato’s <hi rend="italic">anima</hi><hi rend="italic">mundi,</hi>

                    was not read only, but studied also with care, and made his own interpreter, I
                    believe the prejudice that now lies against him would soon wear off, or be even
                    converted into high esteem, for those exalted notions, and fine hints, that
                    sparkle and shine throughout his writings<pb break="no" facs="nls:193501461"

                    learning of Athens and Greece, but also a treasure of the most remote traditions
                    and early science of the east.” Cudworth, and the learned author of Ancient
                    Metaphysics, are likewise strenuous advocates for the Aristotelian doctrine of a
                    plastic nature diffused throughout the material world; and a notion very similar
                    occurred to a subsequent writer, who does not appear to have borrowed it either
                    from the Lyceum or the Academy.</p>
                <p>This writer is Mr Young, of whose <hi rend="italic">active substance,</hi> and
                    its agency in moving bodies, some account has elsewhere been given (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Motion).</hi> As a mere unconscious agent, immaterial, and, as
                    he expresses himself, immental, it bears a striking resemblance to the plastic
                    nature or vegetable life of Cudworth. But the author holds it to be not only the
                    principle of motion, but also the basis or substratum of matter itself; in the
                    production of which, by certain motions, it may be said to be more strictly
                    plastic than the hylarchical principle, or <hi rend="italic">vis</hi><hi

                    have any acquaintance. Though this opinion be singular, yet as its author is
                    evidently a man who thinks for himself, unawed by the authority of celebrated
                    names, and as one great part of the utility of such works as ours consists in
                    their serving as indices to science and literature, we shall lay before our
                    readers a short abstract of the reasonings by which Mr Young endeavours to
                    support his hypothesis, and we shall take the liberty of remarking upon those
                    reasonings as we proceed.</p>
                <p>The author, after a short introduction, enters upon his work,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An Essay on the Powers and
                    Mechanism of Nature.</p></note> in a chapter entitled Analysis of Matter in
                    general. In that chapter there is little novelty. He treats, as others have
                    done, of primary and secondary qualities, and adheres too closely to the
                    language of Locke, when he says, that “the nature of bodies signifies the
                    aggregate of all those ideas with which they furnish us, and by which they are
                    made known.” To say the best of it, this sentence is inaccurately expressed. An
                    aggregate of ideas may be occasioned by the impulse of bodies on the organs of
                    sense, but the effect of impulse cannot be that which impels. We should not have
                    made this remark, which may perhaps be deemed captious, were we not persuaded
                    that the vague and inaccurate use of terms is the source of those mistakes into
                    which we cannot help thinking that the very ingenious author has sometimes
                    fallen. Having justly observed that we know nothing directly of bodies but their
                    qualities, he proceeds to investigate the nature of solidity.</p>
                <p>“Solidity,” he says, “is the quality of body which principally requires our
                    notice. It is that which fills extension, and which resists other solids,
                    occupying the place which it occupies; thus making extension and figure real,
                    and different from mere space and vacuity. If the secondary qualities of bodies,
                    or their powers variously to affect our senses, depend on their primary
                    qualities, it is chiefly on this of solidity; which is therefore the most
                    important of the primary qualities, and that in which the essence of body is by
                    some conceived to consist. This idea of solidity has been judged to be incapable
                    of any analysis; but it appears evident to me,” continues our author, “that the
                    idea of solidity may be resolved into another idea, which is that of the power
                    of resisting within the extension of body. Hence it becomes unnecessary, and
                    even inadmissible, to suppose that solidity in the body is at all a pattern or
                    archetype of our sensation.”</p>
                <p>That solidity in the body, and we know nothing of solidity anywhere else, is no
                    pattern of any sensation of ours, is indeed most true, as we have shown at large
                    in another place (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics)</hi>; but to reconcile
                    this with what our author asserts immediately afterwards, that “solidity is no
                    more in bodies than colours and flavours are, and that it is equally with them a
                    sensation and an idea,” would be a task to which our ingenuity is by no means
                    equal. He affirms, indeed, that solidity, as it is said to be in bodies, is
                    utterly incomprehensible; that we can perfectly comprehend it as a sensation in
                    ourselves, but that in bodies nothing more is required than a power of active
                    resistance to make upon our senses those impressions from which we infer the
                    reality of primary and secondary qualities. This power of resistance, whether it
                    ought to be called active or passive, we apprehend to be that which all other
                    philosophers have meant by the word <hi rend="italic">solidity</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and though Locke, who uses the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >idea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">notion</hi> indiscriminately, often talks of
                    the idea of solidity, we believe our author to be the first writer who has
                    thought of treating solidity as a sensation in the mind.</p>
                <p>Though it is wrong to innovate in language, when writing on subjects which
                    require much attention, we must, however, acknowledge it to be unworthy of
                    inquirers after truth to dispute about the proper or improper use of terms, so
                    long as the meaning of him who employs them can be easily discovered. We shall,
                    therefore, follow our author in his endeavours to ascertain what this power of
                    resistance is which is commonly known by the name of solidity. All power he
                    justly holds to be active; and having, by an argument<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“λV e can only conceive of solidity as being
                    a resistance of the parts of any body, to a power which endeavours to separate
                    them, or to bring them nearer together. Now that which resists any power, and
                    prevents its effect, is also a power. By resistance, 1 mean here an active
                    resistance, such as an animal can employ against an animal. If a horse pulls
                    against a load, he draws it along; but if he draws against another horse, he is
                    put to a stand, and his endeavour is defeated. When any endeavour to change the
                    situation of the parts of any solid is in like manner prevented from taking
                    effect, and the parts retain their situation, the situation has plainly been
                    preserved by an active resistance or power, equivalent to that which was
                    fruitlessly exerted on them.”</p><p>Such is our author’s reasoning to prove that
                    matter is essentially active, and that from this activity results our notion of
                    its solidity; but does he not here confound solidity with hardness, and
                    impenetrability with cohesion? He certainly does; for water is as solid, in the
                    proper sense of the word, as adamant, and the particles of air as the particles
                    of iron. The parts of water are, indeed, separated with ease, and those of
                    adamant with difficulty; but it is not because the latter have more solidity
                    than the former, but because the power of cohesion, whatever it may be, operates
                    upon them with greater force. Solidity is an attribute of a whole; hardness and
                    softness result from the cohesion of parts. We do not at all perceive the
                    propriety of the simile of the horse pulling a load, and afterwards pulling
                    against another horse. Is it because both horses are active that one of them
                    cannot prevail against the other, and because the load is inactive that either
                    of them may drag along a mass of iron of half a ton weight? If so, double or
                    triple the mass, and a very strange phenomenon will be the result; for we shall
                    have an active whole compounded of two or three inactive parts, even .though
                    those parts should not be in contact.</p></note> of which we do not perceive the

                    same place with itself, he naturally enough infers matter to be essentially
                    active. “But the activity of matter is to be considered in a certain limited
                    sense, and its inertness is to be regarded in another limited sense; so that
                    these are compatible within their respective limits. The activity of body may be
                    considered as belonging to the parts of a compound; its inertia as the inertia
                    formed of those parts. The actions of the parts are everywhere opposed to each
                    other, and equal; and hence results the inactivity of the whole.”</p>
                <p>Solidity alone of the primary qualities being positive, and peculiar to bodies,
                    and our author having resolved this into <hi rend="italic">action</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">power,</hi> it follows, by his analysis, that the <hi
                    rend="italic">essence</hi> of <hi rend="italic">body</hi> is reduced to power
                    likewise. But, as he properly observes, power is an idea of reflection, not
                    acquired by the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501474" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1474-0799"
                    />senses, but suggested by thought. Hence our knowledge of real existence in
                    body must be such as is suggested to us by our thoughts exercised about our
                    sensations. “We are capable of acting and producing changes in appearances; and
                    this faculty, which we experience to exist in ourselves, we call power. We are
                    conscious of the exertion of our own power; and, therefore, when we see <hi
                    rend="italic">action</hi> or <hi rend="italic">change</hi> happen without any
                    exertion of ours, we refer this to other powers without us, and necessarily
                    conclude the power to exist where the change begins or the action is exerted.
                    This power, then, referred to bodies, must exist in them, or it can exist
                    nowhere.”</p>
                <p>In two chapters, which might easily have been compressed into one not so long as
                    the shortest of them, our author analyses atoms or the primary particles of
                    matter, and strenuously opposes their impenetrability. He allows that there are
                    atoms of matter not divisible by any known force; but as these, however small,
                    must still be conceived as having extension, each of them must be composed of
                    parts held together by the same power which binds together many atoms in the
                    same body. This power, indeed, he acknowledges to operate much more forcibly
                    when it cements the parts of a primary atom, than when it makes many atoms
                    cohere in one mass; but still it operates in the same manner; and as the ideal
                    analysis may be carried on <hi rend="italic">in infinitum,</hi> the only
                    possible idea which is suggested by atoms, or the parts of atoms, is the idea of
                    a resisting power. That this power of resistance, which constitutes what is
                    vulgarly called the solidity of bodies, may not be absolutely impenetrable, he
                    attempts to prove, by showing that resistance does in fact take place in cases
                    where impenetrability, and even solidity, are not supposed by any man.</p>
                <p>“Let us endeavour,” says he, “to bring together two like poles of a magnet, and
                    we shall experience a resistance to their approximation. Why, then, may not a
                    piece of iron, which between our fingers resists their coming together, resist
                    by an efficacy perfectly similar, though more strongly exerted? If magnetism
                    were to act upon our bodies as upon iron, we should feel it; or were magnets
                    endowed with sensation, they would fed that which resists their nearer approach.
                    The resisting extension between the two magnets is permeable to all the rays of
                    light, and, reflecting none, is therefore unseen; but it is easy to conceive
                    that the same power which resists the approach of the iron might resist and
                    reflect some rays of light. We should then have a visible object interposed
                    between the two magnets, as we have before supposed it might be a tangible one.
                    It is likewise easy to conceive that which is tangible and visible so applied to
                    our organs of tasting, of smelling, and of hearing, as to excite ideas of
                    flavours, odours, and sounds. Thus we see that an action, in which no
                    supposition of solidity or impenetrability is involved, may be conceived to
                    assume all the qualities of matter, by only supposing a familiar effect extended
                    in its operation.”</p>
                <p>This reasoning is exceedingly ingenious, though perhaps not original; but, what
                    is of more importance, it does not approach so near to demonstration as the
                    author seems to imagine. If magnets operate by means of a fluid issuing from
                    them (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Magnetism),</hi> those who hold the solidity or
                    impenetrability of matter will maintain, that each atom of the magnetic fluid is
                    solid and impenetrable. That we do not see nor feel these atoms, will be
                    considered as no argument that they do not exist; for we do not see, nor in a
                    close room feel, the atoms of the surrounding atmo-. sphere; which yet Mr Young
                    will acknowledge to have a real existence, and to be capable of operating upon
                    our senses of hearing and smelling. Let us, however, suppose that by this
                    reasoning he has established the non-existence of everything in the primary
                    atoms of matter except active powers of resistance, and let us see how he
                    conceives the -actions of these powers to constitute what gives us the notion of
                    inert and solid body; for that we have such a notion cannot be denied.</p>
                <p>To <hi rend="italic">act</hi> he allows to be an attribute, and justly observes,
                    that we cannot conceive an attribute to exist without a substance. “But,” says
                    he, “we have traced all phenomena to action as to a generic idea, comprehending
                    under it all forms of matter and motion as species of that genus. By this
                    analysis, that complex idea we have usually denominated matter, and considered
                    as the substance or substratum to which motion appertained as an attribute, is
                    found to change its character, and to be itself an attribute of a substance
                    essentially active, of which one modification of motion produces matter and
                    another generates motion.” The action of this substance Mr Young determines to
                    be motion; and he proceeds to inquire by what kind of motion it produces matter,
                    or inert and resisting atoms.</p>
                <p>“Whatever portion of the <hi rend="italic">active substance</hi> is given to form
                    an atom, the following things are necessary to be united in such portion of
                    active substance. <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> It must in some respect
                    continually move; for otherwise it would lose its nature, and cease to be
                    active. <hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> It must also in some other respect be
                    at rest, for otherwise it could not form an inactive atom. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thirdly,</hi> It must preserve unity within itself.” The author’s proof of the
                    first of these positions we have given elsewhere; the second he holds to be
                    self-evident; and the third he thinks established by the following reasoning.
                    “Solidity is the result of those actions among the parts of any whole, whereby
                    the unity of the whole is preserved within itself. Several uncohering things may
                    be united by an external bond; this does not constitute these one solid; it may
                    be one bundle; but if several things cohere, and have an unity preserved within
                    themselves, they become one solid. An atom is the least and most simple solid.”
                    ∙ . ∙ ∙</p>
                <p>Having thus proved the necessity of these three requisites to the formation of an
                    atom, he observes that “the two first can only be united in a rotation of the
                    portion of active substance about a centre or axis at rest. By such a motion,
                    all the parts successively occupy different places in the orbit of rotation, and
                    therefore move; the centre round which they revolve being at rest, the whole
                    portion is also at rest; and thus the portion is at once moving and quiescent,
                    as is required. The same kind of motion will also fulfil the terms of the third
                    requisite; for a substance having a revolving motion around its own centre,
                    preserves its unity by reason of all the parts preserving the same relation to
                    the centre; and further, a motion of the active substance about a centre or axis
                    will be an activity in the same orbit, which will act upon and resist whatever
                    shall interfere to oppose its activity, or destroy the unity of the sphere, by
                    diverting the course of the revolving motions. The activity or motion of a
                    portion of <hi rend="italic">active substance</hi> about a centre will,
                    therefore, give solidity to such portion; for it will give it unity and
                    resistance, and in a manner tie together all the parts, forming them into one
                    mass about their common centre; for they move or are active, not towards the
                    centre, in which case they would be lost in non-extension; nor from the centre,
                    where they would dissipate in boundless space; but about the centre, preserving
                    the same limits of extension. And being in this way active, they in this way
                    resist any other activity opposed to them, that is, they resist any action which
                    tends to penetrate or divide this sphere of revolving activity. Therefore, since
                    any portion of active substance does, by revolving about a centre, become an
                    united, resisting, and quiescent whole, the smallest portions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">active substance</hi> which have such motions will become atoms,
                    or make the smallest portions of matter.” <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501487"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1487-0800"/>Having thus shown to his own satisfaction how
                    atoms of matter are formed, he next explains, what at first he confesses may
                    appear to be a paradox, “how the <hi rend="italic">active substance,</hi>
                    retaining its own nature and essential properties, continuing immaterial,
                    unsolid, and active, puts on at the same time the form <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    matter, and becomes material, solid, and inert. A sphere of revolving active
                    substance, as it revolves constantly about a centre, and as parts of the
                    substance are considered as successively passing through every point in the
                    orbit; considered thus in its parts, and in its motions, it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >active substance,</hi> immaterial, and unsolid; but the whole sphere,
                    considered unitically, collectively, and as quiescent, is in this point of view
                    a solid atom, material and inert.”</p>
                <p>Such is the active substance of Mr Young, and such his theory of the formation of
                    matter. That he has not with servility copied from the ancients, every reader of
                    his book, who is not an absolute stranger to Greek and Roman literature, will
                    readily acknowledge; and yet, if his theory be well founded, he has discovered a
                    middle substance between mind and matter, more properly plastic than Aris-,
                    totle or Plato, Cudworth or Berkeley, ever conceived. But truth compels us to
                    add, that to us his theory appears to labour under insuperable objections. That
                    there may be in the universe a substance essentially active, and at the same
                    time not intelligent, is a proposition which we are by no means inclined to
                    controvert. Various phenomena, both in vegetable and in animal life, lead us to
                    suspect that there is such a substance; but it does not follow that we are
                    inclined to adopt our author’s doctrine respecting the formation of matter. He
                    conceives his proof indeed to be “in its nature not at all imperfect, or to fall
                    short of demonstration; and if any one refuse it, he thinks it will be necessary
                    for him to show, either that the explanation offered is not sufficient, or that
                    some other explanation will serve equally well.”</p>
                <p>To show that the explanation which this writer has offered is not sufficient,
                    will not, we apprehend, be a very arduous task; but we have ourselves no
                    inclination to attempt another explanation, because we believe that of the
                    formation of matter no other account can be given than that which resolves it
                    into the fiat of the Creator. That it cannot be formed by the motion of an
                    immaterial substance, in the manner which our author has very clearly described,
                    seems to be a truth so evident as not to admit of proof; for if motion, as he
                    defines it, be a change of place, everything that is moved must have the quality
                    of extension. But all the parts of this active substance which are given to form
                    an atom, move round a centre, and are expressly said to occupy successively
                    different places in the orbit of rotation. Every one of these parts, therefore,
                    is an extended being: And since, according to our author, solidity is nothing
                    but an active power of resistance, and the parts of this active substance, in
                    their rotation round their centre, act upon and resist whatever interferes to
                    oppose their activity, it follows that each of these parts is likewise a solid
                    being. But, in the opinion of Mr Young himself, and of all mankind, whatever is
                    extended and solid is material. This theory, therefore, exhibits a process in
                    which atoms are formed of a substance which, though it is said to be active,
                    immaterial, and unsolid, appears, when narrowly inspected, to be nothing else
                    than a collection of those very atoms of which the author pretends to explain
                    the formation. Mr Young, who examines and very freely censures some of the
                    doctrines of Newton and others, can scarcely have expected that others would
                    refrain from stating objections to a theory which is quite new, to a
                    transformation which he himself acknowledges may to many “appear not only
                    problematical and difficult to conceive, but wholly impossible, and implying
                    contradictions absolutely and for ever irreconcileable.” Whether this be a just
                    character of it our readers must determine; but if we had not believed the
                    author to be a man of ingenuity, we should not have introduced him or his work
                    to the notice of the public.</p>
