                    peculiar view which it takes of Lord Bacon’s philosophy. On this latter subject,

                    rend="smallcaps">Philosophy</hi> is a word derived from the Greek, and literally
                    signifies the <hi rend="italic">love of wisdom.</hi> In its usual acceptation,
                    however, it denotes a science, or collection of sciences, of which the universe
                    is the object; and of the term thus employed many definitions have been given,
                    differing from one another according to the different views of their several
                    authors. By Pythagoras, philosophy is defined <hi rend="italic">εitiστημη των
                    οντων,</hi> the knowledge of things existing; by Cicero, after Plato, “scientia
                    rerum divinarum et humanarum cum <hi rend="italic">causis</hi> and by the
                    illustrious Bacon, <hi rend="italic">interpretatio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >naturae.</hi> Whether any of these definitions be sufficiently precise, and at
                    the same time sufficiently comprehensive, may perhaps be questioned; but if
                    philosophy in its utmost extent be capable of being adequately defined, it is
                    not here that the definition should be given. “Explanation,”· says an acute
                    writer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tatham’s Chart
                    and Scale of Truth, vol. i. p. 8.</p></note> “is the first office of a teacher;
                    definition, if it be good, is the last of the inquirer after truth; but
                    explanation is one thing, and definition quite another.” It may be proper,
                    however, to observe, that the definition given by Cicero is better than that of
                    Pythagoras, because the chief object of the philosopher is to ascertain the <hi
                    rend="italic">causes</hi> of things; and in this consists the difference between
                    his studies and those of the natural historian, who merely enumerates phenomena,
                    and arranges them into separate classes.</p>
                <p>The principal objects of philosophy are, God; nature, and . man. That part of it
                    which treats of God is called Theology: that which treats of nature, Physics and
                    Metaphysics; and that which treats of man, Logic and Ethics. That these are not
                    separate and independent sciences, but, as Bacon expresses it,<note

                    we have, agreeably to our usual plan, given a short history of philosophy from
                    the earliest ages to the present day.</p>
                <p>To attempt to assign an origin to philosophy would be ridiculous; for every man
                    endeavours to ascertain the causes of those changes which he observed in nature;
                    and even children themselves are inquisitive after that which produces the sound
                    of their drums and their rattles. Children, therefore, and the most illiterate
                    vulgar, have in all ages been philosophers. But the first people amongst whom
                    philosophy was cultivated as a profession was probably the Chaldeans. We
                    certainly read of none earlier; for although we have more authentic accounts of
                    the Hebrews than of any other nation of remote antiquity, and have reason to
                    believe that no people was civilized before them, yet the peculiar circumstances
                    in which they were placed rendered all philosophical investigation to them
                    useless, and even tended to suppress the very spirit of inquiry. The Egyptians
                    indeed pretended to be the first of nations, and to have spread the blessings of
                    religion and the light of science amongst every other people; but, from the
                    earliest records now extant, there is reason to believe that the Chaldeans were
                    a civilized and powerful nation before the Egyptian monarchy was founded.</p>
                <p>Of the Chaldean philosophy much has been said, but very little is known.
                    Astronomy seems to have been their favourite study; and at the era of
                    Alexander’s conquest of their country, they boasted that their ancestors had
                    continued their astronomical observations throughout a period of 470,000 years.
                    Extravagant claims to antiquity have been common in all nations.<note

                    is thus rejected with contempt by Cicero: “Contemnamus Babylonios, et eos, qui e

                    Macedonian conqueror, was requested by Aristotle to inform himself concerning
                    the origin of science in Chaldea; and upon examining into the grounds of this
                    report, he found that their observations reached no farther backwards than 1903,
                    or 2234 years before the Christian era. Even this is a remoter antiquity than
                    Ptolemy allows to their science; for he mentions no Chaldean observations prior
                    to the era of Nabonassar, or 747 years before Christ. That they cultivated
                    something which they called philosophy at a much earlier period than this,
                    cannot be questioned; for Aristotle,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Apud Laertium, lib. i. § 8.</p></note> on the credit of the
                    most ancient records, speaks of the Chaldean magi as prior to the Egyptian
                    priests, who were certainly men of learning before the time of Moses. For any
                    other science than that of the stars we do not read that the Chaldeans were
                    famous; and this seems to have been cultivated by them merely as the foundation
                    of judicial astrology. Persuading the multitude that all human affairs are
                    influenced by the stars, and professing to be acquainted with the nature and
                    laws of this influence, their wise men pretended to calculate nativities, and to
                    predict good and bad fortune.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    superstitions; and whilst the Chaldeans were givén up to such puerilities, true
                    science could not be much indebted to their labours. If any credit be due to
                    Plutarch and Vitruvius, who quote Berosus, it was the opinion of the Chaldean
                    wise men that an eclipse of the moon happens when that part of its body which is
                    destitute of fire is turned towards the earth. Their cosmogony, as given by
                    Berosus, and preserved by Syncellus, seems to þe this, that all things in the
                    beginning consisted of darkness and water; that a divine power, dividing this
                    humid mass, formed the world; and that the human mind is an emanation from the
                    divine nature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Enfield’s

                <p>The large tract of country which comprehended the empires of Assyria and Chaldea
                    was the first peopled region on earth. From that country, therefore, the
                    rudiments of science must have been propagated in every direction throughout the
                    rest of the world; but what particular people made the earliest figure, after
                    the Chaldeans, in the history of philosophy, cannot be certainly known. The
                    claim of the Egyptians is probably best founded; but as their science <pb

                    source of that of the Greeks, we shall defer what we have to say of it, on
                    account of the connection between the parent and the offspring, and turn our
                    attention from Chaldean to Indian philosophy, as it has been cultivated from a
                    very early period by the Brahmins and Gymnosophists. We pass over Persia,
                    because we know not of any science peculiar to that kingdom except the doctrines
                    of the magi, which were religious rather than philosophical.</p>
                <p>From whatever quarter India received its wisdom, we are certain that its
                    philosophers were held in high repute at a period of very remote antiquity,
                    since they were visited by Pythagoras and other sages of ancient Greece, who
                    travelled in pursuit of knowledge. Yet they seem to have been in that early age,
                    as well as at present, more distinguished for the severity of their manners than
                    for the acquisition of science; and, as Dr Enfield observes, they appear to have
                    more resembled modern monks than ancient philosophers. The Brahmans or Brahmins,
                    it is well known, are all of one tribe; and the most learned of them are in
                    their own language called Pundits. The Greek writers, however, mention a society
                    called <hi rend="italic">Samanaeans,</hi> who, voluntarily devoting themselves
                    to the study of divine wisdom, gave up all private property, committing their
                    children to the care of the state, and their wives to the protection of their
                    relations. This society was supported at the public expense; and its members
                    spent their time in contemplation, in conversation on divine subjects, or in
                    acts of religion.</p>
                <p>The philosophy of the Indians has indeed from the beginning been engrafted upon
                    their religious dogmas, and seems to be a compound of fanatical metaphysics and
                    extravagant superstition, without the smallest seasoning of rational physics.
                    Very unlike the philosophers of modern Europe, of whom a great part labour to
                    exclude the agency of mind from the universe, the Pundits of Hindustan allow no
                    powers whatever to matter, but introduce the Supreme Being as the immediate
                    cause of every effect, however trivial. “Brahm, <hi rend="italic">the Spirit of
                    God,”</hi> says one of their most revered Brahmins, “is absorbed in
                    self-contemplation. The same is the mighty lord, who is present in every part of
                    space, whose omnipresence, as expressed in the Reig Beid or Rigveda, I shall now
                    explain. Brahm is one, and to him there is no second; such is truly Brahm. His
                    omniscience is self-inspired or self-intelligent, and its comprehension includes
                    every possible species. To illustrate this as far as I am able, the most
                    comprehensive of all comprehensive faculties is omniscience; and being
                    self-inspired, it is subject to none of the accidents of mortality, conception,
                    birth, growth, decay, or death; neither is it subject to passion or vice. To it
                    the three distinctions of time, past, present, and future, are not. To it the
                    three modes of being are not.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the universe, and independent of all. This omniscience is named Brahm. By this
                    omniscient Spirit the operations of God are enlivened. By this Spirit also the

                    twenty-four powers of nature, according to the Brahmins, are the five elements,

                    of action, the hand, foot, tongue, anus, and male organ of generation; the five
                    organs of perception, the ear, eye, nose, mouth, and skin; the five senses,
                    which they distinguish from the organs of sensation; the three dispositions of

                    be of as great antiquity as Mr Halhed supposes, the Brahmins must have been

                    tree, so by this Spirit the world is endued with the powers of intellect, the
                    powers of the will, and the powers of action. Hence, if it emanates from the
                    heart by the channel of the ear, it causes the perception of sounds; if it
                    emanates from the heart by the channel of the skin, it causes the perception of
                    touch; if it emanates from the heart by the channel of the eye, it causes the
                    perception of visible objects; if it emanates from the heart by the channel of

                    the channel of the nose, it causes the perception of smell. This also

                <p>From this passage it is plain that all the motions in the universe, and all the
                    perceptions of man, are, according to the Brahmins, caused by the immediate
                    agency of the Spirit of God, which seems to be here considered as the soul of
                    the world. But it appears, from some papers in the Asiatic Researches, that the
                    most profound of these oriental philosophers, and even the authors of their
                    sacred books, believe not in the existence of matter as a separate substance,
                    but hold an opinion respecting it very similar to that of the celebrated
                    Berkeley. The Vedants, says Sir William Jones, unable to form a distinct idea of
                    brute matter independent of mind, or to conceive that the work of Supreme
                    Goodness was left a moment to itself, imagine that the Deity is ever present to
                    his work, and constantly supports a series of perceptions, which in one sense
                    they call <hi rend="italic">illusory,</hi> though they cannot but admit the
                    reality of all created forms, as far as the happiness of creatures can be
                    affected by them. This is the very immaterialism of Berkeley; and in proof that
                    it is the genuine doctrine of the Brahmins, the learned president quotes the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bhagavat,</hi> which is believed to have been pronounced by the
                    Supreme Being, and in which is the following sentence: “Except the <hi
                    rend="italic">first cause,</hi> whatever may appear, and may not appear, in the
                    mind, know that to be the mind’s <hi rend="italic">Maya,</hi> or delusion, as
                    light, as darkness.”</p>
                <p>We have shown elsewhere (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics),</hi> that the
                    metaphysical doctrines of the Brahmins respecting the human soul differ not from
                    those of Pythagoras and Plato; and that they believe it to be an emanation from
                    the great soul of the world, which, after many transmigrations, will be finally
                    absorbed in its parent substance. In proof of their believing in the
                    metempsychosis, Mr Halhed gives us the following translation of what, he says,
                    is a beautiful stanza in the Gēētā: “As, throwing aside his old clothes, a man
                    puts on others that are new; so our lives, quitting the old, go to other newer
                    animals.”</p>
                <p>From the Brahmins believing in the soul of the world not only as the sole agent,
                    but as the immediate cause of every motion in nature, we can hardly suppose them
                    to have made any great progress in that science which in Europe is cultivated
                    under the name of Physics. They have no inducement to investigate the laws of
                    nature, because, according to the first principles of their philosophy, which,
                    together with their religion, they believe to have been revealed from heaven,
                    every phenomenon, however regular, or however anomalous, is produced by the
                    voluntary act of an intelligent mind. Yet if they were acquainted with the use
                    of fire-arms four thousand years ago, as Mr Halhed seems to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193496651" xml:id="kp-eb0717-6651-0428"/>believe, he who made that
                    discovery must have had a very considerable knowledge of the powers of nature;
                    for though gunpowder may have been discovered by accident in the East, as it
                    certainly was in the West many ages afterwards, it is difficult to conceive how
                    mere accident could have led any man to the invention of a gun. In astronomy,
                    geometry, and chronology, too, they appear to have made some proficiency at a
                    very early period. Their chronology and astronomy are indeed full of those
                    extravagant fictions which seem to be essential to all their systems; but their
                    calculation of eclipses, and their computations of time, arc conducted upon
                    scientific principles.</p>
                <p>“It is sufficiently known,” says Mr Davis,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Asiatic Researches, vol. ii.</p></note> “that the Hindu
                    division of the ecliptic into signs, degrees, &amp;c. is the same as ours; that
                    their astronomical year is sidereal, or containing that space of time in which
                    the sun, departing from a star, returns to the same; that it commences on the
                    instant of his entering the sign Aries, or rather the Hindu constellation Mésha;
                    that each astronomical month contains as many even days and fractional parts as
                    he stays in each sign; and that the civil differs from the astronomical account
                    of time only in rejecting those fractions, and beginning the year and month at
                    sunrise, instead of the intermediate instant of the artificial day or night.
                    Hence arises the unequal portion of time assigned to each month, dependent on
                    the situation of the sun’s apsis, and the distançe of the vernal equinoctial
                    colure from the beginning of Mésha in the Hindu sphere; and by these means they
                    avoid those errors which Europeans, from a different method of adjusting their
                    calendar by intercalary days, have been subject to.”</p>
                <p>Mr Davis observes, that an explanation of these matters would have led him beyond
                    his purpose, which was only to give a general account of the method by which the
                    Hindus compute eclipses, and to show that the science of astronomy is as well
                    known amongst them now as ever it was amongst their ancestors. This he does very
                    completely; but in the present short historical sketch we can neither copy nor
                    abridge his memoir. Suffice it to say, that he has shown the practical part of
                    the Hindu astronomy to be founded on mathematical principles; and that the
                    learned Pundits appear to have truer notions of the form of the earth and the
                    economy of the universe than those which are ascribed to their countrymen in
                    general.</p>
                <p>The same writer likewise shows, that the prodigious duration which the Hindus
                    attribute to the world, is the result of a scientific calculation, founded
                    indeed upon very whimsical principles. “It has been common with astronomers to
                    fix on some epoch, from which, as from a radix, to compute the planetary
                    motions; and the ancient Hindus chose that point of time counted back, when,
                    according to their motions as they had determined them, they must have been in
                    conjunction in the beginning of Mésha or Aries, and coeval with which
                    circumstance they supposed the creation. This, as it concerned the planets only,
                    would have produced a moderate term of years compared with the enormous
                    antiquity that will be hereafter stated; but having discovered a slow motion of
                    the nodes and apsides also, and taken it into computation, they found it would
                    require a length of time corresponding with 1,955,884,890 years, now expired,
                    when they were so situated, and 2,364,115,110 years more before they would
                    return to the same situation again, forming together the grand anomalistick
                    period denominated a <hi rend="italic">Calpa,</hi> and fancifully assigned as
                    the day of Brahma.”</p>
                <p>But although the mathematical part of the astronomy of the Pundits is undoubtedly
                    respectable, their physical notions of the universe are in the highest degree
                    ridiculous and extravagant. In the Vedas and Puranas, writings of which no
                    devout Hindu can dispute the divine authority, eclipses are said to be
                    occasioned by the intervention of the monster <hi rend="italic">Fahu,</hi> and
                    the earth to be supported by a series of animals. “They suppose,” says Mr
                    Halhed, “that there are fourteen spheres, seven below and six above the earth.
                    The seven inferior worlds are said to be altogether inhabited by an infinite
                    variety of serpents, described in every monstrous figure that the imagination
                    can suggest« The first sphere above the earth is the immediate vault of the
                    visible heavens, in which the sun, moon, and stars are placed. The second is the
                    first paradise, and genera, receptacle of those who merit a removal from the
                    lower earth. The third and fourth are inhabited by the souls of those men who,
                    by the practice of virtue and dint of prayer, have acquired an extraordinary
                    degree of sanctity. The fifth is the reward of those who have all their lives
                    performed some wonderful act of penance and mortification, or who have died
                    martyrs for their religion. The highest sphere is the residence of Brahma and
                    his particular favourites, such as those men who have never uttered a falsehood
                    during their whole lives, and those women who have voluntarily burned themselves
                    with their husbands. All these are absorbed in the divine essence.”</p>
                <p>On ethics, the Hindus have nothing that can be called philosophy. Their duties,
                    moral, civil, and religious, are all laid down in their Vedas and Shasters, and
                    enjoined by what they believe to be divine authority, which supersedes all
                    reasoning concerning their fitness or utility. The business of their Pundits is
                    to interpret these books, which are extremely ancient, and written in a language
                    that has long been unintelligible to every other order of men; but no Pundit
                    will alter the text, however impossible to be reconciled to principles
                    established in his own practice <hi rend="italic">of</hi> astronomy. On such
                    occasions, the usual apology for their sacred books is, that “such things may
                    have been so formerly, and may be so still; but that for astronomical purposes
                    astronomical rules must be followed.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Davis’s Memoir, in the Asiatic Researches, vol.
                    ii.</p></note> The great duties of morality have been prescribed in every
                    religious code; and they are not overlooked in that of the Hindus, although the
                    highest merit that a Brahmin can have consists in voluntary acts of abstinence
                    and mortification, and in contempt of death.</p>
                <p>Of the ancient philosophy of the Arabians and Chinese nothing certain can be
                    said; and the narrow limits of such an abstract as this do not admit of our
                    mentioning the conjectures of the learned, which contradict each other, and are
                    all equally groundless. There is indeed sufficient evidence that both nations
                    were at a very early period observers of the stars, and that the Chinese had
                    even a theory by which they foretold eclipses; but there is reason to believe
                    that the Arabians, like other people in their circumstances, were nothing more
                    than judicial astrologers, who possessed not the smallest portion of
                    astronomical science. Pliny makes mention of their magi, whilst later writers
                    tell us that they were famous for their ingenuity in solving enigmatical
                    questions, and for their skill in the arts of divination. But the authors of
                    Greece are silent concerning their philosophy; and there is not an Arabian book
                    of greater antiquity than the Koran extant.</p>
                <p>Leaving therefore regions so barren of information, let us pass to the
                    Phoenicians, whose commercial celebrity has induced many learned men to allow
                    them great credit for early science. If it be true, as seems highly probable,
                    that the ships of this nation had doubled the Cape and almost encompassed the
                    peninsula of Africa long before the era of Solomon, we cannot doubt that the
                    Phoenicians had made great proficiency in the art of navigation and in the
                    science <pb break="no" facs="nls:193496664" xml:id="kp-eb0717-6664-0429"/>of
                    astronomy at a period of very remote antiquity. Nor were these the only sciences
                    cultivated by that ancient people. The learned Cudworth has, in our opinion,
                    sufficiently proved that Mosehus or Mochus, a Phoenician, who, according to
                    Strabo, flourished before the Trojan war, was the author of the atomic
                    philosophy afterwards adopted by Leucippus, Democritus, and others, amongst the
                    Greeks; and that it was with some of the successors of this sage that, as
                    Jam⅛lichus tells us, Pythagoras conversed at Sidon, and from them received his
                    doctrine of <hi rend="italic">monads.</hi> Another proof of the early progress
                    of the Phoenicians in philosophy may be found in the fragments of their
                    historian Sanchoniathon, which have been preserved by Eusebius.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pr&lt;xparaiiο Evangelii.</hi></p></note> We are indeed aware that men of great
                    celebrity have called in question the authenticity of those fragments, and even
                    the very existence of such a writer as Sanehoniathon; but for this scepticism we
                    can discover no solid foundation. His history may have been interpolated in some
                    places by the translator Philo-Byblius; but Porphyry/ Eusebius, and Theodoret,
                    speak of it as a work of undoubted credit, and affirm that its author flourished
                    before the Trojan war. Now this ancient writer teaches, that, according to the
                    wise men of his country, all things arose at first from the necessary ageney of
                    an active principle upon a passive chaotic mass, which he calls <hi
                    rend="italic">mot.</hi> This chaos, Cudworth thinks, was the same with the
                    elementary water of Thales, who was also of Phoenician extraction; but Mosheim
                    justly observes that it was rather dark air, since Philo translates it <hi
                    rend="italic">αεpα ζο&lt;f&gt;ωδη.</hi> Be this as it may, nothing can be more
                    evident than that the Phoenicians must have made some progress in what must
                    surely be considered as philosophy, however false, as early as the era of
                    Sanehoniathon; for speculations concerning the origin of the world never oecnr
                    to untaught barbarians. Besides Moehus and Sanehoniathon, Cadmus, who introduced
                    letters into Greece, may undoubtedly be reckoned amongst the Phoenician
                    philosophers; for though it is not pretended that the alphabet was of his
                    invention, and though it is by no means certain that the Greeks, at the time of
                    his arrival amongst them, were wholly destitute of alphabetic characters; yet
                    the man who could prevail with illiterate savages to adopt the use of strange
                    characters, must have been a great master of the science of human nature.
                    Several other Phoenician philosophers are mentioned by Strabo; but as they
                    flourished at a later period, and philosophized after the systematic mode of the
                    Greeks, they do not fall properly under our notice. We pass on therefore to the
                    philosophy of Egypt.</p>
                <p>It has already been observed that the Egyptians boasted of being the first of
                    nations, and the authors of all the science which in separate rays illuminated
                    the rest of the world. But though this claim was undoubtedly ill founded, their
                    high antiquity and early progress in the arts of civil life cannot be
                    controverted. The Greeks with one voice confess that all their learning and
                    wisdom came from Egypt, either imported immediately by their own philosophers,
                    or brought through Phoenicia by the sages of the East; and we know, from higher
                    authority than the histories of Greece, that at a period so remote as the birth
                    of Moses the wisdom of the Egyptians was proverbially famous. Yet the history of
                    Egyptian learning and philosophy, although men of the first eminence, both
                    ancient and modern, have bestowed much pains in attempts to elucidate it, still
                    remains involved in clouds of uncertainty. That they had some knowledge of
                    physiology, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy, are facts which cannot be
                    questioned; but there is reason to believe that even these sciences were in
                    Egypt pushed no farther than to the uses of life. That they believed in the
                    existence of incorporeal substances is certain; because Herodotus assures us
                    that they were the first assertors of the immortality, pre-existence,, and
                    transmigration of human souls, which they could not have been without holding
                    those souls to be at least incorporeal, if not immaterial.</p>
                <p>The founder of Egyptian learning is generally acknowledged to have been Thoth,
                    Thent, or Taant, called by the Greeks Hermes, and by the Romans Mercury; but of
                    this personage very little is known. Diodorus Siculus says that he was chief
                    minister to Osiris, and that he improved language, invented letters, instituted
                    religious rites, and taught astronomy, music, and other arts. The same thing is
                    affirmed by Sanchoniathon, whose antiquity has already been mentioned; by
                    Manetho, an Egyptian priest, who flourished during the reign of Ptolemy
                    Philadelphus; and by Plato, whose authority, as he resided long in Egypt, and
                    was himself an eminent philosopher, is perhaps more to be depended upon than
                    that of the. other two. In the Philcbus we are told that Tboth was the inventor
                    of letters; and lest we should suppose that by these letters nothing more is
                    meant than picture-writing or symbolical hieroglyphics, it is added, that he
                    distinguished between vowels and consonants, determining the number of each. The
                    same philosopher, in his Phaedrus, attributes to Thóth the invention of
                    arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and hieroglyphical learning; and subjoins a
                    disputation said to have been held between him and Thamus, then king of Egypt,
                    concerning the advantage and disadvantage of his newly-invented letters. Thoth
                    boasted that the invention, by aiding memory, would greatly contribute to the
                    progress of science; whilst the monarch contended that it would enervate men’s
                    natural faculties, by making them trust to writ - ten characters, without
                    exerting the powers of their own minds.</p>
                <p>All this, if real, must have happened before the era of Moses; and since it is
                    almost certain that alphabetical characters were in use prior to the exod of the
                    Israelites from Egypt, we may as well allow the invention to Thoth, as give it
                    to an earlier author of unknown name. That arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy,
                    were cultivated in Egypt from the most remote antiquity, is affirmed by all the
                    ancients, and rendered in the highest degree probable by the situation of the
                    country. The first elements of astronomy have certainly been discovered by
                    various nations, whose habits of life led them to the frequent observation of
                    thç heavens; and it is observed by* Cicero, that .the Egyptians and Babylonians,
                    dwelling in open plains, where nothing intercepted the view of the heavenly
                    bodies, naturally devoted themselves to the study of that science. The annual
                    overflowing of the Nile, which broke up the boundaries of their land, would lay
                    the Egyptians under the necessity of adopting some method of settling those
                    boundaries anew; and necessity we know to be the parent of invention. Hence
                    their early acquaintance with practical geometry cannot well be doubted. Their
                    custom of embalming their dead, and the perfection to which they carried that

                    that their knowledge of antiseptic drugs was great, since it is now certainly
                    known, even from these dissections, that by means of such drugs they contrived

                    we can hardly refuse them some skill in the art of physic, which they themselves
                    traced up to their <pb break="no" facs="nls:193496677"

                <p>The art of alchemy has been said to have been known by the ancient Egyptians;
                    and, from the author of the Egyptian philosophy, it has been called the Hermetic
                    art. But although this is unquestionably a fiction, there is evidence that they
                    were possessed of one art which is even yet a desideratum in the practice of
                    chemistry. “Moses,” we are told,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Exodus, xxii. 20.</p></note> “took the golden calf which his
                    brother had made for idolatrous purposes, and <hi rend="italic">burnt it in the
                    fire,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ground it to powder,</hi> and strewed it on the
                    water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.” Had this fact been related
                    by Herodotus or Diodorus Siculus, it would have been deemed sufficient evidence
                    that the Egyptians were even at that early period no strangers to the art of
                    chemistry; and surely the evidence should not be the worse for coming from the
                    pen of the Hebrew lawgiver, who was himself educated in the court of Egypt.</p>
                <p>But although it is thus evident that the rudiments of almost every useful science
                    were known in Egypt from the remotest, antiquity, it does not appear that any of
                    them was carried to a great degree of perfection, unless perhaps chemistry alone
                    must be excepted. One would think that no science could have been more
                    indispensably requisite to them than geometry; and yet, though Pythagoras is
                    said to have spent twenty-two years in Egypt studying that science' and
                    astronomy, he himself discovered<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This discovery he claimed; and his claim was admitted by the
                    Greek writers, without having been directly controverted since. An excellent
                    mathematician, however, has shown that the equality between the square of the
                    hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle, and the sum of the squares on the other
                    two sides, was known to the astronomers of India at a period long prior to that
                    of Pythagoras. Notwithstanding this, it is certainly possible that the sage of
                    Samos may have made the. discovery himself, though we think the contrary much
                    more probable; for we agree with the able writer already mentioned, that
                    Pythagoras, who is generally believed to have conversed with Indian Brahmins as
                    well as Egyptian priests, may have derived from them some of the solid as well
                    as the visionary speculations with which he delighted to instruct or amuse his
                    disciples. See Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol.

                    his return to Samos. This, although a very useful, is yet a simple theorem; and
                    since it was not reached by the Egyptian geometry, we cannot suppose that the
                    people of Egypt had then advanced far in such speculations. The same conclusion
                    must be drawn with respect to astronomy; for Thales is said to have been the
                    first who calculated an eclipse of the sun, and we nowhere read that the
                    Egyptians pretended to dispute that honour with him. To this it may be replied,
                    that Pythagoras was in Egypt undoubtedly taught the true constitution of the
                    solar system, and, what is more extraordinary, the doctrine of comets in
                    particular, and of their revolutions, like the other planets, round the
                    sun.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is recorded by

                    the priests had received by tradition from their early ancestors, and of which
                    they had never questioned the truth nor inquired into the reasons. Of this we
                    need no better proof than that the Pythagorean system of the sun was totally
                    neglected by the Greeks as soon as they began to frame hypotheses and to
                    speculate in philosophy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>But it may appear strange, and certainly is so, that the Egyptian priests, in the
                    days of Pythagoras, should have preserved so great a discovery of their
                    ancestors, and at the same time have totally forgotten the principles and
                    reasoning which led to a conclusion apparently contrary to the evidence of
                    sense. This is a difficulty which we pretend not to remove, although the fact
                    which involves it seems to be beyond the reach of controversy. Perhaps the
                    following observations may throw upon it a feeble light. According to Manetho,
                    the written monuments of the first Thoth were lost or neglected in certain civil
                    revolutions or natural calamities which befell the kingdom of Egypt. After many
                    ages great part of them were recovered by an ingenious interpretation of the
                    symbols which he had inscribed upon ancient columns; and the man who made this
                    interpretation was called the second Thoth, or Hermes Trismegistus. But thrice
                    illustrious as this personage was, it is at least possible that he may have been
                    much inferior to the former Hermes, and have read his writings and transcribed
                    his conclusions without being able to comprehend the principles or reasoning
                    which led to these conclusions. Any man who understands Latin might translate
                    into his own tongue the conclusions of Newton; but much more would be requisite
                    to make him comprehend the demonstrations of his sublime geometry. By what mode
                    of reasoning the first Hermes was led to the true idea of the solar system, or
                    whether it was by reasoning at all, cannot now be known; but it seems very
                    evident, that when the intercourse between the Egyptains and Greeks first
                    commenced, the wisdom of the former people consisted chiefly in the science of
                    legislation and civil policy, and that the philosopher, the divine, the
                    legislator, and the poet, were all united in the same person. Their cosmogony
                    (for all the ancients who pretended to science framed cosmogonies) differed
                    little from that of the Phoenicians already mentioned. They held that the world
                    was produced from chaos by the energy of an intelligent principle; and they
                    likewise conceived that there is in nature a continual tendency towards
                    dissolution. In Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Timaeus,</hi> an Egyptian priest is
                    introduced describing the destruction of the world, and asserting that this will
                    be effected by means of water and fire. They conceived that the universe
                    undergoes a periodical conflagration; after which all things are restored to
                    their original form, to pass again through a similar succession of changes.</p>
                <p>“Of preceptive doctrine the Egyptians had two kinds, the one sacred, the other
                    vulgar. The former, which respected the ceremonies of religion and the duties of
                    the priests, was doubtless written in the sacred books of Hermes, but was too
                    carefully concealed to pass down to posterity. The latter consisted of maxims
                    and rules of virtue, prudence, or policy. Diodorus Siculus relates many
                    particulars concerning the laws, customs, and manners of the Egyptians; whence
                    it appears that superstition mingled with and corrupted their notions of morals.
                    It is in vain to look for accurate principles of ethics among an ignorant and
                    superstitious people. And that the ancient Egyptians merited this character is
                    sufficiently evident from this single circumstance, that they suffered
                    themselves to be deceived by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193496690"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-6690-0431"/>impostors, particularly by the professors of the
                    fanciful art of astrology; concerning whom Sextus Empiricus justly remarks, that
                    they have done much mischief in the world, by enslaving men to superstition,
                    which will not suffer them to follow the dictates of right reason.”</p>
                <p>From Egypt and Phoenicia philosophy passed into Greece, where it was long taught
                    without system, as in the countries from which it was derived. Phoroneus,
                    Cecrops, Cadmus, and Orpheus, were amongst the earliest instructors of the
                    Greeks; and they inculcated Egyptian and Phoenician doctrines in detached
                    maxims, and enforced them, not by strength of argument, but by the authority of
                    tradition. Their cosmogonies were wholly Phoenician or Egyptian disguised under
                    Grecian names; and they taught a future state of rewards and punishments. The
                    planets and the moon Orpheus conceived to be habitable worlds, and the stars to
                    be fiery bodies like the sun; but he taught that they are all animated by
                    divinities, an opinion which prevailed both in Egypt and in the East. It does
                    not appear, however, that he gave any other proof of his doctrines than a
                    confident assertion that they were derived from some god·.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have seen philosophy in its state of infancy and childhood,
                    consisting only of a collection of sententious maxims and traditionary opinions;
                    but amongst the Greeks, an ingenious and penetrating people, it soon assumed the
                    form of profound speculation and systematic reasoning. Two eminent philosophers
                    arose nearly at the same period, who may be considered as the parents not only
                    of Grecian science, but of almost all the science which was cultivated in Europe
                    prior to the era of the great Lord Bacon. These were Thales and Pythagoras, of
                    whom the former founded the Ionic school, and the latter the Italic; from which
                    two sprung the various sects into which the Greek philosophers were afterwards
                    divided. A bare enumeration of these sects is all that our limits will admit of;
                    and we shall give it in the perspicuous language and just arrangement of Dr
                    Enfield, referring our readers for a fuller account than we can give of their
                    respective merits to his abridged translation of Brucker’s history.</p>
                <p>From the <hi rend="italic">Ionic School</hi> sprung various others: 1. The Ionic
                    sect proper, whose founder Thales had as his successors Anaximenes, Anaxagoras,
                    Diogenes Apolloniates, and Archelaus. 2. The Socratic school, founded by
                    Socrates, the principal of whose disciples were Xenophon, Aeschines, Simon,
                    Cebes, Aristippus, Phaedo, Euclid, Plato, Antisthenes, Critias, and Alcibiades.
                    3. The Cyrenaic sect, of which Aristippus was the author; his followers were,
                    his daughter Arete, Hegisias, Anicerris, Theodorus, and Bion. 4. The Megaric or
                    Eristic sect, formed by Euclid of Megara; to whom succeeded Eubulides, Diodorus,
                    and Stilpo, famous for their logical subtilty. 5. The Eliac or Eretriae school,
                    raised by Phaedo of Elis, who, although he closely adhered to the doctrine of
                    Socrates, gave name to his school. His successors were Plistanus and Menedemus;
                    the latter of whom, being a native of Eretria, transferred the school and name
                    to his own country. 6. The Academic sect, of which Plato was the founder. After
                    his death, many of his disciples deviating from his doctrine, the school was
                    divided into the old, new, apd middle academies. 7. The Peripatetic sect,
                    founded by Aristotle, whose successors in the Lyceum were Theophrastus, Strato,
                    Lycon, Aristo, Critolaus, and Diodorus. Amongst the Peripatetics, besides those
                    who occupied the chair, were also Dicaearchus, Eudemus, and Demetrius Phalereus.
                    8. The Cynic sect, of which the author was Antisthenes, whom Diogenes,
                    Onesicritus, Crates, Metrocles, Menippus, and Menedemus, succeeded. In the list
                    of Cynic philosophers must also be reckoned</p>
                <p>Hipparchia, the wife of Crates. 9. The Stoic sect, of which Zeno was the founder.
                    His successors in the porch were Persaeus, Aristo of Chios, Herillus, Sphaerus,
                    Cleanthus, Chrysippus, Zeno of Tarsus, Diogenes the Babylonian, Antipater,
                    Panaetius, and Posidonius.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Italic School</hi> were, 1. The Italic sect proper,
                    founded by Pythagoras, a disciple of Pherecydes. The followers of Pythagoras
                    were Aristaeus, Mnesarchus, Alemaeon, Ecphantus, Hippo, Empedocles, Epicharmus,
                    Ocellus, Timaeus, Archytas, Hippasus, Philolaus, and Eudoxus. 2. The Eleatic
                    sect, of which Xenophanes was the author. His successors, Parmenides, Melissus,
                    Zeno, belonged to the metaphysical class of this sect; Leucippus, Democritus,
                    Protagoras, Diagoras, and Anaxarchus, to the physical. 3. The Heraclitean sect,
                    which was founded by Heraclitus, and soon afterwards expired. Zeno and
                    Hippocrates philosophized after the manner of Heraclitus, and other philosophers
                    borrowed freely from his system. 4. The Epicurean sect, a branch of the Eleatic,
                    had Epicurus for its author ' and amongst his followers were Metrodorus,
                    Polyaenus, Hermachus, Polystratus, Basilides, and Protarchus. 5. The Pyrrhonic
                    or Sceptical sect, the parent of which was Pyrrno. His doctrine was taught by
                    Timon the Phliasian; and after some interval was continued by Ptolemy, a
                    Cyrenean. and at Alexandria by Aenesidemus.</p>
                <p>Of the peculiar doctrines of these sects, the reader will in this work find a
                    short account either in the lives of their respective founders, or under the
                    names of the sects themselves. We shall only observe at present, that although
                    many of them were undoubtedly absurd, and many wicked, it would yet perhaps be
                    going too far to say with some, that the philosophy of Greece became impious
                    under Diagoras, vicious under Epicurus, hypocritical under Zeno, impudent under
                    Diogenes, covetous under Demochares, voluptuous under Metrodorus, fantastical
                    under Crates, scurrilous under Menippus, licentious under Pyrrho, and
                    quarrelsome under Cleanthes. Of the truth of this heavy charge every reader must
                    judge for himself. We are strongly inclined to think that there were virtues and
                    vices peculiar to each sect; “and that the sects themselves had an affinity more
                    or less direct with the different temperaments of man; whence the choice of
                    sectators often depended on physical influence, or a peculiar disposition of
                    their organs. Nothing appears more natural than that those men who were born
                    with great force of mind and strong nerves should discover a predilection for
                    stoicism; while mortals endowed by nature with more delicacy of fibres and
                    keener sensibility fled for refuge to the myrtles of Epicurus. People whose
                    temperaments partook of no extremes, were always inclined either for the Lyceum
                    or the Academy. Such as possessed solidity of understanding ranged themselves
                    with Aristotle; and those who had only genius, or even pretensions to that
                    endowment, went to augment the crowd of Platonists.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>All the systematical philosophers, however, pursued their inquiries into nature
                    by nearly the same method. Of their philosophy, as well as of ours, the
                    universe, with all that it contains, was the vast object; but the individual
                    things which compose the universe are infinite in number and ever changing; and
                    therefore, according to an established maxim of theirs, incapable of being the
                    subjects of human science.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    and to fix those fleeting beings, they established certain definite arrangements
                    or classes, to some of which every thing past, present, or to come, might be
                    referred; and having ascertained, as they thought, al! that could be affirmed or
                    denied of these classes, they proved, by a very short process of-syllogistic
                    reasoning, that what is true of the class must be true of every individual
                    comprehended<pb break="no" facs="nls:193496703" xml:id="kp-eb0717-6703-0432"/>
                    under it. The most celebrated of these arrangements is that which is known by
                    the name of categories, which Mr Harris thinks at least as old as the era of
                    Pythagoras, and to the forming of which mankind would, in his opinion, be
                    necessarily led by the following considerations. Every subject of human thought
                    is either substance or attribute; but substance and attribute may each of them
                    be modified under the different characters of universal or particular. Hence
                    there arises a quadruple arrangement of things into <hi rend="italic">substance
                    universal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">substance particular,</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">attribute universal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">attribute
                    particular</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> to some one of which four not only our
                    words and ideas, but every individual of that immense multitude of things which
                    compose the universe, may be reduced. This arrangement, however, the learned
                    author thjnks too limited; and he is of opinion, that, by attending to the
                    substances with which they were surrounded, the Grecian schools must soon have
                    distinguished between the attributes <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> to all
                    substances, and those which are only <hi rend="italic">circumstantial</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> between the attributes proper to <hi rend="italic"
                    >natural</hi> substances or bodies, and those which are peculiar to <hi
                    rend="italic">intelligible</hi> substances or minds. He likewise thinks, that
                    the time and place of the existence of substances not present must soon have
                    attracted their attention; and that, in considering the place of this or that
                    substance, they could hardly avoid thinking of its position or situation. He is
                    of opinion that the superinduction of one substance upon another would
                    inevitably suggest the idea of clothing or habit, and that the variety of
                    co-existing substances and attributes would discover to them another attribute,
                    viz. that of relation. Instead, therefore, of confining themselves to the simple
                    division of substance and attribute, they divided attribute itself into nine
                    distinct sorts, some essential and others circumstantial; and thus, by setting
                    substance at their head, made ten comprehensive universal genera, called, with
                    reference to their Greek name, <hi rend="italic">categories,</hi> and with
                    reference to their Latin name, <hi rend="italic">predicaments.</hi> These
                    categories are, Substance, Quality, Quantity, Relation, Action, Passion, When,
                    Where, Situation, and Clothing; which, according to the systematic philosophy of
                    the Greeks, comprehend every human science and every subject of human thought.
                    History, natural and civil, springs, says Mr Harris, out of Substance;
                    mathematics out of Quantity; optics out of Quality and Quantity; medicine out of
                    the same; astronomy out of Quantity and Motion; music and mechanics out of the
                    same; painting out of Quality and Site; ethics out of Relation; chronology out
                    of When; geography out of Where; electricity, magnetism, and attraction, out of
                    Action and Passion; and so in other instances.</p>
                <p>To these categories, considered as a mere arrangement of science, we are not
                    inclined to make many objections. The arrangement is certainly not complete; but
                    this is a matter of comparatively small importance, for a complete arrangement
                    of science cannot, we believe, be formed. The greatest objection to the
                    categories arises from the use which was made of them by almost every
                    philosopher of the Grecian schools; for those sages having reduced the objects
                    of all human science to ten general heads or general terms, instead of setting
                    themselves to inquire, by a painful induction, into the nature and properties of
                    the real objects before them, employed their time in conceiving what could be
                    predicated of substance in general, of this or that quality, quantity, relation,
                    &amp;c. in the abstract; and they soon found, that of such general conceptions
                    as the categories there are but five predicables or classes of predicates in
                    nature. The first class is that in which the predicate is the genus of the
                    subject; the second, that in which it is the species of the subject; the third
                    is, when the predicate is the specific difference of the subject; the fourth,
                    when it is a property of the subject; and the fifth,.when it is something
                    accidental to the subject. Having proceeded thus far in their system, they had
                    nothing to do with individuals but to arrange them under their proper
                    categories, which was commonly done in a very arbitrary manner; and then, with
                    the formality of a syllogism, to predicate of each the predicable of the genus
                    or species to which it belonged. But by this method of proceeding, it is obvious
                    that no progress whatever could be made in physical, metaphysical, or ethical
                    science; for if the individual truly belongs to the category under which it is
                    arranged, we add nothing to our stock of knowledge by affirming or denying of it
                    what we had before affirmed or denied of the whole genus; and if it belong not
                    to the category under which we arrange it, our syllogising will only give the
                    appearance of proof to what must, from the nature of things, be an absolute
                    falsehood. It is only by experiments made on various substances apparently of
                    the same kind that they can be certainly known to belong to the same category;
                    and when this is done, all syllogistic reasoning, from the genus to the species,
                    and from the species to the individual, is but solemn trifling, as every
                    proposition in this retrograde course takes for granted the thing to be
                    proved.</p>
                <p>Yet this mode of philosophizing spread from Greece almost over the whole world.
                    It was carried by Alexander into Asia, by his successors into Egypt, and it
                    found its way to Rome after Greece became a province of the empire. It was
                    adopted by the Jews, by the fathers of the Christian church, by the Mahommedan
                    Arabs during the caliphate, and continued to be cultivated by the schoolmen
                    throughout all Europe till its futility was exposed by Lord Bacon. The
                    professors of this philosophy often displayed great acuteness; but their systems
                    were built upon mere hypotheses, and supported by syllogistic wrangling. Now and
                    then indeed a superior genius, such as Alhazen, and our countryman Roger Bacon,
                    broke through the trammels of the schools, and, regardless of the authority of
                    the Stagyrite and his categories, made real discoveries in physical science by
                    experiments judiciously conducted on individual substances; but the science in
                    repute still continued to be that of <hi rend="italic">generals.</hi> It was
                    indeed a combination of absurd metaphysics with more absurd theology; and that
                    which is properly called physics had in Europe no place in a liberal education
                    from the end of the eighth century to the end of the fourteenth. Towards the
                    beginning of this period of darkness, the whole circle of instruction, or the
                    liberal arts as they were called, consisted of two branches, the <hi
                    rend="italic">trivium</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">quadrivium;</hi> the former
                    of which comprehended grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics; the latter music,
                    arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy, to which was added, about the end of the
                    eleventh century, the study of a number of metaphysical subtilties equally
                    useless and unintelligible.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the works of the ancient Greek philosophers had been read only in
                    imperfect Latin translations; and before the scholastic system was completely
                    established, Plato and Aristotle had been alternately looked up to as an oracle
                    in science. The rigid schoolmen, however, universally gave the preference to the
                    Stagyrite, because his analysis of body into matter and form is peculiarly
                    calculated to keep in countenance the most incredible doctrine of the Roman
                    Catholic church; and upon the revival of Greek learning this preference was
                    continued after the school philosophy had begun to fall into contempt, on
                    account of much useful information contained in some of his writings on subjects
                    of natural history, and his supposed merit as a natural philosopher. At last the
                    intrepid spirit of Luther and his associates set the minds of men free from the
                    tyranny of ancient names, as well in human science as in theology; and many
                    philosophers sprung up in different countries of Europe, who professed either to
                    be <hi rend="italic">eclectics,</hi> or to study nature, regardjess of every
                    authority except that of reason. Of these the most eminent beyond all comparison
                    was Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193496716" xml:id="kp-eb0717-6716-0433"/>
                <p>This illustrious man having read with attention the writings of the most
                    celebrated ancients, and made himself master of the sciences which were then
                    cultivated, soon discovered the absurdity of pretending to account for the
                    phenomena of nature by syllogistic reasoning from hypothetical principles; and,
                    with a boldness becoming a genius of the first order, he undertook to give a new
                    chart of human knowledge. This he did in his two admirable works, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Dignitate et Augmentis Scientiarum;</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Novum Organum Scientiarum, sive Judicia vera de
                    Interpretatione Naturae.</hi> In the former of these works, he takes a very
                    minute survey of the whole circle of human science, which he divides into three
                    great branches; history, poetry, and philosophy, corresponding to the three
                    faculties of the mind, memory, imagination, and reason. Each of these general
                    heads is subdivided into minuter branches, and reflections are made upon the
                    whole, which, though we can neither copy nor abridge them, will amply reward the
                    perusal of the attentive reader. The purpose of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Novum</hi><hi rend="italic">Organum</hi> is to point out the proper method of
                    interpreting nature, which the author shows could never be done by the logic
                    which was then in fashion, but only by a painful and fair induction. “Homo
                    naturae minister,” says he, “et interpres tantum facit et intelligit, quantum de
                    naturae ordine re, vel mente observaverit; nec amplius scit aut potest.
                    Syllogismus ad principia scientiarum non adhibetur, ad media axiomata frustra
                    adhibetur, cum sit subtilitati naturae longe impar. Assensum itaque constringit,
                    non res. Syllogismus ex propositionibus constat, propositiones ex verbis, verba
                    notionum tesserae stmt. Itaque si notiones ipsae (id quod basis rei est)
                    confusae sint et temere a rebus abstractae, nihil in iis quae superstruuntur,
                    est firmitudinis. Itaque spes est una in <hi rend="italic">inductione
                    vera.”</hi></p>
                <p>To hypotheses and preconceived opinions, which he calls <hi rend="italic"
                    >idda</hi><hi rend="italic">theatri,</hi> this great man was not less inimical
                    than to syllogisms; and since his days almost every philosopher of eminence,
                    except Descartes and his followers, has professed to study nature according to
                    the method of induction so accurately laid down in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Novuιη</hi><hi rend="italic">Organum.</hi> On this method a few improvements
                    have perhaps been made; but notwithstanding these, Lord Bacon must undoubtedly
                    be considered as the author of that philosophy which is now cultivated in
                    Europe, and which will continue to be cultivated as long as men shall have more
                    regard for matters of fact than for hypothetical opinions. Of this mode of
                    philosophizing we shall now give a short, though we hope not inaccurate view, by
                    stating its objects, comparing it with that which it superseded, explaining its
                    rules, and pointing out its uses; and from this view it will appear that its
                    author shares with Aristotle the empire of science.</p>
                <p>The universe, that unbounded object of the contemplation, the curiosity, and the
                    researches of man, may be considered in two different points of view. In the
                    first place, it may be considered merely as a collection of existences, related
                    to each other by means of resemblances and distinction, situation, succession,
                    and derivation, as making parts of a whole. In this view it is the subject of
                    pure description. To acquire an acquaintance with, or a knowledge of, the
                    universe in this point of view, we must enumerate all the beings in it, mention
                    all their sensible qualities, and mark all these relations for each. But this
                    would be labour immense; and when done, an undistinguishable chaos. A book
                    containing every word of a language would only give us the materials, so to
                    speak, of this language. To make it comprehensible, it must be put into some
                    form, which will comprehend the whole in a small compass, and enable the mind to
                    pass easily from one word to another related to it. Of all relations amongst
                    words, the most obvious are those of resemblance and derivation. An etymological
                    dictionary, therefore, in which words have been classed in consequence of their
                    resemblances, and arranged by means of their derivative distinctions, will
                    greatly facilitate the acquisition of the language.</p>
                <p>It is just so in nature. The objects around us may be grouped by means of their
                    resemblance, and then arranged in those groups by means of their distinctions
                    and other relations. In this classification we are enabled to proceed by means
                    of the faculty of abstracting our attention from the circumstances in which
                    things differ, and turning it to those only in which they agree. By the
                    judicious employment of this faculty we are able not only to distribute the
                    individuals into classes, but also to distribute those classes into others still
                    more comprehensive, by discovering circumstances of resemblance amongst them;
                    for the fewer the circumstances are which concur to form that resemblance which
                    has engaged our attention, the greater is the number of similar circumstances
                    which are neglected, and the more extensive will be the class of individuals in
                    which the resemblance is observed. Thus a number of individuals resembling each
                    other in the single circumstance of life composes the most extensive kingdom of
                    Animals. If it be required that they shall further resemble in the circumstance
                    of having feathers, a prodigious number of animals are excluded, and we form the
                    inferior class of Birds. We exclude a great number of birds by requiring a
                    further similarity of web feet, and have the order of Anseres. If we add lingua
                    ciliata, we confine the attention to the genus of Anates. In this manner may the
                    whole objects of the universe be grouped, and arranged into kingdoms, classes,
                    orders, genera, and species.</p>
                <p>Such a classification and arrangement is called <hi rend="italic">Natural
                    History,</hi> and must be considered as the only foundation of any extensive
                    knowledge of nature. To the natural historian, therefore, the world is a
                    collection of existences, the subject of descriptive arrangement. His aim is
                    threefold. 1. To observe with care, and describe with accuracy, the various
                    objects of the universe. 2. To determine and enumerate all the great classes of
                    objects; to distribute and arrange them into all their subordinate classes,
                    through all degrees of subordination, till he arrive at what are only accidental
                    varieties, which are susceptible of no farther distribution; and to mark with
                    precision the principles of this distribution and arrangement, and the
                    characteristics of the various assemblages. 3. To determine with certainty the
                    particular group to which any proposed individual belongs. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Description,</hi> therefore, <hi rend="italic">arrangement,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">reference,</hi> constitute the whole of his employment; and in
                    this consists all his science.</p>
                <p>Did the universe continue unchanged, this would constitute the whole of our
                    knowledge of nature; but we are witnesses of an uninterrupted succession of
                    changes, and our attention is continually called to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >events</hi> which are incessantly happening around us. These form a set of
                    objects vastly more interesting to us than the former, being the sources of
                    almost all the pleasures or pains we receive from external objects. We are
                    therefore much interested in the study of the events which happen around us, and
                    strongly incited to prosecute it. But they are so numerous and so multifarious,
                    that the study would be immense, without some contrivance for abbreviating and
                    facilitating the task. The same help offers itself here as in the study of what
                    may be called <hi rend="italic">quiescent nature.</hi> Events, like existences,
                    are susceptible of classification, in consequence of resemblances and
                    distinction; and by attention to these, we can acquire a very extensive
                    acquaintance with active nature. Our attention must be chiefly directed to those
                    circumstances in which many events resemble each other, whilst they differ
                    -perhaps in a thousand others. Then we must attend to their most general
                    distinctions; then to distinctions of smaller extent, and so on. It is in this
                    way accordingly that we have advanced in our knowledge of active nature, and are
                    gradually, and by no means slowly, forming assemblages<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193496729" xml:id="kp-eb0717-6729-0434"/> of events more and more
                    extensive, and distributing these with greater and greater precision into their
                    different classes.</p>
                <p>In the zealous and attentive prosecution of this task a very remarkable and
                    interesting observation occurs. In describing those circumstances of similarity
                    amongst events, and particularly in distributing them according to those
                    similarities, it is impossible for us to overlook that constancy which is
                    observed in the changes of nature in the events which are the objects of our
                    contemplation. Events which have once been observed to accompany each other are
                    observed always to do so.</p>
                <p>The rising of the sun is always accompanied by the light of day, and his setting
                    by the darkness of night. Sound argument is accompanied by conviction, impulse
                    by motion, kindness by a feeling of gratitude, and the perception of good by
                    desire. The unexcepted experience of mankind informs us that the events of
                    nature go on in certain regular trains; and if sometimes exceptions seem to
                    contradict this general affirmation, more attentive observation never fails to
                    remove the exception. Most of the spontaneous events of nature are very
                    complicated; and it frequently requires great attention and penetration to
                    discover the simple event amidst a crowd of unessential circumstances which are
                    at once exhibited to our view. But when we succeed in this discovery, we never
                    fail to acknowledge the perfect uniformity of the event to what has been
                    formerly observed. But this is not all. We firmly believe that this uniformity
                    will still continue; that fire will melt wax, will burn paper, will harden clay,
                    as we have formerly observed it to do; and whenever we have undoubted proofs
                    that the circumstances of situation are precisely the same as in some former
                    case, though but once observed, we expect with irresistible and unshaken
                    confidence that the event will also be the same.</p>
                <p>It is not surely necessary to produce many proofs of the universality of this law
                    of human thought. The whole language and actions of men are instances of the
                    fact. In all languages there is a mode of construction which is used to express
                    this relation as distinct from all others, and the conversation of the most
                    illiterate never confounds them, except when the conceptions themselves are
                    confounded. The general employment of the active and passive verb is regulated
                    by it. <hi rend="italic">Turris eversa est a militibus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">turris eversa est</hi><hi rend="italic">terrae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">motu,</hi> express two relations, and no schoolboy will confound
                    them. The distinction therefore is perceived or felt by all who can speak
                    grammatically. Nor is any language without general terms to express this
                    relation. Nay, it is a fact in the mind of brutes, who hourly show that they
                    expect the same uses of every subject which they formerly made of it; and
                    without this, animals would be incapable of subsistence, and man incapable of
                    all improvement. From this alone memory derives all its value; and even the
                    constancy of natural operation would be useless if not matched or adapted to our
                    purposes by this expectation of any confidence in that constancy.</p>
                <p>After all the labours of ingenious men to discover the foundation of this
                    irresistible expectation, we must be contented with saying that such is the
                    constitution of the human mind. It is an universal fact in human thought; and,
                    for any thing that has yet been discovered, it is an ultimate fact, not included
                    in any other still more general. We shall soon see that this is sufficient for
                    making it the foundation of true human knowledge, all of which must in like
                    manner be reduced· to ultimate facts in human thought. We must consider this
                    undoubted feeling, this persuasion of the constancy of nature, as an instinctive
                    anticipation of events similar to those which we have already experienced. The
                    general analogy of nature should have disposed philosophers to acquiesce in
                    this, however unwelcome to their vanity. In no instance of essential consequence
                    to our safety or well-being are we left to the guidance of our boasted reason;
                    God has given us the surer conduct of natural instincts. No case is so important
                    as this. In none do we so much stand in need of a guide which shall be powerful,
                    infallible, and rapid in its decisions. Without it we must remain incapable of
                    all instruction from experience, and therefore of all improvement.</p>
                <p>Our sensations are undoubtedly feelings of our mind. But all those feelings are
                    accompanied by an instinctive reference of them to something distinct from the
                    feelings themselves. Hence arises our perception of external objects, and our
                    very notions of this <hi rend="italic">externeity.</hi> In like manner, this
                    anticipation of events, this irresistible connection of the idea of fire with
                    the idea of burning, is also a feeling of the mind; and this feeling is by a law
                    of human nature referred, without reasoning, to something external as its cause;
                    and, like our sensation, it is considered as a <hi rend="italic">sign</hi> of
                    that external something. It is like the conviction of the truth of a
                    mathematical proposition. This is referred by us to something existing in
                    nature, to a necessary and external relation subsisting between the ideas which
                    are the subjects of the proposition. The conviction is the sign or indication of
                    this relation by which it is brought to our view. In precisely the same manner,
                    the irresistible connection of ideas is interpreted as the sensation or sign of
                    a necessary connection of external things or events. These are supposed to
                    include something in their nature which renders them inseparable companions. To
                    this bond of connection between external things we give the name of Causation.
                    All our knowledge of this relation of cause and effect, is the knowledge or
                    consciousness of what passes in our own minds during the contemplation of the
                    phenomena of nature. If we adhere to this view of it, and put this branch of
                    knowledge on the same footing with those called the abstract sciences,
                    considering only the relations of ideas, we shall acquire demonstrative science.
                    If we take any other view of the matter, we shall be led into inextricable mazes
                    of uncertainty and error.</p>
                <p>We see, then, that the natural procedure of our faculty of abstraction and
                    arrangement, in order to acquire a more speedy and comprehensive knowledge of
                    natural events, presents them to our view in another form. We not only see them
                    as similar events, but as events naturally and necessarily conjoined. And the
                    expression of resemblance amongst events is also an expression of concomitancy;
                    and this arrangement of events in consequence of their resemblance is in fact
                    the discovery of those accompaniments. The trains of natural appearance being
                    considered as the appointments of the Author of Nature, has occasioned them to
                    be considered also as consequences of laws imposed on his works by their great
                    author, and everything is said to be regulated by fixed laws. But this is the
                    language of analogy. When a sovereign determines on certain trains of conduct
                    for his subjects, he issues his orders. These orders are laws. He enforces the
                    observance of them by his authority; and thus a certain regularity and constancy
                    of conduct is produced. But should a stranger, ignorant of the promulgation of
                    these laws, and of the exerted authority of the magistrate, observe this
                    uniformity of conduct, he would ascribe it to the genius and disposition of the
                    people; and his observation would be as useful to him for directing the tenor of
                    his own conduct, as the knowledge of the subject himself of the real source of
                    this constancy is for directing his.</p>
                <p>It is just so in nature. Whilst the theologian pretends, from his discoveries
                    concerning the existence and superintendence of God, to know that the constant
                    accompaniment of events is the consequence of laws which the great Author and
                    Governor of the universe has imposed on his works, the ordinary philosopher, a
                    stranger to this scene, and to the unsearchable operations of the Supreme -Mind,
                    must ascribe<pb break="no" facs="nls:193496742" xml:id="kp-eb0717-6742-0435"/>
                    this constancy to the nature of the things. There is a great resemblance between
                    the expression natural law and grammatical rule. Rule in strict language implies
                    command; but in grammar it expresses merely a generality of fact, whether of
                    flexion or construction. In like manner, a law of nature is to the philosopher
                    nothing but the expression of a generality of fact. A natural or physical law is
                    a generally observed fact; and,whenever we treat any subject as a generally
                    observed^ fact, we treat it physically. It is a physical law of the
                    understanding that argument is accompanied by conviction; it j,S' a physical law
                    of the affection that distress is accompanied by pity; it is a physical law of
                    the material world that impulse is accompanied by motion. And thus we see that
                    the arrangement of events, or the discovery of those general points of
                    resemblance, is in fact the discovery of the laws of nature; and one of the
                    greatest and most important is, that the laws of nature are constant.</p>
                <p>There is no question that this view of the universe is incomparably more
                    interesting and more important than that which is taken by the natural
                    historian; contemplating everything that is of value to us, and, in short, the
                    whole life and movement of the universe. This study, therefore, has been
                    dignified with the name of Philosophy and of Science; and natural history has
                    been considered as of importance only in as far as it has proved conducive to
                    the successful prosecution of philosophy. But the philosopher claims a
                    superiority on another account. He considers himself as employed in the
                    discovery of causes, saying that philosophy is the study of the objects of the
                    universe as related by causation, and that it is by the discovery of these
                    relations that he communicates to the world such important knowledge.
                    Philosophy, he says, is the science of causes. The vulgar are contented to
                    consider the prior of two inseparably conjoined events as the cause of the
                    other; the stroke on a bell, for instance, as the cause of sound. But it has
                    been clearly shown by the philosopher, that between the blow struck on the bell
                    and the sensation of sound there are interposed a long train of events. The blow
                    sets the bell a trembling; this agitates the air in contact with the bell; this
                    agitates the air immediately beyond it; and thus between the bell and the ear
                    may be interposed a numberless series of events, and as many more between the
                    first impression on the ear and that last impression on the nerve by which the
                    mind is affected. He can no longer therefore follow the nomenclature of the
                    vulgar. Which of the events of this train, therefore, is the cause of the
                    sensation? None of them. It is that something which inseparably connects any two
                    of them, and constitutes their bond of union. These bonds of union or causes he
                    considers as residing in one or both of the connected objects; diversities in
                    this respect must therefore constitute the most important distinctions between
                    them. They are accordingly with great propriety called the qualities, the
                    properties, of these respective subjects.</p>
                <p>As the events from which we infer the existence of these qualities of things
                    resemble in many respects such events as are the consequences of the exertion of
                    our own powers, these qualities arc frequently denominated powers, forces,
                    energies. Thus, in the instance which has just now been given of the sound of a
                    bell, we infer the powers of impulse, elasticity, nervous irritability, and
                    animal sensibility. In consequence of this inference of a necessary connection
                    between the objects around us, we not only infer the posterior event from the
                    prior, or, in common language, the effect from the cause, but we also infer the
                    prior from the posterior, the cause from the effect. We not only expect that the
                    presence of a magnet will be followed by certain motions in iron filings, but
                    when we observe such motions, we infer the presence and agency of a magnet. Joy
                    is inferred from merriment, poison from death, fire from smoke, and impulse from
                    motion. And thus the appearances of the universe are the indications of the
                    powers of the objects in it. Appearances are the language of nature, informing
                    us of their causes. And as all our knowledge of the sentiments of others is
                    derived from our confidence in their veracity, so all our knowledge of nature is
                    derived from our confidence in the constancy of natural operations. A veracity
                    and credulity necessarily resulting from that law of our mental constitution, by
                    which we are capable of speech, conduct us in the one case; and the constancy of
                    nature, and the principle of induction, by which we infer general laws from
                    particular facts, conduct us in the other. As human sentiment is inferred from
                    language, and the existence of external things from sensation, so are the laws
                    of nature, and the powers of natural objects, inferred from the phenomena. It is
                    by the successful study of this language of nature that we derive useful
                    knowledge. The knowledge of the influence of motives on the mind of man enables
                    the statesman to govern kingdoms, and the knowledge of the powers of magnetism
                    enables the mariner to pilot a ship through the pathless ocean.</p>
                <p>Such are the lofty pretensions of philosophy. It is to be wished that they should
                    be well founded; for we may be persuaded that a mistake in this particular will
                    be fatal to the advancement of knowledge. An author of great reputation<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ancient
                    Metaphysics.</p></note> gives us an opportunity of deciding this question in the
                    way of experiment. He says that the ancients were philosophers, employed in the
                    discovery of causes, and that the moderns are only natural historians,
                    contenting themselves with observing the laws of nature, but paying no attention
                    to the causes of things. If he speak of their professed aim, we apprehend that
                    the assertion is pretty just in general. With very few exceptions indeed it may
                    be affirmed of his favourite Aristotle, the philosopher <hi rend="italic">κατ'

                    because they are set in continual opposition by this author, and because it will
                    be allowed that they were the most eminent students of nature (for we must not
                    yet call them philosophers) in ancient and modern times. Aristotle’s professed
                    aim, in his most celebrated writings, is the investigation of causes; and, in
                    the opinion of this author, he has been so successfill, that he has hardly left
                    any employment for his successors besides that of commenting upon his works. We
                    must, on the other hand, acknowledge that Newton makes no such pretensions, at
                    least in that work which has immortalized his name, and that his professed aim
                    is merely to investigate the general laws of the planetary motions, and to apply
                    these to the explanation of particular phenomena. Nor will we say that he has
                    left no employment for succeeding inquirers; but, on the contrary, confess that
                    he has only begun the study, has discovered but one law, and has enabled us to
                    explain only the phenomena comprehended in it alone. But he has not been
                    unsuccessful; his investigation has been complete; and he has discovered, beyond
                    all possibility of contradiction, a fact which is observed through the whole
                    extent of the solar system, namely, that every body, nay, that every particle in
                    it, is continually deflected toward every other body, and that every deflection
                    is, in every instance, proportional to the quantity of matter in that body
                    toward which the deflection is directed, and to the reciprocal of the square of
                    the distance from it. He has therefore discovered a physical law of immense
                    extent. Nor has he been in any degree less successful in the explanation of
                    particular phenomena. Of this there cannot be given a better instance <pb

                    brought to such a degree of perfection, that if the moon’s place be computed

                    be found to differ from the place on which she was actually observed by one
                    hundredth part of her own breadth.</p>

                <p>We may now perhaps desire the champions of the science of causes to name any one
                    cause which has really been discovered by their great master, whether in the
                    operations of mind or of body. But they must not on this occasion adduce the
                    investigation of any natural law, in which he has sometimes succeeded. With
                    still greater confidence may we challenge them to produce any remarkable
                    instance of the explanation of natural phenomena, either of mind or body. By
                    explanation we mean an account of the production, and an appreciation of all the
                    circumstances, susceptible of a scrupulous comparison with fact, and perfectly
                    consistent with it. It is here that the weakness of this philosopher’s
                    pretensions is most conspicuous; and his followers candidly acknowledge, that in
                    the inquiries which proceed by experiment, we have not derived any great
                    assistance from Aristotle’s philosophy. But this, say they, does not derogate
                    from the pre-eminence of his philosophy, because he has shown that the
                    particular fields of observation are to be cultivated only by means of
                    experiment But surely every field of observation is particular. There is no
                    abstract object of philosophical research, the study of which shall terminate in
                    the philosophy of universals. In every kind of inquiry, that cause alone must be
                    supposed to act which we understand so far as to be able to appreciate its
                    effects in particular circumstances, and compare them with fact, and see their
                    perfect coincidence. If we have discovered causes, they are <hi rend="italic"
                    >known</hi> as far as they are discovered. Their genuine effects are known, and
                    therefore the phenomena which result from their agency are understood. When
                    therefore it is acknowledged, as it must be acknowledged, that mankind have made
                    but little advances in the knowledge of nature, notwithstanding the pretended
                    discovery of causes by Aristotle, and the conducting clue of his philosophy,
                    until of late years; and when it is also allowed that <hi rend="italic"
                    >now,</hi> whilst we are every day making great additions to this subordinate
                    knowledge, the causes which Aristotle has discovered are forgotten, and his
                    philosophy is neglected; there is great room for suspecting, to say the least,
                    that either the causes which philosophy pretends to have discovered are not
                    real, or that Aristotle and his followers have not aimed at the discovery of
                    causes, but only at the discovery of natural laws, and have failed in the
                    attempt.</p>
                <p>But there seems here to be a previous question: Is it possible to discover a
                    philosophical cause, that something which is neither the prior nor the posterior
                    of the two immediately adjoining events, but their bond of union, and this, too,
                    distinct from the union itself? It is evident that this is an inquiry purely
                    experimental. It is of human knowledge we speak. This must depend upon the
                    nature of the human mind. This is a matter of contingency, known to ns only by
                    experiment and observation. By observing all the feelings and operations of the
                    mind, and classing and arranging them like any other object of science, we
                    discover the general laws of human thought and human reasoning; and this is all
                    the knowledge we can ever acquire of it, or of any thing else.</p>
                <p>Much has been written upon this subject. The most acute observation and the
                    soundest judgment have been employed in the study; and we may venture to say
                    that considerable progress has been made in pneumatology. Many Jaws of human
                    thought have been observed, and very distinctly marked; and philosophers are
                    busily employed, some of them with considerable success, in the distribution of
                    them into subordinate classes, so as to know their comparative extent, and to
                    mark their distinguishing characters, with a precision similar to that which has
                    been attained in botany and other parts of natural history, so that we may hope
                    that this study will advance like others. But in all these researches no
                    phenomena have occurred which look like the perception or contemplation of these
                    separate objects of thought, these philosophical causes, this power <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">abstracto.</hi> No philosopher has ever
                    pretended to state such an object of the mind’s observation, or attempted to
                    group them into classes.</p>
                <p>We may say at once, without entering into any detail, that those causes, those
                    bonds of necessary union between the naturally conjoined events or objects, are
                    not only perceived by means of the events alone, but are perceived solely in the
                    events, and cannot be distinguished from the conjunctions themselves. They are
                    neither the objects of separate observation, nor the productions of memory’, nor
                    inferences drawn from reflection on the laws by which the operation of our own
                    minds are regulated; nor can they be derived from other preceptions in the way
                    of argumentative inference. We cannot infer the paroxysm of terror from the
                    appearance of impending destruction, or the fall of a stone when not supported,
                    as we infer the incommensurability of the diagonal and side of a square. This
                    last is implied in the very conception or notion of a square, not as a
                    consequence of its other properties, but as one of its essential attributes; and
                    the contrary proposition is not only false, but incapable of being distinctly
                    conceived. This is not the case with the other phenomenon, or any matter of
                    fact. The proofs which are brought of a mathematical proposition are not the
                    reason of its being true, but the steps by which this truth is brought into our
                    view; and frequently, as in the instance now given, this truth is perceived, not
                    directly, but consequentially, by the inconceivableness of the contrary
                    proposition.</p>
                <p>Mr Hume derives this irresistible expectation of events from the known effect of
                    custom, the association of ideas. The co-related event is brought into the mind
                    by this well-known power of custom, with that vivacity of conception which
                    constitutes belief or expectation. But without insisting on the futility of his
                    theory of belief, it is sufficient to observe, that this explanation begs the
                    very thing to be proved, when it ascribes to custom a power of any kind. It is
                    the origin of this very power which is the subject in dispute. Besides, upon the
                    genuine principles of scepticism, this custom involves an acknowledgment of past
                    events, of a something different from present impressions, which, in this
                    doctrine, if doctrine it can be called, are the only certain existences in
                    nature; and, lastly, it is known that one clear experience is a sufficient
                    foundation for this unshaken confidence and anticipation. General custom can
                    never, upon Mr Hume’s principles, give superior vivacity to any particular
                    idea.</p>
                <p>This certain nonentity of it as a separate object of observation, and this
                    impossibility to derive the notion of necessary and causal connection between
                    the events of the universe from any source, have induced two of the most acute
                    philosophers of Europe, Leibnitz and Malebranche, to deny that there is any such
                    connection, and to assert that the events of the universe go on in corresponding
                    trains, but without any causal connection, just as a well-regulated clock will
                    keep time with the motions of the heavens, without any kind of dependence upon
                    them. This harmony ¢f <pb break="no" facs="nls:193496768"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-6768-0437"/>events was pre-established by the Author of the
                    universe, in subserviency to the purposes he had in view in its formation; and
                    all those purposes which are cognisable by us may certainly be accomplished by
                    this perfect adjustment. But without insisting on the fantastical wildness of
                    this ingenious whim, it is quite enough to observe, that it also is a begging of
                    the question, because it supposes causation when it ascribes all to the agency
                    of the Deity.</p>
                <p>Thus have we searched every quarter, without being able to find a source from
                    which to derive this perception of a necessary connection amongst the events of
                    the universe, or of this confident expectation of the continuance of physical
                    laws; and yet we are certain of the feeling, and of the persuasion, be its
                    origin what it may; for we speak intelligibly on this subject. We speak
                    familiarly of cause, effect, power, energy, necessary connection, motives and
                    their influence, argument and conviction, reasons and persuasion, allurements
                    and emotions, of gravity, magnetism, irritability, &amp;c.; and we carry on
                    conversations on these subjects with much entertainment and seeming instruction.
                    Language is the expression of thought, and every word expresses some notion or
                    conception of the mind; therefore it must be allowed that we have such notions
                    as are expressed by cause, power, energy. But it is here, as in many cases, we
                    perceive a distinction without being able to express it by a definition; and
                    that we do perceive the relation of causation as distinct from all others, and
                    in particular as distinct from the relation of contiguity in time and place, or
                    the relation of agent, action, and patient, must be concluded from the
                    uniformity of language, which never confounds them except on purpose, and when
                    it is perceived. But even here we shall find, that none of the terms used for
                    expressing those powers of substance which are conceived as the causes of their
                    characteristic phenomena, really express any thing different from the phenomena
                    themselves. Let any person try to define the terms gravity, elasticity,
                    sensibility, and the like, and he will find that the definition is nothing but a
                    description of the phenomena itself. The words are all derivatives, most of them
                    verbal derivatives, implying action, gravitation, and so on. As the general
                    resemblances in shape, colour, or otherwise, are expressed by the natural
                    historian by generic terms, so the general resemblances in event are expressed
                    by the philosopher in generic propositions, which, in the progress of
                    cultivation, are also abbreviated into generic terms.</p>
                <p>This abundantly explains the consistency of our language on this subject, both
                    with itself and the operations of nature, without, however, affording any
                    argument for the truth of the assumption, that causes are the objects of
                    philosophical research as separate existences; or that this supposed necessary
                    connection is a <hi rend="italic">necessary truth,</hi> whether supreme or
                    subordinate. But since the perception of it has its foundation in the
                    constitution of the human mind, it seems entitled to the name of a <hi
                    rend="italic">first principle.</hi> We are hardly allowed to doubt of this, when
                    we consider the importance of it, and the care of nature to secure us, in all
                    things essential to our safety and well-being, from all danger, from
                    inattention, ignorance, or indolence, by an instinct infallible in its
                    information and instantaneous in its decisions. “It would not be like her usual
                    care,” says Hume, “if this operation of the mind, by which we infer like effects
                    from like causes, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> were intrusted to the
                    fallacious deduction of our reason, which is slow in its operations, appears not
                    in any degree during the first years of infancy, and in every age and period of
                    human life is extremely liable to error. It is more conformable to her <hi
                    rend="italic">ordinary caution</hi> to secure so necessary an act of the mind by
                    some instinct, or blind tendency, which may be infallible and rapid in all its
                    operations, may discover itself at the first appearance of life, and may be
                    independent of all the laboured deductions of reason. As she has taught us the
                    use of our limbs, without giving us any knowledge of the nerves and muscles by
                    which they are actuated; so she has implanted in us an instinct, which carries
                    forward the thought in a course conformable to that established among external
                    objects, though we be ignorant of the powers and forces on which this regularity
                    depends.”</p>
                <p>Such a knowledge is quite unnecessary, and therefore causes are no more
                    cognisable by our intellectual powers than colours by a man born blind; nay,
                    whoever will be at the pains to consider this matter agreeably to the received
                    rules and maxims of logic, will find that necessary connection, or the bond of
                    causation, can no more be the subject of philosophical discussion by man than
                    the ultimate nature of truth. It is precisely the same absurdity or incongruity
                    as to propose to examine light with a microscope. Other rational creatures may
                    perceive them as easily as we hear sounds. All that we can say is, that their
                    existence is probable, but by no means certain. Nay, it may be, though we may
                    never know it, that we are not the efficient causes of our own actions, which
                    may be effected by the Deity or by ministering spirits; and this may even be
                    true in the material world. But all this is indifferent to the real occupation
                    of the philosopher, and does not affect either the certainty, the extent, or the
                    utility of the knowledge which he may acquire.</p>
                <p>We are now able to appreciate the high pretensions of the philosopher, and his
                    claim to scientific superiority. We now see that this can neither be founded on
                    any scientific superiority of his object, nor of his employment. His object is
                    not causes, and his discoveries are nothing but the discovery of general facts,
                    the discovery of. physical laws; and his employment is the same with that of the
                    descriptive historian. He observes and describes with care and accuracy the
                    events of nature; and then he groups them into classes, in consequence of
                    resembling circumstances, detected in the midst of many others which are
                    dissimilar and occasional. By gradually throwing out more circumstances of
                    resemblance, he renders liis classes more extensive; and by carefully marking
                    those circumstances in which the resemblance is observed, he characterizes all
                    the different classes; and by a comparison of these with each other, in respect
                    to the number of resembling circumstances, he distributes his classes according
                    to their generality and subordination; thus exhausting the whole assemblage, and
                    leaving nothing unarranged but accidental varieties. In this procedure it is to
                    be remarked, that every grouping of similar events is, <hi rend="italic">ipso
                    facto,</hi> discovering a general fact, a physical law; and the expression of
                    this assemblage is the expression of the physical law. And as every observation
                    of this constancy of fact affords an opportunity for exerting the instinctive
                    inference of natural connection between the related subjects, every such
                    observation is the discovery of a power, property, or quality of natural
                    substance. From what has been said, this observation of event is all we know of
                    the connection, all we know of the natural power. And when the philosopher
                    proceeds farther to the arrangement of events, according to their various
                    degrees of complication, he is, <hi rend="italic">ipso facto,</hi> making an
                    arrangement of all natural powers according to their various degrees of
                    subordinate influence. Thus his occupation is perfectly similar to that of the
                    descriptive historian, namely, classification and arrangement; and this
                    constitutes all the science attainable by both.</p>
                <p>Philosophy may therefore be defined the study of the phenomena of the universe,
                    with a view to discover the general laws which indicate the powers of natural
                    substances, to explain subordinate phenomena, and to improve art; or, in
                    compliance with that natural instinct so much spoken of, philosophy is the study
                    of the phenomena of the universe, with a view to discover their causes, to
                    explain subordinate phenomena, and to improve art. The task is undoubtedly <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193496781" xml:id="kp-eb0717-6781-0438"/> difficult, and
                    will exercise our noblest powers. The employment is manly in itself, and the
                    result of it important. It therefore justly merits the appellation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophy,</hi> although its objects are nowise different from
                    what occupy the attention of other men.</p>
                <p>The employment of the philosopher, like that of the natural historian, is
                    threefold, viz. <hi rend="italic">description, arrangement,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">reference</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whilst the objects are not
                    <hi rend="italic">things,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">events.</hi> The
                    description, when employed about events, may be more properly termed <hi
                    rend="italic">history.</hi> A philosophical history of nature consists in a
                    complete or copious enumeration and narration of facts, properly selected,
                    cleared of all unnecessary or extraneous circumstances, and accurately narrated.
                    This constitutes the materials of philosophy. We cannot give abetter example of
                    this branch of philosophical occupation than astronomy. From the beginning of
                    the Alexandrian school to this day, astronomers have been at immense pains in
                    observing the heavenly bodies, in order to detect their true motions. This has
                    been a work of prodigious difficulty; for the appearances are such as might have
                    been exhibited although the real motions had been extremely different. Not that
                    our senses give us false information; but we form hasty, and frequently false
                    judgments, from these informations; and call those things deceptions of sense,
                    which are in fact errors of judgment. But the true motions have at last been
                    discovered, and have been described with such accuracy, that the history may be
                    considered as nearly complete. This is to be found in the usual systems of
                    astronomy, where the tables contain a most accurate and synoptical account of
                    the motion, so that we can tell with precision in what point of the heavens a
                    planet has been seen at any instant that can be named.</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton’s Optics is such another perfect model of philosophical history,
                    as far as it goes. This part of philosophy may be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phenomenology.</hi> Having in this manner obtained the materials of
                    philosophical description, we must put them into a compendious and perspicuous
                    form, so that a general knowledge of the universe may be easily acquired and
                    firmly retained. This is to be done by classification and arrangement, and this
                    classification must proceed upon resemblances observed in the events; and the
                    subsequent arrangement must be regulated by the distinctions of which those
                    resemblances are still susceptible. This assemblage of events into groups must
                    be expressed. They arc facts, therefore the expression must be propositions.
                    These propositions must be what the logicians call general or abstract
                    propositions; for they express, not any individual fact of the assemblage, but
                    that circumstance in which they all resemble. Such propositions are the
                    following: Proof is accompanied by belief; kindness is accompanied by gratitude;
                    impulse is accompanied by motion. These are usually called general facts, but
                    there are none such; every fact is individual. This language, however
                    inaccurate, is very safe from misconstruction, and we may use it without
                    scruple. These propositions are <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">physical laws,</hi> and then the detecting or marking those
                    resemblances in event is the investigation of physical laws; and we may
                    denominate this employment of the philosopher <hi rend="italic"
                    >Investigation.</hi></p>
                <p>In the prosecution of this task, it will be found that the similarities of fact
                    are of various extent. And thus we shall form physical laws of various extent,
                    and we shall also find that some are subordinate to others; for the resemblance
                    of a number of facts in one circumstance does not hinder a part of them from
                    also resembling in another circumstance; and thus we shall find subordinations
                    of fact in the same way as of quiescent qualities. And it is found here, as in
                    natural history, that our assemblage of resembling events will be the more
                    extensive as the number of resembling circumstances is smaller; and thus we
                    shall have kingdoms, classes, orders, genera, and species of phenomena, which
                    are expressed by physical laws of all those different ranks.</p>
                <p>It has already been observed, that this observation of physical laws is always
                    accompanied by a reference of that uniformity of event to a natural bond of
                    union between the concomitant facts which is conceived by us as the cause of
                    this concomitancy; and therefore this procedure of the philosopher is considered
                    as the discovery of those causes, that is, the discovery of those powers of
                    natural substances which constitute their physical relations, and may justly be
                    called their distinguishing qualities or properties. This view of the matter
                    gives rise to a new nomenclature and language# We give to those powers generic
                    names, such as sensibility, intelligence, irritability, gravity, elasticity,
                    fluidity, magnetism, and the like. These terms, without exception, mark
                    resembling circumstances of event; and no other definition can be given of them
                    except a description of these circumstances. In a few cases which have been the
                    subjects of more painful or refined discussion, we have proceeded farther in
                    this abbreviation of language.</p>
                <p>We have framed the verb “to gravitate,” and also the verbal noun “gravitation,”
                    which purely expresses the fact, the phenomenon, but is conceived to express the
                    operation or energy of the cause or natural power. It is of importance to keep
                    in mind this metaphysical remark on these terms; for a want of attention to the
                    pure meaning of the words has frequently occasioned very great mistakes in
                    philosophical science. We may with propriety call this part of the philosopher’s
                    employment <hi rend="italic">Aitiology.</hi></p>
                <p>We shall give an instance of its most successful application to the class of
                    events already adduced as an example of philosophical history or phenomenology.
                    Kepler, a celebrated Prussian astronomer, having maturely considered the
                    phenomena recorded in the tables and observations of his predecessors,
                    discovered, amidst all the varieties of the planetary motions, three
                    circumstances of resemblance, which are now known by the name of Kepler’s Laws.
                    I. All the planets describe ellipses, having the sun in one focus. 2. The
                    elliptical areas described by a planet in the different parts of its orbit are
                    proportional to the times of description. 3. The squares of the periodic times
                    are proportional to the cubes of the mean distances from the sun. By this
                    observation or discovery, the study of the planetary motions was greatly
                    promoted, and the calculation of their appearances was now made with a facility
                    and an accuracy which surpassed all hopes; for the calculation of the place of a
                    planet at any proposed instant was reduced to the geometrical problem of cutting
                    off an area from an ellipse of known dimensions, which should bear the same
                    proportion to the whole area, as the time for the duration of which the motion
                    is required has to the known time of a complete revolution.</p>
                <p>Long after this discovery of Kepler, Sir Isaac Newton found that these laws of
                    Kepler were only particular cases of a fact or law still more general. He found
                    that the deflections of the planets from uniform rectilineal motion were all
                    directed to the sun; and that the simultaneous deflections were inversely
                    proportional to the squares of the distances from that body. Thus was
                    established a physical law of vast extent. But further observation showed him,
                    that the motion of every body of the solar system was compounded of an original
                    motion of projection, combined with a deflection towards every other body; and
                    that the simultaneous deflections were proportional to the quantity of matter in
                    the body towards which they were directed, and to the reciprocal of the square
                    of the distance from it. Thus was the law made still more general. But he did
                    not stop here. He compared the deflection of the moon in her orbit with the
                    simultaneous deflection of a stone thrown from the hand, and describing a
                    parabola; and he found that they followed the same law, that is, that the
                    deflection of the moon in a second, was to that of the stone in the same time,
                    as the square of the stone’s distance from the centre of the earth <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193496794" xml:id="kp-eb0717-6794-0439"/> to the square of
                    the moon’s distance from it. Hence he concluded, that the deflection of a stone
                    from a straight line was just a particular instance of the deflections which
                    took place throughout the whole solar system. The deflection of a stone is one
                    of the indications it gives of its being <hi rend="italic">gravis</hi> or heavy,
                    whence he calls it <hi rend="italic">gravitation.</hi> He therefore expresses
                    the physical law which obtains throughout the whole solar system by saying that
                    “every body <hi rend="italic">gravitates</hi> to every other body; and the
                    gravitations are proportional to the quantity of matter in that other body, and
                    inversely proportional to the square of the distance from it.”</p>
                <p>Thus we see how the arrangement of the celestial phenomena terminated in the
                    discovery of physical laws; and that the expression of this arrangement is the
                    law itself. Since the fall of a heavy body is one instance of the physical law,
                    and since this fall is considered by all as the effect of its <hi rend="italic"
                    >weight,</hi> and this weight is considered as the cause of the fall, the same
                    cause is assigned for all the deflections observed in the solar system, and all
                    the matter in it is found to be under the influence of this cause, or to be
                    heavy; and thus his doctrine has been denominated the <hi rend="italic">system
                    of universal gravitation.</hi></p>
                <p>Philosophers have gone farther, and supposed that gravity is a power, property,
                    or quality, residing in all the bodies of the solar system. Sir Isaac Newton
                    does not expressly say so, at least in that work where he gives an account of
                    these discoveries. He contents himself with the immediate consequence of the
                    first axiom in natural philosophy, viz. that every body remains in a state of
                    rest, or of uniform rectilineal motion, unless affected by some moving force.
                    Since the bodies of the solar system are neither in a state of rest, nor of
                    uniform rectilineal motion, they must be considered as so affected; that is,
                    that there operates on every one of them a moving force, directed towards all
                    the others, and having the proportions observed in the deflection.</p>
                <p>Other philosophers have endeavoured to show, that this general fact, detected by
                    Sir Isaac Newton, is included in another still more general, viz. that every
                    body moves which is impelled by another body in motion. They assert, that all
                    the bodies of the solar system are continually impelled by means of a fluid
                    which they call <hi rend="italic">ether,</hi> which is moving in all places, and
                    in all directions, or in circular vortices, and hurries along with it the
                    planets and all heavy bodies. It would seem that the familiarity of motion
                    produced by impulse, at least in those instances in which our own exertions are
                    most employed, has induced philosophers to adopt such notions; perhaps, too,
                    they are influenced by an obscure and indistinct notion affixed to the term
                    action, as applied to changes in the material world, and which has given rise to
                    an axiom, “that a body cannot act at a distance, or where it is not,” and thus
                    have thought themselves obliged to look out for an immediate and contiguous
                    agent in all these phenomena.</p>
                <p>But the philosophers who profess to be most scrupulous in their adherence to the
                    rules of philosophic discussion deny the legitimacy of this pretended
                    investigation of causes, saying that this doctrine is in direct opposition to
                    the procedure of the mind in acquiring the knowledge of causes. Since the fact
                    of impulse is not really observed in the celestial deflections, nor in the
                    motions of heavy bodies, the law cannot be inferred. They say that it is not
                    even necessary to show that the phenomena of the celestial motions are unlike
                    the phenomena of impulse, although this can be done in the completest manner. It
                    is enough that neither the fluid nor the impulse are observed; and therefore
                    they are in the right when they assert that there is inherent in, or
                    accompanies, all the bodies of the system, a power by which they deflect to one
                    another. The debate is foreign to our present purpose, which is only to show how
                    the observation and arrangement of phenomena terminate in the discovery of their
                    causes, or the discovery of the powers or properties of natural substances. This
                    is a task of great difficulty, as it is of great importance.</p>
                <p>There are two chief causes of this difficulty. 1. In most of the spontaneous
                    phenomena of nature there is a complication of many events, and some of them
                    escape our observation. Attending only to the most obvious or remarkable, we
                    conjoin these only in our imagination, and are apt to think these the
                    concomitant events in nature, the proper indication of the cause, and the
                    subjects of this philosophical relation, and to suppose that they are always
                    conjoined by nature. Thus it was thought that there resided in a vibrating chord
                    a power by which the sensation of sound was excited, or that a chord had a
                    sounding quality. But it appears clearly from observation that there is an
                    inconceivable number of events interposed between the vibration of the chord and
                    the sensitive affection of our ear; and therefore, that sound is not the effect
                    of the vibration of the chord, but of the very last event of this series; and
                    this is completely demonstrated by showing that the vibration and the sound are
                    not necessarily connected, because they are not always connected, but require
                    the interposition of air or of some other elastic body. These observations show
                    the necessity of the most accurate and minute observation of the phenomena, that
                    none of those intermediate events may escape us, and we be thus exposed to the
                    chance of imaginary connections between events which are really far asunder in
                    the procedure of nature. As the study has improved, mistakes of this kind have
                    been corrected; and philosophers have become careful to make their trains of
                    events under one name as short as possible. Thus, in medicine, a drug is no
                    longer considered as a specific remedy for the disease which is sometimes cured
                    when it has been used, but is denominated by its most immediate operation on the
                    animal frame; it is no longer called a febrifuge, but a sudorific.</p>
                <p>2. When many natural powers combine their influence in a spontaneous phenomenon
                    of nature, it is frequently very difficult to discover what part of the
                    complicated effect is the effect of each; and to state those circumstances of
                    similarity which are the foundation of a physical law, or entitle us to infer
                    the agency of any natural power. The •most likely method for insuring success in
                    such cases is to get rid of this complication of event, by putting the subject
                    into such a situation that the operation of all the known powers of nature shall
                    be suspended, or so modified as that we may perfectly understand their effects.
                    We can thus appreciate the effects of such as we could neither modify nor
                    suspend, or we can discover the existence of a new law, the operation of a new
                    power.</p>
                <p>This, which is called <hi rend="italic">making an experiment,</hi> is, of all,
                    the most effectual way of advancing in the knowledge of nature, and it has been
                    called <hi rend="italic">Experimental Philosophy.</hi> It seems, however, at
                    first sight, in direct opposition to the procedure of nature in forming general
                    laws. These are formed by induction from multitudes of individual facts, and
                    must be affirmed to no greater extent than the induction on which they are
                    founded. Yet it is a matter of fact, a physical law of human thought, that one
                    simple, clear, and unequivocal experiment gives us the most complete confidence
                    in the truth of a general conclusion from it to every similar case. Whence this
                    anomaly? It is not an anomaly or contradiction of the general maxim of
                    philosophical investigation, but the most refined application of it. There is no
                    law more general than this, that “Nature is constant in all her operations.” The
                    judicious and simple form of our experiment insures us in the complete knowledge
                    of all the circumstances of the event. Upon this supposition, and upon this
                    alone, we consider the experiment as the faithful representative of every
                    possible case of the conjunction. This will be more minutely considered
                    afterwards.</p>

                <p>The last branch of philosophical occupation is the explanation of subordinate
                    phenomena. This is nothing more than the referring any particular phenomenon to
                    that class in which it is included; or, in the language of philosophy, it is the
                    pointing out the general law, or that general fact of which the phenomenon is a
                    particular instance. Thus the feeling of the obligations of virtue is thought to
                    be explained when it is shown to be a particular case of that regard which every
                    person has for his dearest interests. The rise of water in pumps is explained
                    when we show it to be a particular case of the pressure of fluids, or of the
                    air. The general law under which we show it to be properly arranged is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">principle</hi> of the explanation, and the explanation
                    itself is called the <hi rend="italic">theory</hi> of the phenomenon. Thus
                    Euler’s explanation of the lunar irregularities is called a theory of the lunar
                    motions on the principle of gravitation. This may be done either in order to
                    advance our own knowledge of nature, or to communicate it to others. If done
                    with the first view, we must examine the phenomenon minutely, and endeavour to
                    detect every circumstance in it, and thus discover all the known laws of nature
                    which concur in its production; we then appreciate the operation of each,
                    according to the circumstances of its exertion; we then combine all these, and
                    compare the result with the phenomenon. If they are similar, we have explained
                    the phenomenon. We cannot give a better example than Franklin’s explanation of
                    the phenomena of thunder and lightning.</p>
                <p>If we explain a phenomenon from known principles, we proceed synthetically from
                    the general law already established and known to exert its influence in the
                    present instance. We state this influence both in kind and degree, according to
                    the circumstances of the case; and having combined them, we compare the result
                    with the phenomenon, and show their agreement, and thus it is explained. Thus,
                    because all the bodies of the solar system mutually gravitate, the moon
                    gravitates to the sun as well as to the earth, and is continually, and in a
                    certain determinate manner, deflected from that part which she would describe
                    did she gravitate only to the earth. Her motion round the earth will be retarded
                    during the first and third quarters of her orbit, and accelerated during the
                    second and fourth. Her orbit and her period will be increased during our winter,
                    and diminished during our summer. Her apogee will advance, and her nodes will
                    recede; the inclination of her orbit will be greatest when the nodes are in
                    syzigee, and least when they are in quadrature; and all these variations will be
                    in certain precise degrees. Then we show that all these things actually obtain
                    the lunar motions, and they arc considered as explained.</p>
                <p>This summary account of the object and employment in all philosophical discussion
                    is sufficient for pointing out its place in the circle of the sciences, and will
                    serve to direct us to the proper methods of prosecuting it with success. Events
                    are its object; and they are considered as connected with each other by
                    causation, which may therefore be called the philosophical relation of things.
                    The following may be adopted as the fundamental proposition on which all
                    philosophical discussion proceeds, and under which every philosophical
                    discussion or discovery may be arranged :— “Every change that we observe in the
                    state or condition of things <hi rend="italic">is considered by us</hi> as an
                    effect, indicating the agency, characterizing the kind, and determining the
                    degree of its <hi rend="italic">inferred</hi> cause.”</p>
                <p>As thus enounced, this proposition is evidently a physical law of human thought.
                    It may be enounced as a necessary and independent truth, by saying that every
                    change in the state and condition of things <hi rend="italic">is an effect,</hi>
                    &amp;c. And accordingly it has been so enounced by Dr Reid;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Essays on the Intellectual Powers of
                    Man.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> L</hi> and its title to this denomination
                    has been abundantly supported by him. But we have no occasion to consider it as
                    possessing this quality. We are speaking of philosophy, which is something
                    contingent, depending on the existence and constitution of an intellectual being
                    such as man; and, in conformity to the view which we have endeavoured to give of
                    human knowledge in the subjects of philosophical relation, it is quite
                    sufficient for our purpose that we maintain its title to the rank of an
                    universal law of human thought. This will make it a first principle, even
                    although it may not be a necessary truth.</p>
                <p>All the proof necessary for this purpose is universality of fact; and we believe
                    this to be without exception. We are not to expect that all mankind have made,
                    or will ever make, a formal declaration of their opinion; but we may venture to
                    say that all have made it, and continually do make it, virtually. What have the
                    philosophers of all ages been employed about except the discovery of the causes
                    of those changes that are incessantly going on? “Nil turpius physico” says
                    Cicero, “quam fieri sine causa quidquam dicere.” Human curiosity has been
                    directed to nothing so powerfully and so constantly as to this. Many absurd
                    causes have been assigned for the phenomena of the universe; but no set of men
                    have ever said that they happened without a cause. This is so repugnant to all
                    our propensities and instincts, that even the atheistical philosophers, who, of
                    all others, would have profited most by the doctrine, have never thought of
                    advancing it. To avoid so shocking an absurdity, they have rather allowed that
                    chance, and the concourse of atoms, are the causes of the beautiful arrangements
                    of nature. The thoughtless vulgar are no less solicitous than the philosophers
                    to discover the cause of things; and the poet expresses the natural and
                    instinctive passion of all men when he says,</p>
                <p>Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.</p>
                <p>And this anxiety is not to nourish, but to get rid of superstitious fears; for
                    thus metus omnes, et inexorabile fatum</p>
                <p>Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari.</p>
                <p>Had men never speculated, their conduct alone gives sufficient evidence of the
                    universality of the opinion. The whole conduct of man is regulated by it, nay,
                    almost wholly proceeds upon it, in the most important matters, and where
                    experience seems to leave us in doubt; and to act otherwise, as if any thing
                    whatever happened without a cause, would be a declaration of insanity. Dr Reid
                    has beautifully illustrated this truth, by observing, that even a child will
                    laugh at you if you try to persuade him that the top, which he misses from the
                    place where he left it, was taken away by nobody. You may persuade him that it
                    was taken away by a fairy or a spirit; but he believes no more about this nobody
                    than the master of the house, when <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is told that nobody
                    was the author of any piece of theft or mischief. What opinion would be formed,
                    says Dr Reid, of the intellects of the juryman, on a trial for murder by persons
                    unknown, who should say that the fractured skull, the watch and money gone, and
                    other like circumstances, might possibly have no cause? He would be pronounced
                    insane or corrupted.</p>
                <p>We believe that Mr Hume is the first author who has ventured to call the truth of
                    this opinion in question; and even he does it only in the way of mere
                    possibility. He acknowledges the generality of the opinion, and he only objects
                    to the foundation of this generality; and he objects to it merely because it
                    does not quadrate with his theory of belief, and therefore it may happen that
                    some men may have no such opinion. But it must be observed on this occasion<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193496820" xml:id="kp-eb0717-6820-0441"/>, that the opinion
                    of a philosopher is of no greater weight in a case like this than that of a
                    ploughboy. If it be a first principle, directing the opinions and actions of
                    all, it must operate on the minds of all. The philosopher is the only person who
                    may chance to be without it; for it requires much labour, and long habits
                    resolutely maintained, to warp our natural sentiments; and experience shows us
                    that they may be warped if we are at sufficient pains. It is also worthy of
                    remark, that this philosopher seems as much under the influence of this law as
                    ordinary mortals. It is only when he is aware of its not tallying with his other
                    doctrines that his scruples appear. Observe how he speaks when off his guard:
                    “As to those impressions which arise from the senses, their ultimate cause is,
                    in my opinion, perfectly inexplicable by human reason; and it will always be
                    impossible to decide with certainty whether they arise immediately from the
                    object, are produced by the creative power of the mind, or are derived from the
                    Author of our being.”</p>
                <p>Amongst these alternatives he never thought of their not being derived from any
                    cause. But it is not enough to show that this is a physical law of the human
                    mind. We have assumed it as a first principle, the foundation of a whole
                    science, and therefore not included in or derived from any thing more general.
                    Mr Hume’s endeavours to prove that it is not a necessary truth, show with
                    sufficient evidence that most attempts to derive it in the way of argument are
                    <hi rend="italic">petitiones principii</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a thing very
                    commonly met with in all attempts to prove first principles. It cannot be proved
                    by induction of facts that every event has a cause, because induction always
                    supposes an observed fact or event Now in by far the greater number of events
                    the causes are unknown. Perhaps in no event whatever do we know the real cause,
                    or that power or energy which, without any intervention, produces the effect. No
                    man can say that, in the simplest event which he ever observed, he was fully
                    apprised of every circumstance which concurred to its production. We suppose
                    that no event in nature can be adduced more simple than the motion of a
                    suspended glass ball when gently struck by another glass ball; and we imagine
                    that most of our readers will say that they perfectly see every thing which
                    happens in this phenomenon. We believe, too, that most of our readers are of
                    opinion that a body is never put in motion but by the impulse of another, except
                    in the cases of animal motion; and that they are disposed to imagine that
                    magnets put iron in motion, and that an electrified body moves another, by means
                    of an interposed though invisible fluid somehow circulating round them. Now we
                    must inform such readers, that unless the stroke has been very smart, so smart
                    indeed as to shatter the glass balls, the motion of the suspended ball was
                    produced without impulse; that is, the two balls were not in contact during the
                    stroke, and the distance between them was not less than the nine thousandth part
                    of an inch, and probably much greater. We must say farther, that it is not
                    certain that even the violent stroke, such as would shatter them to pieces, is
                    enough to bring them into real contact.</p>
                <p>Unless, therefore, our readers are willing to allow that the suspended ball was
                    put in motion by a repulsive force inherent in one or both balls, they must
                    acknowledge that they, do not fully know all the circumstances of this so simple
                    phenomenon, or all the train of events which happen in it; and therefore they
                    are reduced to the necessity of supposing, although they do not see it, an
                    intervening fluid or matter, by the immediate action of the adjoining particles
                    of which the motion is produced.</p>
                <p>This being the case in the simplest phenomenon that we can pitch upon, what shall
                    we say of the numberless multitudes which are incomparably more complex. Must we
                    not acknowledge that the efficient causes, even in the vulgar sense of the word,
                    the immediately preceding events, are unknown, because the conjunctions are not
                    observed; and therefore it cannot be said that it is from experimental induction
                    that this truth gains universal belief. Experience, so far from supporting it as
                    a direct proof, seems rather the strongest argument against it; for we have no
                    ex-perjment of unquestionable authority but the narrow circle of our own power
                    exerted upon our thoughts and actions. And even here there are perhaps cases of
                    change where we cannot say with certainty that we perceive the efficient cause.
                    Nothing seems to remain, therefore, but to allow that this physical law of human
                    judgment is instinctive, a constituent of the human soul, a first principle, and
                    incapable of any other proof than the appeal to the feelings of every man.</p>
                <p>Simply to state, that every change is considered as an effect, is not giving the
                    whole characters of this physical law. The cause is not always, perhaps never,
                    observed, but it is inferred from the phenomena. The inference is therefore in
                    every instance dependent on the phenomenon. The phenomenon is to us the language
                    of nature. It is therefore the sole indication of the cause and of its agency;
                    it is the indication of the very cause, and of no other. The observed change
                    therefore characterizes the cause, and marks its kind. This is confirmed by
                    every word of philosophical language, where, as has already been observed, the
                    names of the inferred powers of nature are nothing but either abbreviated
                    descriptions of the phenomena, or terms which are defined solely by such
                    descriptions. In like manner, the phenomenon determines the cause in a
                    particular degree, and in no other; and we have no immediate measure of the
                    degree of the cause but the phenomenon itself. We take many measures of the
                    cause, it is true; but on examination they will be found not to be immediate
                    measures of the cause, but of the effect. Assuming gravitation as the cause of
                    the planetary deviations from uniform rectilineal motion, we say that the
                    gravitation of the moon is but ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> +θ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ri</hi> th part of the gravitation of a stone thrown from the
                    hand; but we say this only from observing that the deflection of the stone is
                    three thousand six hundred times greater than the simultaneous deflection of the
                    moon. In short, our whole knowledge of the cause is not only founded on our
                    knowledge of the phenomenon, but it is the same. This will be found a remark of
                    immense consequence in the prosecution of philosophical· researches; and a
                    strict attention to it will not only guard us against a thousand mistakes into
                    which the reasoning pride of man would continually lead us, but will also enable
                    us fully to detect may egregious and fatal blunders made in consequence of this
                    philosophical vanity. Nothing can be more evident than that, whenever we are
                    puzzled, it would be folly to continue groping amongst those obscure beings
                    called causes, when we have their prototypes, the phenomena themselves, in our
                    hands.</p>
                <p>Such is the account which may be given of philosophy, the study of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> the works of God, as related by causation. It is of
                    vast extent, reaching from an atom to the glorious Author of the universe, and
                    contemplating the whole connected chain of intelligent, sensitive, and inanimate
                    beings. The philosopher makes use of the descriptions and arrangements of the
                    natural historian as of mighty use to himself in the beginning of his career,
                    confiding in the uniformity of nature, and expecting that similarity in the
                    quiescent properties of things will be accompanied by some resemblances in those
                    more important properties which constitute their mutual dependencies, linking
                    them together in a great and endlessly-ramified chain of events.</p>
                <p>We have endeavoured to ascertain with precision the peculiar province of
                    philosophy, both by means of its object and its mode of procedure. After this it
                    will not require many words to point out the methods for prosecuting the study
                    with expedition and with success. The rules of philosophizing, which Newton
                    premises in his account of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193496833"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-6833-0442"/>planetary motions, which he so scrupulously
                    followed, and with a success which gives them great authority, are all in strict
                    conformity to the view we have now given of the subject.</p>
                <p>The chief rule is, that similar causes are to be assigned to similar phenomena.
                    This is indeed the source of all our knowledge of connected nature; and without
                    it the ¶mi-verse would only present to us an incomprehensible chaos. It is by no
                    means, however, necessary to enjoin this as a maxim for our procedure; it is an
                    instinctive propensity of the human mind. It is absolutely necessary, on the
                    contrary, to caution us in the application of this propensity. We must be
                    extremely confident in the certainty of the resemblance before we venture to
                    make any inference. We are prone to reason from analogy; the very employment is
                    agreeable, and we are ever disposed to embrace opportunities of engaging in it.
                    For this reason we are satisfied with very slight resemblances, and eagerly run
                    over the consequences, as if the resemblance were complete; and our researches
                    frequently terminate in falsehood.</p>
                <p>This propensity to analogical reasoning is aided by another equally strong, and
                    equally useful when properly directed; we mean the propensity to form general
                    laws. This is in fact a propensity to discover causes, which is equivalent to
                    the establishing of general laws. It appears in another form, and is called a
                    love of or taste for simplicity; and this is encouraged or justified, as
                    agreeable to the uniformity and simplicity of nature. “Natura semper sibi
                    similis et consona,” says Newton. “Frustra fit per plura, quod fieri potest per
                    pauciora,” says another. The beautiful, the wise economy of nature, are phrases
                    in every body’s mouth; and Newton enjoins us to adopt no more causes than are
                    sufficient to explain the phenomena. All this is very well, and is true in its
                    own degree; but it is toö frequently the subterfuge of human vanity and
                    self-love. This inordinate admiration of the economy and simplicity of nature is
                    generally conjoined with a manifest love of system, and with the actual
                    production of some new system, where from one general principle some extensive
                    theory or explanation is deduced and offered to the world. The author sees a
                    sort of resemblance between a certain series of phenomena and the consequences
                    of some principle, and thinks the principle adequate to their explanation. Then,
                    on the authority of the acknowledged simplicity of nature, he roundly excludes
                    all other principles of explanation; because, says he, this principle is
                    sufficient, “ct frustra fit per plura,” &amp;c. We could point out many
                    instances of this kind in the writings of perhaps the first mathematician and
                    the poorest philosopher of this century; where extensive theories are thus
                    cavalierly exhibited, which a few years’ examination have shown to be nothing
                    but analogies, indistinctly observed, and, what is worse, inaccurately
                    applied.</p>
                <p>To regulate these hazardous propensities, and thus to keep philosophers in the
                    right path, Newton inculcates another rule, or rather gives a modification of
                    this injunction of simplicity. He enjoins that no cause shall be admitted but
                    what is real. His words are, that “no causes shall be admitted but such as are
                    true, and sufficient to account for the phenomena.” We apprehend that the
                    meaning of this rule has been mistaken by many philosophers, who imagine that by
                    true he means causes which really exist in nature, and are not mere creatures of
                    the imagination. We have met with some who would boggle at the doctrines of
                    Aristotle respecting the planetary motions, viz. that they are carried along by
                    conducting intelligent minds, because we know of none such in the universe; and
                    who would nevertheless think the doctrine of the Cartesian vortices deserving of
                    at least an examination, because we see such vortices exist, and produce effects
                    which have some resemblance to the planetary motions, and have justly rejected
                    them, solely because this resemblance has been very imperfect. We apprehend
                    Newton’s meaning by these words is, that no cause of any event shall be
                    admitted, or even considered, which we do not know to be actually concurring or
                    exerting some influence,in that very event. If this be his meaning, he would
                    reject the Cartesian vortices, and the conducting spirits of Aristotle, for one
                    and the same reason; not because they were not adequate to the explanation, nor
                    because such causes do not exist in nature, but because we did not see them
                    anyhow concerned in the phenomenon under consideration. We neither see a spirit
                    nor a vortex, and therefore need not trouble ourselves with inquiring what
                    effects they would produce. Now we know that this was his very conduct, and what
                    has distinguished him from all philosophers who preceded him, though many, by
                    following his example, have also been rewarded by similar success. This has
                    procured to Newton the character of the modest philosopher; and modest his
                    procedure may, for distinction’s sake, be called, because the contrary procedure
                    of others did not originate so much from ignorance as from vanity. Newton’s
                    conductor in this was not modesty, but sagacity, prudence, caution, and, to say
                    it purely, it was sound judgment.</p>
                <p>For the bonds of nature, the supposed philosophical causes are not observed; they
                    are only inferred from the phenomena. When two substances are observed, and only
                    when they are observed to be connected in any series of events, we infer that
                    they are connected by a natural power; but when one of the substances is not
                    seen, but fancied, no law of human thought produces any inference whatever. For
                    this reason alone Newton stopped short at the last fact which he could discover
                    in the solar system, that all bodies were deflected to all other bodies,
                    according to certain regulations of distance and quantity of matter. When told
                    that he had done nothing in philosophy, that he had discovered no cause, and
                    that to merit any praise he must show how this deflection was produced, he said
                    that he knew no more than he had told them; that he saw nothing causing this
                    deflection, and was contented with haying discovered it so exactly, that a good
                    mathematician could now make tables of the planetary motions as accurate as he
                    pleased, and with hoping in a few years to have every purpose of navigation and
                    of philosophical curiosity completely answered; and he was not disappointed. And
                    when philosophers on all sides were contriving hypothetical fluids and vortices
                    which would produce these deflections, he contented himself with proving the
                    total inconsistency of these explanations with the mechanical principles
                    acknowledged by their authors; showing that they had transgressed both parts of
                    his rule, their causes neither being real, nor sufficient for explaining the
                    phenomena. A cause is sufficient for explaining a phenomenon only when its
                    legitimate consequences are perfectly agreeable to these phenomena.</p>
                <p>Newton’s discoveries remain without any diminution or change; no philosopher has
                    yet advanced a step farther. But let not the authority, nor even the success, of
                    Newton, be our guide. Is his rule founded in reason? It surely is. For if
                    philosophy be the only interpretation of nature’s language, the inference of
                    causes from the phenomena, a fancied or hypothetical phenomenon can produce
                    nothing but a fanciful cause, and can make no addition to our knowledge of real
                    nature.</p>
                <p>All hypotheses therefore must be banished from philosophical discussion as
                    frivolous and useless, administering to vanity alone. As the explanation of any
                    appearance is nothing but the pointing out the general fact, of which this is a
                    particular instance, a hypothesis can give no explanation; knowing nothing of
                    cause and effect but the conjunction of two events, we see nothing of causation
                    where one of the events is hypothetical. Although all the legitimate
                    consequences of a hypothetical principle should be perfectly <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193496846" xml:id="kp-eb0717-6846-0443"/>similar to the phenomenon, it
                    is extremely dangerous to assume this principle as the real cause. It is
                    illogical to make use of the economy of nature as an argument for the truth of
                    any hypothesis; for, if true, it is a physical truth, a matter of fact, and true
                    only to the extent in which it is observed; and we are not entitled to say that
                    it is so one step farther, therefore not in this case till it be observed. But
                    the proposition that nature is so economical, is false; and it is astonishing
                    that it has been so lazily acquiesced in by the readers of hypotheses; for it is
                    not the authors who are deceived by it; they are generally led by their own
                    vanity. Nothing is more observable than the prodigious variety of nature. That
                    the same phenomena may be produced by different means, is well known to the
                    astronomers, who must all grant that the appearances of motion will be precisely
                    the same whether the earth moves round the sun like the other planets, or
                    whether the sun with his attendant planets moves rt)und the earth; and that the
                    demonstration of the first opinion is had from a fact totally unconnected with
                    all the deflections, or even with their causes; for it may be asserted, that Dr
                    Bradley’s discovery of the aberration of the fixed stars, in consequence of the
                    progressive motion of light, was the first thing which put the Copernican system
                    beyond question; and even this is still capable of being explained in another
                    way. The Author of nature seems to delight in variety; and there cannot be named
                    a single purpose on which the most inconceivable fertility in resource is not
                    observed. It is the most delightful occupation of the curious mind and the
                    sensible heart to contemplate the various contrivances of nature in
                    accomplishing similar ends.</p>
                <p>As a principle, therefore, on which to found any maxim of philosophical
                    procedure, this is not only injudicious, because imprudent and apt to mislead,
                    but as false, and almost sure to mislead. In conformity to this observation, it
                    must be added, that nothing has done so much harm in philosophy as the
                    introduction of hypotheses.</p>
                <p>Authors have commonly been satisfied with very slight resemblances, and readers
                    are easily misled by the appearances of reasoning which these resemblances have
                    countenanced. The ancients, and above all Aristotle, were much given to this
                    mode of explanation, and have filled philosophy with absurdities. The slightest
                    resemblances were with them sufficient foundations of theories. It has been by
                    very slow degrees that men have learned caution in this respect; and we are
                    sorry to say that we are not yet cured of the disease of hypothetical
                    systematizing, and to see attempts made by ingenious men to bring the frivolous
                    theories of antiquity again into credit. Nay, modern philosophers, even of the
                    greatest name, are by no means exempted from the reproach of hypothetical
                    theories. Their writings abound in ethers, nervous fluids, animal spirits,
                    vortices, vibrations, and other invisible agents. We may affirm that all these
                    attempts may be shown to be either unintelligible, fruitless, or false. Either
                    the hypothesis has been such that no consequence can be distinctly drawn from
                    it, on account of its obscurity and total want of resemblance to any thing we
                    know; or the just and legitimate consequences of the hypothesis are inconsistent
                    with the phenomena. This is remarkably the case in the hypotheses which have
                    been introduced for the explanation of the mechanical phenomena of the universe.
                    These can be examined by accurate science, and the consequences compared without
                    any mistake; and nothing else but a perfect agreement should induce us even to
                    listen to any hypothesis whatever.</p>
                <p>It may be here asked, Whether, in the case of the most perfect agreement, after
                    the most extensive comparison, the hypothesis should be admitted? We believe
                    that this must be left to the feelings of the mind. When the belief is
                    irresistible, we can reason no more. But as there is no impossibility of as
                    perfect an agreement with some other hypothesis, it is evident that it does not
                    convey an irrefragable title to our hypothesis. It is said, that such an
                    agreement authorizes the reception of the hypothetical theory, in the same
                    manner as we must admit that to be the true cipher of a letter which will make
                    perfect sense of it. But this is not true. In deciphering a letter we know the
                    sounds which must be represented by the characters, and that they are really the
                    constituents of speech; but in hypothetical explanations the first principle is
                    not known to exist; nay, it is possible to make two ciphers, each of which shall
                    give a meaning to the letter. Instances of this are to be seen in treatises on
                    the art of deciphering.</p>
                <p>We conclude our criticism on hypothetical explanations with this observation,
                    that it is <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> that they can make any addition to
                    our knowledge. In every hypothesis we thrust in an intermediate event between
                    the phenomenon and some general law; and this event is not seen, but supposed.
                    Therefore, according to the true maxims of philosophical investigation, we give
                    no explanation; for we are not by this means enabled to assign the general law
                    in which this particular phenomenon is included. Nay, the hypothesis makes no
                    addition whatever to our list of general laws; for our hypotheses must be
                    selected, in order to tally with all the phenomena. The hypothesis therefore is
                    understood only by and in the phenomena, and it must not be made more general
                    than the phenomena themselves. The hypothesis gives no generalization of facts.
                    Its very application is founded on a great coincidence of facts; and the
                    hypothetical fact is thrust in between two which we really observe to be united
                    by nature. The applicability, therefore, of the hypothesis is not more extensive
                    than the similarity of facts which we observe, and the hypothetical law is not
                    more general than the observed law. Let us then throwaway entirely the
                    hypothetical law, and insert the observed one in our list of general laws; it
                    will be in different language from the hypothetical law, but it will express the
                    same facts in nature.</p>
                <p>It is in experimental philosophy alone that hypotheses can have any just claim to
                    admission; and here they are not admitted as explanations, but as conjectures
                    serving to direct our line of experiments. Effects only appear; and by their
                    appearance, and the previous information of experience, causes are immediately
                    ascertained by the perfect similarity of the whole train of events to other
                    trains formerly observed. Or they are suggested by more imperfect resemblances
                    of the phenomena; and these suggestions are made with stronger or fainter
                    evidence, according as the resemblance is more or less perfect. These
                    suggestions do not amount to a confidential inference, and only raise a
                    conjecture. Wishing to verify or overturn this conjecture, we have recourse to
                    experiment; and we put the subject under consideration in such a Situation that
                    we can say what will be the effect of the conjectural cause if real. If this
                    tallies with the appearance, our conjecture has more probability of truth, and
                    we vary the situation, which will produce a new set of effects of the
                    conjectured cause, and so on. It is evident that the’ probability of our
                    conjecture will increase with the increase of the conformity of the legitimate
                    effects of the supposed cause with the phenomena, and that it will be entirely
                    destroyed by one disagreement. In this way conjectures have their great use, and
                    are the ordinary means by which experimental philosophy is improved. But
                    conjectural' systems are worse than nonsense, filling the mind with false
                    notions of nature, and generally leading us into a course of improper conduct
                    when they become principles of action. This is acknowledged even by the abettors
                    of hypothetical systems themselves when employed in overturning those of their
                    predecessors, and establishing their own; witness the successive maintainers of
                    the many hypothetical systems in medicine, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193496859"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-6859-0444"/>which have had their short-lived course within
                    these two last centuries. Let every person, therefore, who calls himself a
                    philosopher, resolutely determine to reject all temptations to this kind of
                    system-making, and let him never consider a composition of this kind as any
                    thing better than the amusement of an idle hour.</p>
                <p>After these observations, it cannot require much discussion to mark the mode of
                    procedure which will insure progress in all philosophical investigations. The
                    sphere of our intuitive knowledge being very limited, we must be indebted for
                    the greatest part of our intellectual attainments to our rational powers, and it
                    must be deductive. In the spontaneous phenomena of nature, whether of mind or
                    body, it seldom happens that the energy of that natural power, which is the
                    principle of explanation, is so immediately connected with the phenomenon that
                    we can see the connection at once. Its exertions are frequently concealed, and
                    in all cases modified, by the joint exertions of other natural powers; hence the
                    particular exertion of each must be considered apart, and their mutual
                    connection traced out. It is only in this way that we can discover the perhaps
                    long train of intermediate operations, and also see in what manner and degree
                    the real principle of explanation concurs in the ostensible process of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>In all such cases it is evident that our investigation (and investigation it most
                    strictly is) must proceed by successive steps, conducted by the sure hand of
                    logical method. To take an instance from the material world, let us listen to
                    Galileo whilst he is teaching his friends the cause of the rise of water in a
                    pump. He says that it is owing to the pressure of the air. This is his
                    principle; and he announces it in all its extent. All matter, says he, is heavy,
                    and in particular air is heavy. He then points out the connection of this
                    general principle with the phenomenon. Air being heavy, it must be supported; it
                    must lie and press on what supports it; it must press on the surface AB of the
                    water in the cistern surrounding the pipe CD of the pump; and also on the water
                    C within this pipe. He then takes notice of another general principle which
                    exerts its subordinate influence in this process. Water is a fluid; a fluid is a
                    body the parts of which yield to the smallest impression, and, by yielding, are
                    easily moved amongst themselves; and no little parcel of the fluid can remain at
                    rest unless it be equally pressed in every direction, but will recede from that
                    side where it sustains the greatest pressure. In consequence of this fluidity,
                    known to be a property of water, if any part of it is pressed, the pressure is
                    propagated through the whole; and if not resisted upon every side, the water
                    will move to that side where the propagated pressure is not resisted. All these
                    subordinate or collateral propositions are supposed to be previously
                    demonstrated or allowed. Water, therefore, must yield to the pressure of the
                    air, unless pressed by it upon every side, and must move to that side where it
                    is not withheld by some opposite pressure. He then proceeds to show, frofn the
                    structure of the pump, that there is no opposing pressure on the water in the
                    inside of the pump. “For,” says he, “suppose the piston thrust down till it
                    touches the surface of the water in the pipe; suppose the piston now drawn up by
                    a power sufficient to lift it, and all the air incumbent on it; and suppose it
                    drawn up a foot or fathom, there remains now nothing that I know of to press on
                    the surface of the water. In short,” says he, “gentlemen, it appears to me that
                    the water in the pump is in the same situation that it would be in were there no
                    air at all, but water poured into the cistern to a height AF; such, that the
                    column of water FAB G presses on the surface AB as much as the air does. Now, in
                    this case, we know that the water at C is pressed upwards with a force equal to
                    the weight of a column of water having the section of the pipe for its base and
                    CH for its height. The water below C, therefore, will be pressed up into the
                    pipe CD, and will rise to <hi rend="italic">G,</hi> so that it is on a level
                    with the external water FG; that is, it will rise to H. This is a necessary
                    consequence of the weight and pressure of the incumbent column FABG, and the
                    fluidity of the water in the cistern. Consequences perfectly similar must
                    necessarily follow from the weight and pressure of the air; and therefore, upon
                    drawing up the piston from the surface C of the water with which it was in
                    contact, the water must follow it till it attain that height which will make its
                    own weight a balance for the pressure of the circumambient air. Accordingly,
                    gentlemen, the Italian plumbers inform me that a pump will not raise water quite
                    fifty palms; and from their information I conclude, that a pillar of water fifty
                    palms high is somewhat heavier than a pillar of air of the same base, and
                    reaching to the top of the atmosphere.”</p>
                <p>Thus is the phenomenon explained. The rise of the water in the pump is shown to
                    be a particular case of the general fact in hydrostatics, that fluids in
                    communicating vessels will stand at heights which are inversely as their
                    densities, or that columns of equal weights are in equilibrio. This way of
                    proceeding is called arguing <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> or the synthetical
                    method. It is founded on just principles; and the great progress which we have
                    made in the mathematical sciences by this mode of reasoning shows to what length
                    it may be carried with irresistible evidence. It has long been considered as the
                    only inlet to true knowledge; and nothing was allowed to be known with certainty
                    which could not be demonstrated in this way to be true. Accordingly logic, or
                    the art of reasoning, which was also called the art of discovering truth, was
                    nothing but a set of rules for successfully conducting this mode of
                    argument.</p>
                <p>Under the direction of this infallible guide, it is not surely unreasonable to
                    expect that philosophy should make sure progress towards perfection; and as we
                    know that the brightest geniuses of Athens and of Rome were for ages solely
                    occupied in philosophical researches in every path of human knowledge, it is
                    equally reasonable to suppose that the progress has not only been sure, but
                    great. We have seen that the explanation of an appearance in nature is nothing
                    but the arrangement of it into that general class in which it is comprehended.
                    The class has its distinguishing mark, which, when it is found in the phenomenon
                    under consideration, fixes it in its class, there to remain for ever an addition
                    to our stock of knowledge. Nothing can be lost any other way but by forgetting
                    it; and the doctrines of philosophers must be stable, like the laws of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>We have seen, however, that the very reverse of all this is the case; that
                    philosophy has but very lately emerged from worse than total darkness and
                    ignorance; that what passed under the name of philosophy was nothing but systems
                    of errors, if systems they could be called, which were termed doctrines,
                    delivered with the most imposing apparatus of logical demonstration, but belied
                    in almost every instance by experience, and affording us no assistance in the
                    application of the powers of nature to the purposes of life. Nor will this
                    excite much wonder in the mind of the enlightened reader of the present day, who
                    reflects on the use that in this dialectic process was made of the categories,
                    and the method in which those categories were formed. From first principles so
                    vague in themselves, and so gratuitously assumed, ingenious men might deduce
                    many different conclusions, all equally erroneous; and that this was actually
                    done, no surer evidence can be given, than that hardly a lifetime elapsed when
                    the whole system of doctrines which had captivated the minds of the most
                    penetrating was oftener than once exploded and overturned by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193496872" xml:id="kp-eb0717-6872-0445"/>another system, which
                    flourished for a while, and then was supplanted by a third, which shared the
                    same fate. Here was an infallible proof of their error, for instability is
                    incompatible with truth.</p>
                <p>It is allowed by all that this has been the case in those branches of study at
                    least which contemplate the philosophical relations of the material world; in
                    astronomy, in mechanical philosophy, in chemistry, in physiology, in medicine,
                    in agriculture. It is also acknowledged, that in the course of less than two
                    centuries we have acquired much knowledge respecting these very subjects, call
                    it philosophy, or by what name you will; so much more conformable to the natural
                    course of things, that the deductions made from it by the same rules of the
                    synthetic method are more conformable to fact, and therefore better fitted to
                    direct our conduct and improve our powers. It is also certain that these bodies
                    of doctrine which go by the name of philosophical systems have much more
                    stability than in ancient times; and though sometimes in part superseded, they
                    are seldom or never wholly exploded.</p>
                <p>This cannot perhaps be affirmed with equal confidence respecting those
                    speculations which have our intellect or propensities for their object: And we
                    have not perhaps attained such a representation of human nature as will bear
                    comparison with the original, nor will the legitimate deductions from such
                    doctrines be of much more service to us for directing our conduct than those of
                    ancient times; for whilst we observe this difference between these two general
                    classes of speculations, we may remark, that it is conjoined .with a difference
                    in the manner of conducting the study. We have proceeded according to the old
                    Aristotelian method when investigating the nature of mind; yet we see the
                    material philosophers running about, passing much of their time away from books
                    in the shop of the artisan, or in the open fields engaged in observation,
                    labouring with their hands, and busy with experiments. But the speculatist on
                    the intellect and the active powers of the human soul seems unwilling to be
                    indebted to any thing but his own ingenuity, and his labours are confined to the
                    closet. In the first class, we have met with something like success, and we have
                    improved many arts; in the other, it is to be feared that we are not much wiser,
                    or better, or happier, for all our philosophical attainments.</p>
                <p>Here, therefore, must surely have been some great and fatal mistake. There has
                    indeed been a material defect in our mode of procedure, in the employment of
                    this method of reasoning as an inlet to truth. The fact is, that philosophers
                    have totally mistaken the road of discovery, and have pretended to set out in
                    their investigation from the very point where this journey should have
                    terminated.</p>
                <p>The Aristotelian logic, the syllogistic art, that art so much boasted of as the
                    only inlet to true knowledge, and the only means of discovery, is in direct
                    opposition to the ordinary procedure of nature, by which we every day, and in
                    every action of our lives, acquire knowledge and discover truth. It is not the
                    art of discovering truth; it is the art of communicating knowledge, and of
                    detecting error: it is nothing more than the application of this maxim;
                    “Whatever is true of a whole class of objects, is true of each individual of
                    that class.” This is not a just account of the art of discovering truth, nor is
                    it a complete account of the art of reasoning. Reasoning is the producing of
                    belief; and whatever mode of argumentation invariably and irresistibly produces
                    belief, is reasoning. The ancient logic supposes that all the first principles
                    are already known, and that nothing is wanted but the application of them to
                    particular facts. But were this true, the application of them, as we have
                    already observed, can hardly be called a discovery. But it is not true; and the
                    fact is, that the first principles are generally the chief objects of our
                    research, and that they have come into view only now and then, as it were by
                    accident, and never by the labour of the logician. He indeed can tell us whether
                    we have been mistaken; for if our general principle be true’ it must influence
                    every particular case. If, therefore, it be false in any one of these, it is not
                    a true principle. And it is here that we discover the source of that fluctuation
                    which is so much complained of in philosophy. The authors of systems give a set
                    of consecutive propositions logically deduced from a first principle, which has
                    been hastily adopted, and has no foundation in nature. This does not hinder the
                    amusement of framing a system from it, nor this system from pleasing by its
                    symmetry; and it takes a run: but when an officious follower thinks of making
                    some use of it, which requires the comparison with experience and observation,
                    they are found totally unlike, and the whole fabric must be abandoned as
                    unsound; and thus the successive systems were continually pushing out their
                    predecessors, and presently met with the same treatment.</p>
                <p>How was this to be remedied? The ratiocination was seldom egregiously wrong; the
                    syllogistic art had ere now attained a degree of perfection which left little
                    room for improvement, and was so familiarly understood by the philosophical
                    practitioners, that they seldom committed any great blunders. Must we examine
                    the first principles? This was a task quite new in science; and there were
                    hardly any rules in the received systems of logic to direct us to the successful
                    performance of it. Aristotle, the sagacious inventor of those rules, had not
                    totally omitted it; but, in the fervour of philosophical speculation, he had
                    made little use of them. His fertile genius never was at a loss for first
                    principles, which answered the purpose of verbal disquisition, without much risk
                    of being belied on account of its dissimilitude to nature; for there was
                    frequently no prototype with which his systematic doctrine could be compared.
                    His enthusiastic followers found abundant amusement in following his example;
                    and philosophy, being no longer in the hands of men acquainted with the world,
                    conversant in the great book of nature, was now confined almost entirely to
                    recluse monks, equally ignorant of men and of things. But curiosity was
                    awakened, and the men of genius were fretted as well as disgusted with the
                    disquisitions of the schools, which one moment raised expectations by the
                    symmetry of composition, and the next moment blasted them by their inconsistency
                    with experience. They saw that the best way was to begin <hi rend="italic">de
                    novo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> to throw away the first principles altogether,
                    without exception or examination, and endeavour to find out new ones which
                    should stand the test of logic; or, in other words, should in every case be
                    agreeable to fact.</p>
                <p>Philosophers began to reflect, that under the unnoticed tuition of kind nature we
                    have acquired much useful knowledge. It is therefore highly probable that her
                    method is the most proper for acquiring knowledge, and that by imitating her
                    manner we shall have the like success. We are too apt to slight the occupations
                    of children, whom we may observe continually busy turning every thing over and
                    over, putting them into every situation, and at every distance. We excuse it,
                    saying that it is an innocent amusement; but we should rather say with an
                    ingenious philosopher (Dr Reid), that they are most seriously and rationally
                    employed; they are acquiring the habits of observation, and, by merely indulging
                    an undetermined curiosity, they are making themselves acquainted with
                    surrounding objects; they are struck by similitudes, and amused with mere
                    classification. If some new effect occurs from any of their little plays, they
                    are eager to repeat it. When a child has for the first time tumbled a spoon from
                    the table, and is pleased with its jingling noise upon the floor, if another lie
                    within its reach, it is sure to share the same fate. If the child be indulged in
                    this diversion, it will repeat it with a greediness that deserves our attention.
                    The very first eager repetition shows a confidence in the constancy of natural
                    operations, which we can <pb break="no" facs="nls:193496885"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-6885-0446"/>hardly ascribe wholly to experience; and its
                    keenness to repeat the experiment shows the interest which it takes in the
                    exercise of this most useful propensity. It is beginning the study of nature;
                    and its occupation is the same with that of a Newton computing the motions of
                    the moon by his sublime theory, and comparing his calculus with observation. The
                    child and the philosopher are equally employed in the contemplation of a
                    similarity of event, and are anxious that this similarity shall return. The
                    child, it is true, thinks not of this abstract object of contemplation, but
                    throws down the spoon again to have the pleasure of hearing it jingle. The
                    philosopher suspects that the conjunction of events is the consequence of a
                    general law of nature, and tries an experiment where this conjunction recurs.
                    The child is happy, and eager to enjoy a pleasure which to us appears highly
                    frivolous; but it has the same foundation with the pleasure of the philosopher,
                    who rejoices in the success of his experiment; and the fact, formerly a trifle
                    to both, now acquires importance. Both go on repeating the experiment, till the
                    fact ceases to be a novelty to either; the child is satisfied, and the
                    philosopher has now established a new law of nature.</p>
                <p>Such, says this amiable philosopher, is the education of kind nature, who from
                    the beginning to the end of our lives makes the play of her scholars their most
                    instructive lessons, and has implanted in our mind the curiosity and the
                    inductive propensity by which we are enabled and disposed to learn them. The
                    exercise of this inductive principle, by which nature prompts us to infer
                    general laws from the observation of particular facts, gives us a species of
                    logic new in the schools, but as old as human nature. It is certainly á method
                    of discovery; for by these means general principles, formerly unknown, have come
                    into view.</p>
                <p>Induction is a just and rational logic; for it is founded on, and indeed is only
                    the habitual application of, this maxim, that “Whatever is true with respect to
                    every individual of a class of events, is true of the whole class.” This is just
                    the inverse of the maxim upon which the Aristotelian logic wholly proceeds, and
                    is of equal authority in the court of reason. Indeed, the expression of the
                    general law is only the abbreviated expression of every particular instance.
                    This new logic, therefore, or the logic of induction, must not be considered as
                    subordinate to the old system, or founded upon it. In fact, the use and
                    legitimacy of the Aristotelian logic is founded on the inductive: All animals
                    are mortal; all men are animals; therefore all men are mortal. This is no
                    argument to any person who chooses to deny the mortality of men; for even
                    although he acknowledges his animal nature, he will deny the major
                    proposition.</p>
                <p>It is beside our purpose to show how a point so general, so congenial to man, and
                    so familiar, remained so long unnoticed, although the disquisition is curious
                    and satisfactory. It was not till within these two centuries that the increasing
                    demand for practical knowledge, particularly in the arts, made inquisitive men
                    see how useless and insufficient was the learning of the schools in any road of
                    investigation which was connected with life and business; and observe that
                    society had received useful information chiefly from persons actually engaged in
                    the arts which the speculatists were endeavouring to illustrate; and that this
                    knowledge consisted chiefly of experiments and observations, the only
                    contributions which their authors could make to science.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Novum</hi><hi rend="italic">Organum</hi> of Bacon, which
                    points out the true method of forming a body of real and useful knowledge,
                    namely, the study of nature in the way of description, observation, and
                    experiment, is undoubtedly the noblest present that science ever received. It
                    may be considered as the grammar of nature’s language, and is a counterpart to
                    the logic of Aristotle; not exploding it, but making it effectual. <hi
