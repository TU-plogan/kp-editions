                    articles Music and <hi rend="smallcaps">Organ.)</hi> λVithout entering into
                    useless details regarding the ancient <hi rend="italic">αυ^Kοι</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">tibiae,</hi> we may mention that Strutt, in his Sports and
                    Pastimes of the People of England, gives representations of the pipe and tabor,
                    as used in England in the fourteenth century to accompany a dancing dog, a cock
                    on stilts, a horse rearing, &amp;c. From the drawings we cannot ascertain the
                    nature of the pipe represented. We may, however, suppose it to have been similar
                    to the <hi rend="italic">galoubet</hi> used in France, along with the tabor,
                    from a very remote period. This <hi rend="italic">galoubet</hi> is a small
                    instrument of the flageolet kind. Its use, for more than the last two centuries,
                    has been confined to Provence. It has only three finger-holes, and is played
                    with the left hand, whilst the right beats the tabor, which is attached to the
                    performer. The compass of the <hi rend="italic">galoubet</hi> is two octaves and
                    a tone from D on the third line of the treble clef up to E in <hi rend="italic"
                    >altissimo.</hi> Great skill is required to bring out all the sounds of its
                    compass. Some of the players on this small and imperfect instrument are said to
                    be so dexterous as to be able to perform upon it very difficult pieces of music
                    composed for other instruments, such as the violin, &amp;c. It is always
                    accompanied by the tabor, which is a small drum of a cylindrical form, and
                    rather longer and narrower in its relative proportions than the common drum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pipe,</hi> in building and other employments or arts, a
                    canal, or conduit, for the conveyance of water and other liquids. Pipes for
                    water, water-engines, and the like, are usually of lead, iron, earth, or wood;
                    the latter being usually made of oak or elder. Those of iron are cast in forges,
                    and their usual length is about two feet and a half; several of these being
                    commonly fastened together by means of four screws at each end, with leather or
                    old hat between them to stop the water. Those of earth are made by the potters,
                    and are fitted into one another, one end being always made wider than the other.
                    To join them the closer, and prevent their breaking, they are covered with tow
                    and pitch; their length being usually about that of the iron pipes. The wooden
                    pipes are trees bored with large iron augres, of different sizes, beginning with
                    a less, and then proceeding with a larger successively; the first being pointed,
                    the rest being formed like spoons, increasing in diameter from one to six inches
                    and more. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Boring.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    >Pepper,</hi> a genus of plants belonging to the <hi rend="italic">diandria</hi>
                    class. There are twenty species of <hi rend="italic">piper,</hi> of which the
                    most remarkable is the <hi rend="italic">siriboa,</hi> with oval, heart-shaped,
                    nerved leaves, and reflexed spikes. This is the plant which produces the pepper
                    so much used in food. It is a shrub, the root of which is small, fibrous, and
                    flexible; and it rises into a stem, which requires a tree or prop to support it.
                    Its wood has the same sort of knots as the vine; and when it is dry, it exactly
                    resembles the vine-branch. The leaves, which have a strong smell and a pungent
                    taste, are of an oval shape; but they diminish towards the extremity, and
                    terminate in a point. From the flower-buds, which are white, and are sometimes
                    placed in the middle and sometimes at the extremity of the branches, are
                    produced small berries resembling those of the currant-tree. Each of these
                    contains between twenty and thirty corns of pepper. They are commonly gathered
                    in October, and exposed to the sun seven or eight days. The fruit, which was
                    green at first, and afterwards red, when stripped of its covering assumes the
                    appearance it has when we see it. The largest, heaviest, and least shrivelled,
                    is the best.</p>
                <p>The pepper plant flourishes in the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Ceylon, and more
                    particularly on the Malabar coast. It is not sown, but planted; and great nicety
                    is required in the choice of the shoots. It produces no fruit until the end of
                    three years; but bears so plentifully the three succeeding years, that some
                    plants yield between six and seven pounds of pepper. The bark then begins to
                    shrink; and the shrub declines so fast that in twelve years’ time it ceases
                    bearing.</p>
                <p>The culture of pepper is not difficult. It is sufficient to plant it in a rich
                    soil, and carefully to pull up the weeds that grow in great abundance round its
                    roots, especially the first three years. As the sun is highly necessary to the
                    growth of the pepper plant, when it is ready to bear, the trees that support it
                    must be lopped, to prevent their shade from injuring the fruit. When the season
                    is over, it is proper to crop the head of the plant. Without this precaution
                    there would be too much wood, and little fruit.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">piper amalago,</hi> or black pepper, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">piper ine-quale,</hi> or long pepper of Jamaica, with some other
                    species, are indigenous, and known by the names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >joint-wood,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">peppery elders.</hi> The first bears a
                    small spike·, on which are attached a number of small seeds of the size of
                    mustard. The whole of the plant has the exact taste of the East India black
                    pepper. The long-pepper bush grows taller than the amalago. The leaves are
                    broad, smooth, and shining; and the fruit is similar to the long pepper of the
                    shops, but smaller. The common people in Jamaica season their messes with the
                    black pepper. To preserve both, the fruit may be slightly scalded when green,
                    then dried, and wrapped in paper.</p>
