                <p><label type="entry">PETIT, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a doctor of
                    the Sorbonne, who very early gained to himself a name by his knowledge, and the
                    eloquent orations which he pronounced before the university of Paris. He was
                    employed in the famous embassy which was sent from France to Rome for the
                    purpose of healing the schism in 1407; but he soon forfeited all the honour
                    which he had acquired. John Sans Peur, duke of Burgundy, having treacherously
                    contrived to assassinate Louis of France, duke of Orleans, only brother to
                    Charles VI., John Petit, entirely devoted to the views of the murderer,
                    maintained in a public disputation, at Paris, on the 8th of March 1408, that the
                    murder was lawful· He had the effrontery to assert, that “it is allowed to
                    employ fraud, treason, and every other method, however base, in order to get rid
                    of a tyrant; and that no faith ought to be kept with him.” And he had even the
                    audacity to add, that “the man who should commit such an action, not only
                    deserved to be exempted from punishment, but to receive a reward.” This
                    sanguinary doctrine was loudly exclaimed against; but the Duke of Burgundy’s
                    powerful influence sheltered Petit for some time. Some eminent writers of that
                    period, however, with Gerson at their head, denounced the doctrine to John de
                    Montaigu, bishop of Paris, who condemned it as heretical, on the 23d of November
                    1414. It was likewise condemned by the council of Constance the year following,
                    at the instigation of Gerson; but no notice was taken either of Petit’s name or
                    of his writings. In fine, the king, on the 16th of September 1416, ordered the
                    parliament of Paris to pronounce a severe decree against this dangerous
                    performance; and it was also censured by the university. But the Duke of
                    Burgundy, in 1418, had interest enough to compel the grand vicars of the bishop
                    of Paris, who then lay sick at St Omer, to retract the sentence which that
                    prelate had passed in 1414. Petit had died three years before this, or in 1411,
                    at Hesdin; and his apology in favour of the Duke of Burgundy, with all the
                    particulars of that infamous transaction, may be seen in the fifth volume of the
                    last edition of Gerson’s works. Father Pinchinat, of the order of St Francis,
                    and author of the Dictionary of Heresies, has endeavoured to vindicate his order
                    from a charge brought by some writers, who have called Petit a Cordelier or
                    Franciscan friar. “He proves very clearly," says the Abbé Prevot, “that he was a
                    secular priest and adds, that “upon the same evidence, Father Mercier, a
                    Cordelier, had a warm dispute in 1717 with Μ. Dupin, who had given this title to
                    Petit in his Collection of Censures. He represented to him,” says he, “before a
                    meeting of the faculty, the falsity of such a claim, and the injury which he
                    offered to the order of St Francis. Dupin, convinced of his error, candidly
                    owned that he was led into it by following some infidel writers; and promised to
                    retract it in the new edition of the Censures, which was published in 1720. Μ.
                    Fleury, who had committed the same mistake, promised also to make amends for it
                    by a solemn recantation; but dying before he had an opportunity of doing that
                    piece of justice to the Cordeliers, the continuator of his Ecclesiastical
                    History, who had not such opportunities of information, fell into the same
                    fault.” <hi rend="italic">(Pour et Contre,</hi> tom. x. p. 23.) If we follow
                    L’Avocat’s Dictionary, it would appear that no fault was committed; for it gives
                    a list of the pensioners of the dukes of Burgundy, in order to prove that John
                    Petit was a Cordelier. Indeed it is highly probable, that if Dupin, Fleury, and
                    Father Fabre, did not alter their opinion, it was owing to a firm persuasion
                    that they had committed no error.</p>
