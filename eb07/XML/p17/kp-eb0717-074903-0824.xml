                <p><label type="entry">PIQUET, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Picket</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated game at cards, much in use throughout the polite world. It is played
                    between two persons, with only thirty-two cards; the deuces, threes, fours,
                    fives, and sixes, being set aside.</p>
                <p>In reckoning at this game, every card goes for the number it bears, as a ten for
                    ten, only all court cards go for ten, and the ace for eleven; and the usual game
                    is one hundred up. In playing, the ace wins the king, the king the queen, and so
                    down.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> (</hi> Twelve cards are dealt round, usually by two and
                    two; which done, the remainder are laid in the middle. If one of the gamesters
                    finds he has not a court card in his hand, he is to declare he has <hi
                    rend="italic">carte-blanche,</hi> and tell how many cards he will lay out, and
                    desire the other to discard, that he may show his game, and satisfy his
                    antagonist that the carte-blanche is real; for which he reckons ten.</p>
                <p>Each person discards, or lays aside a certain number of his cards, and takes in a
                    like number from the stock. The first of the eight cards may take three, four,
                    or five; the dealer all the remainder, if he pleases. After discarding, the
                    eldest hand examines what suite he has most cards of; and reckoning how many
                    points he has in that suite, if the other have not so many in that or any other
                    suite, he tells one for every ten of that suite. He who thus reckons most is
                    said to win the point.</p>
                <p>The point being over, each examines what <hi rend="italic">sequences</hi> he has
                    of the same suite, that is, how many tierces, or sequences of threes, quartes or
                    fours, quintes or fives, sixièmes or sixes, and so on. For a tierce they reckon
                    three points, for a quarte four, for a quinte fifteen, for a sixième sixteen,
                    and so forth. And the several sequences are distinguished in dignity by the
                    cards they begin from. Thus ace, king, and queen are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >tierce major</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> king, queen, and knave, <hi
                    rend="italic">tierce to a king;</hi> knave, ten, and nine, <hi rend="italic"
                    >tierce to a knave,</hi> &amp;c.; and the best tierce, quarte, or quinte, in
                    other words, that which takes its descent from the best card, prevails, so as to
                    make all the others in that hand good, and destroy all those in the other hand.
                    In like manner, a quarte in one hand sets aside a tierce in the other.</p>
                <p>The sequences being over, the players proceed to examine how many aces, kings,
                    queens, knaves, and tens, each holds, reckoning for every three of any sort,
                    three; but here, too, as in sequences, he that with the same number of threes
                    has one that is higher than any the other has, for instance, three aces, has all
                    his others made good thereby, and his adversary’s all set aside. But four of any
                    sort, which is called a <hi rend="italic">quatorze,</hi> always sets aside
                    three.</p>
                <p>All the game in hand being thus reckoned, the eldest proceeds to play, reckoning
                    one for every card he plays above a nine, and the other follows him in the
                    suite; and the highest card of the suite wins the trick. However, unless a trick
                    be won with a card above a nine (except the last trick), nothing is reckoned for
                    it, though the trick serves afterwards towards winning the cards; and he who
                    plays last does not reckon for his cards unless he wins the trick.</p>
                <p>The cards being played out, he who has most tricks reckons ten for winning the
                    cards. If they have tricks alike, neither reckons anything. The deal being
                    finished, and each player having marked up his game, they proceed to deal again
                    as before, cutting afresh each time for the deal. If both parties be within a
                    few points of being up, the carte-blanche is the first thing that reckons, then
                    the point, then the sequences, then the quatorzes or threes, then the tenth
                    cards.</p>
                <p>He who can reckon thirty in hand by carte-blanche, points, quintes, &amp;c.
                    without playing, before the other has reckoned anything, reckons ninety for
                    them; and this is called a <hi rend="italic">repique.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >If</hi> he reckons above thirty, he reckons so many above ninety. If he can
                    make up thirty, part in hand and part play, ere the other has told any thing, he
                    reckons for them sixty. And this is called a <hi rend="italic">pique</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> whence the name of the game. He who wins all the tricks,
                    instead of ten, which is his right for winning the cards, reckons forty; and
                    this is called a <hi rend="italic">capot.</hi></p>
                <p>Mr Demoivre, who has made this game the object of mathematical investigation, has
                    proposed and solved the following problems. 1. To find at piquet the probability
                    which the dealer has for taking one ace or more in three cards, he having none
                    in his hand. He concludes from his computation, that it is twenty-nine to
                    twenty-eight that the dealer takes one ace or more. 2. To find at piquet the
                    probability which the eldest has of taking an ace or more in five cards, he
                    having no ace in his hand; the answer is two hundred and thirty-two to
                    ninety-one, or five to two nearly. 3. To find at piquet the probability which
                    the eldest hand has of taking an ace and a king in five cards, he having none in
                    his hand; the answer is, the odds against the eldest hand taking an ace and a
                    king are three hundred and thirty-one to three hundred and fifteen, or
                    twenty-one to twenty nearly. 4. To find at piquet the probability of having
                    twelve cards dealt to, without king, queen, or knaves, which case is commonly
                    called <hi rend="italic">cartes-blanches;</hi> the odds against cartes-blanches
                    are seventeen hundred and ninety-one to one nearly. 5. To find how many
                    different sets, essentially different from one another, one may have at piquet
                    before taking in; the answer is, 28,967,278. This number falls short of the sum
                    of all the distinct combinations, by which twelve cards may be taken out of
                    thirty-two, this number being 225,792,840; but it must be considered that in
                    that number several sets of the same import, but differing in suite, might be
                    taken, which would not introduce an essential difference amongst the sets.</p>
