                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">PARIA</label>, a province of Bolivia, in South America,
                    situated in the department of Oruro. On the north and northeast it is bounded by
                    the provinces of Pacajes and Oruro, on the east and south-east by Porco, on the
                    south-west by Lipes, and on the west by Caranjas. This province is traversed by
                    a rapid river called the Desaguadero, or Drain, which is invariably represented
                    in maps of Peru and Bolivia as flowing into the lake of Titicaca, whilst the
                    reverse is the fact. It issues from this celebrated sheet of water, and, after
                    flowing a considerable distance, its waters are dissipated by spontaneous
                    evaporation. The province of Paria is situated in a mountainous tract of
                    country, and being very elevated, the temperature is consequently cold. Like
                    Oruro and other provinces in this region, it is a mining district, and contains
                    several mines of silver. There are some lakes in the province, from which salt
                    is extracted; and also some hot springs. The lake of Paria is from three to four
                    leagues in length and two in width, and abounds in excellent fish. Alcedo says
                    that it has a whirlpool, which sucks down floating bodies, and finds a passage
                    to the sea under the cordillera, and through the shore, close to the port of
                    Iqueique. In 1748 its waters rose to an immense height, a phenomenon which
                    Alcedo attributes to the stoppage of its subterranean passage; but this was far
                    more likely to arise from volcanic agency, so frequent in this country, raising
                    and depressing the land in various directions. Farming operations are carried on
                    in Paria, but little grain is produced; the rearing of cattle, which are
                    plentiful, chiefly occupying the attention of the inhabitants. The cheese made
                    here of sheep’s milk is esteemed a great delicacy, and is much sought after. The
                    capital of the province, which bears the same name, is situated 210 miles
                    west-north-west of Chuquisaca, in 18° 50' south latitude, and 68° 20 ’ west
                    longitude. The population amounts to 50,000, of which number 37,000 are Indians,
                    and 13,000 Creoles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Paria,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gulf of,</hi> a gulf of South
                    America, situated to the north-west of the embouchure of the river Orinoco, and
                    having on the west the province of Cumana, and on the east the large island of
                    Trinidad. On Terra Firma, and north-west from the mouths of the Orinoco, a
                    peninsula or neck of land projects towards the east, in the exact direction of
                    another but much smaller neck of land which juts out from the north-western
                    extremity of the island of Trinidad. These projections approach within a few
                    leagues of each other, but the passage is interrupted by two or three islands,
                    which, from their relative position, form four openings called Boccas del Drago,
                    or the Mouths of the Dragon. Again, at the south-western extremity of Trinidad,
                    a neck of land advances in a westerly direction, towards a part of the delta of
                    the Orinoco, and approaches to within twelve or fourteen miles of it. This
                    passage is likewise interrupted by islands, and is called the Serpent’s Mouth.
                    Thus the mainland embosoms an immense bay, whilst the island of Trinidad, which
                    lies at its mouth, forms also a bay, facing the other, by its northern and
                    southern extremities projecting forwards. Both shores thus bend and mutually
                    approach each other, so as to form two comparatively narrow entrances, by which
                    the waters of the gulf communicate with those of the ocean. The Gulf of Paria,
                    at its widest part, that is, from the shores of Trinidad to those of Colombia,
                    is eighty-three miles across. In the other direction, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193492036" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2036-0073"/>from the Bocca on the south
                    to the Boccas del Drago on the north, it measures forty-three miles. In depth it
                    varies from eight to thirty fathoms; but there is anchorage throughout its whole
                    extent, though on the coast of Paria its soundings are much less. On the south
                    side of the Serpent’s Mouth, which communicates with the Atlantic Ocean, and
                    receives in the rainy season the vast flood of waters which pour as from an
                    inland ocean through the mouths of the Orinoco, a considerable current is found
                    setting into the gulf, which is thus reported to have its waters raised four or
                    five inches above their usual level. The surface-water at this time, which is
                    during the months of July, August, and September, is also said to be fresh. This
                    is by no means an unlikely circumstance, arising from the inferior specific
                    gravity of fresh water as compared with that of the sea; and the surface of the
                    gulf will also continue a longer time partially fresh, from its being embayed on
                    all sides by land, so as to shut out the swell and agitation of the ocean, which
                    would cause a more rapid commixture of the fresh and salt water. It was this
                    current which Columbus encountered, and which gave him so unfavourable an
                    opinion of the Gulf of Paria, which he accordingly called the Melancholy Gulf.
                    It is of course most violent during the rainy months; but a current generally
                    sets into the gulf through the Serpent’s Mouth to the northward during the dry
                    season; it is, however, partial and unimportant. In the months of December,
                    January, and February the tide sets through the Dragon’s Mouth from the
                    northward, by which the current is occasionally overpowered. The water of the
                    Gulf of Paria is generally of a turbid and dull green cast, but in the interior
                    it presents everywhere a tranquil and glassy surface. The winds are in general
                    light, never increasing to more than a gentle breeze, excepting in autumn, when
                    a few transient squalls disturb its serenity. It may indeed be regarded as a
                    spacious harbour, affording secure anchorage in all its parts, and perfectly
                    free from gales, storms, and accidents; for if vessels happen to get aground,
                    the soft muddy bottom receives them without injury. The nights are generally
                    calm and quiet, the principal annoyance to the mariner being the want of wind;
                    so that coasting along the shores of the gulf is extremely troublesome and
                    tedious. Its waters abound with various kinds of fish; and numerous flocks of
                    terns and pelicans may at all seasons be seen here and there, busily employed in
                    catching their prey. The western shore of the gulf, which forms part of a
                    province of Colombia formerly called Paria, is remarkable for its fertility and
                    beauty. Columbus spoke with rapture of this luxuriant land, and in his
                    enthusiasm he concluded that it was the terrestrial paradise which had received
                    the progenitor of the human race pure from his Creator’s hands. (See the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Orinoco.)</hi> The point of the peninsula, which runs for a
                    great many leagues into the sea opposite the island of Trinidad, is called Point
                    Paria, and is situated in latitude 9. 12. north, and longitude 62. 1. west from
                    Greenwich. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r. r.)</hi></p>
