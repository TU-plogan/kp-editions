                <p><label type="entry">UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA</label>.</p>
                <p>No single event in modern history has been of so much importance to mankind as
                    the discovery of America. That great continent, which had been hid from the eyes
                    of civilized nations for so many ages, comprises nearly one third of the
                    habitable globe. In soil and climate it rivals the best parts of the old
                    continent. It is not, like Asia and Africa, infested by the larger and more
                    dangerous species of wild animals, nor deformed by vast deserts, which present
                    insuperable obstacles to civilization. But its great and peculiar advantage lies
                    in the unrivalled magnitude and number of its navigable rivers, which enable its
                    most remote inland parts to hold commercial intercourse with each other, and
                    with foreign states, with unparalleled case and rapidity. The position of these
                    great rivers, whose estuaries all open to the east, points out the western side
                    of the old continent as the region with which it is destined by nature to be
                    most closely connected. Two great classes of colonists, widely dissimilar in
                    character and in circumstances, came from Europe to occupy this new world. The
                    Spaniards, who were first in the order of time, took possession of the most
                    populous and fertile regions; but their natural advantages were rendered
                    abortive by political and moral evils, a rapacious spirit, a corrupt religion,
                    and a vicious system of government. The English, the other great class of
                    colonists, owed their better fortunes in some measure to their apparent
                    disadvantages. Having neither gold mines to work, nor wealthy Indians to rob,
                    they cultivated with greater diligence the natural riches of the soil, and laid
                    the foundation of future prosperity in habits of order and industry. Neglected
                    by the government as a band of destitute refugees, they enjoyed what was then an
                    unusual degree of civil and religious liberty. Their industry flourished,
                    because it was unfettered and unburdened. They were well governed, because they
                    were left to govern themselves. And if they wanted the aid of the mother country
                    when that aid might sometimes have been useful, they were, on the other hand,
                    exempted from those incessant exactions and vexations to which the Spanish
                    colonists were exposed, from the ignorant, meddling, grasping, bigoted spirit of
                    their European rulers. The troubles which they experienced from the hostility of
                    the Indians diminished as their own numbers increased, and, except at first,
                    were never extremely detrimental. Their common dangers served in some measure as
                    a bond of union among themselves, and perhaps favoured their social improvement,
                    by acting as a slightly compressing force to prevent the indefinite diffusion of
                    the population over a large surface. To their free spirit, virtuous habits,
                    intelligence, and industry, the English colonists certainly owed much of their
                    early success; but we must not forget that a series of fortunate changes, not
                    directly the consequence of their own exertions, has greatly contributed to
                    place them in the enviable situation which they now occupy. Had the Dutch,
                    French, Danish, and Swedish colonies planted in North America spread as fast and
                    as far as those of England, and continued separate and independent, we should
                    have seen, in the space between the Mississippi and the Atlantic, the same
                    medley of nations and languages, with the same diversity of manners, religion,
                    institutions, and clashing interests, which foster everlasting feuds and
                    jealousies in Europe, engender desolating wars, load the people with oppressive
                    taxes and military tyrannies, and present a formidable barrier to the
                    circulation of knowledge and the progress of society. The conquests of England,
                    which blended all these colonies into one nation, have secured to the United
                    States an exemption from half the evils which afflict civil society in Europe,
                    and have prepared for them a career of peaceful grandeur and growing prosperity,
                    which divided Europe cannot hope to enjoy, and which has had no parallel in the
                    history of mankind. The people of the United States find themselves in a
                    condition to devote their whole energies to the cultivation of their vast
                    natural resources, undistracted by wars, unburdened by oppressive taxes,
                    unfettered by old prejudices and corruptions. Enjoying the united advantages of
                    an infant and a mature society, they are able to apply the highly refined
                    science and art of Europe to the improvement of the virgin soil and unoccupied
                    natural riches of America. They start unencumbered by a thousand evils,
                    political and moral, which weigh down the energies of the Old World. The volume
                    of our history lies before them: they may adopt our improvements, avoid our
                    errors, take warning from our sufferings, and, with the combined lights of our
                    experience and their own, build up a more perfect form of society. Even already
                    they have given some momentous and some salutary truths to the world. It is
                    their rapid growth which has first developed the astonishing results of the
                    productive powers of population. We can now calculate, with considerable
                    certainty, that America, which yet presents to the eye, generally, the aspect of
                    an untrodden forest, will, in the short space of one century, surpass Europe in
                    the number of its inhabitants. We even hazard little in predicting, that, before
                    the tide of civilization has rolled back to its original seats, Assyria, Persia,
                    and Palestine, an intelligent population of two or three hundred millions will
                    have overspread the New World, and extended the empire of knowledge and the arts
                    from Cape Horn to Alayska. Among this vast mass of civilized men there will be
                    but two languages spoken. The effect of this single circumstance in accelerating
                    the progress of society can scarcely be calculated. What a field will then be
                    opened to the man of science, the artist, the popular writer, who addresses a
                    hundred millions of educated persons? what a stimulus given to mental energy and
                    social improvement, when every new idea, and every useful discovery, will be
                    communicated instantaneously to so great a mass of intelligent beings, by the
                    electric agency of the post and the press? With the united intellect and
                    resources of a society framed on such a gigantic scale, what mighty designs will
                    then be practicable? Imagination is lost in attempting to estimate the effects
                    of such accumulated means and powers. One result may however be anticipated.
                    America must then become the centre of knowledge, civilization, and power; and
                    the present leading states of Europe (Russia perhaps excepted), placed on the
                    arena amidst such colossal associates as the American republics, will sink to a
                    subordinate rank, and cease to exert any greater influence on the fate of the
                    world than the Swiss cantons do at the present day.</p>
                <p>The territory of the United States is situated between the 25th and 49th degrees
                    of north latitude, and between the 67th and 124th degrees of west longitude from
                    London. Its extreme length east and west is 2780 miles, its greatest breadth
                    north and south 1230 miles, and its area, according to Mr Mellish, 2,076,410
                    square English miles. It is bounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the
                    north by the British possessions, on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and on the
                    south by Mexicoand the Mexican Gulf. The Mississippi divides it into two parts
                    nearly equal in extent. In the north-east angle of this territory, there is a
                    space of more than 100 miles square, of very barren ground, interposed between
                    New Brunswick and Lower Canada, the possession of which has long been the
                    subject <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=489"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0489-0451"/>of negociation between the British and American
                    governments. On the west coast the Americans have an unquestioned claim to the
                    country, between the 42d and 47th parallels; but Russia disputes the right of
                    possession with them to the tract of country between the 49th and 60th
                    parallels. As the admitted boundaries are in general very distinctly marked, on
                    the common maps, we shall not describe them in detail.</p>
                <p>Two chains of mountains separate this extensive territory into three great
                    natural divisions. 1. The Atlantic region, or the country lying east of the
                    Alleghany Mountains. 2. The valley of the Mississippi, or the country watered by
                    the Mississippi, Missouri, and their numerous branches. 3. The Pacific region,
                    or the country lying west of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
                <p>The Alleghany Mountains commence in Lower Canada, below Quebec; and passing along
                    the northern boundary of Maine, and through New Hampshire, Vermont, New York,
                    Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the two Carolinas, they terminate in the upper parts
                    of Georgia and Alabama, preserving a south-west direction throughout. They
                    consist of three, four, five, or more distinct ridges, with wide and fertile
                    valleys interposed. Their entire length is 1100 miles, their breadth varies from
                    110 to 150. In the northern half their height is greatest, but most unequal;
                    detached peaks are numerous, and the ridges indistinctly marked. In the south,
                    the ridges are lower, but better defined, and their summits are often
                    distinguished by a very uniform continuous level. They attain their greatest
                    height in New Hampshire, where Mount Washington has an elevation of 6600 feet.
                    Their greatest height in New York is 3800, in Pennsylvania 2500, in Virginia
                    3900, in South Carolina 4000. The mean height is said by Mr Mellish to be from
                    1000 to 1800 feet, but his average is undoubtedly formed on wrong principles.
                    That of the highest chain cannot be less than from 2000 to 2500 feet.<note

                <p>The Rocky Mountains, known but imperfectly, are a continuation of the Mexican
                    Cordilleras, and extend to the Polar Ocean. They pass through the territory of
                    the United States, at the distance of 500 miles from the Pacific Ocean, and
                    consist of several elevated chains, occupying a breadth of 300 miles, with deep
                    valleys between them. They rise abruptly from their base, and are supposed to
                    reach the elevation of 12,000 feet in their highest summits, many of which are
                    covered with perpetual snow. There are, however, several passes through them,
                    which, with a little improvement, might be traversed by loaded waggons.<note

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Region</hi> was the first settled, and is the most
                    populous and improved portion of the United States, but not the most favoured as
                    to soil and climate. It may be considered as the eastern slope of the
                    Alleghanies. Including all the countries watered by rivers flowing into the
                    Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi, it is about 1700 miles
                    in length, with an average breadth of 250, and embraces an area of 400,000
                    square miles. It includes three well-marked varieties of soil and surface. 1.
                    The alluvial district, consisting of sand, gravel, and clay, comprising a stripe
                    of level land, extending along the coast from New York southward, with a breadth
                    varying from twenty miles to 100. The surface is level or slightly undulating,
                    and it embraces large tracts of marsh near the coast. The soil is poor and
                    sandy, producing almost nothing but pines, except in the alluvial tracts which
                    skirt the rivers. About one half of the surface of New Jersey, Delaware, and
                    Maryland, one fifth of Virginia, one third of the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida,
                    and Alabama, fall under this description. 2. The upland country, extending from
                    the alluvial tract to the foot of the mountains, with a breadth varying from
                    twenty to 200 miles. Here the soil is chiefly formed from the detritus of the
                    primitive rocks, and is generally fertile, and well adapted for tillage. 3. The
                    ridges of the Alleghanies, and the valleys between them, which bear a strong
                    growth of natural wood, have generally a rich soil, capable of tillage, wherever
                    the surface is not rocky or too steep; and are almost free from marshes. In part
                    of Pennsylvania, New York, and in the six New England States,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As the name of New England
                    occurs often in American books. it may bu proper to mention, that the
                    appellation is applied to the six states east of the Hudson,—Connecticut, Rhode
                    Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.</p></note> where the
                    Alleghanies spread out into an irregular broken surface, the soil possesses a
                    mixed character. The northern parts of New England are mountainous, the southern
                    hilly or uneven. The soil, comparatively speaking, is rocky, has little depth,
                    and is better adapted for pasture than tillage, and improves generally as we
                    advance inwards from the coast. The south-east section of New York corresponds
                    in character with New England. But, of all the old states, Pennsylvania contains
                    the largest portion of good soil on the east side of the mountains. The woods
                    originally covered all this Atlantic region, except some tracts called the
                    American <hi rend="italic">prairies,</hi> on which, from causes not well
                    explained, no natural growth of timber exists. These are not meadows or wet
                    grounds, as the French term might be supposed to indicate; but lands bare of
                    wood, whether wet or dry, level or uneven. As the population thickens, the
                    forests disappear; but even in the most densely peopled parts, the woodlands
                    occupy so large a proportion of the surface, that the country generally
                    presents, to the eye of a European, the aspect of a natural wilderness, broken
                    by patches of cultivation, which are numerous round the great cities, but grow
                    less frequent as we recede from the shore, till they terminate in the boundless
                    forests of the Alleghanies.</p>
                <p>The basin or <hi rend="italic">Valley of the Mississippi,</hi> which extends from
                    the Alleghanies to the Rocky Mountains, is not so large by one third as the
                    basin of the Amazon, but being situated in the best part of the temperate zone,
                    it may be pronounced the finest valley in the world. Its breadth east and west
                    is 1400 miles; its length in the opposite direction 1200, and its area 1,400,000
                    square miles. It comprehends a great diversity of soil, surface, and climate. 1.
                    The basin of the Ohio, including the Cumberland, 700 miles long and 300 broad,
                    is a rich and beautiful country, the garden of the United States. The lower
                    parts of the surface are from 500 to 800 feet above the level of the sea, and
                    are finely diversified with round-topped arable hills, rising 400 or 500 feet
                    above their base. The rivers generally run in deep hollows, sometimes mere
                    ravines, but often spreading out into valleys, which include lands of exuberant
                    fertility. This district includes Kentucky, Tennessee, with part of Virginia,
                    Pennsylvania, Ohio. Indiana, and Illinois. 2. The territory extending from the
                    basin of the Ohio north-westward to Lake Superior, including the country between
                    the Missouri and Upper Mississippi. The surface is sometimes undulating,
                    sometimes so level that the waters stagnate on it, till carried off by
                    evaporation; nor is it broken by any notable elevations, except one long ridge
                    extending between the Missouri and Mississippi, and two low eminences called the
                    Ocooch and Smoky Mountains. The soil is naturally rich, and covered with
                    luxuriant herbage; but the climate is severe, and the woods so thin that the
                    bare ground or prairies occupy three fourths of the surface on the east side of
                    the Mississippi, and nineteen twentieths on the west.</p>

                <p>The absolute elevation of the northern parts is probably not under 1500 feet, for
                    Cassina lake, thirty miles below the sources of the Mississippi, is 1330 feet
                    above the sea. (Mellish, p. 32. James’s Expedition, iii. 204.) 3. The last and
                    largest division of this great valley, extending from the Mississippi and
                    Missouri to the Rocky Mountains, consists of two very different qualities of
                    soil, which graduate into each other, but, on the great scale, may be conceived
                    to form two parallel tracts of nearly equal extent, parted by the 98th meridian.
                    In the middle of the eastern section, and, as it were, in the very bottom of the
                    great basin of the Mississippi, he the Ozark Mountains; a chain, like the
                    Alleghanies, of great length and breadth, and small height, rising only from
                    1000 to 2000 feet above the sea. (James’s Expedition, iii. p. 313.) Mr Mellish
                    erroneously calls the height 3500 feet. Their breadth is from 100 to 150 miles:
                    their sides, which slope with gentle declivities, are deeply furrowed with
                    streams, and partly covered with small timber. The Arkansas and Red River are
                    the only streams which cut their way through this chain. On the east side of the
                    Ozark chain is the Great Swamp, 200 miles long and twenty broad, which is
                    converted into a lake by the annual overflow of the Mississippi, but is dry
                    during the heats of summer, and rendered impenetrable at all times by a thick
                    growth of cypress. The country round it is rich bottom or meadow land, clothed
                    with excellent timber. The country for one or two hundred miles west of the
                    Ozarks is also good, but less wooded; and in the eastern section, taken
                    altogether, the open ground occupies nineteen twentieths of the surface. The
                    western section, extending from the meridian of 98° to the Rocky Mountains, is
                    comparatively dry and sterile, and much of it an absolute desert, destitute of
                    herbage, and unfit for human habitation. As we approach the mountains, the
                    ground, which is at first hilly, subsides into smaller undulations, and these
                    terminate in table-lands, nearly fiat on the top, with steep, and sometimes
                    precipitous sides, and rising 600 or 800 feet above the common level. These
                    table-lands, consisting of alternate beds of sandstone and breccia, increase in
                    number and diminish in extent as we approach the base of the mountains, which is
                    believed to have an elevation of 3000 feet above the sea. The desert aspect of
                    the country, however, is not the effect of its elevation, but more probably of
                    its aridity; for valleys among the mountains, which are still higher, are
                    fertile. The rivers in this frightful solitude often spread out to a breadth of
                    one or two miles, and dry up in the warm weather. Salt springs are numerous, and
                    salt incrustations cover many square miles. Trees are only to be seen at some
                    spots along the rivers, and arc rather more abundant in the south than in the
                    north; but throughout the whole section, the wood does not cover the thousandth
                    part of the surface. Of the basin of the Mississippi altogether, it may be
                    observed, that the western side is a barren desert; the middle contains much
                    good lands, but abounds in swamps; the east side, comprehending the basin of the
                    Ohio, is the richest, and most eligible for human habitation. The woods, in
                    their natural state, increase continually as we advance from the Rocky Mountains
                    to the Atlantic; a proof, perhaps, that the summer heat, and the quantity of
                    atmospheric moisture, follow a similar law.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    taken from Major Long’s Memoir, published in the third volume of James’s Account

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pacific Region</hi> extends from the Rocky Mountains to the
                    ocean, and (exclusive of disputed ground) from latitude 42° to 49°, embracing an
                    area of 300,000 square miles, It consists almost entirely of the basin of the
                    Columbia river. This country naturally divides itself into three parts, the
                    first of which commences at the coast of the Pacific, and extends inland to a
                    range of mountains running parallel with the coast, south-east and north-west,
                    through which the Columbia river passes, and enters the sea in lat. 46° 19' N.
                    and in long. 124° W. These mountains lift their bold summits several thousand
                    feet from their bases, but from their mid distance upwards their barren sides
                    present the naked deformity of rocks, lava, and cinders. Their elevated summits
                    appear to be the craters of extinguished volcanoes. Some of the high snowy peaks
                    of this range are seen far at sea on the Pacific Ocean. The extent of this tract
                    from west to east is about 130 miles, and southward to the limits of California,
                    and probably very fat north. The climate is remarkably moist, almost
                    uninterrupted rain falling from October to April. In winter the weather is clear
                    and the cold moderate. The temperature is mild and equable, resembling that of
                    France and Spain much more than that of the Atlantic coast. Snow is seldom seen
                    at the mouth of the Columbia river, so that ploughing could be carried on
                    through most winters. This region contains a great proportion of barren
                    inaccessible land; but the water-courses, which are numerous, afford valleys
                    that are as fertile as can be found in the United States. The immediate
                    sea-board is the worst part. For farming purposes, the level country may be upon
                    the whole reckoned equal to any part of the state of New York. One half is of
                    excellent quality, the other half inaccessible mountains.</p>
                <p>The second division extends from the mountains, embracing the lower course of the
                    Columbia, including its great tails, and eastward to the Blue Mountains a higher
                    range, about 168 miles. The temperature differs little from that of New England;
                    the snows are light, and do not last long, seldom so long as to obstruct the
                    feeding of animals. Little rain falls in summer in this division; about the
                    middle of October there are usually rains, but not heavy. In this division of
                    country the river-bottoms are neither so frequent nor so extensive as in the
                    first, but at the foot of the mountains bounding each side of the valley, there
                    are large tracts very fertile.</p>
                <p>The third division extends from the Blue Mountains on the west to the Rocky
                    Mountains eastward, a distance of about 286 miles, and presents wide sandy
                    deserts, almost destitute of water. The deposits of vegetable matter are few,
                    and there is very little moisture except near the rivers; and thousands of acres
                    are white with Epsom and Glauber salts. In this valley is the great salt lake,
                    on the bottom of which, when low, the salt is deposited as in a salt-pan. The
                    climate is remarkable for dryness, and for the difference between the
                    temperature during the night and the day. Not a cloud will be seen in the sky
                    for six weeks, and no rain falls except for a few days in the spring, nor is
                    there much snow in winter. A traveller mentions, that on the 18th August 1832
                    the thermometer at sunrise was as low as 18°, a depression which it seldom
                    reaches in Great Britain, and on the same day was at 92°. A difference of 40°
                    between sunrise and noon is not uncommon. On the Columbia river, about eighty
                    miles from its mouth, the two great companies of Canadian traders, who in 1821
                    were formed into the North-West Company, established a settlement and the fort
                    of Vancouver, which has since become the centre of the fur trade. It has been
                    gradually improved, and the cultivators, clerks, factors, and traders who reside
                    here amount to about 2000 souls. In 1835, they produced 8000 bushels of wheat,
                    5500 bushels of barley, 6000 of or ts, 9000 of pease, 14,000 of potatoes,
                    besides large quantities of vegetables. There is also a thriving orchard, in
                    which are produced abundantly, apples, quinces, pears, and grapes. A large ship
                    annually arrives from London with goods, and a trade is also carried on with the
                    Sandwich and other of the South Sea Islands. There are other stations occupied
                    by the North-West Company’s servants; namely, at Wallawallah, 250 miles above
                    Vancouver, and at <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=491"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0491-0453"/>Colville, 600 miles higher. There are several
                    other posts along the upper course of the river. These are generally picketed
                    enclosures, occupied by from fifteen to twenty servants of the North-West
                    Company, for the purpose of trading with the Indians for furs. They have at
                    Vancouver a large thrashing machine, a saw-mill, a distillery, a grit-mill, and,
                    in short, all the necessary rudiments of a civilized community.<note

                <p>In 1835 a settlement was made on the river Wallamete, by a missionary of the name
                    of Lee, which succeeded well. During the first year, a g∞d crop was raised of
                    green pease and other vegetables. A school was established, at which native
                    children were instructed in rending and in all mechanical arts. The state of
                    this country was brought under the consideration of the Congress by a petition
                    from different settlers, who were intending to emigrate to it, and there to
                    establish a colony. They requested the countenance of the government, and the
                    aid of a military force with which to maintain law and order; and an estimate
                    was made of the expense of a battalion of troops, and the necessary stores for
                    that purpose.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Letter

                <p>The main flood of the American population is now rapidly making its way across
                    the extended plains to the west of the Mississippi; numbers of adventurous
                    emigrants are already settled in these western regions; the desert is rapidly
                    assuming the aspect of cultivation, villages and towns supplanting the primeval
                    forest; and in a few years the wild animals and the savage will alike disappear
                    before the rapid progress of civilized man. The interminable woods of the west,
                    and the inundations and marshes of the south, yield alike to the resistless sway
                    of persevering energy; the great mass moves onward with increasing force, under
                    the impulse of causes which no longer brook control, and which will no less bear
                    down, it is to be feared, moral right than physical obstacles in its progress to
                    the barrier of the ocean. Since the adventurous journey of Lewis and Clarke to
                    the mouth of the Columbia river, the settlements have advanced farther to the
                    west, and new and easier roads have been found across the wilderness and the
                    Rocky Mountains, and down the great river of the Pacific. This country, the
                    abode of wild animals, has been for more than twenty years a noted resort of the
                    fur traders, and especially those in the service of the North-West Company.</p>
                <p>The United States, whose territories almost touch the tropic on the one side, and
                    reach to districts where frost lasts five or six months on the other, embrace
                    greater varieties of climate than any other single state in the world. Generally
                    speaking, the climate of the United States is distinguished from that of Europe
                    by three peculiarities. 1. It is absolutely colder for the corresponding degrees
                    of latitude, the mean temperature of the year, according to Humboldt, being nine
                    degrees of Fahrenheit lower on the east coast of America than on the west coast
                    of Europe at the latitude of 40°, and 12½° lower at the latitude of 50°. 2.</p>
                <p>The thermometer has a greater range, as the heat of summer and the cold of winter
                    reach greater extremes. 3. The climate changes more rapidly as we proceed from
                    south to north, or a greater variety of climates is comprised within the same
                    range of latitude. the mean temperature of Quebec, at one extremity, is 42°, and
                    of Cape Sable, at rite other, 72∙7°. Between the parallels of 33 and 50, a
                    degree of latitude which makes a change of 1∙13° (Fahrenheit) in Europe, makes a
                    change of 1∙57° in the United States; and the same annual temperature which is
                    found at a given degree of latitude in the United States, is found seven degrees
                    farther north in Europe. The seasons are also differently distributed.
                    Philadelphia, for instance, has the summers of Rome and the winters of Vienna.
                    In Florida, at New Orleans, and at St Mary’s in Georgia, snow is never seen; but
                    in Pennsylvania snow lasts three months, in Massachusetts four, and in Maine
                    five.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Humboldt,

                    333; vol. ii. p. 60.</p></note> In the two latter states, the ice bears loaded
                    waggons, and the sea is sometimes frozen to a considerable distance from the
                    coast. In all the low country, from Florida to the St Lawrence, the extreme
                    summer heat is nearly the same, from 90° to 98°, and the varieties of climate
                    are chiefly marked by the intensity and duration of the winter’s cold. The
                    climate in the basin of the Ohio, compared with that of the Atlantic coast,
                    possesses no very striking peculiarities, but seems, on the whole, to have its
                    mean annual heat a little higher, to be rather more steady and equable, to be
                    less frequently visited by the frigorifie north-west winds, and to have fits of
                    cold weather almost equally severe, but more transitory. The great lakes appear
                    to mitigate the winter cold in the country immediately around them, and probably
                    in the basin of the Ohio too; for on the west and north-west of this district
                    the climate is much more rigorous. At Council Bluffs, on the Missouri, in
                    latitude 41½°, the thermometer descends to —22° in winter, and rises to 105° in
                    summer. At St Peter’s Fort, on the Mississippi, in latitude 45°, it ranges from
                    92° to —30°, and the mean temperature of January is about zero. The absolute
                    height of the fort, which cannot exceed 1000 feet, does not account for this
                    excessive cold. We have already mentioned the equable temperature of the basin
                    of the Columbia; and, from the observations made on the Missouri and Upper
                    Mississippi, we have reason to believe that the mildest and the most rigorous
                    winters known in any similar latitude are to be found at once on the opposite
                    sides of the great rampart of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=492" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0492-0454"
                    />Rocky Mountains. (On the subject of Climate, see Mellish, p. 59-77.)</p>
                <p>So many local circumstances affect the annual depth of rain, that little reliance
                    can be placed on general estimates. We find that it was forty-two inches at
                    Charlestow n, on an average of some years, forty at Natchez, thirty at
                    Philadelphia, thirty-six at Cincinnati. The mean fall of rain for the inhabited
                    part of the United States (latitude 41°) should be about thirty-four inches. The
                    frequent failure of the streams, and the scarcity of verdure in the country near
                    the Rocky Mountains, indicate a deficiency of atmospheric moisture in that
                    region. Snow falls to the greatest depth on the borders of the great lakes. On
                    the sea-coast it is rarely seen farther south than Northfolk, latitude 37°; but
                    in the interior it is found four or five degrees farther south. Compared with
                    the middle countries of Europe, the United States occupying a more southern
                    position, have rains more regular and heavy, and greater in absolute quantity,
                    but a smaller number of wet days. Of the winds, the most remarkable are, 1. A
                    moist and warm south or south-west wind, which is supposed to be a branch of the
                    trade-wind, and is felt all over the Atlantic States as far as the Potowmac, and
                    occasionally in New England. 2. Another wind, possessing the same qualities, and
                    believed also to be a branch of the trade-wind: it blows from the Mexican Gulf,
                    up the course of the Mississippi, and seems to send off subordinate branches,
                    which ascend the courses of the Ohio and Missouri. In Louisiana and Arkansas, it
                    is a south wind; at Council Bluffs, on the Missouri, it is a south-east; and in
                    Ohio and Kentucky, a south-west wind. It is the prevailing wind in all these
                    districts. 3. The north-weft blows occasionally on the west side of the
                    Alleghanies, but more frequently on the east side, and is most prevalent in New
                    England. It everywhere produces intense cold, depressing the thermometer to—7°
                    or —8° in Ohio, and sometimes to —20° in Massachusetts. 4. The north-east is a
                    cold wind, which, transporting the fogs of the Newfoundland bank, occasions
                    showers of snow. Various facts observed in the United States seem to show, what
                    some meteorologists have doubted, that clearing and cultivation improve the
                    climate, at least so far as regards the growth of the cerealia.<note

                <p>If we draw a line from New York to the cast end of Lake Ontario, the peninsula
                    lying north-eastward between the St Lawrence and the sea consists of primitive
                    rocks, interspersed with some patches of secondary. From this line southward the
                    country has a different geological character. A belt of alluvial soil, beginning
                    at Long Island, extends along the shore of all the southern states to Natchez on
                    the Mississippi, having an average breadth of a hundred miles, and probably
                    including all Florida, except some high ground in the interior. It is everywhere
                    penetrated by the tide-water in the rivers. On the west side of this is a region
                    of primitive rocks, from 100 to 200 miles broad, in which gneiss predominates.
                    It embraces the eastern ridges of the Alleghanies, with the rolling country at
                    their foot. On the west side of this, again, is a long narrow zone of transition
                    rocks, including the western ridges of the Alleghanies, and extending from Lake
                    Champlain to the northwest angle of Georgia. From this transition formation,
                    which constitutes, as it were, the eastern edge of the basin of the Mississippi,
                    immense beds of secondary limestone, sandstone, and shale, cover the country to
                    the Rocky Mountains, interrupted only by the alluvial formations on the banks of
                    the rivers, and by the Ozark Mountains. Like the Alleghanies, these mountains

                    far as they have been explored, consist of primitive rocks, granite, gneiss,
                    quartz rock, &amp;c,, covered on the east side by an extensive formation of old
                    red sandstone.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>S

                <p>That important mineral, coal, is found on both sides of the Alleghanies. The two
                    principal formations on the east side are, 1. On the river Apomatox, above
                    Richmond in Virginia, where a seam of excellent coal, which occupies a basin
                    twenty miles long and ten broad, has been long worked, and employs 5000 persons:
                    2. At various spots along a narrow tract of country, from the sources of the
                    Juniata and western Susquehannah to Providence Bay. At Lehigh, and other places
                    within this district, the coal is worked. On the western side of the
                    Alleghanies, an immense formation of coal, probably the largest in the world,
                    extends from the head waters of the Ohio southward to those of the Tombigbee,
                    and westward, with some interruptions, beyond the Mississippi. A similar bed
                    appears on the west side of the Ozarks, which is also traced far up the course
                    of the Missouri; and there is a third bed of unknown extent on the east side of
                    the Rocky Mountains.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Salt, another mineral of primary importance, is distributed in considerable
                    abundance over the United States territory, especially those parts that are
                    remote from the sea. A great formation of rock-salt (and gypsum), indicated by
                    numerous salt springs, is believed to accompany the coal formation over a great
                    part of the basin of the Mississippi. Salt springs are numerous at the foot of
                    the Rocky Mountains, and extensive plains occur covered with salt, one of which,
                    the Grand Saline, is thirty miles in circumference, and in hot weather is
                    covered with a crust of clear white salt from two to six inches deep, and
                    superior in quality to manufactured salt. On the cast side of the Alleghanies,
                    salt is generally obtained from the ocean, or imported.</p>
                <p>Iron is found in nearly all the states, and is worked to such an extent that, of
                    50,000 tons consumed, according to computation, in the country, only 10,000 are
                    imported. (Morse, i. 236.) A bed of magnetic iron ore, from eight to twelve feet
                    thick, in gneiss, and another from two to twenty feet, extend, with some
                    interruptions, from the White Mountains on the one side, and from Lake Champlain
                    on the other, to the northern limits of New Jersey. Iron ore, of various kinds,
                    is also found in Maryland and Virginia. On the west side of the Alleghanies it
                    is abundant, and is extensively worked at Pittsburg, and in Kentucky and
                    Tennessee. The whole number of furnaces, forges, and bloomeries, in 1810, was
                    530. Ores of copper are smelted in New Jersey, and are found in various other
                    parts of the Union. Native copper is said to exist in great quantities near the
                    river St Croix, in the NorthWest Territory; but at present the United States are
                    chiefly supplied with this metal from Mexico Lead is found in Massachusetts and
                    Pennsylvania, but it exists most abundantly in Missouri, at the north-east angle
                    of the Ozark Mountains, where forty-five mines are worked, which yield three
                    millions of pounds annually. (Mellish, 366.) Gold is found in considerable
                    abundance in Virginia, between the tide river, and the blue ridge in the
                    Alleghany Mountains. A map has been published exhibiting a condensed view of
                    this interesting region, which has been surveyed and explored; and the gold
                    annually obtained is estimated, “it is stated, in millions of dollars,'’ and it
                    is rapidly increasing, though, comparatively speaking, only the surface of the
                    ground has been disturbed in obtaining this precious metal. Some of the
                    Virginian ores were pounded in a mortar, and the sand being washed away, a large
                    proportion of metallic gold appeared in numerous and beautiful grains, though no

                    explored this country are of opinion that it is decidedly rich in minerals; and.
                    from the situation of the mines in a populous district, with a complete command
                    of machinery of every description, there will be great advantages for working
                    them. The gold mines on the Rappahannock are not above half a dozen miles from
                    the city of Washington. The rich gold veins are said to be finely developed; to
                    be composed of quartz, commonly called white flint, from one to five feet in
                    thickness, generally perpendicular in the earth, like a wall, supported on both
                    sides by sort talcose slate; and to extend from the surface to an unknown depth.
                    Gold has not unusually been found in the broken veins of the fragments at the
                    surface; and it has also been found at the depth of 160 feet, increasingly
                    rich.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See American

                    Cobalt, antimony, manganese, and ores of zinc, occur in some few spots. Nitre is
                    obtained in vast quantities from the limestone caves in Kentucky. On a general
                    view, it may be said that the United States have a supply of coal, salt, iron,
                    lead, and probably copper, adequate to their own consumption.</p>
                <p>The United States have no considerable lake entirely within their territory,
                    except Michigan. But a series of fresh-water lakes, by far the largest in the
                    world (for the Caspian Sea is salt), and connected with one another by the St
                    Lawrence, extends along the northern frontier. The following is their extent,
                    and their elevation above the level of the sea.</p>

                <p>Reckoning from Quebec to the western extremity of Superior, these lakes afford a
                    line of 1550 miles of inland navigation, which will be increased to 4500 miles
                    if we include the whole extent of their shores. But Quebec is far from the open
                    sea, and the shortest and best route to the Atlantic. from Lake Erie and the
                    waters above will be by the New York Canal. Lake Erie is about twenty fathoms in
                    average depth, Ontario eighty, and Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior are said
                    to be still deeper. All these inland waters can be navigated with advantage; and
                    will be crowded with vessels at some future period, when an active population
                    covers the North-West Territory. The principal interruptions at present are,
                    lst, at the rapids between Montreal and Kingston, where it is proposed to cut a
                    canal; 2d, at the rapids and the great fall of Niagara, where a canal is also
                    projected; 3d, in the stream of the river between Lakes Huron and Erie, where
                    there are also rapids, and in Lake St Clair, which is full of shallows; 4th, at
                    the falls of St Mary, between Huron and Superior, amounting to twenty-three feet
                    in half a mile. All these obstructions, it is believed, can be surmounted by
                    art. These various lakes evidently occupy the bottom of a raised plateau, the
                    outer sides of which are not very distant; and hence they receive very few
                    rivers of any magnitude. Their shores are beset with ice for two, three, or four
                    months in the year.</p>
                <p>Lake George, thirty-six miles long and seven broad, pours its waters into Lake
                    Champlain, which is 160 miles long and eighteen broad, and communicates by the
                    river Sorelle with the St Lawrence. A canal, twenty two miles long, now nearly
                    finished, connects Lake Champlain with the Hudson. We pass over the other lakes
                    of smaller size.</p>
                <p>The rivers of the United States belong to four different systems: 1st, those
                    which water the Atlantic region; 2d, the Mississippi and its branches, which
                    water the great central valley of North America; 3d, those which flow into the
                    St Lawrence; and, 4th, the Columbia and its tributaries, which flow into the
                    Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <p>The rivers which fall into the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico from Maine to the
                    eastern boundary of Louisiana, all rise in the Alleghanies, except the
                    Susquehannah and the Hudson, which pass entirely through the principal chains.
                    Their length varies from 200 to 450 miles, increasing gradually with the breadth
                    of the level country, as we advance southward. The tide-water ascends in all
                    these rivers to the outer boundary of the primitive formations, where falls
                    regularly occur, except on the Hudson. In this river the tide reaches to Albany,
                    160 miles from its mouth, to which point there is an uninterrupted navigation
                    for sloops of eighty tons. This peculiar advantage has made the Hudson the scene
                    of a more active inland trade than any river, perhaps, in the world, of the same
                    magnitude. Tide navigation reaches a very short way up the great rivers in the
                    northern states generally; but in those south of the Susquehannah, it reaches
                    generally from 100 to 130 miles. Boats ply on these rivers much farther up, but
                    the navigation is seldom uninterrupted. The following are the principal rivers
                    on the Atlantic side, with their computed lengths.</p>

                <p>The rivers that fall into the St Lawrence and its lakes are comparatively small,
                    and probably do not carry off one tenth part of the water that falls on the cast
                    side of the Mississippi. The most considcrable are the Fox River, which falls
                    into Lake Michigan, the Miamie of Lake Erie, the Genessee, and Seneca of Lake
                    Ontario, and the Sorelie or Richlieu, which joins the St Lawrence below
                    Montreal.</p>
                <p>The majestic Mississippi drains a greater surface than any river in the world
                    except the Amazon, and in the magnitude of its stream is only surpassed by the
                    Amazon and the Plata. It has been computed to convey to the Mexican Gulf <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 38</hi> th of all the water
                    which the ocean receives from the dry land. The extreme length of the
                    Mississippi proper, including all its sinuosities, is generally computed to be
                    2500 miles, but reckoning to the head of the Missouri, which is the largest
                    branch, it is nearly 4000. It has three bars at its mouth, the deepest of which
                    affords only seventeen feet of water. (Warden, i. 114.) Sloops of this draught
                    can navigate to Natchez, 350 miles from its mouth. There is depth sufficient at
                    all times for sloops drawing six feet to the Ohio, and for vessels drawing three
                    feet to the junction with the Missouri. (James’s Expedition, iii. 258.) But
                    during the floods in May, June, and July, the waters rise fifty feet, and are
                    then navigable by vessels of any size. The Mississippi, from its junction with
                    the Ohio to the sea, is about 1000 yards, or two thirds of a mile, in width, and
                    below Red River it is about 120 feet deep. From the junction of the Arkansas,
                    its banks form an elevated ridge or platform, which support the stream at the
                    height of ten or twenty feet above the level of the adjacent lands. In its
                    floods, it sometimes bursts the barriers which confine it, and inundates the
                    flat country below. Οι the two great branches, the Missouri, and Mississippi
                    proper, the former stream is the larger and more rapid, and also more turbid,
                    from the quantity of travelled soil it transports; <pb break="no"

                    />but its waters, generally occupying a wider channel, are more loaded with bars
                    and sand-banks, and the navigation is more intricate. (James’s Expedition, iii.
                    259.) The Platte, Kansas, and some other tributaries of the Missouri, often
                    extend to a breadth of one or two miles, and during the warm season dry up
                    entirely. But these, and all the branches of both rivers, generally admit of
                    boat navigation for nine tenths of their course, during a longer or shorter
                    period every year. In the Ohio, the boating season is from 20th February to the
                    middle of June. Before this period the waters are icebound; after it they are
                    too shallow except for very small craft. The length of the Mississippi, from its
                    mouth to the junction of the Ohio, is about 1200 miles, and to its junction with
                    the Missouri, 1300. The length of the Missouri, above the junction to its
                    remotest branch, is, by Lewis and Clarke’s measurement, 2575 miles. The length
                    of the Ohio, above the point of confluence, is 1188 miles. The other large
                    branches of the Mississippi are the Red River and Arkansas, in the lower part of
                    its course. The chief tributaries of the Missouri are the Osage, Platte, Kansas,
                    and Yellowstone; of the Ohio, the Tennessee, Cumberland, and Wabash. The whole
                    extent of the navigable waters above the confluence of the Missouri and
                    Mississippi has been estimated at 23,000 miles, to which, if we add 12,000 for
                    the Ohio, Arkansas, Red River, &amp;c., and their branches, we shall have 35,000
                    miles of boat navigation in the basin of the Mississippi. To this we may add
                    10,000 miles more for the eastern section of the states, with 5000 for the lakes
                    and their tributary streams, and 2000 for the river Columbia, making altogether
                    51,000 miles of river navigation, which is probably three times greater than all
                    the rivers of Europe afford. Except in New England, Pennsylvania, and New York,
                    the rivers of the United States flow over a surface which has rather a small
                    declivity. Of the two sides of the great central valley, the western is the
                    steepest. The base of the Rocky Mountains is computed to have an elevation of
                    3000 feet. That of the beds of the rivers, where they begin to be navigable, may
                    be about 2000; and estimating their average length of course to the sea to be
                    about 2500 miles, the mean fall will be about nine or ten inches per mile. The
                    Mississippi proper, at 2500 miles from the sea, has a height of 1330 feet, or a
                    mean fall of six or seven inches per mile. The Ohio, at Pittsburg, 2200 miles
                    from the sea, has a height of 600 feet, or a mean fall of four inches. In the
                    Amazon and the Ganges, from the point where they leave the mountains, and in the
                    Wolga from its source, the average rate of descent is from four to five inches
                    per mile. In the middle and south of Europe generally, the fall of the rivers is
                    probably twice as great.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The variety of cultivated plants in North America corresponds to the diversity of
                    its climates. At one extremity, the sugar-cane of the tropical regions thrives;
                    and at the other, oats and barley, the staple crops of the arctic regions, are
                    leading articles of cultivation. The high summer heat, however, in all parts of
                    the United States, makes some plants which cannot be raised in England succeed
                    in the coldest districts of the north. Of this description is maize, or Indian
                    corn, an indigenous American plant, which is cultivated from Maine to Louisiana.
                    It is a vegetable in universal use in the United States, yields generally double
                    the produce of wheat, and is adapted to a variety of situations. The maple tree,
                    which grows in all the states, yields a juice from which sugar is made. Nearly
                    ten millions of pounds of maple sugar were made in 1810. Wheat is raised from
                    one extremity of the Union to the other, but succeeds best in the middle and
                    western states anti in the uplands of the southern. The cultivation of tobacco
                    begins in Maryland, about the parallel of 39° or 40°, and continues through all
                    the southern states, and through those in the west, south of the Ohio. The
                    climate favourable for cotton is not found farther north than about the latitude
                    of 37°, though it can be raised as far north as 39° on both sides of the
                    mountains. The best grows in South Carolina and Georgia, in dry situations, upon
                    the sea-coast. The rice crops, which require a marshy soil and a great heat,
                    commence about the same parallel with cotton, and have nearly the same
                    geographical range. The sugar-cane grows in low and warm situations, as high as
                    the latitude of 33°, but the climate favourable for its cultivation does not
                    extend beyond 31½°. Oats, barley, hemp, and flax, succeed well, except in the
                    low grounds of the southern states. The vine can be advantageously raised as far
                    north as Pennsylvania. The olive, orange, lemon, and fig. are injured by the
                    frost in South Carolina; but it is believed that these trees, as well as the
                    banana, will succeed in Florida.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    all the valuable and useful species of wood.</p>
                <p>The United States contain about one fourth of the known species of quadrupeds.
                    Some are common to both continents, others are peculiar to the western.
                    Comparing individuals of the same species, some are perfectly similar; between
                    others there is some difference in size, colour, or other circumstances. In a
                    few instances, the animal of the eastern continent is larger than the American;
                    in most, the reverse is the case. The following is a catalogue of the quadrupeds
                    of the United States: Mammoth (an extinct species), bison or buffalo,
                    moose-deer, caribou, red deer, fallow deer, roe, bear, wolverene, wolf, fox,
                    catamount, spotted tiger, sallow cougar, gray cougar, mountain cat, lynx,
                    kincagou, weasel, ermine, marten, mink, otter, fisher, skunk, opossum,
                    wood-chuck, urchin, hare, racoon, fox squirrel, gray squirrel, red squirrel,
                    flying squirrel, field-mouse, field-bat, ground mouse, wood cat, American rat,
                    shrew mouse, purple mole, black mole, water rat, beaver, musquash, morse, seal,
                    manati, sapajou, sagoin.</p>
                <p>Nine tenths of these animals yield a fur, which is used for dress or in
                    manufactures. The bison, or wild ox (improperly called the buffalo), is,
                    according to some American naturalists, of the same species with the common neat
                    cattle of the United States, the difference being the effect of the
                    domestication of the latter. Buffon, however, thinks otherwise. The bison is
                    larger than the domestic ox, has a fleshy or grisly substance extending along
                    his shoulders and back, and has on his neck and shoulders a woolly hair, which
                    admits of being spun or wrought into hats. The moose-deer, now rare, is a
                    gigantic animal, one variety sometimes reaching the height of twelve feet. The
                    caribou is probably the rein-deer of Scandinavia. the bear is of two species.
                    The short-legged lives chiefly on vegetable food, and is probably not
                    carnivorous. He dozes away the winter in a torpid state, sucking his paws, and
                    expending the fat he had previously acquired. the ranging bear is larger, but
                    more lean. He destroys calves, sheep, pigs, and sometimes children, and in
                    winter migrates southward. The wolf, like the bear, is found in all the states.
                    It is a voracious animal, stealing into sheep-folds at night, attacking deer,
                    hogs, and small cattle, and sometimes hunting in packs. The catamount is of the
                    size of a large dog, and extremely ferocious, but it is rarely seen. The spotted
                    tiger is scarcely seen. except near Louisiana. It is from five to six feet long.
                    The cougar or American panther is about the same size, but more common. It
                    destroys sheep, calves, and hogs, and when hungry will attack large cattle. The
                    urchin differs in several respects from the European hedgehog. The lion,
                    leopard, striped or true tiger, hyena, elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus,
                    camelopard, are unknown in the New World. The horse, the ass, the sheep, the
                    goat, the <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=495"

                    there, but have been naturalized. The latter, however, are not numerous, and
                    have never been introduced into the United States. Of the birds and reptiles our
                    limits will not allow us to speak in detail. The eagle, pheasant, grouse,
                    partridge, swan, Canadian goose, ptarmigan, are less or more numerous. In
                    general, the small birds of America surpass those of Europe in the beauty of
                    their plumage, but are much inferior to them in the melody of their notes. Among
                    the reptiles, the most remarkable is the alligator or American crocodile, from
                    twelve to twenty-three feet long, very strong and active. Of serpents, the
                    rattlesnake, from four to six feet long, is the most formidable.<note

                <p>Perhaps no single circumstance connected with the United States has attracted so
                    much attention as the rapid growth of their population. Philosophers had shown,
                    from the laws which govern propagation, that the human species might double its
                    numbers in a short period. But this was only known as a speculative truth,
                    applicable, it was supposed, to small tribes under extraordinary circumstances,
                    but not to a great nation of many millions. The Spanish colonies, planted a
                    hundred years earlier than the United States, should have made this principle
                    familiar to the world long ago; but ignorance and misgovernment, intercepting
                    the bounty of nature, inflicted all the vices and evils of old societies upon
                    these colonies, and a jealous policy threw a veil of secrecy over their
                    condition.</p>
                <p>The first European emigrants settled in the United States in 1607. From that
                    period, colonists continued to flock to the country in small parties or large
                    bodies. The last new settlement on a considerable scale was in 1733, when, by
                    means of a grant of L.10,000 from parliament, and various sums raised by private
                    contributions, 618 persons were sent out from England to Georgia.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For an account of this and
                    the earlier settlements, the reader may consult the History of the British
                    Empire in America. Lend. 1741, 2 vols. 8vo.</p></note> The growth of the
                    colonies was rapid and obvious; but much more was probably attributed to the
                    influx of settlers from the mother country than was consistent with the truth.
                    No accurate enumeration of the inhabitants was made till the first census was
                    taken in 1790. That for the year 1753, in Marshall’s Life of Washington, is
                    undoubtedly erroneous. The ratio of increase being ascertained by the four
                    separate enumerations, and having continued remarkably uniform for forty years,
                    we can now, by calculating backwards, obtain results more deserving of
                    confidence than the rude guesses made from uncertain data. The period of
                    doubling at present is 24 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    6</hi> years; but, taking it at 25 years, and reckoning backwards from 1790, we
                    find the population at the under-mentioned periods would be,</p>
                <p>1790 3,929,000 1715 490,000</p>
                <p>(by census) 1690 245,000</p>
                <p>1765 1,960,000 1665 122,000</p>
                <p>1740 980,000 1640 61,000</p>
                <p>Beyond the last-mentioned period we cannot, for obvious reasons, carry our
                    calculation. If we suppose 1000 settlers to have come from Europe annually for
                    the first thirty-three years, these, by natural multiplication, would amount to
                    about 60,000 at the time alluded to, that is, in 1640. The following table,
                    constructed from authentic documents, gives an interesting view of the
                    progressive advances of population in the different states.</p>

                <p>According to the census which is now in progress, and is nearly completed, the
                    population, it is estimated, will nearly amount to 17,000,000.</p>
                <p>It will be observed from the first table, that the rate of increase is very
                    unequal for the different sections of the Union. The older states of Connecticut
                    and Massachusetts have only added one fifth to their population, in the same
                    period in which the new states of Kentucky and Ohio have quadrupled theirs; and,
                    according to the more recent census of 1830, the increase of population has been
                    in like manner far more rapid in the newly-settled states of Indiana, Illinois,
                    Missouri, Arkansas, and Michigan, where it has more than doubled within ten
                    years, than in any of the northern and first-settled states, in which the
                    increase has only been from five to forty, fifty, and sixty-one per cent. Even
                    in Kentucky and Ohio, where the population increased so rapidly the first thirty
                    years after they were settled, it has now been checked by those causes which
                    never fail to operate in all countries with the increase of inhabitants and the
                    occupation of the land; which have been long felt in the crowded communities of
                    Europe, as they are now in all the older states of America. There is still
                    another reason for the comparatively rapid increase of the newly-settled states
                    of the west, namely, that the more densely peopled parts of the Union, and in
                    particular New England, serve as a nursery to the new states, to which they are
                    continually sending out large draughts of emigrants. Thus there is a constant
                    stream of population pouring across the Alleghanies, from the east side to the
                    west, to occupy the vast plain of the Mississippi; and by this gradual
                    generation of a mighty people from a central stock, a uniformity of language,
                    manners, and institutions, is diffused over the whole, which will cement their
                    union, in spite of local diversities of interest, and which promises to make the
                    countless millions who will by and by cover North America from sea to sea. more

                    Prussia, France, Spain, or Britain, are at this day.</p>
                <p>If we calculate prospectively from the present rate of increase, assuming that it
                    will continue permanent for some time, the population at the under-mentioned
                    periods will be,</p>

                <p>Before this last result is realized, some retardation will probably take place in
                    the rate of increase. But even if the vast population alluded to were in
                    existence, the average density for the whole territory would not be greater than
                    it is at this day in Massachusetts, and only half as great as in Italy, France,
                    and the British Isles.</p>
                <p>The rapid growth of the population in America becomes much more striking when we
                    contrast it with the scarcely perceptible progress of communities in the Old
                    World. France, which, according to Marshal Vauban, had 19,094,000 inhabitants in
                    1700, had 26,363,000 in 1791. Now, according to the rate of increase which this
                    indicates, that country would have doubled its population in 195 years; but the
                    population of the United States in the same period would have increased to 220
                    times its first amount. The following table, calculated from the best data to be
                    obtained, shows the comparative rate of increase in different countries.</p>

                <p>The existence of slavery is the standing reproach of America. In the structure of
                    society, it is a flaw which has corrupted the manners of the people and the
                    policy of the state. In the northern provinces, the people are sensible of its
                    evils, and of its peculiar reproach in a land of freedom; and they have not
                    failed to convey these sentiments to the proprietors of slaves. Slavery has
                    accordingly been abolished, and is nearly extinguished, in all the New England
                    states and in New York, and is hastening to its extinction in Pennsylvania, New
                    Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. By the laws of Pennsylvania, all persons born
                    within that state since 1780 are free, the children of a slave being subject to
                    a limited servitude to her owner. In New Jersey, every child born after July
                    1804 is declared free, and all traffic in slaves was prohibited in 1798. The
                    revised laws of New York declare, that every person born in that state is free;
                    that all persons brought into the state, except for a limited period, become
                    free; and that no person can be sold within the limits of the state. The
                    ordinance for the territory north-west of the river Ohio, passed in 1787,
                    prohibits for ever the introduction of slavery into that tract of country in
                    which the four states of Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Michigan, have already
                    been formed. The introduction of slaves from abroad was prohibited by Virginia
                    in 1798, and by Congress into the Mississippi territory in the same year; and in
                    1808, by the same authority, into any part of the United States. But though
                    declining, slavery still prevails in the southern states, namely, Kentucky,
                    Tennessee, Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi,
                    and even in the district of Columbia, and is the fruitful source of complicated
                    evils. Louisiana and several other states prohibited the introduction of slaves
                    from any other state except by an immigrant proprietor; but an active internal
                    trade among the southern states is carried on in slaves, who are exported in
                    great numbers from the worn-out districts towards the north and east, to be
                    employed in the cultivation of new and fresh cotton lands in the south. Like the
                    lower animals, slaves are encouraged to breed and to multiply, by those who have
                    invested their capital in the trade.</p>
                <p>But slavery, if it be the reproach of America, the far-famed land of liberality
                    and freedom, is also her misfortune; and the slave-holders would receive, as
                    they would merit, the sympathy and aid of Europe, if they would endeavour to
                    improve the condition of the slaves, and gradually prepare them for
                    emancipation, the only consummation in which it is so devoutly to be wished that
                    slavery, so unhappily begun, should happily end. In a community divided, as in
                    all slave-holding states, between two hostile races,—the oppressor and the
                    oppressed,—there are two alternatives, either by kindness and humanity to mingle
                    the two into one, or to maintain by rigour the bondage and degradation of the
                    inferior cast. In the one case, the slaves are retained in chains and darkness,
                    without hope, and the system will only stand so long as power remains on the
                    side of the oppressor. But so surely as love springs from kindness, resentment,
                    curses not loud but deep, are the fruits of oppression; and thus, in a long
                    course of abused power, a standing feud is established between two great
                    sections of the community, an arrear of vengeance accumulates, which, if
                    occasion offers, will be duly repaid by the oppressed class, in a measureless
                    retribution, for ages of violent wrong; and how precarious therefore must be the
                    condition of society, where one class lives in continual dread of the other, the
                    sentinel ever at his post, and where the slumbering vengeance of thousands may
                    at any moment awaken into activity, and convert the whole country into one scene
                    of anarchy and blood. It was from this just apprehension, and from a desire to
                    wipe out the moral stain of slavery, that Great Britain, by a generous policy,
                    emancipated the slaves in her West India colonies; and though the proportion of
                    blacks to whites was much greater, being ten, and sometimes twenty, to one, than
                    in North America, where they seldom amount to above a third of the population,
                    yet their emancipation would be a great reform, which would conduce not less to
                    the improvement of morals than to the peace of society. But this great change
                    must be the work of time. The way must be prepared by the diffusion of
                    intelligence and of purer morals; and great was the error of those over-zealous
                    missionaries who went about preaching to the American slaves the dangerous
                    doctrine of natural right; thus agitating society by the fear of some dreadful
                    crisis, which might involve the land in devastation and blood, or, if authority
                    were maintained, which would rivet, and render more cruel, the yoke of slavery.
                    And such, in point of fact, has been its effect. The incendiary doctrines of
                    these apostles of freedom really alarmed the slave-holders for their lives and
                    properties; and they now regarded them as the enemies of good order, to be
                    repressed and punished, and treated some of them so roughly that they narrowly
                    escaped with their lives. It is char that slavery will never be abolished,
                    either in America or elsewhere, except by the aid of the slaveholders
                    themselves. In the West India islands they were gained over by a bribe of 20
                    millions sterling; and it is only, we fear, by some such powerful argument that
                    the master will ever consent to the emancipation of the slave. There is no
                    authority in America that could effect the abolition of slavery. An act of
                    Congress for this purpose could scarcely be obtained; and it is even doubtful
                    how far the wealthy planters of the south would submit to a law passed, as they
                    would reason, by fanatical zealots, and endangering both their property and
                    their lives. Such discussions are now considered to be dangerous and
                    inexpedient. Hence they are forborne in the Congress, and still more all
                    attempts to legislate on the subject, as putting in jeopardy the supreme
                    authority and unity of the empire.</p>
                <p>The alarm excited in the southern states, by the missionaries of freedom, has
                    rather been unfavourable to the slaves. Fear has, as usual, been the parent of
                    cruelty. It has added to the rigour of their bondage, and has given rise to laws
                    without a parallel for barbarity in any civilized country, which are intended
                    for ever to debar the slave from the blessings either of knowledge or of
                    religion. In all the slave-states, namely, the Carolinas, Virginia, Georgia,
                    Louisiana, &amp;c., not only are those cruel laws enforced against slaves, but,
                    in the wantonness of abused power, they are extended to free men of colour, who
                    are exposed to every species of injury and insult. They are not allowed to pass
                    from one state into another. Mr Stuart, who cannot be accused of prejudice
                    against American manners or institutions, relates of an individual in South
                    Carolina, who was accustomed, during the unhealthy season, to go from Charleston
                    to New York, that, by a law recently passed, he was prohibited from crossing the
                    boundary, under the pain of not being allowed to return; and thus, having his
                    wife and children in the state, he was confined a prisoner within its limits;
                    while a person of colour coming into the same state, or brought in by a vessel,
                    is apprehended and confined in jail until the vessel is ready to sail. It ⅛
                    contrary to law that this class of nominal freemen, but real slaves, shall be
                    educated; they are not competent witnesses where the rights of the other class
                    are concerned, though their testimony is received against each other, as is even
                    the evidence of slaves; and they are tried for any offence with which they may
                    be charged, by a justice of the peace and freeholders, without the benefit of a
                    jury. From those laws passed against the offspring of slaves having the original
                    taint of slavery, we may infer the treatment of the slaves themselves. Several
                    barbarous enactments have lately been passed. In 1830 the state legislature of
                    Louisiana ordained, that “whosoever shall write, print, publish, or distribute
                    any thing <hi rend="italic">having a tendency</hi> to create discontent among
                    the free coloured <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=498"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0498-0460"/>population of this state, or insubordination among
                    the slaves, shall, at the discretion of the court, <hi rend="italic">suffer
                    death, or imprisonment at hard labour for life."</hi> The same language used in
                    any public discourse from the bar, the bench, the stage, the pulpit, or in any
                    place, or in private conversation, or the bringing into the state any paper,
                    pamphlet, or book, having any such tendency, shall subject the offender to not
                    less than three years and not more than twenty years hard labour, or death. The
                    teaching of a slave, or permitting or causing to be taught, any slave, to read
                    or write, is declared punishable with imprisonment for not less than one and not
                    more than twelve months. Another act provides for the expulsion from the state
                    of all free people of colour who came into it subsequent to the year 1807; it
                    prohibits any of this class from entering the state, and sentences to
                    imprisonment or hard labour for life such as disobey the order for their
                    departure. These laws present a revolting picture of degradation and suffering
                    on the one hand, and of disquiet and terror on the other. The ruling class live
                    in daily terror of vengeance from their wretched slaves, and hence these cruel
                    precautions. Their cruelty brings its punishment along with it; it is the
                    measure of their misery; and therefore in relaxing the bonds of slavery, the
                    happiness of all parties would be promoted.</p>
                <p>in Europe, many cruel and unjust laws have been passed, which have fallen into
                    disuse with the progress of society. But in the slave-holding states of America,
                    congenial manners give force to tyrannical laws. With some exceptions, the
                    general treatment of slaves is harsh and cruel; a fact to which all travellers
                    in the southern states of the Union bear ample testimony. Mr Stuart, already
                    mentioned, and the duke of Saxe-Weimar, in describing the treatment of American
                    slaves, give the particulars of the grossest cruelty, by individuals who are in
                    the habit of beating and ill-using their slaves on the slightest offence, or
                    sending them to gaol, where the slave, on the payment of a fee to the gaoler,
                    is, without further inquiry, fastened to a machine and lashed without mercy.
                    “Nothing is more common,” says Mr Stuart, “than for the masters and mistresses
                    of slaves, either male or female, when they wish them to be punished, to send
                    them to a prison, with a note to the gaoler, specifying the number of lashes to
                    be inflicted. If the master so orders it, the slave receives his whipping laid
                    flat upon his face upon the earth, with his hands and feet bound to posts. In
                    passing the prison in the morning, the cries of the poor creatures are
                    dreadful.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stuart’s
                    Three Years in America, vol. ii. p. 26.</p></note> At the public sales of
                    slaves, where the ties of nature are rudely tom asunder, scenes occur which are
                    revolting to humanity, and which, without the aid of laws, would be utterly
                    repudiated by the improved manners of Europe. Where these maxims prevail, they
                    forbid all hope of alleviating the lot of the slave; and the great point would
                    therefore be, to impress on the slave-holders themselves, not only the cruelty,
                    but the error of their measures. They are no doubt obstinate and prejudiced; but
                    in time the voice of reason may prevail so far as to lead to a mitigation of the
                    present harsh code, and pave the way for the abolition of slavery throughout the
                    country.</p>
                <p>In the southern states of the Union, namely, the Carolinas Virginia, Georgia,
                    Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi* Tennessee, Arkansas, slavery appears to have
                    fixed its permanent abode; and, according to the following table, which exhibits
                    the progressive increase of the two different races for the last forty years,
                    there has not been so rapid an increase in the white as in the black

                <p>In France and England, and probably in Europe at large, the females exceed the
                    males by two or three per cent.; but in the United States generally, the males
                    exceed the females by nearly four per cent. In the newest states, the excess is
                    as high as nineteen per cent. (Seybert, p.42.) The difference is still more
                    striking in what relates to ages. In the United States, children form a much
                    greater, and aged persons a much smaller, proportion of the population than in
                    Europe. In Sweden, according to Wargentin’s Tables, the persons under the age of
                    sixteen form thirty-six per cent. of the population; in Britain, according to
                    the last census, forty; and in the United States fifty per cent. The persons
                    aged above forty-five form twenty-two per cent. of the whole population in
                    Sweden, eighteen per cent. in Britain, and twelve per cent. in the United
                    States. This peculiarity arises from the rapidly progressive state of the
                    population. Since the inhabitants of the United States quadruple their numbers
                    in fifty years, a person born half a century ago belongs by his birth to a
                    society of two millions and a half of persons but now lives in a society of ten
                    millions which will furnish four times as many old men to a future and
                    equidistant period. The annual amount of immigration (to borrow an American
                    word) is very variable, and its effects have been greatly overrated. The whole
                    number of passengers who arrived in 1817, at the ten principal ports, was
                    22,240, including citizens, and persons on business who did not mean to remain
                    in the country. In 1816, it was estimated at 20,000; in 1818 and 1819, at 28,000
                    each, not more than one half of whom, very probably, were strangers <pb

                    immigrants, according to the National Calendar, was 7001, of whom 5042 were
                    males, consisting of 997 agricultural persons, 1461 commercial, 1407
                    manufacturers, artisans, &amp;c. Dr Seybert thinks the average number of
                    foreigners who come to settle in the United States does not exceed 6000 per
                    annum; but assuming it to be 8000 or 9000, this is only from <hi

                    increment, which must amount to 290,000 persons to make the population double in

                <p>This rapid increase does not greatly affect the rate of the annual mortality,
                    which is proportionally rather greater among the persons under twenty-five than
                    among those of all ages. In the absence of proper data for ascertaining the
                    annual mortality of the whole country, or of any particular state, we can only
                    refer to a single fact. The average number of deaths in Philadelphia, for eight
                    years (1807 to 1814), was found to be about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 43</hi> of the contemporaneous population. (Seybert, p. 50.)
                    In Birmingham, in the ten years ending 1811, it was about <hi rend="superscript"

                    45</hi>. (Milne’s Annuities, p. 456.) This single fact, therefore, as far as it
                    goes, bears testimony to the salubrity of the climate, and to the comfortable
                    condition of the inhabitants, of the United States.</p>
                <p>The active population in the United States is pro∣&gt;or-tionally greater, and
                    the idle population less, than in any other country. They have few public
                    functionaries, preachers, or annuitants, and a very small army and navy.
                    According to a table which will afterwards be inserted, the active population
                    amounts to twenty-seven per cent. of the whole, or two per cent. more than the
                    number of males above the age of sixteen. The proportions employed in

                <p>The situation of the labouring classes in the United States is confessedly far
                    superior to that of the same 'description of persons in any other part of the
                    world. Wages are so high, compared with the price of provisions, that an
                    American labourer, who should live exactly as labourers live in other countries,
                    might always save the half of his earnings. The average wages of a labourer were
                    estimated at seventy-five cents a day by Mr Blodget, and more recently at eighty
                    cents by Mr Niles, wheat being one and a half dollar per bushel. (Warden.
                    Introduction.) In such circumstances, a very moderate degree of industry
                    suffices to place a man above want, and pauperism can only be the lot of those
                    who are debilitated by old age or disease. Accordingly, it is a proud
                    distinction for North America, that this moral deformity, except so far as it is
                    the consequence of natural and unavoidable misfortunes, is almost unknown within
                    her borders. It is not there as in the old countries of Europe, where a person
                    who is able to provide comfortably for his own wants, has still his feelings
                    exposed to daily laceration from the sight of multitudes of miserable beings,
                    who exhibit human nature in its most loathsome and degraded state, and whose
                    wretchedness it is beyond his power to relieve. It is Rochefoucault, we think,
                    who remarks that he had seen only one beggar in the United States. Mendicity
                    does exist; but except in the large cities, where foreigners are often found in
                    a state of destitution, it rarely obtrudes itself on the eye, and may be said
                    generally to be as rare in that country as it is abundant everywhere else. In
                    Europe, the paupers have been supposed, on a rough calculation, to amount to
                    one-twentieth part of the population. In the United States, they were estimated
                    by Mr Niles, some years ago, at one person in 250 on the Atlantic coast, and one
                    in 350 in the interior. But in times of great public calamity, the proportion is
                    much higher. In the New England states, and in some of the others, though not
                    the whole, each parish is obliged to provide for the support of its own poor,
                    according to the humane spirit of the English laws. (Morse, vol. i. p. 293.

                <p>The North American Union comprehends at present twenty-six distinct states, each

                    and placed under the exclusive authority of the federal government.</p>
                <p>The thirteen original states which concurred in the declaration of independence
                    on the 4th July 1776, were New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
                    Connecticut, New-York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
                    North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia. Vermont was then an appendage to New
                    York, and Maine to Massachusetts. The extent of the several states is very
                    unequal. Rhode Island and Delaware are specks in the map, rather smaller than
                    Devonshire or Perthshire. New York, Pennsylvania, and the new states generally,
                    are each larger than Ireland or Scotland; while Virginia, Georgia, Missouri, and
                    Illinois, severally exceed England in extent. The density of the population
                    diminishes pretty regularly in every direction as we recede from Massachusetts;
                    and in that state, where it is greatest, it rather exceeds that of Spain or
                    Poland, or Europe taken altogether. The mean density for all the states east of
                    the Mississippi, including the district of Columbia, and also the state of
                    Louisiana, is nearly forty-one persons to the square mile.</p>
                <p>Some writers, who derive their political ideas from the old institutions of
                    Europe, strongly disapprove of the division into states, with distinct local
                    governments. But this arrangement, though originally the effect of accident, is
                    admirably adapted to the circumstances of the country, and deserves to rank as
                    an improvement in the science of legislation. It is the only system by which the
                    great advantages of union could be combined, in such a gigantic empire, with a

                    />friendship among states that would otherwise be rivals and enemies, exempts
                    them from the scourge of frequent wars, gives unbounded freedom to their
                    internal trade, and, while it enables them to dispense with that sort of strong
                    government which is scarcely compatible with liberty, it gives them an aggregate
                    strength, which secures them against external attacks. On the other hand, each
                    separate district, acting by its own legislature, is invested with the entire
                    regulation of its local concerns, which can never be intrusted to others without
                    the certainty of mismanagement. No single legislative body, even were its
                    sessions perpetual, could properly conduct the local business of such an empire
                    as that now forming in North America. In our own parliament, it is notorious,
                    that, from the multiplicity of business transacted, the general style of
                    legislation is most slovenly, and bills of all kinds, but especially local
                    bills, are often grossly mismanaged. How great an impediment is it felt to be to
                    the redress of grievances, or the promotion of improvements, in the remote parts
                    of Scotland and Ireland, that witnesses, parties, and agents, must be carried
                    six or seven hundred miles, at a vast expense, and that, when they reach the
                    seat of legislation, every thing must depend on the votes of persons who either
                    understand their business imperfectly or not at all, and who are only prevailed
                    upon, by solicitation, to bestow a slight attention upon it. The division into
                    states supplies the only remedy to this great evil. It encourages local
                    improvements, by uniting those whose situation gives them a community of
                    interest as to certain objects. It lessens corruption in the general government,
                    by subdividing patronage. In times of public phrensy, it multiplies the
                    securities against the persecution of individuals, because such persons w ill
                    always find protectors in some one of the state governments. It has indeed one
                    disadvantage; the state legislatures may become the strongholds of faction, as
                    was exemplified in Massachusetts during the last war. But as the number of
                    states increases, the weight of each in the confederacy, and its power to
                    disturb the union, are diminished. Even out of this danger a security arises
                    against another. The existence of the separate state governments forms a strong
                    barrier against despotism, because it creates so many distinct centres of power,
                    from which resistance might be made, if a military tyrant should master the
                    general government, as Cromwell mastered that of Britain, and Bonaparte that of
                    France. Some inconvenience, no doubt, arises from the unavoidable diversity of
                    laws in such an aggregation of republics; but the evil is not much felt or
                    complained of practically, and it is the necessary concomitant of a union
                    producing boundless advantages. An iron despotism may subject all its slaves to
                    the same laws, without regard to the distinctions of climate, character, or
                    situation; but freemen will not associate voluntarily on such a principle.
                    Liberty consists not in being governed by the laws that are absolutely best, but
                    by those which are deemed best by the people w ho obey them. No w ise and
                    liberal statesman will hold it necessary that the fishermen of Massachusetts,
                    the husbandmen of Pennsylvania, and the sugar-planters of Louisiana, should live
                    under one perfectly uniform system of jurisprudence. Such a uniformity could not
                    be enforced without rending asunder the union. And let it be recollected, that
                    the diversity of laws, such as it exists, is much less than it would be if the
                    federal compact were dissolved, and the several states entirely independent. In
                    short, if it is possible by any device to reconcile freedom with extensive
                    empire; to unite all the parts of a vast continent together in the bonds of
                    peace and commercial intercourse; and yet not to trench materially on the
                    natural rights of each part, or the free use of its natural powers and
                    advantages; it must be by a federative system similar in its essential
                    characters to that of the United States. The experiment is by far the most
                    interesting that has ever been made in the science of legislation; and the
                    steadiness and success with which it has hitherto proceeded opens up the most
                    encouraging prospects as to the future destiny of mankind.</p>
                <p>The federal government, of which we shall afterwards speak, possesses merely
                    those specific powers which are vested in it by the constitution. Ali other
                    powers and rights remain with the state governments, in which the sovereignty
                    essentially resides. The territory of each state is not the territory of the
                    Union, but of that particular state. The people and militia are the people and
                    militia of the several states, not of the Union. Lands are held under the laws
                    of the states; descents, contracts, and all the concerns of private property,
                    the administration of justice, and the whole criminal code, except in the case
                    of breaches of the laws of the federal body, are regulated by state laws.<note

                    governed by the charter granted by Charles II. in 1663. These constitutions are
                    purely republican, though the right of suffrage (for the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >franchise</hi> is inapplicable and odious where voting is a general right, not
                    a special privilege) is restricted in one or two states, and unequally divided
                    in one or two others. In every one of the states, the legislature consists of
                    two chambers, both chosen by direct popular election, except in Maryland, where
                    the senators are chosen by delegatee, ln eighteen states out of the twenty-six,
                    the representatives (or members of the lower house, according to our
                    phraseology) are elected annually, and in Tennessee and Louisiana biennially,
                    and in three triennially, viz. in South Carolina, lllinois, and Missouri. The
                    period of service in the senates (or upper houses) varies from one to four
                    years, except in Maryland, where it is five: in some cases one third or one
                    fourth, in others one half, of the members are renewed every year; in others,
                    one half every two years. In some of the states the right of suffrage was
                    formerly limited to freeholders or corporations, but by amendments in most of
                    the old constitutions these restrictions have been abolished; and the right of
                    suffrage, though variously defined in the different states, is substantially
                    universal in them all, except in New Jersey and Virginia. In these two states,
                    the possession of a small amount of property still constitutes the citizen’s
                    title to vote. In many of the states, there are certain qualifications
                    prescribed for the persons elected. A senator must, in general, be a freeholder,
                    and not under thirty years of age; a representative not under twenty-five. The
                    governors act in some cases with, in others without a council, and hold their
                    offices, some for one year, some for two, some for three, but none for more than
                    four years. In all the constitutions recently framed, an express provision is
                    introduced for adopting amendments. The rule generally is, that if any
                    alteration is judged necessary and approved of by two successive legislatures,
                    it may then be submitted to the people, who appoint a special convention to
                    decide upon it. In some cases it is provided that a convention shall meet
                    periodically to revise the constitution. The existing legislature is always
                    considered as exercising a trust, in the terms of which it has no power to make
                    the smallest change. By this principle, legislation is founded on a clear and
                    rational basis. It gives stability to institutions that might otherwise be the
                    foot-ball of domineering factions; it checks the growth of sinister interests,
                    and, while it affords a safe and easy remedy for grievances, it is so far from
                    being an inlet to rash innovations, that it is the best guarantee against them,
                    as the history of the United States demonstrates. To suffer those who exercise
                    the supreme power of a country to change at pleasure the conditions by which <pb

                    to make the laws which he administers, or the steward to fix the terms of the
                    engagement which invests him with the management of an estate. Under such a
                    system, the steward unavoidably becomes a peculator, the judge a tyrant, and the
                    legislature a junto of conspirators against the public weal.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of the United States varies according to the climate, soil, and
                    situation, of the several divisions of the country; but, taken altogether, it
                    differs materially from that of Britain, in the nature of the productions
                    cultivated, in the condition of those who are engaged in it, and in the general
                    principles by which it is conducted. Besides our staple productions, wheat,
                    barley, oats, pease, beans, turnips, and potatoes, the soil of the United States
                    yields rice. Indian corn, indigo, cotton, sugar, tobacco, the vine; and Florida
                    will probably add to these the olive and the banana, which scarcely succeed in
                    the other states. The staple produce of New England is Indian corn; that of the
                    middle states wheat and tobacco; that of the southern, cotton, rice, and, to a
                    limited extent, sugar. Dr Morse indicates the proportional quantity of each
                    species of produce raised, by naming them in the following order, the greatest
                    being first. In New England. Indian corn, grass, rye, oats, flax, wheat,
                    buck-wheat, barley, and hemp; in the middle states, wheat. Indian corn, tobacco,
                    grass, oats, buck-wheat, flax, barley, potatoes, spelts, rye; in the southern
                    states, cotton, wheat, tobacco. Indian corn, rice, indigo (formerly), barley,
                    and hemp. the western states, along the Ohio, correspond in their productions to
                    the middle states on the Atlantic. Good soils, carefully cultivated, in the
                    United States, yield 100 bushels of Indian corn or 50 of wheat per acre. But the
                    average produce of the cultivated land in Ohio and Kentucky, districts not
                    inferior in soil to any in the Union, is estimated as follows: Maize 40 bushels
                    per acre, wheat 22, rye 26, oats 35, barley 30, tobacco 12 to 15 cwt., cotton 5
                    to 7 cwt. in the seed, or from 150 to 200 pounds cleaned. (James, vol. iii. p.
                    199.) This great staple of the United States consists of two sorts, the
                    sea-island or long staple, and the upland or short staple. The former, of a
                    superior quality, is grown along the sea-coast of South Carolina and Georgia.
                    Cotton was first sown in the United States in 1787, and was exported in small
                    packages, called packets, in 1790. In 1800 the produce amounted to 85,000,000
                    lbs., which has gradually increased to 480,000,000 in 1836, of which there were
                    exported 386,000,000 lbs. The value of the crop was estimated to amount to
                    80,000,000 dollars, and that of the exports to 63,000,000 dollars. A great fall
                    has since taken place in the price; but even at this lower rate the value of the
                    cotton exported in the year ending September 1838 was 61,536,811 dollars, and
                    the quantity of cotton 595,952,297 lbs. Tobacco, an indigenous American plant,
                    has been the staple of Maryland and Virginia from their first settlement; and it
                    is also extensively cultivated in Kentucky, Ohio, Missouri, and other states.
                    The quantity of tobacco exported in 1838 amounted to 100,593 hhds., in value
                    7,392,029 dollars; besides 75,083 lbs. snuff, and 5,008,147 lbs. of manufactured
                    tobacco, amounting in value to 577,420 dollars. An acre sown in rice yields from
                    1200 to 1500 pounds on what are called tide-lands, and from 600 to 1200 on
                    inland plantations. Rice was first cultivated in South Carolina in 1694; and its
                    culture has been so successful that, in addition to the home consumption, it was
                    exported in 1838 to the amount of 71,048 tierces, of the value of 1,721,819
                    dollars. In 1835 the quantity exported amounted to 110,851 tierces, of the value
                    of 2,210,331 dollars. An acre planted in canes yields about 1000 or 1200 pounds
                    of sugar, with an equal quantity of molasses. The necessity of renewing the
                    canes annually by planting, in consequence of the winter’s frost, renders the
                    cultivation less advantageous than in the West Indies. In 1817, however, it was
                    calculated that 20,000,000 of pounds of sugar were made in Louisiana alone; a
                    quantity estimated to be about two sevenths of the whole annual consumption of
                    the United States. (Warden, ii. p. 483,541. Morse, i. p. 668.) The culture of
                    sugar has since been greatly extended; and in 1838 the quantity exported
                    amounted to 408,802 pounds, and the value to 30,487 dollars;<note

                <p>The rural population of the United States presents an extraordinary contrast in
                    its constituent parts to that of every country in Europe. The class of extensive
                    proprietors living on their rents, and the class of peasants living merely by
                    their labour, are almost equally unknown. The great bulk of the inhabitants
                    consists of farmers, who are the owners of the lands they occupy, and the
                    greater proportion of whom work with their own hands. “The number of those who
                    are mere labourers,” says Dwight, “is almost nothing, except in a few populous
                    towns, and almost all these are collected from the shiftless, the idle, and the
                    vicious. A great part of them are foreigners. Every young man hired to work upon
                    a farm aims steadily to acquire a farm for himself, and hardly once fails of the
                    acquisition.” (Dwight’s Travels, vol. iv. p. 335.) Except in some few spots near
                    large towns, there is scarcely any land rented. The price is generally so low,
                    that a small addition to the sum necessary for stocking a farm suffices to
                    purchase it; and even where the value is higher, an individual who has money
                    enough to stock a large farm will prefer buying one of half the size. Of the
                    state of New York, only one fifth, and of the whole inhabited country east of
                    the Mississippi (excluding Michigan and Florida), only about one tenth part is
                    yet cleared and cultivated. Of course the best soils are first used, and, till
                    population thickens and produce rises, soils of the second and third quality
                    will not repay the expense of culture; and as a necessary consequence, those of
                    the first quality yield no rent. The farms occupied by the owners are seldom
                    large, because, where wages are high, agriculture cannot be advantageously
                    conducted on an extensive scale; and the large property in land occasionally
                    acquired by an individual is soon broken up by division among his children. Thus
                    situated, the rural population certainly enjoy a greater share of happiness in
                    the United States than in any other country in the world. They are exempted from
                    the fluctuations incident to the commercial and manufacturing classes; they feel
                    none of the evils of dependence, and are far above want; without possessing that
                    wealth which engenders idleness and vanity, and often becomes a snare to its
                    possessor. They have the means of settling their families well, without making
                    great sacrifices; they live in the enjoyment of all the substantial comforts of
                    life, and can look forward to old age with less anxiety and apprehension than
                    any class of men in any other country.</p>
                <p>The system of agriculture is necessarily less perfect in the United States than
                    in Britain. Where prime soils can be had for almost nothing, where the price of
                    labour is high, and that of produce low, the elaborate and costly modes of
                    cultivation adopted in Britain cannot be advantageously applied. Some English
                    farmers, who have gone out to America with an impression that large gains might
                    be made by introducing our improved system of husbandry, have found themselves
                    disappointed. Something the Americans may learn from us; but, till the country
                    is more densely peopled, it will be more profitable to cultivate a large surface
                    rudely than a small one laboriously. In the middle and eastern states, however,
                    where produce brings a considerable price, farming is carried on with care and

                    as an agricultural state, in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Jersey,
                    agricultural societies exist, and much attention is paid to the cultivation of
                    the indigenous grasses and to the use of manures. Grazing is well understood in
                    New England, where it is considered the most profitable species of farming. Much
                    care has been bestowed on the breeding of sheep, and Merinos are now spread over
                    all the northern, middle, and western states.</p>
                <p>Hutchins reckoned that <hi rend="superscript"> 13</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    16</hi> ths of the land east of the Mississippi were covered with a strong
                    fertile soil, and that the remaining <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 16</hi> ths were occupied by lakes and rivers, or consisted of
                    land too poor or too steep for cultivation. In 1811, Mr Blodget estimated the
                    land under “actual improvement” to be 40,950,000 acres, or 5¾th acres for each
                    inhabitant, a proportion which is found to be near the truth. In 1798, when a
                    census was taken for the imposition of a tax, the quantity of land valued and
                    taxed in sixteen states was one hundred and sixty-three millions of acres out of
                    three hundred and eight millions, the estimated value of which was four hundred
                    and seventy-nine millions of dollars. The value per acre varied widely. In
                    Connecticut it was fifteen dollars per acre, in Pennsylvania six, in Georgia
                    three fourths; but the average for the whole was about three dollars. The value
                    of the houses was estimated at a hundred and forty millions of dollars, or two
                    sevenths of that of the land. When new returns were procured in 1814, the value
                    of lands and houses conjointly had risen from six hundred and twenty to one
                    thousand six hundred and thirty millions of dollars. From these two documents,
                    which afford a curious view of the state and growth of property in the republic,
                    we find that, in the sixteen states organized in 1798, rather more than one half
                    of the surface was the property of individuals. In the old states, such as
                    Massachusetts and Connecticut, the appropriated land embraced nearly the whole
                    surface; in New York it embraced about four sevenths, in Georgia one third. The
                    number of acres appropriated for each individual of the population was about
                    thirty, of which five and one half or six acres were cleared or “improved.” The
                    estimated value of the houses and lands was at the rate of 125 dollars for each
                    individual of the contemporaneous population in 1798, but had risen to 200
                    dollars in 1814. Supposing every other species of property to have grown as
                    rapidly, the rate of increase would be about 6¼th per cent. per annum, and the
                    capital of the country must double itself in 11¼th years, or it increases twice
                    as rapidly as the population. With a stationary population, the rate of increase
                    would be 5∙4 per cent., and the period of doubling 18¼th years. We have no
                    similar data for other countries to found a comparison on, but we are certain
                    that such a velocity of accumulation is unknown anywhere else.</p>
                <p>The value of houses, lands, <hi rend="italic">and slaves,</hi> in 1814, was,
                    according to the returns, 1902 millions of dollars. If we add one eighth for
                    omissions and under estimates, and for Louisiana, which was not included, with
                    fifty millions for state lands, and two thirds additional for all other species
                    of property (this being nearly the proportion in Colquhoun’s estimate for
                    Britain), namely, agricultural stock, manufactured goods on hand or in progress,
                    ships, harbours, canals, roads, public buildings, &amp;c., the whole will be
                    3550 millions of dollars, equal to 780 millions sterling, or about L.95 for each
                    individual of the contemporaneous population. Colquhoun’s estimate for Britain
                    was 2700 millions sterling, or L. 150 for each inhabitant. This gross amount,
                    increasing at the rate of 6 per cent., would become 1400 millions sterling in
                    1824; and the annual increment, or the value added to the national capital,
                    every year, should be about eighty millions sterling. The whole annual produce
                    of the national industry, which affords a saving of eighty millions, cannot be
                    less than four times as much, or 320 millions, that is, L.S2 per head on the
                    population. Colquhoun’s estimate for the British Isles in 1812 was 430 millions,
                    or L.24 per head on the population. (Colquhoun, p. 55, 65.) These calculations
                    are founded on the returns taken as they stand. It is probable, however, that
                    the second census would be more accurately taken than the first, and that the
                    growth of the national capital is not quite so great as it appears.</p>
                <p>The large profits which farming yields, the high price of labour, and the
                    comparative scarcity of capital, are discouragements to manufacturing industry
                    in the United States; and hence they naturally rely for a supply of manufactures
                    on countries that have been longer settled, and where industry has made greater
                    progress. Great Britain is a vast storehouse of ready-made goods; and it is more
                    for the interest of an advancing and imperfectly cultivated country, such as
                    America, to purchase with its rude produce the manufactures of Britain, than to
                    divert her scanty capital (scanty, when compared with the boundless outlet which
                    lies before it in the improvement of the interior wilderness) from the important
                    business of cultivation. By this exchange, America is supplied on the easiest
                    terms with manufactures, while Great Britain, rich in capital, and still more in
                    art and industry, finds a vent in the increasing demands of the American people
                    for her surplus produce, and receives in return cotton and the other raw
                    materials of her industry. Domestic manufactures will no doubt be gradually
                    improved in America with the progress of wealth and population. But at present
                    they have not made nearly the same progress as in Great Britain. Yet there is no
                    art or trade necessary for comfort or convenience which is not pursued in
                    America; only the great manufactures of cotton, linen, woollen, iron, glass,
                    &amp;c., are not on the same great scale, or in such perfection, as in Britain;
                    they are however all established, and are rapidly advancing. There are
                    manufactures of soap, candles; of leather in all its branches; of household
                    furniture, coaches, and other carriages; of snuff and tobacco; of paper and
                    stationery; of printing presses and types; and printing and engraving are
                    carried on in all their branches. There are also manufactures in all the metals;
                    of combs and brushes, umbrellas, &amp;c. Pianofortes are respectably made. The
                    saw gin for cleaning cotton from the husks, and the nail making machine, are
                    American inventions. The woollen manufacture is almost entirely domestic, being
                    carried on in the houses of the farmers; but the cotton manufacture is partly
                    conducted in large works. This last, as well as several other manufactures,
                    received a great stimulus during the last war with Britain; but they have
                    declined since the peace, though a few of the works then established are still
                    carried on with advantage. It was computed by a committee of Congress, that the
                    cotton manufactures, which consumed only 10,000 bales of the raw material in
                    1810, consumed 90,000 in 1815, employed 100,000 hands (10,000 men, 66,000 women
                    and girls, 24,000 boys), and produced 81,000,000 yards of cloth, valued at 24
                    millions of dollars. In 1835 the number of looms was estimated at 48,000, from
                    eighty-five to ninety millions of pounds were consumed, and the value of the
                    manufactures was computed at 50,000,000 dollars. The value of the woollen
                    manufacture was estimated at nineteen millions of dollars, and was supposed to
                    employ 50,000 hands constantly, and as many more occasionally. (Reports of 13th
                    February and 6th March 1816.) The total value of the woollen manufactures has
                    since been computed at between sixty-five and seventy millions of dollars. Broad
                    cloths are manufactured; as are also cassimeres, satinets, flannels, blankets,
                    carpeting, &amp;c. Hemp and flax are manufactured in considerable quantities,
                    but chiefly in families. Very ingenious machinery has however been applied to
                    the spinning of cables and cordage, which are manufactured to the value of five
                    millions of dollars. Some sailcloth is also made.</p>

                    bar iron made in 1810 was estimated at 27,000 tons; in 1830 it had increased to
                    112,000 tons. Of pig iron 191,536 tons were also produced, amounting in value to
                    13,329,760 dollars. The iron manufactures, which in 1810 amounted in value to
                    14,364,526 dollars, are now estimated at little short of 50,000,000 dollars. The
                    manufacture of machinery in which iron is required, is carried to great
                    perfection. Steam-engines of all dimensions, and every description of machinery,
                    chain-cables, agricultural and mechanical tools of all kinds, fire-arms, nails,
                    fire-grates, and stoves, have long been made in different parts of the United
                    States. There is no country in which the application of the steamengine to the
                    purposes of navigation has been of greater practical value than in America; and
                    the number of steamers amounted in 1838 to 800,<note anchored="true"

                    number of steam-engines to 1860, which may give an idea of the extent of this
                    manufacture. The manufacture of spirits is carried on to a large extent
                    throughout the United States. The materials used are grain, molasses, and
                    fruits, chiefly the two former, from which it was estimated that the spirits
                    distilled amounted to 25,000,000 gallons in 1810. It is stated that in 1835 4000
                    distilleries had been stopt through the influence of temperance societies, but
                    the truth of this statement is doubted. Tobacco is manufactured to the annual
                    value of 2,000,000 of dollars, and glass and paper to the respective values of
                    3,000,000 and 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 of dollars. There were in 1831 thirty
                    chemical establishments in the United States, of which the produce was estimated
                    at 1,000,000 dollars a year. Cabinet-ware is made to the value of about
                    10,000,000 dollars; and horn, wood, ivory, and shell combs to the value of
                    800,000, and buttons to an equal amount. According to the returns made in the
                    census of 1810, the whole annual value of the manufactures of the United States
                    was 127,694,602 dollars. But Mr Tenche Coxe calculated, that, making allowance
                    for articles omited or under-estimated, the true value would not be less than
                    172,700,000 dollars (L.37,500,000). Mr Pitkin, in his elaborate work on the
                    Statistics of the United States, estimates the aggregate value of manufactures
                    in 1835 to be from 325,000,000 to 350,000,000 dollars; and he adds, that the
                    amount of foreign articles consumed in the country, exclusive of tea, wine,
                    coffee, and spices, does not exceed one third of that sum. Nearly one fourth of
                    the manufactures is in Pennsylvania; Massachusetts ranks next, then New York,
                    Virginia, Maryland, Connecticut, North Carolina, New Jersey, Vermont, Kentucky.
                    It may be remarked, that the effect of the high price of labour in discouraging
                    manufactures is counteracted by three circumstances. 1. The United States being
                    far distant from Europe, the expense of freight, and still more that of inland
                    carriage, makes a material addition to the prime cost of all bulky or heavy
                    articles. 2. As the use of machinery comes to be substituted more and more for
                    manual labour, the disadvantage of high wages gradually vanishes; and the
                    Americans, who possess great mechanical genius, have the means of procuring
                    steam and water power to an unlimited extent. 3. The American women prefer
                    working in factories to domestic service, which they consider degrading; and
                    hence female labourers are not scarce, and may be procured at moderate
                    wages.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Seybert, 6, 8.

                <p>The commerce of the United States has gradually expanded to a vast extent, and
                    has made much greater progress than manufactures. The Americans are not
                    surpassed in activity and enterprise by any other nation; and the surplus
                    produce, which in every country is the means of its foreign trade, naturally
                    increases with the progress of cultivation. The wars and convulsions of Europe
                    consequent on the French Revolution threw a great proportion of the general
                    carrying trade into their hands; and in the interval from 1790 to 1807, their
                    exports increased from 20 millions to 108 millions of dollars. But in the course
                    of the war, Great Britain and France differed concerning the respective rights
                    of the neutral and the belligerent; and this dispute ended in their defiance of
                    all those maxims of public law which formerly restrained the rage of war. They
                    refused any longer to recognise the rights of the neutral trader; his
                    merchandise was considered to be lawful prey, France issued the Berlin decrees
                    for the seizure an,d confiscation of all British goods on the land, which were
                    ordered to be consumed in the flames; and Great Britain issued her orders in
                    council for the proscription of all trade with France by sea, and for the
                    detention of all vessels bound to a French port. Lawless violence thus reigned,
                    and the unprecedented outrages which followed gave a sudden check to the growing
                    trade of the United States, from which it did not recover and attain its former
                    extent till the year 1835. The progressive increase of the American trade will
                    be seen from the following table of the exports and imports of the country from
                    the year 1791 to 1838 inclusive.</p>

                <p>From these tables it will be seen, that foreign produce or manufactures
                    constitute about one ninth of the exports. The leading articles chiefly consist
                    of the produce of the land. Cotton forms about 60 per cent. of the domestic
                    exports; wheat. Indian corn, and other bread-stuffs, 10 per cent.; tobacco 12
                    per cent.; lumber, bark, &amp;c. 3½ per cent.; horses, beef, &amp;c. 2½ per
                    cent. The leading imports are the fine products of the loom in wool, cotton,
                    silk, and linen, or articles not raised in the country, such as tea, coffee,
                    sugar, and wine. In hemp, iron, and leather, the imports are small. Nearly one
                    half of the whole imports come from Britain, and only about one seventh from
                    France.</p>
                <p>The internal and coasting trade of the United States has increased more rapidly
                    than their foreign commerce, and is undoubtedly far greater than that of any
                    other state with an <pb break="no"

                    tons in 1795, had risen to 588,000 in 1821, and in 1838 to 1,133,999. It now
                    exceeds the registered tonnage, of which it formed only one third in 1795. The
                    Hudson is the great channel of inland trade for districts containing nearly two
                    millions of inhabitants, and is rapidly advancing, both in its commerce and
                    navigation. 'The Delaware, Susquehannah, Potomac, and other large rivers farther
                    south, all exhibit an active and growing traffic. The vessels on the majestic
                    Mississippi, though they do not yet equal those on the Hudson, are fast
                    increasing with the progress of cultivation and commerce.</p>

                <p>The application of steam to the propelling of vessels forms a great era in the
                    history of navigation. It is perhaps one of the greatest practical discoveries
                    of which modem times can boast. It even effects a greater improvement in the
                    intercourse by sea, than the railroad in that by land; and perhaps no other
                    country, owing to natural advantages, has derived such incalculable benefits
                    from it as America. From the rapidity of the vast rivers by which the country is
                    intersected, the navigation against the stream by means of wind and sails was
                    seldom practicable; and as the voyage downward was speedy and certain, the
                    upward voyage was in proportion tedious. Accordingly, the boats that brought
                    down the produce of the interior from the Ohio and other streams to New Orleans,
                    were generally broken up and used for fire-wood, and the crew were thus
                    compelled to retrace their course by land. But the power of steam, unlike the
                    fickle gale, is equable and constant. It can at all times be relied on; and,
                    surpassing in force the raging torrent, it propels the vessel with the same
                    certainty through the adverse waters as in the downward voyage. Some such agency
                    was required to facilitate the navigation of rivers, and to turn to full account
                    the advantages which they afford for internal intercourse. A voyage from New
                    Orleans to Pittsburg against the current of the Mississippi, running from four
                    to six miles an hour, generally occupied six weeks; it now does not occupy as
                    many days. What a boundless field is here opened for steam-navigation, which
                    accordingly is universally extended through the whole country. Experiments were
                    made at an early period, both in America and elsewhere, for propelling vessels
                    by steam. The idea was broached in England in 1736, in France in 1782, and
                    various trials were made in America from 1783 to 1787. A steam-vessel was
                    actually constructed by Mr Miller of Dalswinton, and was seen sailing on the
                    Clyde about this period; but the discovery was not followed out. It was however
                    from his model that Mr Fulton constructed in 1807, on the Hudson river, in the
                    state of New York, his first steam-vessel, which, with an engine of only
                    eighteen horsepower, made the passage between Albany and New York, a distance of
                    160 miles, in thirty-three hours. The whole number of steam-vessels in the
                    United States was estimated, from the information collected by the select
                    committee on steam-engines, and laid before Congress, at 800 in December 1838.
                    Of these, nearly 400 are now computed to be running on the western and
                    south-western waters, comprising chiefly the Mississippi and its tributary
                    streams, where none was used till 1811, and where in 1834 the number was
                    computed to be only 234. On the Ohio, the number of passages by steam-vessels
                    through the Louisville Canal, which in 1831 was 406, had increased in 1837 to
                    1501, or nearly fourfold in six years. About seventy steam-vessels were running
                    in 1838 on the north-western lakes, where in 1825 there were only twenty-five.
                    Of the whole number, nearly 800, sailing in 1838 chiefly on the American rivers,
                    140 belong to the state of New York. Of these, very few are sea-going vessels.
                    The government of the United States never owned more than two steam-vessels of
                    war, one of which is now lost; though about thirteen other steam-vessels are
                    employed by the war department on the public works, and in the transportation of
                    troops and stores. The steam-boats in the United States are computed at 60,000
                    tons. The largest of those that run between New York and Mississippi is supposed
                    to be 860 tons, and nearly 300 horse-power. There are two on Lake Erie of 755
                    and 700 tons. The chief places for the construction of steam-vessels and their
                    engines arc, Pittsburg, Cincinnati, and Louisville, on the western waters; and
                    New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, on the Atlantic<pb break="no"

                    Secretary of the Treasury to the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
                    December 12. 1838, p. 11.</p></note> Owing to the numerous and fatal accidents
                    that have befallen steam-vessels in the United States, the subject was early
                    investigated, under the directions of Congress, when ample information was
                    obtained from every part of the Union respecting the causes and consequences of
                    these casualties. A stringent enactment had been previously passed by this
                    active and energetic government, ordaining, under heavy penalties, increased
                    caution in the management of this craft; frequent examinations, by qualified
                    persons, of the nature and strength of the machinery; and prosecutions against
                    the officers and owners for injuries to life and property; thus evincing that
                    vigilance and laudable anxiety for the public safety which so well merits the
                    confidence of the people. Another law, it is expected, will follow, providing
                    for the employment of careful and skilful engineers.</p>
                <p>Those accidents that have occurred to steam-vessels are computed to have amounted
                    to 260; ninety-nine occasioned by explosions of the boilers, or the bursting of
                    some part of the engines, or by collapses; twenty-five by shipwreck from
                    collision, gales, &amp;c.; twenty-eight by fire; fifty-two by snags or sawyers,
                    which are trees that, having been swept away by floods, have, in their course
                    down the river, stuck in the bottom, and there remain, moving up and down, and
                    have, from the resemblance of their motion to sawyers, received that name. They
                    are extremely dangerous to vessels that run against them. Different and unknown
                    causes have occasioned the loss of twenty-four steam-vessels. “The general
                    impression,” says the secretary at war in his letter, “is, that a great part of
                    the boats destroyed by explosions, as well as many lost by fire and other
                    accidents, would have been saved by proper experience, science, and attention,
                    on the part of the engineers and commanders.” Such accidents are in all cases
                    occasioned by ignorance or carelessness; and it is highly necessary that the
                    agency of steam, as it is so powerful and useful, should be also rendered
                    comfortable and safe. This has not been the case in America; and the frequent
                    explosions which have occurred with loss of life, give an impression of
                    recklessness and mismanagement, highly disgraceful to those in the immediate
                    charge. In this country such evils could not have continued so long. They would
                    have been put down by the scandal which they would have excited, even by the
                    force of public opinion, without the aid of laws.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It appears that a prejudice bad arisen in
                    favour of copper boilers, which, as copper is inferior to iron in tenacity, were
                    not so safe. But one of the proprietors or managers of steam-boats said it was
                    impossible to disabuse the people of this error; and that unless the, used a
                    boiler of this metal, a vessel would be built, and provided with a copper
                    boiler, and run against them. So, this person adds, in a tone of reckless levity
                    that cannot be too severely reprobated, “we have concluded, therefore, to give
                    them a copper boiler, the strongest of its class, and have made up our minds
                    that they have a perfect right to be scalded by copper boilers if they insist on
                    it. ’ “Hament to add," says</p><p>Wm. C. Redfield, the writer of the excellent
                    letter to the secretary to the treasury, in which this anecdote is given, “that
                    the exercise of this * right’ to the use of copper was attended, within a few
                    years, with a fearful destruction of life, as bad been foretold.”</p></note> The
                    number of lives lost in these various accidents is differently stated. The
                    lowest amount is stated at 2000; though, according to other accounts, it is
                    double or triple. The secretary to the treasury states that be had been able to
                    ascertain 1676 killed and 443 wounded in steam-boats. By the sinking of a vessel
                    on the Mississippi in 1837, 300 lives were lost, which is the greatest number by
                    any one accident. By the explosion of a vessel on the same river in 1838, 130
                    lives were lost, and 120 by that of another on the Ohio. By the burning of a
                    vessel on the Mississippi in 1837, 130 persons perished; and 100 by shipwreck in
                    the same year on the North Carolina shore. The loss of property from the same
                    cause is estimated at between five and six millions of dollars.</p>
                <p>The internal intercourse of the United States has been wonderfully improved by
                    the construction of canals, which fill up the blanks left by nature in the water
                    communications of the country, and more recently by railroads, which now
                    intersect the American territory in all directions. Plans of improvement, which,
                    when they were proposed, were regarded as visionary, have been actually
                    executed, and have far outstript the most sanguine hopes of their projectors.
                    Capital to a prodigious amount has been laid out on these improvements, which
                    have already produced, and are destined to produce still more, mighty changes in
                    the internal intercourse and genera) aspect of the world. In a lew years they
                    will connect the St Lawrence with the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic with the
                    Mississippi. Nor need we wonder if we yet see the railroad car speeding its
                    course, on wings of fire, from New York, along the great table-land of New
                    Spain, to Mexico The following account of the canal navigation of the United
                    States is abridged from Mitchell’s Compendium of the internal Improvements of
                    the country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Maine.—</hi> The only canal of any importance in this state is
                    Cumberland and Oxford Canal, which extends from Portland to Sebago Pond. By
                    means of a lock constructed in Songo river, it is connected with Brandy and Long
                    Ponds, and comprehends a water communication, natural and artificial, of about
                    fifty miles in extent. It was completed in 1829, at an expense of 250,000
                    dollars.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">New Hampshire.—</hi> The internal improvements in this state
                    consist of a series of short canals, constructed on the Merrimack river, for the
                    improvement of its navigation, by means of which, and the Middlesex Canal,
                    Boston is connected with the interior of New Hampshire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vermont.—</hi> There are several short canals constructed in
                    this state on the western bank of the Connecticut river, intended principally
                    for improving the navigation of that river.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Massachusetts.—</hi> The Middlesex Canal, in connection with
                    those in New Hampshire, opens a water-communication between Boston and the
                    interior parts of that state. It connects the Merrimack river with Boston
                    harbour, and extends from Charlestown, opposite Boston, to Chelmsford,
                    twenty-seven miles. It was completed in 1808, at an expense of 528,00 dollars.
                    The Blackstone Canal commences at Worcester, Massachusetts, and extends to
                    Providence, Rhode Island. It was completed in 1828, at an expense of 600,000
                    dollars. The Hampshire and Hampden Canal, uniting with the Farmington Canal at
                    Southwick, and extending thence to Northampton, twenty miles, connects the
                    Connecticut river with New Haven harbour. The entire distance is seventy-eight
                    miles. It was commenced in 1825, and finished at an expense of 600,000 dollars.
                    There are other two canals, constructed for passing two fulls in the Connecticut
                    river.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Connecticut.—</hi> The Farmington Canal, in Connecticut,
                    commences at New Haven, and passes through the state fifty-eight miles, to its
                    northern boundary, where it is connected with the Hampshire and Hampden Canal in
                    Massachusetts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">New York.—</hi> The Erie Canal is by far the most important
                    work of the kind in the United States, or indeed in the world. It was commenced
                    in 1817, and completed in 1825. It unites the Hudson with Lake Erie, extending
                    from Albany, on that river, to Buffalo on Lake Erie, a distance of 363 miles,
                    with a width at the bottom of twenty-eight feet, at the surface of forty feet,
                    and a depth of water of four feet. The number of locks is eighty-four, and the
                    rise and fall 698 feet. This great work was begun without any sanguine hopes of
                    success, and was generally pronounced to be vain <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=509" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0509-0471"
                    />and chimerical; and four years after its commencement, the revenues derived
                    from the tolls were estimated at the low rate of 150,000 dollars a year, whereas
                    they amounted for the first ten years after its completion to ten millions of
                    dollars; and the tonnage brought down by the canal, which was estimated, with a
                    fear of its being deemed extravagant, at 250,000 tons, actually exceeded, in
                    1836, 1,300,000 tons. The whole debt incurred in the construction of this canal
                    is now paid off, and it yields, over all expenses, a considerable surplus, which
                    is expended on other public works. This however is one of the most successful
                    undertakings in the United States. There are others of which the revenue hardly
                    pays the expense of repairs. But the influence of this great work on the general
                    prosperity of the country has been still more remarkable. It has given a
                    wonderful impulse to the agriculture of the interior; it has converted deserts
                    into fruitful fields. Flourishing towns have been seen to spring up in its
                    track. Albany, l’tica, Rochester, and Buffalo, have, from the facilities of
                    communication which it has afforded, the two first doubled their respective
                    populations within ten years, and that of the two latter has increased,
                    Rochester from 5271 in 1825, to 14,404 in 1835, and Utica from 2600 to 15,661.
                    Champlain Canal extends farther from Whitehall, on Lake Champlain, to Albany, a
                    distance of sixty-three miles. Oswego Canal, a branch of the Erie, connects Lake
                    Ontario with the Erie Canal. It is thirty-eight miles in length. Cayuga and
                    Seneca Canal extends from Geneva, on Seneca lake, to Montezuma, on Erie Canal, a
                    distance of twenty miles. Chemung Canal extends eighteen miles from the head
                    waters of Seneca lake to the Chemung or Tioga river. Chenango Canal extends from
                    the Erie Canal, near Utica, in Oneida county, to Binghampton in Broome county,
                    on Susquehannah river, in length 9.3¾ miles. Black River Canal extends
                    thirty-six miles, from Rome to the high falls on the Black River. The net
                    revenue received from the Erie and Champlain Canals was, for the year ending
                    September 1834, 1,035,644 dollars. The other canals have not been profitable.
                    The following is a statement of the different canals already constructed by the
                    state, and of the expense of their construction.</p>

                    south-west direction, to Port Jervis on the Delaware, fifty-nine miles, where it
                    unites with the Lackawaxen Canal, proceeds up the left bank of the Delaware to
                    Lackawaxen Creek, thence to Honesdale, the termination of the canal, 108 miles.
                    It was completed in 1828. There are several other inconsiderable canals within

                    Jersey city on Hudson river, across the state of New Jersey, to Delaware river,
                    opposite Easton, Pennsylvania, where it connects with the Lehigh Canal; the
                    distance being 101 miles, the expense nearly two millions of dollars. The
                    Delaware and Raritan Canal extends from Bordentown, on Delaware river, to New
                    Brunswick, on the Raritan, forty-two miles. In this state there are several
                    other inconsiderable canals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pennsylvania</hi> The main division of the Pennsylvania Canal
                    commences at Columbia, at the termination of the Columbia Railroad, passes up
                    the bank of the Susquehannah to the mouth of the Juniatta river, and thence to
                    Holidaysburg, at the eastern base of the Alleghany Mountains; its length being
                    171 miles. The western division commences at Johnstown on the Conemaugh, pursues
                    the course of that stream, and also that of the Kiskiminitas and Alleghany
                    rivers, and finally terminates at Pittsburg. In connection with the Columbia
                    Railroad, it forms a grand chain of communication between the eastern and
                    western parts of the state, the distance from Philadelphia to Pittsburg being
                    about 395 miles. It is proposed to extend this communication to the town of
                    Beaver, so as to unite with the Beaver division. The distance is only
                    twenty-five miles; and this, with a proposed canal from Newcastle to Akron on
                    the Ohio and Erie Canal, would, with the exception of the passage over the
                    Alleghany Portage Railroad, of thirty-six miles, form a water-communication from
                    Philadelphia to New Orleans of 2435 miles. The Susquehannah division of the
                    Pennsylvania Canal leaves the main division at the mouth of the Juniatta, and
                    passing up the west bank of the Susquehannah river, intersects the north branch
                    and west branch divisions at Northumberland. Its length is thirty-nine miles.
                    The north branch division commences at the termination of the Susquehannah
                    division, and passes along the right bank of the north branch of the
                    Susquehannah. The west branch division commences at the same point as the north
                    branch division, and is carried along the left bank of the west branch of the
                    Susquehannah. The Beaver division of the Pennsylvania Canal commences at the
                    town of Beaver on the Ohio river, twenty-six miles below Pittsburg, and ascends
                    the valley of the Ohio river, and its tributary the Chenango Creek, to its
                    termination in Mercer county, a distance of forty-six miles. It is intended, by
                    a farther extension of this canal, to connect Lake Erie with the Ohio; and by
                    another canal from Newcastle on the Beaver division, twenty-four miles above the
                    town of Beaver, along the valley of the Mahoning river to Akron, a distance of
                    eighty-five miles, to connect the canal navigation of the Ohio with that of
                    Pennsylvania; and thus a water-communication being opened to Philadelphia, that
                    city will rival New York as the maritime emporium of the western states. At
                    present the valuable produce of these rising states is carried through Lake
                    Erie, the navigation of which is frequently dangerous, and the Erie Canal, to
                    New York, a distance of 760 miles, while the route by the proposed series of
                    canals to Philadelphia is not above 575 miles. This route would also possess
                    this additional advantage over that by the Erie Canal, that it would not be
                    interrupted for so long a time by the winter frosts. All traffic on the Erie
                    Canal is suspended during five months of the year, it being seldom navigable
                    till the 20th April, and rarely after the 20th November; while, from the milder
                    climate of Pennsylvania, its canals are open from the 10th March to the 25th
                    December. When all the projected lines of intercourse by canals and railroads
                    are completed in Pennsylvania, from Pittsburg to Philadelphia, the merchants of
                    the latter city will be enabled to monopolize the western trade during the <pb

                <p>The Delaware division commences at Bristol, eighteen miles above Philadelphia,
                    and passes thence in a direct line to Morrisville, opposite Trenton, a distance
                    of fifty-nine miles. This is the channel by which the coal-trade of the Lehigh
                    reaches Philadelphia. The Schuylkill Canal extends from Philadelphia to Reading,
                    and thence to Mount Carbon, a distance of 108 miles. The Union Canal connects
                    the borders of the Susquehannah with those of the Schuylkill, and is in length
                    eighty-two miles. The Lacka-waxen Canal commences at the termination of the
                    Delaware and Hudson, and unites with a railroad at Honesdale, a distance of
                    forty-nine miles. The Lehigh Canal extends from Easton, on Delaware river, to
                    Mauch Chunk; its length being 46¾ miles. There are several other smaller canals,
                    chiefly for improving the navigation of the Susquehannah river.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Delaware.</hi> —The Chesapeake and Delaware Canal connects
                    Delaware river with Chesapeake Bay. It is fourteen miles in length, and was
                    constructed at the immense expense of 2,200,000 dollars, owing to its size,
                    being sixty-six feet broad at the surface, and eight feet deep, and to the depth
                    of its excavations and the extent of its embankments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Maryland.—</hi> The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, commenced in
                    1828, is a great undertaking, which, extending from the tide-water of the
                    Potomac river, above Georgetown, in the district of Columbia, and terminating at
                    Pittsburg in Pennsylvania, a distance of 341¼ miles, would connect the Atlantic
                    with the Ohio and the Mississippi, terminating in the Gulf of Mexico The breadth
                    of this canal, which would be a splendid improvement, is from sixty to eighty
                    feet at the surface, and fifty at the bottom. In the year 1835 it was only
                    completed to the distance of 100 miles. The undertaking languished for want of
                    funds. The estimated expense is 3,650,000 dollars. The district of Columbia has
                    two branches connected with the above canal.</p>
                <p>The Dismal Swamp Canal, in Virginia, connects Chesapeake Bay with Albemarle
                    Sound; and various other small canals have been constructed for improving the
                    navigation of James River, by avoiding the falls which interrupt the navigation.
                    They may be considered as the commencement of a series of improvements, by which
                    the waters of James river may be connected with the Great Kanawha, one of the
                    head streams of the Ohio, and a short and direct communication thus opened from
                    the Atlantic, into which the James river falls, to the Mississippi and the Gulf
                    of Mexico Companies have also been formed to improve the channels of the Roanoke
                    and its confluents in both Virginia and North Carolina. The canals in South
                    Carolina are small, and chiefly have in view to improve the navigation of the
                    different streams which water this state, namely, the Catawba, the Saluda, the
                    Wateree, and others. In North Carolina there is a canal which connects
                    North-West River with the Dismal Swamp Canal, and others for improving the
                    navigation of the Roanoke and other streams. In Georgia there is only one canal
                    which unites the waters of the Ogeechee with those of the Savannah. In the state
                    of Kentucky there is a small canal for avoiding a fall on the Ohio; and in
                    Tennessee similar improvements are projected for improving the river of that
                    name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ohio.—</hi> The canal navigation of this state is of great
                    magnitude and importance, and further improvements are in progress. The Ohio and
                    Erie Canal, completed in 1832, commences at Cleveland, at the mouth of the
                    Cuyahoga, and, passing through a number of towns in its route, joins the Ohio
                    river at Portsmouth, connecting it with Lake Eric. The main trunk is 310 miles
                    in length, and, including its branches, the total length is 334 miles. This
                    canal has been a most successful undertaking, and has in many places through
                    which it has passed quadrupled the value of private property. The Miami Canal
                    commences at Cincinnati and terminates at Dayton. An extension of this work is
                    in progress, by which it will be connected with the Wabash and Erie Canal at
                    Defiance. The expense of these two canals has been 5,500,500 dollars. The total
                    length of canals in Ohio is 409 miles. The net revenue on these two canals was,
                    for the year 1834, ending in October 31, 191,444 dollars. Other plans are in
                    contemplation for extending brandies from this canal in different directions. It
                    is proposed, by the Mahoning and Beaver Canal, to connect it by a canal
                    eighty-five miles in length with the Beaver division of the Pennsylvania Canal,
                    by which a communication would be secured to the western states with the
                    Atlantic section of the Union, and a choice would thus be afforded them of two,
                    and eventually, when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio
                    Canal are completed, of three great outlets for their produce.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Indiana.—</hi> The Wabash and Erie Canal, in this state,
                    extends from near Lafayette, on the Wabash river, up the valley of that stream,
                    across to the Maumee at Wayne, 105 miles. This work is to be carried from Wayne
                    to the east boundary of the state, where, uniting with that part of it
                    authorized by the state of Ohio, the whole distance will be 187 miles. Other
                    canals are proposed in this state, some as branches from the main trunk of other
                    canals already made, and others new.</p>
                <p>In the western states, Alabama. Mississippi, and Louisiana, there is no extent of
                    canal navigation, and those which are projected are chiefly for improving the
                    navigation of the streams tl&gt;at abound in the country.</p>
                <p>A canal across the peninsula of Florida has for some years been considered an
                    object of national importance, and would greatly facilitate the transmission of
                    the produce and merchandise constantly passing and repassing to an immense
                    amount between the seaports on the Gulf of Mexicoand the Atlantic region of the
                    United States, and at present carried by a dangerous navigation among the Bahama
                    Islands and around the southern point of Florida, where the loss of shipping has
                    been so great that it is estimated to have been nearly equal to the expense of
                    the proposed canal.</p>
                <p>The railroad is a still more striking and splendid improvement than the canal,
                    and affords even greater facilities to internal intercourse. This great
                    improvement is marvellously aided by the power of steam, by which the speed may
                    be indefinitely increased; so that the time spent in travelling hundreds of
                    miles is no longer counted, as formerly, by weeks, or even days, but by hours,
                    and the remote extremities of a kingdom appear to be brought nearer than were
                    formerly those of the same county. The enterprising spirit of the Americans has
                    eagerly laid hold of this singular improvement, which they are rapidly extending
                    in all directions. We shall endeavour to give a short notice of such as are
                    connected with the great communications of the country, omitting those which,
                    being more local, are of less importance.</p>

                    eastwardly to the boundary line of Mississippi. This plan is recommended as part

                <p>The substitution of paper-money for specie is a modern improvement of obvious
                    advantage, but liable to peculiar risks. Dr Smith very clearly explains the
                    benefits which arise from the judicious operations of banking, as well as its
                    evils when it is carried to excess.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Smith’» Wealth of Nations, vol. i. p. 510.</p></note> The
                    great security against the abuse of paper-money, is its immediate convertibility
                    into specie. It is a promise to pay on demand a certain amount of gold or
                    silver. The punctual performance of this promise is the only sure guarantee of
                    its value, which, where it is not performed, may vary to any amount, until the
                    note degenerate into a mere piece of waste paper, as was the case in France
                    during the progress of the revolution, from the inordinate issue of assignats.
                    The great profit of a bank arises from the circulation of its notes, and its
                    chief danger from the sudden return of those notes in exchange for specie. It is
                    well known that no bank has a store of specie equal to the amount of its notes
                    in circulation. The liabilities of the Bank of England have often been between
                    twenty and thirty millions, while its stock of specie did not exceed one or two
                    millions. Specie being, however, an expensive stock, a bank is tempted to carry
                    on business with the lowest possible quantity; and as the disproportion between
                    this fund and the liabilities increases, the hazard also increases of a run upon
                    the bank, and a suspension of cash payments. Against this danger the American
                    banks, though many of them conducted their business with success, and possessed
                    ample funds, were not sufficiently guarded. In a time of panic, a bank, by the
                    sudden influx of its notes, may be drained of its last guinea or dollar, as
                    happened to the Bank of England in 1797. But when a bank has ample funds, every
                    effort should be made, at whatever expense, and with the least possible delay,
                    to provide specie, and to resume cash payments. In this country, though the Bank
                    of England in 1797 might have been forced for a time to suspend its cash
                    payments, yet the continuance of the suspension after the panic, and when the
                    necessity had ceased, was a fatal error, and a most disgraceful fraud on the
                    community, which was followed by the depreciation of the currency, and by great
                    injustice and disorder. In 1805, the bank of Paris was exposed to a drain of
                    specie to be remitted for payment of the French armies when they were in
                    Germany, and was under a like necessity of suspending its cash payments; but
                    when the pressure ceased, its payments were resumed early in 1806, after the
                    conclusion of the peace of Presburg.</p>
                <p>In 1836 the number of banks in America amounted to 636, in 1838 to 663, besides
                    166 branches, and several other banks from which no returns were received in
                    reply to the application made. Including these, the whole may be estimated at
                    between 800 and 900. Their capital was either subscribed by individuals, or it
                    consisted of loans from the several states in which they were situated; and in
                    many cases the state was a shareholder or sole proprietor of the bank. Where the
                    state agreed to aid the bank with funds, or with its credit, bonds bearing
                    interest, and payable in ten, twenty, or thirty, or any greater number of years
                    that might be agreed upon, were issued to the amount of one or two millions of
                    dollars, or to any greater or less amount, for which the borrowers gave a
                    mortgage on real property to double the amount. The state bonds being disposed
                    of in the market, the bank acquired the necessary funds for carrying on its
                    business. In some cases banks have been established on the frail foundation of
                    fictitious capital. The fourth part of its capital, for example, or out of
                    160,000 dollars, only 25,000 were really subscribed. For the residue the
                    shareholders gave their bills, and pledged as a security the stock they had paid
                    in; and thus the nominal capital was 100,000 dollars, but the real capital only
                    one fourth. In one case the whole capital subscribed was next day given back
                    under the name of a loan to the subscribers. Though such fraudulent transactions
                    were not common, yet many of the banks possessed a slender foundation of
                    capital, not amounting to 100,000 dollars, and in some cases not to above 60,000
                    or 30,600 dollars, and this often made up with paper promises. In most cases,
                    however, the banks carried on a profitable business, and divided from five to
                    eight and ten per cent.</p>
                <p>No country has suffered so much from the mania for banking, or been so deluged
                    with depreciated and worthless paper money, as the United States. There were 400
                    banks in existence in 1819, many of which had no adequate foundation<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0513-0475"/> of real capital. They were generally got up by
                    knots of speculating tradesmen and lawyers, often without depositing a dollar
                    beyond what was necessary to pay for paper and engraving. Even the respectable
                    banks issued notes for a single dollar; but in the western country, where these
                    establishments were on the worst footing, notes were issued for a half, a
                    quarter, an eighth, and even a sixteenth of a dollar. An immense mass of paper
                    money was thus put into circulation by these banks, which, when it fell into
                    discredit, was followed by a degree of embarrassment and distress that had
                    almost the character of a general bankruptcy. The paper bubbles burst, one after
                    another, with extraordinary celerity, and involved multitudes in ruin. Of a
                    hundred banks in Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Indiana, there were only two
                    whose notes were received at the land-offices. In some of these states, acts
                    were passed by the legislature, suspending legal proceedings to compel payment
                    of debts. It may be imagined what an extraordinary derangement was produced in
                    the state of property, when the circulating medium was reduced in three years
                    (1815 to 1819) from 110 to forty-five millions of dollars.<note anchored="true"

                    presidency of General Washington. The charter, which was for twenty years,
                    expired in 1811; and from the fear that had in the mean time arisen, of this
                    great national bank being converted into a political engine, it was not renewed.
                    But owing to the disorder that arose at this time in the trade, and in the state
                    of the currency, the consequence partly of the war with Great Britain, it was
                    thought expedient to establish a new bank, with a charter for twenty years.
                    General Jackson was decidedly opposed to this establishment; and in 1829, in his
                    message to Congress, he expressed his opinion in the strongest terms. The senate
                    and house of representatives entirely disapproved of the president’s views, in
                    which he however persevered; and though in 1832 an act was passed for renewing
                    the charter of the bank, the president exercised his constitutional privilege of
                    rejecting the act, it not being sanctioned by two thirds of the legislative
                    bodies. In pursuance of his views, he in 1833 directed the government deposits
                    to be removed from the federal bank to certain other banks, which he selected;
                    though a committee of the house of representatives declared, on inquiry into its
                    affairs, a balance in its favour of 43,058,143 dollars.<note anchored="true"

                    carried on with increasing acrimony; and such was the distrust of the banks by
                    General Jackson and his friends, that they proposed to collect the public
                    revenue entirely in specie, to be laid up in vaults under the charge of public
                    officers. This question has created a great division in the American community,
                    and has finally decided the late contest for the great office of president
                    against Van Buren, an advocate of this system, and in favour of General
                    Harrison.</p>
                <p>But though General Jackson has carried too far his distrust of the banks, yet his
                    measures, however mistaken, could not have occasioned the great calamity which
                    soon after befell the credit and commerce of the United States. The cause was
                    more deeply seated in the general condition of commerce, arising from the great
                    extent to which credit was carried in Great Britain and in the United States,
                    and the intense spirit of speculation thence arising, under the influence of
                    which vast funds were lavished in ruinous adventures. A great increase had taken
                    place in the importations, especially from Great Britain, which had risen from
                    108 millions, the amount in 1833, to 190 millions in 1836. A large debt was thus
                    incurred to Great Britain, while vast sums, mostly in paper, to the amount, as
                    estimated, of 125,000,000 of dollars, were expended on railroads, canals, banks,
                    insurance and other companies, by which states, cities, corporations, and
                    merchants, were involved in extensive engagements: wild tracts of government
                    lands were purchased on speculation with paper to the estimated amount of about
                    forty millions of dollars. The sales of these lands had increased from five
                    millions of dollars in 1833, to twenty-five millions in 1836; extensive lots
                    were besides purchased around the different cities, towns, and villages, with
                    borrowed funds, and large sums were expended on rash improvements and on town
                    buildings.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Statements in relation to the Condition of the Slate Banks, laid before Congress
                    February 27, 1839, p. 404, Doc. No. 227. Report to the Missouri Assembly on the
                    Currency, November 20, 1838.</p></note> An immense superstructure was thus
                    reared on a slender basis. There was a fair show of outward wealth and a false
                    security, which continued until the unfortunate speculator was roused from his
                    golden dreams by the commercial storm, and by a scene of ruin which was without
                    a parallel in the history of commerce. The alarm began in Great Britain, where
                    credit had been carried to a great excess. The bank contracting its credit to
                    American houses, they in their turn called for payment of their American debts.
                    At the same time Congress passed a bill, in June 1836, ordering that the surplus
                    revenue of the United States, which had accumulated in the treasury, should,
                    after reserving five millions of dollars, be deposited, by four quarterly
                    instalments, with the several states. This sum amounted to 37,468,859 dollars.
                    It had been lent out by the banks in which it was deposited, to the merchants of
                    New York and other cities; and they being now suddenly called upon for payment,
                    insisted on prompt payment from the merchants, at the time they were called upon
                    to pay their European debts. The treasury order issued on 11th July 1836, in
                    order to check the inordinate speculations in land, ordaining all payments at
                    the land-offices to be made in specie, increased the pressure for money, and
                    combined, with all the other causes, to hasten on the crisis for which the
                    materials had been long prepared. The scarcity of money rapidly increased; those
                    who in the riot of speculation had recklessly borrowed, were now called upon to
                    pay: the golden dream had vanished, and they had no funds. A general panic now
                    spread far and wide; the banks were assailed by demands for specie; and in May
                    1837 cash payments were universally suspended throughout the United States. This
                    was follow ed by a general depreciation of the currency, which was more or less
                    in proportion to its excess or its discredit; by a varying rate of exchange in
                    consequence, for all remittances of money between the different states; by a
                    universal panic, a fall in the price of all goods, and heavy sacrifices of
                    property in order to procure funds. But these calamities, though they were
                    aggravated, were not altogether occasioned by the failure of the banks. They
                    were involved in the general ruin which arose from other causes, namely, the
                    undue extension of credit, and the excess to which speculation was carried.
                    Great commercial distress was also experienced from the same cause in Great
                    Britain, where the Bank of England and the other banks continued to pay in
                    specie.</p>
                <p>To supply the want of change, notes were issued under the value of five dollars,
                    though they had been prohibited by law; and it is mentioned in a Report on the
                    State of New York, that “it was flooded with every species of depreciated paper,
                    to the general annoyance and loss of the people at large.” The suspension of
                    cash payments is an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=514" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0514-0476"
                    />expedient to which banks too readily resort in critical times. The Bank of
                    England was extremely reluctant to part with this privilege, which it had so
                    recklessly abused, and in which abuse it was, with little regard to justice,
                    countenanced by those who then ruled the country. During the commercial pressure
                    of 1814, all the banks south of New England suspended their cash payments; and
                    they were countenanced in this proceeding by the merchants of New York and other
                    places, though not by the government or congress, where other and wiser views
                    prevailed. the merchants depending on the banks for accommodation, did not
                    insist on a strict fulfilment of their engagements, lest it should compel them
                    to contract their discounts, and to call in their debts, which would have added
                    to the general distress. It is accordingly mentioned as a proof that public
                    opinion was in favour of the banks, that in Massachusetts “suits for refusing
                    specie were instituted against thirteen only of all the banks, and those suits
                    are for trifling amounts.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    other states. " The suspension,” says the comptroller of the state of New York,
                    in his Report, “was forced upon the New York banks by several powerful classes
                    of persons, as a measure of relief,” on the supposition that as soon as the
                    banks were relieved from the obligation of redeeming their notes, they would
                    discount more freely.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“If the legal consequence of suspension,” it is observed in the same
                    document, “had been a contraction of bank issues, those who congregated in Wall
                    Street, instead of coercing the banks to suspend, would have rallied round them
                    to prevent a catastrophe so destructive to the honour and detrimental to the
                    morals of the country, and so injurious to the credit of our great commercial
                    emporium.” Document No. 227. Extract from the Report of the Comptroller of the
                    State of New York, p. 205.</p></note> The attention of the Congress and of the
                    legislatures of the different states was deeply aroused by the catastrophe which
                    had befallen the banks, and the credit and commerce of the country; and acts
                    were passed for regulating the issues, and the general management of their
                    business. Commissioners were also appointed to inquire into the general
                    condition of all the banks, to call for and examine their books or accounts; and
                    they were empowered to bring the case of any bank under the consideration of a
                    court of law, which might issue an injunction to its managers, setting aside and
                    appointing receivers to take charge of its effects. Various acts were passed
                    abolishing the issue of notes under the value of five dollars, and fixing a
                    certain proportion between the circulation and the liabilities of the different
                    banks. By an act passed in 1838, it is declared, that when any bank shall
                    transfer to the comptroller of banks, an officer appointed in each state, a
                    given amount of the public debt, he shall receive in return from the said
                    comptroller an equal amount of circulating notes, which the said comptroller is
                    required to cause to be printed and engraved, and to be countersigned, numbered,
                    and registered in proper books, kept in his office, and to be delivered to any
                    bank on the conditions above specified. According to this law, the circulating
                    notes of banks are to be furnished by the state; and for the whole amount
                    delivered, an equal amount of public stock, on which the bank receives interest,
                    must be conveyed to the comptroller, as a security to the public for the payment
                    of the notes.</p>
                <p>The commissioners appointed to inquire into the condition of the banks made their
                    reports, containing the returns of their capital, circulation, discounts,
                    specie, deposits, &amp;c.; besides just and clear views of the principles of
                    paper currency, and of the necessity of specie payments to the maintenance of
                    its value. From these reports, it appears that the American banks, with few
                    exceptions, were solvent. They had ample funds for the discharge of their debts,
                    though their stock of specie proved unequal to the ruinous drains to which they
                    were exposed during the prevailing panic. A table is subjoined, containing a
                    condensed statement of the capital, the circulation, deposits, debts due to
                    other banks, other liabilities, together with the amount of specie in the
                    different banks of the United States, on the 1st January 1889.</p>

                <p>From the above statement, the capital of the American banks in many cases appears
                    to be inconsiderable. Even this capital was not always paid up, but consisted in
                    part of the promissory notes or simple bonds of the shareholders, or for which
                    the stock primarily paid in was pledged. Laws were passed to guard against such
                    abuses, but these were evaded. Complaints were general against the banks in the
                    southern states, for entering into rash engagements to assist, with permanent
                    loans, railroads, canals, and other improvements; thus locking up the funds that
                    should have been available for other purposes.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Select Committee of the State of Ohio
                    observe: “This sudden expansion of the currency gave an unnatural impetus to the
                    ordinary business of the country, and opened the way to all the wild schemes of
                    speculation that the imagination of the most enthusiastic fortune-hunter could
                    invent. the hitherto honest, industrious, and virtuous tiller of the soil,
                    became a bold adventurer upon the broad sea of speculation; the mechanic turned
                    merchant; while the professional man, and the cautious dealer in dry goods and
                    groceries, became proptietors of cities, and the nominal owners of immense
                    tracts of wild lands." See Papers laid before Congress, Document No. 227, p.
                    617. “No state in the Union,” says the Report of the Commissioners of the State
                    of Mississippi, “is more deeply injured by an expanded currency than
                    Mississippi. the price of almost every article is nearly doubled, and in some
                    instances trebled.” In this state, the capital invested in banks bad increased
                    from 950,000 dollars, the capital of one bank, to 75,000,000 dollars in
                    1839.</p></note> Among other expedients, the issue of bank post-bills was
                    resorted to, by which debt was accumulated, and the evil day of payment was for
                    a time delayed. The Scotish banks were formerly in the practice of issuing notes
                    with what was called an optional clause, deferring payment for six months, which
                    was wisely prohibited by act of parliament. The post-notes of the bank of the
                    United States were gradually increased, as its affairs became involved, from
                    4,376,424, its amount in July 1838, to 8,994,443 dollars in November following;
                    and other banks in the United States resorted to this and to other hazardous
                    devices for raising money. It is not easy to determine the due proportion
                    between the stock of specie and the liabilities of a bank. The bullion in the
                    Bank of England has varied from one third and one fourth to one fifteenth of its
                    circulation and other liabilities; and the American banks have generally
                    retained in their coffers a proportion of bullion, amounting to a tenth, a
                    seventh, a fifteenth, but sometimes not to above a 200th part, of the
                    circulation and other liabilities. On a general average of all the American
                    banks, the stock of specie amounted, in January 1839, to about forty-three
                    millions of dollars, which was about one fourth of the circulation and other
                    liabilities.</p>
                <p>Though cash payments were generally resumed in 1838, a partial suspension again
                    occurred at the close of the year 1839. The commerce of the country had by no
                    means recovered from the recent shock; want of confidence still prevailed, and a
                    scarcity of cash; and many were deeply involved in speculations of doubtful
                    issue. The great bank of the United States in Pennsylvania, notwithstanding its
                    large capital of thirty-five millions, was engaged in vast adventures, and was
                    greatly embarrassed by the want of funds, to provide which it had been reduced
                    to various shifts; among others, to the issue of post-notes, to the amount, as
                    already stated, of above eight millions of dollars. No efforts however could any
                    longer maintain its sinking credit; and its notes being refused by the bank of
                    the United States in New York, as well as in Europe, its payments were finally
                    suspended in October 1839, when the notes fell to a discount of ten per cent. It
                    was proposed to resume cash payments in January 1841; but, according to the last
                    accounts, a new panic bad arisen in the United States, and it was doubted
                    whether this resolution would be carried into effect, and even whether the
                    assets of the bank would be found equal to its liabilities. All the southern
                    banks suspended their cash payments as soon as they heard of the suspension of
                    the Philadelphia bank; but those in New York honourably fulfilled, and still
                    have continued to fulfil, their engagements, and to pay their notes on
                    demand.</p>
                <p>The debt incurred by the United States at the close of the war with Great Britain
                    in 1783 amounted, with arrears of interest in 1794, to 76,096,468 dollars, equal
                    to L.17,121,704. It was reduced to 45,154,189 dollars in 1812. In 1815, after
                    the conclusion of the war which began with Great Britain in 1812, the debt had
                    increased to 158,713,049 dollars, and was reduced in 1820 to 91,225,560 dollars.
                    In 1835 it was entirely redeemed; and in the following year a surplus had
                    accumulated, which, with the reservations of five millions of dollars, was, in
                    conformity with an act of Congress, distributed, as already stated, among the
                    several <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=516"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0516-0478"/>states of the Union. This sum amounted to
                    37,468,859 dollars, and was to be paid in quarterly instalments. The last
                    instalment was however deferred for a time, in consequence of the commercial
                    embarrassments that occurred, and afterwards, by an act of Congress,
                    indefinitely. The prudence, forethought, and economy of the American government
                    in the management of its affairs is singularly contrasted with the reckless
                    improvidence of the mother country, whose vast debt, increasing for more than a
                    century, now swallows up for interest thirty millions a year, about two thirds
                    of the whole national revenue. The following is the state of the American
                    finances for 1837.</p>

                <p>Available balance in the treasury 1st January 1841 estimated at one million and a

                <p>The article entitled “deposits with the states” is the surplus revenue that was
                    distributed among the several states. The United States are entirely free from
                    the grievance of internal taxes, the public revenue being wholly derived from
                    the customs and the sale of public lands. The post-office merely defrays its own
                    expense.</p>
                <p>Besides the public debt of the United States, several states of the Union have
                    incurred debts for money laid out on railroads, canals, banking schemes, and
                    public institutions of every description. In 1835 these debts were estimated at
                    sixty millions of dollars; and they have since been greatly increased. Of the
                    amount raised from 1835 to 1838, about forty millions of dollars were
                    appropriated to the establishment of banks, and about sixty-eight millions to
                    works of internal improvement. In many cases the funds have been judiciously
                    laid out, and will make a suitable return;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Trotter’s Observation· on the Financial Position and

                    other cases they will not yield a revenue sufficient for the repairs of the
                    canals or railroads on which they have been expended, and for the payment of
                    interest. When there are no adequate auxiliary funds, taxation must be resorted
                    to for upholding the credit of the state. The Pennsylvania legislature has
                    already agreed to the imposition of taxes, if no adequate funds accrue from
                    other sources; and it is not doubted that all the other states will follow this
                    example, and join in upholding the credit of the state bonds, which now form an
                    article of traffic in the money markets of Europe. The following table, taken
                    from the American Almanac for 1840, contains an account of the total amount of
                    stock issued and authorized to be issued by each of the eighteen states where
                    this mode of raising money has been resorted to. It is partly founded on the
                    Annual Report for 1839, of the comptroller appointed under the general banking
                    law passed in 1838, to inquire into the amount of the public debt in all the
                    states, which was stated in that Report at 123,703,750 dollars, and partly on
                    information derived from the state laws, which have been carefully examined,
                    though it is probable that the aggregate amount of stock authorized by all the
                    states is even greater than the amount stated in the table.</p>

                    imbued from the highest to the lowest rank with the spirit of freedom, and in
                    all respects a most unfit instrument of tyrants. In Great Britain, the old
                    constitutional jealousy of a standing army has been long exploded; and there is
                    even less reason for jealousy on this subject in the democratical states of
                    America; besides, that regular troops can be effectually opposed only by regular
                    troops; and, in the present condition of the world, the state which denudes
                    itself of efficient defensive weapons may be said to court disaster and
                    disgrace. To supply the want of a small number of regular troops by masses of
                    raw militia six times as numerous, who leave their homes under great personal
                    and pecuniary sacrifices, is not economy, but the reverse; to say nothing of the
                    certain defeat and disgrace to which such a force is subjected in its conflicts
                    with a veteran enemy, and the humiliations which these produce to national
                    feeling. After the close of the late war, the Congress, by act of 3d March 1815,
                    fixed the strength of the regular army at 9980 men; but it was afterwards
                    reduced, and its actual strength, as reported to Congress in March 1822,

                <p>The army is distributed at about fifty posts and places along the sea-coast and
                    inland frontier. The pay of a colonel of infantry is seventy-five dollars (L.16.
                    10s.) per month, and six rations a day; of a captain, forty dollars and three
                    rations; of a first lieutenant, thirty dollars and three rations; of a sergeant,
                    eight dollars and one ration; of a private, five dollars and one ration. The
                    Americans have a well-conducted military academy at West Point, on the Hudson,
                    where 230 cadets, between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one, are instructed in
                    the branches of knowledge necessary to form engineers. The period of service is
                    five years, and the expense for each pupil is about 500 dollars per annum. But
                    the chief military force of the United States is the militia, consisting
                    properly of all the males between eighteen and forty-five, but always less or
                    more deficient. A return made to Congress in February 1839 makes the number
                    amount to 1,350,805. When called out to the field they have the same allowances
                    as the regular army, and their period of service is limited to six months.</p>
                <p>The American militia are under the charge of the state governments. They
                    generally if not universally elect their own officers, and are said to be very

                <p>The expense of the naval service in 1837 was 6,854,059 dollars; and in the first
                    three quarters of the year 1838 it was 4,325,563 dollars.</p>
                <p>The navy is managed by a board of three commissioners and a secretary. A small
                    tax of twenty cents per month is paid by all officers and seamen, both in the
                    navy and merchant service, for the relief of sick and disabled mariners, part of
                    whom are lodged in hospitals.</p>
                <p>The great distinction of the American government is, that the first magistrate is
                    chosen by the people, solely on account of his fitness for the office. In an
                    hereditary monarchy, the same office descends from father to son, without regard
                    to fitness. He who is in the line of succession obtains the throne, though he
                    may be a minor or an infant, or however otherwise unfit for its great duties.
                    This distinction of birth has been adopted in all the modern kingdoms of Europe,
                    as the best security against rival claims, and the danger of a disputed
                    succession. The illustrious historian of Romeobserves, that of “all the various
                    forms of government which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy
                    seems to present the fairest scope for ridicule a nation being handed down like
                    a drove of cattle to an infant son, and the “bravest warriors and wisest
                    statesmen” approaching the royal cradle with bended knees and protestations of
                    inviolable fidelity. Still, however, he adds, that though “satire and
                    declamation may paint these obvious topics in the most dazzling colours, our
                    serious thoughts will respect a useful prejudice, which establishes a rule of
                    succession independent of the passions of mankind....In the cool shade of
                    retirement,” he continues, “we may easily devise imaginary forms of government,
                    in which the sceptre shall be constantly bestowed on the most worthy, by the
                    free and incorrupt suffrage of the whole community. Experience overturns these
                    airy fabrics, and teaches us that, in a large society, the election of a monarch
                    can never devolve to the wisest or to the most numerous part of the
                    people."<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gibbon’s
                    Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, chap. vii.</p></note> The truth of these
                    eloquent observations, and their agreement with all previous experience, could
                    not have been questioned at the time the historian wrote. The ancient
                    democracies of Greece and Rome presented one continued scene of violence and
                    disorder; they were bold but rude sketches of civil freedom, and they shine as
                    meteors in the page of history; but the proper materials were wanting for the
                    nice machinery of a popular government. The people were fierce and ignorant;
                    they would not submit to the curb of the law; and those rude constitutions,
                    loosely held together, perished amid the popular conflicts to which they gave
                    rise. During the elective monarchy of Rome which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=519" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0519-0481"
                    />succeeded, how often was the crown the prize of successful violence. Nor can
                    the remark of the Roman historian, that “to the firm establishment of this idea
                    (namely, the hereditary principle), we owe the peaceful succession and mild
                    administration of European monarchies,” well be questioned, in the face of our
                    own experience twice during the last century, of a disputed succession to the
                    crown, and two civil wars in Great Britain.</p>
                <p>Popular election, however, if it lead to faction and disorder, never fails to
                    insure an able government, as the hereditary principle is as certainly a source
                    of weakness. When the people have a free choice, they will always prefer merit
                    to demerit; capacity for service becomes in this manner a passport to honour and
                    distinction, and ability is secured for the business of the state. The great men
                    who ruled in Greece and Rome almost invariably justified the choice of the
                    people; their genius shone alike in war and policy, and the conquest of the
                    world attested the wisdom of their councils. Still, if the elective principle,
                    an ever-living source though it be of energy, give rise to violence and
                    disorder, it must be sacrificed to peace, the greatest of all blessings. We
                    cannot make use of an agency, however powerful, which we cannot control. But in
                    America they had no choice; they could not possibly have established a
                    hereditary government, and hence they were driven upon the critical experiment
                    of a republic. That experiment however has succeeded. The great political
                    principle of popular election has been found to be compatible with all the great
                    ends of government; and the election of a supreme ruler takes place every four
                    years, without the least disturbance. The system therefore no longer answers to
                    the description of the Roman historian; it is not an imaginary form of
                    government, an airy fabric which experience overthrows; it has been sanctioned
                    by experience, and has been found to combine liberty and every civil right with
                    good order and peace, while it admits no principle that can impair the native
                    vigour of a pure democracy.</p>
                <p>The legislative power is vested in a Congress, consisting of a Senate and a House
                    of Representatives. The senate is composed of two members from each state,
                    chosen for six years, by the respective state legislatures, and the seats of one
                    third are vacated every two years. A senator must be thirty years of age, an
                    inhabitant of the state for which he is chosen, and he must have been a citizen
                    of the United States for nine years. The members of the House of Representatives
                    are chosen every second year, by the people, in the proportion of one for every
                    40,000 inhabitants, excluding the Indians, and two fifths of the people of
                    colour. The electors being the same as for the most numerous branch of the state
                    legislature, the right of suffrage may be described as universal. A
                    representative must be an inhabitant of the state for which he is chosen,
                    twenty-five years of age, and he must have been seven years a citizen of the
                    United States. No law can be passed without the concurrence of both houses. When
                    that is obtained, it is presented to the president, who, if he approves, signs
                    it; if not, he returns it, with his objections, for the reconsideration of
                    Congress, and it cannot in that case become a law without the concurrence of two
                    thirds of the members. The executive power is vested in a President, who is
                    elected for four years, by a number of electors chosen for the purpose by the
                    people, distinct from the senators and representatives whom each state sends to
                    Congress, but equal to them in number. The president must be a native citizen of
                    the United States, and not under thirty-five years of age. His salary is 25,000
                    dollars (L.5500) per annum.</p>
                <p>The Congress has power to impose taxes and duties to pay the debts and provide
                    for the defence of the republic; to borrow money; to regulate commerce; to
                    establish uniform laws of bankruptcy and naturalization; to coin money, and fix
                    the standard of weights and measures; to establish post-offices; to constitute
                    tribunals; to declare war, raise and support an army and navy; to call out the
                    militia, and to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining it. The
                    president is commander-in-chief of the army, navy, and the militia, when in
                    active service. By and with the advice of the senate (two thirds concurring), he
                    makes treaties, and nominates ambassadors, ministers, consuls, and judges.</p>
                <p>The federal judiciary consists of the Supreme Court (formed of a chief judge and
                    six associate judges), which sits at Washington, and a District Court in each
                    state, in which one judge sits. The chief justice has 4000 dollars a year, an
                    associate judge 3500, and a district judge from 800 to 2000. The supreme court,
                    deriving its authority from the constitution, is not bound by the proceedings of
                    the legislature farther than they are consistent with that charter. It has,
                    accordingly, set aside several acts of the state legislatures, and even of
                    Congress itself, on the ground that they contravened an express provision of the
                    constitution, by annulling or impairing the validity of contracts. The laws of
                    the United States are substantially the same with the laws of England, but
                    differently modified in each state by causes springing out of the physical,
                    moral, and political situation of the people.</p>
                <p>There is no national church in the United States; each congregation pays its own
                    minister, and each sect regulates its own concerns. Notwithstanding this,
                    wherever the population is dense, the means of religious instruction are as
                    ample as in any country in Europe. It is computed that there are above 8000
                    churches, or religious societies, of which about 3000 belong to the Baptists,
                    2000 to the Methodists, 1200 to the Congregationalists, 900 to the
                    Presbyterians, 600 to the Episcopalians, and a small number to the Catholics,
                    Dutch Lutherans, Universalists, and other sects.</p>
