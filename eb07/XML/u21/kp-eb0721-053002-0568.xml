                <p><label type="entry">UNTERWALDEN</label>, one of the cantons of Switzerland, and
                    one of the most ancient of the confederacy, having been established as an
                    independent state in the year 1308. It is bounded on the north by Lucerne and
                    the lake Lucerne, on the east by Uri, on the south by Berne, and on the west by
                    Lucerne. The extent of it is 198 geographical square miles. It is divided into
                    two parts, called <hi rend="italic">Obwalden</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nidwalden,</hi> or the upper and lower forest. The capital of the former is
                    Samen, with 2000 inhabitants. The capital of the latter is Stanz, with a
                    population of 2000. These two divisions form separate states, having similar
                    democratic constitutions, but distinct administrations; and they alternately
                    send deputies to the general assembly of the confederation.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of both are of German origin, and speak a patois of that
                    language. They are a simple pastoral people, attached to their ancient customs,
                    and bigoted to their faith, which is that of the Romish church, under the
                    episcopal jurisdiction of the bishop of Constance. There are thirteen parish
                    churches, and five churches in the same number of monasteries. In 1838 the
                    population amounted to 22,571.</p>
                <p>The sovereignty is in the whole of the males above twenty years of age, who
                    assemble on the last Sunday in April, when the government is appointed, and the
                    laws which are proposed by the executive power are agreed to or rejected. Each
                    man is taught the use of arms, and is enrolled as a soldier in the militia. The
                    tax paid to the general confederacy is 1910 francs, and the contingent of men is
                    383. The chief, called the landammann, is chosen yearly; and the members of the
                    council also resign their offices each year, but are almost always re-chosen.
                    This description of the government applies to both the states which form the
                    canton, though there are some trifling variations between the two divisions.</p>
                <p>On the borders of the canton are some of the lofty elevations of the Alps, the
                    most remarkable of which is the Titlis, whose snowy peak is 10,700 feet. Next to
                    it are the Wellenstock and the Jockberge, 1000 feet lower; and several of
                    inferior height, as the Geisburg and Bruning on the boundary of Berne; the
                    Nesselstock and the Pilatus on the frontier of Lucerne; and the Engelberg, the
                    Rothstock, and the Brozen on the borders of Uri. The interior has only lower
                    Alps, ranging from 3000 to 5500 feet in height. There are few rivers of much
                    consequence. The most considerable is the Welch, issuing from the lake of
                    Sarnen, and, after uniting with the Aa, losing itself in the lake of the Four
                    Cantons. The chief productions are potatoes and hemp, with some corn in the
                    valleys, but scarcely sufficient for the consumption. On the side of the Alps,
                    and at a great height, in the summer, there is good pasture, and many cows are
                    bred, and their milk made into cheese. The forests yield much timber. The only
                    trade is the export of butter, cheese, hides, chestnuts, and wood, with which
                    are purchased iron, spirits, and the few foreign articles that are used. There
                    are not any manufactures; and besides keeping the flocks and herds, and cutting
                    the wood, there is no occupation except that of fishing on the lakes. There are
                    several mineral springs; one impregnated with sulphur, at Schwendel, is much
                    frequented. The climate is severe, very hot in the short summer, and dreadfully
                    cold in winter. Fruit trees cease to bear above the elevation of 4000 feet; but
                    chestnuts, which are abundant, are to be found higher than that level.</p>
