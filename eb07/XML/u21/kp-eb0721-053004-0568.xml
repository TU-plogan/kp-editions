                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">UPSALA</label>, one of the provinces of the kingdom of
                    Sweden. It has been formed out of the western part of the ancient province of
                    Upland. It extends in north latitude from 59° 24' to 60° 39', and in east
                    longitude from 16° 36' to 18° 17'. It comprehends 2112 square miles, with two
                    cities, one market-town, and 8546 villages and hamlets. The population is
                    80,926. It is rather an undulating than a level district, with small groups of
                    hills connected together, which in the north may be almost described as
                    mountains. It extends along the Gulf of Bothnia, but has no good harbours; but
                    the lake of Malaren, which forms its southern boundary, and is connected with
                    the sea at Stockholm, provides a good egress for the productions. This lake is
                    connected with a chain of others, which, by means of canals, forms a
                    communication between the two seas that bound the eastern and western sides of
                    the kingdom towards the south.</p>
                <p>The soil of the southern part of the province is a rich black loam, highly
                    fertile; but in the north, beyond the 60th degree of latitude, it is much less
                    productive. The chief corn is rye, and in the north barley, with some oats; but
                    the whole province usually yields sufficient grain for its consumption. The
                    inhabitants of the northern part subsist almost wholly on oaten bread. It is not
                    favourable to the growth of fruit, except that some cherries are seen, and in
                    most parts abundance of wortle-berries.</p>
                <p>In the north there are extensive woods, mostly of pines and firs, with some
                    beeches. The cattle are generally small, but of late the wool of the sheep has
                    been improved by the introduction of Saxon rams. The fisheries, both on the sea
                    and the lakes, afford a supply of food, and give employment to many persons; but
                    the chief occupation arises from the extensive mines of iron that are worked.
                    The most considerable of them, that of Dannemora, is a prodigious work, and
                    furnishes to commerce the best bar-iron, and converts a part into various
                    articles for domestic use.</p>
                <p>The capital of the province is the city of the same name, standing on the river
                    Fyrisac, which divides it into two parts. Upsala is one of the most beautiful
                    old-fashioned cities in Europe. It has a castle or palace, the residence of the
                    governor; a cathedra], in which many of the kings have been interred, and in
                    which there is a fine monument to the memory of the celebrated Linnaeus. It is
                    the seat of an archbishop, and likewise of the chief university of the kingdom.
                    This institution, founded in 1478, has a good library of 50,000 volumes, a fine
                    botanic garden, an astronomical observatory, and the several other aids to study
                    usually found in universities. The average number of students is 800. The trade
                    of this place is inconsiderable, the manufactures being limited to making snuff
                    and tobacco, and weaving coarse linens. The inhabitants amount to 15,000, who
                    mostly depend on the university for employment and the means of subsistence. In
                    the neighbourhood are many remains of Gothic antiquity. Long. 27. 31. 40. E.
