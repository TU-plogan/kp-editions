                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> subject of this article may be conveniently divided
                    into two parts; the first embracing Universities, and the second Schools. In
                    treating of the former, it has been deemed the most satisfactory method to
                    present a view of some of the oldest and most celebrated of the continental
                    universities, and to subjoin a short account of the origin, progress, and
                    present condition of those of Great Britain and Ireland. An opportunity will
                    thus be afforded of viewing the higher education in its infancy, of observing
                    the improvements which have at various times been introduced, and of forming an
                    estimate of it after it has been in operation for nearly seven centuries. The
                    space to which we are necessarily restricted prevents us from doing more than
                    stating the principal facts: the subject, if treated in detail, would extend
                    much beyond the limits within which it must be comprised in a work like
                    this.</p>
                <p>PART I.—UNIVERSITIES.</p>
                <p>University (<hi rend="italic">Universitas)</hi> has been defined “a universal
                    school, in which are taught all branches of learning, or the four faculties of
                    Theology, Law, Medicine, and the Arts, and in which degrees are conferred in
                    these faculties.” This we believe to be the meaning most commonly attached to
                    the word university; and as it is palpably incorrect, it will be necessary for
                    us to endeavour to point out its true signification. Like many other terms of
                    extensive application, it has undergone various modifications of meaning, till
                    its origin and primary use seem to have been utterly forgotten. By the nations
                    of modern Europe, it has been applied to the highest seminaries of learning in
                    their respective countries, whether these embraced “the whole circle of the
                    sciences,” or were limited to one or two faculties; and we accordingly find that
                    the idea attached to the word varies in extent and comprehensiveness with the
                    institution to which it is applied. Those who have formed their notion of the
                    word merely from the English universities, commonly suppose that a university
                    “necessarily means a collection and union of colleges; that it is a great
                    corporation, embodying in one the smaller and subordinate collegiate bodies."
                    The author of “A Reply to the Calumnies of the Edinburgh Review,”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Commonly ascribed to Dr
                    Copleston, late provost of Oriel College, Oxford, and now bishop of Llandaff.
                    Oxford, 1810, 8vo.</p></note> asserts that “the university of Oxford is not a
                    national foundation. It is a congeries of foundations, originating, some in
                    royal munificence, but more in private piety and bounty. They are moulded,
                    indeed, into one corporation; but each one of our twenty colleges is a
                    corporation by itself.” The inaccuracy of this opinion will appear from our
                    account of that distinguished seminary. It is indeed sufficiently refuted by the
                    fact, that many universities exist in which there are no colleges. This is the
                    case with most of the German universities;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    rend="superscript"> s</hi> and in the Scotish universities there are no
                    foundations which bear any resemblance to the English colleges. Edinburgh,
                    though called a college, is merely a university, and has nothing in common with
                    the English meaning of the term college; and the colleges at St Andrews,
                    Glasgow, and Aberdeen, are corporations chiefly endowed for the principals and
                    professors, and not for the students. Trinity College, Dublin, is a college with
                    the privileges of a university, possessing however a munificent endowment for
                    the provost, fellows, and scholars. It is important, besides, to bear in mind,
                    that the universities of Oxford and Cambridge existed before a single college
                    was endowed; and that the universities would continue to exist, with all their
                    rights and privileges unimpaired, even if the property of all the colleges were
                    confiscated, and their buildings levelled with the ground.<note anchored="true"

                    faculty of medicine; and even Bologna was celebrated for 200 years as a school
                    of law, before it contained any provision for lectures in theology. The teaching
                    of the civil law was prohibited in Paris from 1220 till 1679; and other
                    remarkable instances might easily be adduced, in which the study of particular
                    faculties was forbidden in particular universities. It is true that most of the
                    modern universities <hi rend="italic">embrace</hi> the “whole circle of
                    learning,” as contained in the four faculties of the arts, theology, law, and
                    physic; but this was not the case in the twelfth century, when the term <hi
                    rend="italic">universities</hi> was first applied to academical
                    institutions.</p>

                    the whole members of an incorporated body of persons, teaching and learning one
                    or more departments of knowledge. The word <hi rend="italic">universitas,</hi>
                    in the technical language of the civil law, was used to signify a plurality of
                    persons associated for a continued purpose, and may be inadequately rendered by
                    <hi rend="italic">society, company, corporation.</hi> In the language of the
                    middle ages, it was applied either loosely to any understood class of persons,

                <p>The period when universities were first established, cannot be precisely
                    ascertained. Previously to the age of Charlemagne, Europe had sunk into the
                    grossest barbarism, in consequence of the migrations of the northern and eastern
                    tribes, and the devastating wars which followed in their train. This monarch
                    merits the praise of having zealously endeavoured to promote the cultivation of
                    literature and science throughout his vast empire. At his accession, we are
                    assured that no means of education existed in his dominions; and in order to
                    restore in some degree the spirit of letters, he was compelled to invite
                    strangers from countries where learning was not so thoroughly extinguished.<note

                    these, he established schools in different cities of his empire; and all the
                    power and influence of the court were employed in forwarding his patriotic
                    endeavours to diffuse some portion of education among his subjects.</p>
                <p>By an imperial enactment, it was ordained that the bishops should erect schools
                    contiguous to their churches, while the monks were enjoined to establish them in

                    the monks and canons of the tenth century, was never altogether destroyed: the
                    cathedral and monastic schools afforded the means of education, such as it was,
                    to the young men who were destined for the church; and during the two succeeding
                    centuries, “what learning there was, and what scientific men there were, were
                    contained in, and proceeded from their walls.”<note anchored="true"

                    had been so long obscured, began to shine more brightly; teachers, whose genius
                    and erudition enabled them to overstep the narrow circle to which they had
                    themselves been restricted, arose in various places; and wherever an Anselm or
                    an Abelard opened his school, his lectures were attended by crowds of admiring
                    listeners.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hallam’s Mid.

                    teacher invited others to the same field of labour, and the large numbers of
                    scholars who frequented the auditory of an admired expounder of some new or
                    favourite question of scholastic logic or divinity, afforded ample room for the
                    exertion of their talents and ingenuity. It was in this manner that particular
                    schools obtained a permanent celebrity, and that those associations of teachers
                    were formed, which were afterwards recognised by the civil and ecclesiastical
                    power, and dignified with the name of Universities.</p>
                <p>“The oldest universities of Europe,” says Mr Malden,<note anchored="true"

                    “sprung up in the twelfth century, and were formed by the zeal and enterprise of
                    learned men, who undertook to deliver public instruction to all who were
                    desirous of hearing them. The first teachers soon found assistants and rivals:
                    students resorted in great numbers to the sources of knowledge thus opened to
                    them; and from this voluntary concourse of teachers and learners, the schools
                    arose, which were afterwards recognised as public bodies, and entitled
                    universities,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Quas sola

                    as models for those which, in later times, were founded and established by
                    public authority. Some of the oldest universities had traditions of their
                    foundation at a more remote period by royal or imperial authority, and these
                    traditions might be nominally true; but as far as their real life, and power,
                    and distinctive character are concerned, their origin was in fact spontaneous,
                    and is to be ascribed to the general excitement which pervaded Europe in the
                    twelfth century.”</p>
                <p>The oldest of the European universities were those of Paris and Bologna; the
                    former for several centuries so celebrated as a school of theology as to be
                    designated the “first school of the church,” and the latter equally famous for

                    Europe were established, it will be necessary for us to give a somewhat detailed
                    account. Omitting altogether the question of priority, we shall begin with the
                    university of Paris, because we believe its claim to precedence on the ground of
                    antiquity to be equally well founded with that of its rival, and because its
                    form and constitution were in a great measure adopted by the founders of the two
                    great English universities.</p>

                    by all recent writers who have examined the subject. Among the schools which the
                    great emperor of the west established, it is doubtful whether we can reckon that
                    of Paris; and though there are some traces of public instruction in that city
                    about the end of the ninth century, it is not certain that we can assume it to
                    be more ancient. For two hundred years more, it can only be said that some
                    persons appear to have come to Paris for the purposes of study;<note

                    according to Mr Hallam, “it would be hard to prove an unbroken continuity, or at
                    least a dependence and connexion of its professors.” From the beginning of the
                    twelfth century, Paris became the resort of learned men, who attached themselves
                    in some degree to the existing schools, and infused new life into them by
                    delivering public lectures on scholastic theology. One of these was William of
                    Champeaux, who opened a school of logic in 1109, which is remarkable as the era
                    from which alone the university can deduce the regular succession of its

                    regular form of self-government before the year 1169. In this year Henry II. of
                    England offered to refer the adjustment of his dispute with Becket to the peers

                    practice, which had been introduced by the chancellor, of exacting fees for
                    licenses to teach; and the second, of nearly the same date, relieving Peter

                    its continued existence, when theology had become its leading study and its

                    under the severest penalties, from molesting the students; and in the few cases
                    in which the magistrates of the city were allowed to interfere, they were
                    obliged to deliver over the culprit to his academical superiors. The person of
                    the rector of the schools was declared to be sacred; and the provost of the
                    city, immediately after his instalment, was required to wait on the masters and
                    scholars in full assembly, and in their presence solemnly swear that he would
                    carefully observe and fulfil the designs of the ordinance. This ceremony
                    continued to be observed till 1592. The example of Philip was followed by the
                    kings of France during the two succeeding centuries, by whom the privileges and
                    immunities of the university were still further increased. By various regal
                    enactments, the masters and scholars were exempted from all taxes imposed to

                <p>The university of Paris, being thus recognised by the pope, and encouraged by the
                    fostering care of the kings of France, soon became the most distinguished
                    seminary of learning in Europe, and students resorted to it with an eagerness
                    for instruction which may well astonish those who reflect how little of what we
                    now deem useful could be imparted. A more systematic course of study was
                    introduced; theology and the arts ceased to be the only objects of interest;
                    medicine began to assume the form of a science; and the canon law, under the
                    special patronage of the church, took its place as a new branch of
                    jurisprudence. The study of the civil law was introduced in the twelfth century,
                    soon after its revival at Bologna, but was prohibited by Pope Honorius in 1220;
                    a prohibition which Innocent IV. endeavoured to extend to the whole of France,

                    advert. The popes were too quick-sighted, and too much alive to their own
                    interests, nut to perceive that the authority delegated to the civil magistrate
                    by the civil law militated against their own absolute ecclesiastical
                    claims.</p></note> The number of students in the twelfth century nearly equalled

                <p>Having thus traced the university of Paris from its origin to its full
                    establishment, we shall now give a short analysis of its constitution in the
                    thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The most ancient part of the university was
                    the faculty<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The <hi
                    rend="italic">term faculty,</hi> in all the older universities, denoted the body
                    of teachers or graduates, who, besides the privilege of lecturing on a certain
                    department of knowledge, of examining and admitting candidates for degrees into
                    their body, had also the right of making statutes choosing officers, employing a
                    seal, and performing all the offices of a privileged corporation. In the French

                    The faculty was divided into four nations: 1. the French nation, including the
                    French. Italians, Spaniards, Greeks, &amp;c.; 2. the nation of Picardy, which
                    included the students from the north-east of France, and also the Netherlands;
                    3. the nation of Normandy, comprehending those from the west; 4. the English
                    nation (after 1430, called the German nation), which, besides the students from

                    these nations were enrolled the professors and students from the respective
                    districts, without any distinction arising from the departments of learning to

                    and managed exclusively its own affairs. At the head of each was a procurator,

                    duly observed. The four procurators, with the rector, originally constituted the
                    ordinary council of the university, in which its general government and
                    legislation were vested. Their power extended even to the infliction of corporal
                    punishment, some examples of which are mentioned as early as 1200, and in the

                    themselves. The deans formed the ordinary council of the procurator, and their

                <p>In all the old universities, the chancellor was the fountain of honour, the
                    officer by whose authority degrees were conferred; and this dignity brought
                    along with it considerable power. Each bishop appointed a chancellor within his
                    own diocese, whose office it was to preside in the bishop’s court, and generally
                    to maintain and exercise justice within the episcopal territory. After the full
                    establishment of monasteries, the abbots claimed the same power, and created
                    chancellors with similar authority. It belonged to the bishop and his chancellor
                    to grant licenses to teach within his own diocese; and the same power was
                    claimed and exercised by the abbot and his chancellor within the territory of
                    the abbey.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The power
                    thus vested in the beads of ecclesiastical establishments to which schools were
                    attached, was sometimes used, through personal motives, for the exclusion of fit
                    and able teachers, as well as for the purpose of extorting a high price for
                    license to teach. In the pontificate of Alexander III. <hi rend="smallcaps">a.
                    d</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> .</hi> 1179, a Lateran council enacted,” that
                    every competent person ought to be admitted to teach;” and in the following
                    year, the pope himself issued a decree, containing the following clause :” Ut
                    quicunque viri idonei et literati voluerint regere “ludia literarum, sine
                    molestia et exactione qualibet scholas regere permittantur.” Conringius,
                    Dissert, iv. sect. 24.</p></note> When the university was placed in an episcopal
                    city, the bishop of the diocese was very often the chancellor; and if not the
                    bishop, some other ecclesiastical dignitary. The university of Paris being
                    situate partly within the diocese of Paris, and partly within the abbey lands of
                    St Geneviève, the power of granting license to students and masters was claimed
                    by both. These chancellors were appointed, the one by his bishop, and the other
                    by his abbot: the right of the latter extended to granting degrees in the arts
                    only; that of the former to degrees in theology, law, and medicine. The
                    chancellor of the church of St Geneviève was always the chancellor of the
                    faculty of arts, though the bishop of Paris was the chancellor of the other
                    three faculties, and was considered as the chancellor of the university at
                    large. They chose their own deputies or vice-chancellors, appointed annual
                    examiners of candidates for degrees, but had no power to interfere in the
                    internal government of the university.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The rector appears to have been originally chosen by the four nations voting
                    collectively; but the number of students belonging to the French nation gave it
                    so decided a superiority, that the other three became dissatisfied, and at last
                    revolting, elected another rector. To put an end to this difference, which
                    threatened the prosperity of the university, and to restore unity and peace,
                    delegates were appointed, by whose mediation it was agreed, and confirmed by the

                    room. He presided in the general meetings of the university, took charge of the

                    university. At the head of each faculty was a dean, chosen in the same manner as
                    the procurators of the nations, who presided in its meetings, and represented
                    the body. From this period, therefore, the school of Paris, which had hitherto
                    consisted of four bodies, was composed of seven, namely, of four nations and
                    three faculties, represented respectively in the general council by four
                    procurators and three deans. To the three new faculties belonged doctors only.

                    in the four nations of the faculty of arts. The general government of the
                    university was vested in the council of seven, with the rector as president. The

                    the regents were sometimes held for literary business, for framing statutes
                    respecting discipline, privileges, and order. The meetings of faculties took
                    cognizance each of its own members, in matters chiefly of a literary nature<note

                    nation and faculty had its own clerk and assessor. There were also two classes

                <p>The great concourse of students to the early universities, rendered it difficult
                    for them to obtain lodgings, and gave rise to exorbitant demands on the part of
                    the townsmen in whose houses they were forced to reside. To remedy this
                    inconvenience, various expedients were adopted, but with inadequate etfect.
                    Frederick II. when he founded the university of Naples, fixed a <hi

                    let according to a joint valuation of two citizens and two scholars. A similar
                    regulation was. adopted at Bologna, and established about 1237, by Gregory IX.
                    in the university of Paris.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    burgesses elected with the consent of the masters. It was also provided that,
                    when lodgings had once been hired, the student should not be disturbed in the
                    possession of them so long as he paid his rent, and conducted himself properly.
                    Notwithstanding these regulations, the hardships to which the poorer students
                    were exposed induced charitable individuals to provide houses, in which a
                    certain number of indigent scholars might be accommodated with free lodgings
                    during the progress of their studies. The example was first set by the religious
                    orders, who established in several pf the university towns <hi rend="italic"
                    >hostels (hospitia)</hi> for those of their members who resorted thither, either
                    as teachers or learners. Free board was soon added to free lodging, and in many
                    cases small exhibitions or stipends to defray the necessary expenses of the
                    scholars. For the sake of discipline, these foundations were placed under the
                    superintendence of one or more graduates, who assisted and instructed their
                    pupils, but only in subservience to the public lectures and exercises of the
                    university. Such establishments were called <hi rend="italic">inns, hostels,

                    restricted to foundations which provided for the support of several graduates.
                    These institutions, at first established on a small scale, led to the foundation
                    of the colleges, which afterwards formed one of the most important and essential

                    of Paris stood on a footing very different from the colleges of the English
                    universities. They soon became appropriated to particular faculties, or to
                    particular departments of a faculty; sometimes, but rarely, they included more
                    than one faculty. Thus the theological faculty was collected at an early period
                    in the college of the Sorbonne; and all its lectures and public disputations
                    took place there, with the exception of two courses delivered in the college of
                    Navarre. Regent masters were nominated by the faculties as lecturers in the
                    colleges. These lecturers remained subject to their several faculties, and were
                    liable to be controlled or removed by them. Consequently, attendance on their
                    courses was considered as equivalent to attendance on the public courses
                    delivered in the schools of the university. The colleges speedily began to admit
                    within their walls scholars who were not supported by their foundations; and the
                    college lectures were ultimately thrown open to the members of other colleges,
                    and to those scholars of the university who belonged to no college at all. This
                    took place in the course of the fifteenth century. The lectures in the public
                    schools were thus almost entirely superseded, at least in the faculties of
                    theology and arts; and the colleges became the instruments of the public
                    instruction of the university. During the latter half of the fifteenth century,
                    the great colleges of the faculty of arts, or, as they were called, the colleges
                    'de plein exercice,' amounted to eighteen; although by the middle of the
                    seventeenth ceu-tury<pb break="no"

                    they had fallen to ten. There were about eighty smaller colleges, of which more
                    than half still survived in the eighteenth century, which provided their
                    scholars with lodging and board, and sometimes with email stipends, but taught
                    them only the elements of philology, sending them for all higher learning to the
                    lecturers of the great colleges. The college of Navarre alone appears to have
                    confined its instruction to its own scholars. In this age of the university it
                    became usual for all the scholars to belong to some college. Those students of
                    the university who were not attached to any college, were known by the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">martinets.</hi> As they were less amenable to discipline than
                    the students of the colleges, the legislation of the university was directed
                    against them; and nt length it was made imperative on all scholars of the
                    faculty of arts to be members of some college. The rule was not enforced on
                    students of the higher faculties.”</p>
                <p>The origin of academical degrees, like many other points connected with the early
                    history of universities, is involved in obscurity. According to Du Boulay,
                    degrees were conferred, after a regular examination. from the very foundation of
                    the university; while others assert that they were first introduced by Irnerius
                    into the university of Bologna about the year 1150, and thence transferred to
                    the Parisian school.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    distinctions existed at a very early period is unquestionable, but there is not
                    sufficient evidence to justify us in believing that they were coeval with the
                    earliest universities. The old ’ est degrees were those in arts. The term <hi

                    ><p>The inferior degree of <hi rend="italic">bachelors</hi> is said to have been
                    first instituted by Gregory IX., whose pontificate continued from 1227 to 1241.
                    They probably derived their name from <hi rend="italic">bacilla</hi> (little
                    staves), either because they were admitted by receiving a little wand, or
                    because they adopted the titles of the novices of the soldiery, who exercised
                    with sticks, in order to learn to fight with arms. The word <hi rend="italic"
                    >bachelor</hi> is commonly derived from <hi rend="italic">bas chevalier,</hi>
                    the humblest specie·» of knight, in opposition to the knight banneret; but for
                    this expression no authority has been produced. <hi rend="italic">Bachelor</hi>
                    is a very old word, and is used in early French poetry for a young man, as <hi

                    degree in each faculty, which term is said to have been peculiar to the feudal
                    or military law of France, seems to warrant the inference that the whole system
                    of academical honours has been borrowed from the university of Paris. The terms
                    master, doctor, were originally synonymous, and were designations given in their
                    common meaning to persons engaged in teaching, and not titles conferred by
                    authority after a prescribed course of study or a formal examination. In process
                    of time the name master was restricted to teachers of the liberal arts, and the
                    title of doctor was assumed by the teachers of theology, law, and medicine. The
                    term professor, though less frequent in early times, had originally the same
                    signification, and denoted a person who professed to teach a particular subject.
                    In the English universities the Latin designation of a doctor of divinity still
                    is “sanctae theologiae professor.” Professor is now, in academical language,
                    applied to a salaried graduate, either actually employed in teaching, or at
                    least whose duty it is to teach. When the masters of particular schools adopted
                    regulations, which were afterwards confirmed by public authority, to prevent
                    unqualified persons from assuming their office, the terms master, doctor,
                    professor, became titles indicating a certain rank, and conveying certain powers
                    in the scholastic body. They were still, however, confined to persons admitted
                    by competent authority to the office of teachers. When the titles of doctor and
                    master were distinguished, and more especially when an initiatory stage was
                    marked by the name of <hi rend="italic">bachelor,</hi> these successive
                    designations were called <hi rend="italic">steps</hi> or <hi rend="italic"

                    to teach as the condition on which the degree was granted. The bachelor or
                    imperfect graduate was bound to read, under a master or doctor of his faculty, a
                    course of lectures; and the master, doctor, or perfect graduate was, in like

                    students were allowed to choose their regent, but were expected to attach
                    themselves to some one in particular. A period of <hi rend="italic">necessary
                    regency,</hi> different in different universities, was generally fixed, during
                    which the graduates were bound to teach, and after which they might, if they
                    chose, become <hi rend="italic">non-regents.</hi> The regents were allowed to
                    exact from their pupils a certain regulated fee <hi rend="italic">(pastus,
                    collectum).</hi> The large number of graduates who were willing to devote
                    themselves to teaching as a profession, led to the shortening of the period of
                    <hi rend="italic">necessary regency,</hi> and enabled those to whom teaching was
                    irksome to obtain a dispensation from its duties. The regents alone, except on
                    rate and extraordinary occasions, wert.· allowed to take part in the legislation
                    and government of the university. The regents were ultimately superseded by the
                    institution of salaried lecturers (<hi rend="italic">professores</hi>), who
                    delivered their instructions gratuitously. From the period of this innovation,
                    which took place in 1719, the vigour of the university was gradually impaired.
                    So long as the emoluments of the lecturers depended chiefly on the fees of their
                    pnpils, an honourable and useful competition was kept up; but the graduates,
                    finding their pupils attracted by the gratuitous lectures of the endowed
                    professors, ceased to teach, and the most powerful motive to exertion was thus
                    withdrawn.</p>
                <p>The process of graduation was the following. After two years’ study of grammar

                    preparation, to his obtaining the degree of <hi rend="italic">bachelor.</hi> The
                    object of this proposal being made so early, was to subject the candidate to
                    certain examinations, and to excite attention to his general conduct. In the
                    middle of the fifteenth century, the course of study necessary for obtaining the
                    degree of bachelor of arts was three years and a half. After passing the ordeal
                    of the academical examiners, he was conducted by the rector to the chancellor,
                    who crowned and blessed him. In consequence of passing as a bachelor. he wore a
                    round cap, attended the holy mass, and became a candidate for the degree of
                    master of arts. He was now required to devote an equal portion of time, three
                    years and a half, to the study of philosophy, and, if found qualified, after
                    frequent and severe examinations, was presented to the chancellor as worthy to
                    receive license to teach the seven liberal arts. He was then invested with the
                    <hi rend="italic">bonnet,</hi> was publicly and solemnly declared a master of
                    arts, and was at liberty to commence his career of teaching. But his magisterial
                    character was not yet complete. He next offered himself a candidate for becoming
                    a <hi rend="italic">socius</hi>, or fellow of the masters in the university, an
                    honour which was in the gift of the masters themselves, and by which he was
                    admitted to the full enjoyment of their society, and of all their
                    privileges.</p>
                <p>To obtain the degree of doctor in divinity, it was necessary for the student to
                    be twenty-five years of age when proposed, and to have studied philosophy for
                    seven, or, if he belonged to a religious body, for six years. A further
                    probation of nine years was requisite before he could attain that sacred degree.
                    Two of these years were spent in the study of the Bible, and two in the study of
                    the system of theology contained in the Book of Sentences. Sixteen years were
                    thus spent at the university in order to become a doctor in divinity. The degree
                    of doctor was conferred jointly by the chancellor and by the faculty, who
                    admitted the candidate, with the solemnity of an oath, as a member of their
                    body, and entitled to their privileges. The time necessary for acquiring the
                    degree of doctor in law and medicine was shorter, and the rules were not so
                    strictly observed. In each of these degrees certain fees were exigible.<note

                <p>The students were required to wear a cap and gown of a particular form, varying
                    with their standing or degrees in the university. The determiners wore a short
                    black gown with a hood and sleeves, the bachelors a round cap and long gown of
                    the best black cloth or silk, and the masters a gown which reached down to their
                    heels.</p>
                <p>The revenue of the university seems to have arisen at first entirely from the
                    fees of the scholars, and from contributions which were occasionally levied from
                    them. Some of the colleges, however, were richly endowed from the beginning, for
                    the maintenance both of the scholars and the masters. Their weekly provision
                    appears to have been very small. In the college of Navarre, the students of
                    grammar received each <hi rend="italic">four sous</hi> a week, the students of
                    philosophy <hi rend="italic">six sous,</hi> and the theologians <hi
                    rend="italic">eight sous.</hi> The teachers respectively received a double
                    allowance.</p>
                <p>Of the other early French universities, the most celebrated was that of
                    Montpellier, which was constituted by a bull of Pope Nicholas IV. in 1289, and
                    placed under the superintendence of the bishop of the diocese. Montpellier was
                    at first only a school of medicine, but subsequently embraced also the other
                    faculties. The university was divided into three nations, and was governed by a
                    rector, elected annually, with the assistance of twelve counsellors, of whom
                    four were selected from each nation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    not much inferior to the pattern institution in success and celebrity. It early
                    acquired fame as a school of law. The university of Orleans was established in
                    1307, and was occupied chiefly in the study of law. The students were at first

                    teachers obtained some important privileges before any such concession was made
                    to those at Paris. It is alleged, and apparently on documentary evidence, that

                    appellation, delivered lectures on law about 1075, but without attracting much

                <p>We may safely assume that, like the other early universities, the progress of
                    Bologna was gradual, and that its origin cannot be traced to any definite period
                    of arbitrary establishment. The fame of successful teachers attracted pupils to
                    their schools, and these, settling in the city, gradually claimed for themselves
                    rights and privileges, which the citizens found it their interest to recognise,
                    and which, in process of time, obtained the sanction of the emperor.</p>
                <p>The university started suddenly into celebrity in the early part of the twelfth
                    century, when Irnerius began to teach the Roman law. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Civil Law.)</hi> This great civilian is to be regarded, not only as the founder
                    of the university of Bologna, but as the author of a great revolution in the
                    jurisprudence of Europe. While engaged in teaching the liberal arts at Ravenna,
                    he accepted an invitation from the civic authorities of Bologna, and opened a
                    school in that city. He was employed as a lecturer in arts when copies of some
                    of the books of the code of Justinian, which were beginning to excite attention,
                    and to be circulated through Italy, reached Bologna.<note anchored="true"

                    Irnerius applied himself diligently to the study of them, and, after making
                    himself master of their contents, undertook to expound them in the public
                    schools. According to Conringius, he engaged in this course of lectures with the
                    sanction of the republic of Bologna, and was rewarded for his labours at the
                    public expense.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Jus

                    His zeal and energy collected large crowds of pupils, and gave an effectual
                    impulse to the study of Roman law throughout Italy, while they raised the
                    reputation of the lecturer to a pre-eminent height. The precise time at which
                    Irnerius commenced his lectures has not been ascertained, nor are the events of
                    the latter part of his life known. His name is mentioned in the records of
                    public business and judicial proceedings between the years 1113 and 1118, when
                    he appears to have relinquished his scholastic labours, and to have entered the
                    service of the imperial court. By some he is supposed to have returned to his
                    academical labours after the death of his patron Henry V. Sigonius, in his
                    History of Bologna, fixes the time of his death in the year 1150.<note

                <p>The study of law having thus revived, made surprising progress, and its fame
                    spread rapidly from Italy over other parts of Europe. Students flocked from all
                    parts to Bologna, and some eminent masters of that school repeated its lessons

                    subject of study, of much less intrinsic worth, was brought into public notice
                    at Bologna. In the early ages of the church, the public letters of bishops were
                    known by the name of decretals <hi rend="italic">(epistolae decretales),”</hi>
                    the influence of which, at first feeble, kept pace with the increase of the
                    papal power, till the decretals of the apostolic see came to be regarded as of
                    equal authority with the canons of councils. In 1151, Gratian, a monk of St
                    Felix in Bologna, published a collection of these epistles, which was known
                    simply by the title of <hi rend="italic">Decretum;</hi> a compilation which was
                    immediately received with great favour, and was made the subject of public
                    lectures in Bologna in the pontificate of Eugenius III., who died in the year
                    1153; and many scholars were attracted to the study of it.<note anchored="true"

                    origin of pontifical or canon law, a branch of jurisprudence which was long
                    regarded by the church with peculiar favour. Of the school of arts and
                    philosophy, in which, as we have already stated, the university originated,
                    nothing is known during the twelfth century. Though obscured by the splendour of
                    the rising school of law, it appears nevertheless to have maintained a certain
                    degree of celebrity. The emperor Frederick II. deemed it worthy of his
                    patronage, and about the year 1220 transmitted to it certain works of Aristotle
                    and other philosophers, which he had caused to be translated into Latin, partly
                    from the original Greek, and partly from Arabic versions. The interesting letter
                    which accompanied the gift is quoted by Conringius.<note anchored="true"

                    to which they belonged; and, secondly, that all scholars, if any lawsuit were
                    brought against them, should have the option of having it determined either by

                <p>By these singular privileges, which were afterwards the envy of other academical
                    institutions, the students were exempted from the ordinary tribunals, while the
                    professors were invested with important powers. It is true that Bologna is not
                    expressly mentioned in the authentic; but that it was intended for the benefit
                    of Bolognese scholars is apparent, because Bologna was by much the most
                    celebrated school in the emperor’s dominions, and probably the only one which
                    was at that time frequented by foreign students. Teachers of law are specially
                    mentioned, and Bologna was then the only school of law; and the permission
                    granted to the student to bring his cause before his “lord and master,” seems to
                    assume that his judge was a legal character.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Malden, p. 50.</p></note> An additional reason for applying
                    the edict peculiarly to Bologna, is found in the fact stated in Conringius,<note

                    3.</p></note> that the principal professors in the university were at that time
                    in attendance upon the emperor, having been invited by him to assist in deciding
                    certain matters at issue between him and the cities of Lombardy. It can scarcely
                    be doubted, therefore, that the edict was drawn up by them for the special
                    benefit of their own university, though the language was purposely made general.
                    The professors at first interpreted its provisions as conferring upon them
                    criminal as well as civil jurisdiction; but finding themselves unable to repress
                    the violence of the students, they allowed the former to remain in the hands of
                    the magistrates of the city, and assumed to themselves only the power of
                    determining civil suits.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    example of exemption or privilege granted to a university, and may be regarded
                    as the source of the exclusive privileges which were afterwards conferred upon
                    collegiate institutions. The increasing power of the university excited the
                    jealousy of the inhabitants of the city, and led to frequent collisions, which,
                    on more than one occasion, threatened the existence of the school, but which
                    generally ended in extending and strengthening its privileges. In the year 1226,
                    the emperor Frederick II. threatened to remove the school of law, but in the
                    following year recalled his decree.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Bologna was at first merely a school of law, and in this therefore the university
                    consisted. The scholars were divided into two bodies, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >universities,</hi> as they were called; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >citramontanes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">ultramontanes;</hi> the former
                    including the Italians, and the latter, all foreigners. These were subdivided
                    into nations; the citramontanes into seventeen, and the ultramontanes into
                    eighteen. Each nation had its presiding officer, called its <hi rend="italic"
                    >counsellor,</hi> except the nation of the Germans, who had two, under the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">procurators.</hi> At an early period the professors and
                    scholars of arts and medicine endeavoured to form themselves into a separate
                    university; but being opposed by the jurists and prohibited by the city, they
                    were compelled to unite themselves with the scholars of law. A few years after,
                    they renewed their efforts, and their right as a distinct university was
                    formally recognised by the city in 1316.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    faculty at Paris, consisted of doctors only, the scholars being considered as
                    belonging to the <hi rend="italic">artistae.</hi> Bologna had thus existed for
                    more than two hundred years, as one of the most celebrated schools of learning,

                    been occasionally delivered, but the teachers were not authorized or sanctioned
                    by the university. From the year 1362, when the university of theology was
                    founded, Bologna contained four universities; two of law; one of medicine and
                    the arts, in which were included also the scholars of theology; and one of the
                    doctors of theology. The two schools of law, however, formed together one whole,
                    and are therefore frequently designated as one university.<note anchored="true"

                    colleges of doctors, which (with the exception of the theological college) were
                    established upon quite a different principle. The theological college may have
                    differed only in the number of its members from the university of theology. But
                    there were two colleges of law, one of doctors of the civil law, the other of
                    doctors of the canon law; and two separate colleges of doctors of philosophy and
                    medicine. These colleges seem to have been corporations, in which a limited
                    number of doctors of the several faculties were united, and monopolized the
                    power of promotion and admission to degrees, to the exclusion of other doctors,
                    who, according to the earlier constitution of the university, had an equal right
                    to exercise it. They were confirmed, however, by the statutes of the year 1397.
                    The first origin of the legal colleges runs back to the twelfth century;
                    probably they were then open to all doctors. The legal Colleges were each under
                    a prior; how the others were governed, Savigny does not state. By these colleges
                    or faculties, the candidates for degrees were examined. They had a building for
                    their common use, in which they met, near the cathedral; because the public
                    examinations were held in the cathedral, and degrees solemnly conferred there.
                    Savigny warns his readers that these colleges of civil and canon law are not to
                    be confounded with the <hi rend="italic">college of Doctors, Advocates, and
                    Judges,</hi> which was an institution of the city of Bologna for civic purposes.
                    It may not be superfluous to warn the English reader not to confound these
                    colleges, which were merely corporate faculties, with the English notion of the
                    word college. There were some colleges in our sense of the word, which were
                    restricted to the relief of really indigent scholars; but these foundations
                    never had any weight or influence in any Italian university.”</p>
                <p>The constitution of the university was based on certain statutes which were
                    promulgated at various times, and confirmed by Innocent IV. in 1253; but of
                    these, and of the privileges conferred by them, our limited space will not
                    permit us to give any account. The statutes were revised and corrected every
                    twenty years, by eight scholars appointed for the purpose, and called <hi

                    Paris and Bologna, from the earliest period, that in the former the masters or
                    teachers constituted the corporation considered as a privileged body, to the
                    exclusion of the scholars; while, in the latter, the students formed the
                    university, and had the power of selecting from their own body the academical
                    officers, whom the professors were bound to obey. At the head of the
                    universities of law was the rector, who took precedence of all the other
                    officers. The rector is first mentioned towards the end of the twelfth century,
                    when only one was elected. For a long period two were chosen, one for each
                    university; and finally one, which appears to have been the case in 1514, and
                    which was established as the rule before 1552. He was chosen annually by the
                    preceding rector, the counsellors of the nations, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=528" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0528-0490"/>
                    and a certain number of electors appointed by the university at large, and was
                    taken from the different nations, according to a regular order of succession.
                    The necessary qualifications for a rector were, that he should be twenty-five
                    years of age, a <hi rend="italic">clericus,</hi> not a member of any religious
                    order, and should have studied law for at least five years, at his own cost. The
                    powers of the rector were extensive. He possessed supreme authority over all
                    members of the university, except those of the German nation, who were subject
                    to their own procurators alone. His civil jurisdiction was not doubted when both
                    parties belonged to the university, or when a citizen consented to bring before
                    him a suit against a scholar; but when a suit against a scholar was brought
                    before the magistrates of the city, the claim of the rector to hear it generally
                    gave rise to a violent contest between the city and the university. Soon after
                    the institution of the rectorate, an attempt was made by the city to abolish the
                    office, or to render it subservient to the civic power; but the university
                    succeeded in maintaining its privileges, which were ultimately confirmed by the
                    authority of the pope. The criminal jurisdiction of the rector was limited
                    generally to matters of academical discipline. He had the power of punishing
                    both professors and scholars by fine and expulsion; and, in deciding more
                    serious matters, he sometimes acted in conjunction with the magistrates of the
                    city. In 1544, the pope confirmed by a bull his criminal jurisdiction when both
                    parties belonged to the university, and when the offence was not capital. The
                    rector was assisted by a council consisting of the counsellors of the
                    nations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Savigny, iii.

                <p>In Bologna, as in Paris, there were two Chancellors. Honorius III., whose
                    pontificate extended from 1216 to 1227, when he regulated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >promotions</hi> or collation of degrees in the school of law, placed them under
                    the superintendence of the archdeacon of Bologna, whose consent, to prevent
                    abuse, was rendered necessary. Savigny<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Savigny, iii. 206,</p></note> appears to consider this as a
                    personal authority vested in the archdeacon for the time; but it was retained by
                    his successors, who assumed the title of chancellor, and exercised authority
                    over all the faculties except the faculty of theology. The bishop of Bologna was
                    constituted chancellor of the university of theologians, when this faculty was
                    established by Innocent VI. in 13G2. All honours emanated from the
                    chancellors.</p>
                <p>Besides the rector and chancellors, the other officers of the university were: 1.
                    The <hi rend="italic">counsellors</hi> or representatives of the nations, who
                    assisted the rector, and formed his council. Each nation elected one counsellor:
                    the German nation was represented by two <hi rend="italic">procurators,</hi> who
                    were invested with judicial power over their own nation, independently of the
                    rector. 2. The <hi rend="italic">syndic</hi> or common agent of both
                    universities, whose duty it was to defend their rights and privileges. He was
                    elected annually from among the scholars, and was subject to the jurisdiction of
                    the university at large. He received a salary of twelve <hi rend="italic"
                    >lire,</hi> and latterly a third of all fines. 3. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >notary,</hi> who was also common to both universities. 4. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >treasurer,</hi> who was elected annually from the bankers of the city. 5. Two

                <p>The precise time when Degrees, properly so called, began to be conferred, cannot
                    be ascertained; but perhaps we shall not much err in asserting that they were
                    nearly coeval with the university itself. The earliest teachers were designated
                    <hi rend="italic">dominus, magister, judex,</hi> lord, master judge; but these
                    were names given to them as public lecturers, and were not titles of honour,
                    carrying with them certain privileges, conferred by authority, and after
                    examination.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Conringius,

                    were designations assigned only to the teachers of the Roman law. There appears
                    to be no reason to doubt that the terms soon came to be used synonymously.
                    Savigny<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid, iii.
                    187.</p></note> states that, in the records of the university, Irnerius is
                    styled <hi rend="italic">judex</hi> or <hi rend="italic">causidicus,</hi> but
                    never <hi rend="italic">doctor,</hi> and assigns the middle of the twelfth
                    century as the date of this last title. The term doctor, here, as in Paris,
                    originally signified merely a teacher, and implied nothing more than that the
                    person bearing it had obtained a license to teach in that particular school.
                    Some writers have asserted that it was borrowed from the theological school of
                    Paris, while others have reversed the transmission, and allege that it was
                    borrowed by the Parisians from the Italian seminary. the truth probably is, that
                    it was given independently at both places. Savigny<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. iii. 187.</p></note> supposes that it
                    was in consequence of the privileges conferred on the masters and teachers by
                    the edict of Frederick I., that they found it necessary to adopt measures to
                    prevent the voluntary assumption of their office, and to establish a form of
                    admission. If this supposition be admitted, it follows that degrees were
                    conferred by public authority soon after 1158. The first doctors were no doubt
                    those of the civil law, that being the branch of learning to which the Bolognese
                    school was indebted <hi rend="italic">for</hi> its early celebrity. At the close
                    of the twelfth century we find doctors of the canon law, who soon obtained an
                    equal rank with the civilians. In the thirteenth century, doctors of medicine,
                    grammar, logic, philosophy, and the other arts, were added.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. iii. 188.</p></note> The title or
                    dignity of doctor was at first conferred by the doctors themselves by <hi

                    body by common consent. This admission or promotion conveyed to him the right of
                    lecturing in the school of Bologna, of exercising jurisdiction over his pupils,
                    and of voting in the admission of future candidates. By a pa∣pal bull, the
                    doctors of Bologna, like those of Paris, afterwards obtained the right of
                    lecturing anywhere. The system of self-election having led to frequent abuse, by
                    the admission of unworthy persons. Honorius III. in the early part of the
                    thirteenth century, interposed his authority, and placed the promotions under
                    the control of the archdeacon of Bologna.</p>
                <p>The following extract presents a curions feature in academical history.
                    “Originally,” says Mr Malden,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Origin of Universities, pp. 57, 58.</p></note> “scholars
                    were forbidden to marry into the families of Bolognese citizens, without the
                    license of the rector. Exemptions from this prohibition were granted, which were
                    at last extended to all the descendants of all doctors. By the terms of this
                    exemption, it is manifest that the doctors of the university had become closely
                    connected with the families of the citizens. This connection prepared the way
                    for the gradual encroachments of municipal selfishness; and at last the
                    principal chairs in the university were granted only to Bolognese citizens. But
                    the actual doctors profited by the example, and went a step farther, and took an
                    oath not to grant degrees to any but members of their own families. This
                    outrageous monopoly began to produce its natural effects, in the ruin of the
                    university; and commotions and struggles ensued between the years 1295 and 1304,
                    which ended in compelling the doctors to admit all Bolognese equally to degrees;
                    but the rank of doctor, at least in the two legal colleges or faculties, was
                    still confined to citizens of Bologna.”</p>
                <p>Degrees were conferred in the civil law, or in the canon law, or in both. In the
                    early age of the university single degrees were more common; in later times
                    double degrees prevailed. Six years’ previous study were necessary for the
                    canonist, and eight for the civilian. If the student of the canon law had
                    delivered a course of lectures, it was reckoned equal to a year’s study; and in
                    like manner the course of the civilian was shortened one or two years, by three
                    or four years study of the canon law. The first step necessary for the candidate
                    was to select a doctor who should present or recommend him to the archdeacon. He
                    then underwent two examinations, the first of which <hi rend="italic"
                    >(examen)</hi> was private, and the second <hi rend="italic">(conventus)</hi>
                    public. Previously to the first examination, two points of law were prescribed
                    to him, which he was required to explain and defend, in presence of the
                    chancellor and college of doctors. The doctor by whom he was presented alone
                    examined him; the rest of the faculty having the power merely of asking
                    questions mid of stating objections, after making oath that no previous compact
                    had been made with the candidate. The doctors were bound to treat the candidate
                    <hi rend="italic">lovingly</hi> as their own son, on pain of suspension from
                    their functions fur a year. The votes of the faculty were then taken, and if the
                    examination was sustained, the candidate became a <hi rend="italic"
                    >licentiate,</hi> that is, he obtained a license to present himself for public
                    examination.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. iii.
                    pp. 193, 194.</p></note></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">conventus,</hi> or public examination, by which the degree
                    o doctor was acquired, took place in the cathedral, in presence of the
                    university, when the licentiate read a thesis, and an exposition of a legal
                    question, which was criticised, not by the doctors, but by the scholars. This
                    was follow ed by an address from the archdeacon, or from a doctor deputed by
                    him, in which the new graduate was solemnly proclaimed, He was then presented
                    with the insignia of his rank, and had his place in the cathedral assigned to
                    him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid, iii. pp. 195,
                    196.</p></note> It is probable that, in the earliest age of the university, this
                    public examination by the scholars was the only one, and that the previous
                    examination originated in an assumption of power by the doctors. The public
                    examination frequently took place very soon after the private one, but sometimes
                    a considerable interval was suffered to elapse, and thus the title of licentiate
                    became a species of degree.</p>
                <p>The candidate, before being received for examination, was required to swear, in
                    presence of the rector, that he hud studied for the period prescribed; before
                    the private examination, that he bad paid merely the requisite fees; and before
                    the public examination, that he would promote the interest of the university and
                    scholars, and if he remained in Bologna, would obey the rector, and comply with
                    the statutes. At one time the commencing doctors took an oath to the magistrates
                    of the city, that they would not lecture out of Bologna; but this oath was
                    abolished in 1312, on the petition of the scholars, who purchased exemption from
                    it with a sum of money.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    were admitted to its honours and offices. In early times degrees were conferred
                    on learned women, who were even permitted to occupy professorial chairs. Novella
                    d’Andrea read lectures on the canon law in the fourteenth century; Laura Bassi
                    was professor of physics in the eighteenth century; and Clotilde Tambroni, who
                    was professor of Greek, died in 1817.</p>
                <p>The expense of graduation was considerable. The fees for the private examination
                    amounted to sixty <hi rend="italic">lire</hi>; those for the public examination
                    to eighty. Besides the fees, it was usual for the licentiate to give clothes to
                    many of those who took part in the solemn procession; a custom which was found
                    so oppressive that Pope Clement V. in 1311 ordained that an oath should be
                    exacted from each candidate that be would not expend more than 500 <hi

                    expense and magnificence which attended the early taking of the higher degrees
                    in England in the reigns of Henry III. and Edward I. About the year 1268, he
                    says, when Alphonsus de Senis or Siena, an Italian, studied at Oxford, one
                    Bonifacius de Saluciis proceeded in the civil law, at whose inception there were
                    such ceremonies and feasting, that the like fur that faculty was scarce before
                    known here. The abbot and convent of Oseney gave him the free use of their
                    monastery on that occasion. He adds, that a still greater solemnity was
                    performed some years after, at Gloucester College, by the Benedictines, for one
                    William de Brooke, a monk at St Peter’s monastery at Gloucester, who took the
                    degree of D. D. in 1298, being the first of his order who had attained that
                    dignity. He was accompanied by the abbot and whole convent of his own monastery,
                    the abbots of Westminster, Reading, Abingdon. Evesham, and Malmesbury, numerous
                    other priors and monks, and by a hundred noblemen and esquires on horses richly

                <p>All doctors, in right of their degree, bad the power of lecturing or teaching
                    publicly; licentiates could not lecture without the permission of the rector.
                    But even simple scholars, after five or six years of diligent study, might
                    obtain from the rector a license to teach, on payment of a fee proportioned to
                    the importance of the branch of law on which they proposed to lecture. The
                    scholar who had lectured on an entire treatise, or who had delivered a formal
                    interpretation of a point of law, was considered to have earned his first
                    degree, and took the name of Bachelor. When degrees became so common that the
                    doctors were not all necessarily obliged to teach, the jurisdiction over the

                    the Professors at an early period received fixed salaries. In the year 1279 the
                    scholars made an agreement with a lecturer to deliver a course of lectures for a
                    certain specified sum; and in the following year they petitioned the city to pay
                    a sum to the canonist Garsias for a course of lectures on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decretum</hi>, and their petition was granted. In 1289 two professorships, one
                    of the civil law and another of the canon law. were established, with a fixed
                    salary. The choice of the professors rested with the scholars, who elected
                    annually, sometimes re-electing the same person, and sometimes choosing another.
                    The number of endowed chairs continued to increase, so that in 1384 we find
                    nineteen salaried lecturers in law, and twenty-three in arts. The salaries of
                    the professors of the civil law, which were the highest, amounted to 495 <hi
                    rend="italic">lire</hi> each. The salaries, which had hitherto been granted only
                    for a year, now began to be considered permanent, and the professors to regard
                    themselves as public functionaries. In 1420 there were twenty-one teachers of
                    law, of whom scarcely one is said to have been elected by the university.<note

                    were six endowed lectureships, to which scholars only were eligible. The
                    lecturers were appointed annually, by seventy-six electors, and were equally
                    divided between the Citra-montane and Ultramontane scholars. Doctors,
                    licentiates, and natives of Bologna, were ineligible. This arrangement,
                    according to Savigny, was acted upon in 1338; but in consequence of* the tumult
                    attending the election, it afterwards became customary for the universities to
                    select twelve candidates, from whom were chosen by lot four lecturers on the
                    civil law, and two on the decretals. According to Conringius,<note

                    21.</p></note> there were, in 1664, 126 professors in the school of Bologna, of
                    whom forty-nine belonged to the faculties of law; and the corporation of the
                    city was said to expend annually in their salaries nearly 40,000 crowns. The
                    unsalaried professors received fees from their pupils, and in the flourishing
                    ages of the university many of them acquired great wealth.</p>
                <p>During the whole of the thirteenth century, the professors assembled their pupils
                    in their own houses; in the fourteenth century public schools were founded, and
                    were appropriated solely to the use of the doctors. The bachelors were allowed
                    the use of them twice a week in the afternoon, if they were not occupied by a
                    doctor. The courses of lectures were begun on the 19th of October, and continued
                    for a year. The holidays amounted to about ninety, including two weeks al Easter
                    and eleven days at Christmas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The university of Bologna, though fallen from its former glory, is still one of
                    the first in Italy; and in several branches of study is inferior only to that of
                    Pavia. The university contains the four faculties of theology, law, physic, and
                    philosophy, and furnished in 1833 instruction in nine courses of education. 1.
                    Elementary philosophy, which lasts two years, and consists of logic and
                    metaphysics the elements of algebra and geometry, physics and ethics. 2.
                    Theological course, which lasts four years, and comprehends dogmatic theology,
                    moral theology, lectures on the Scriptures, the Hebrew language, ecclesiastical
                    history, and pulpit oratory. 3. Course of law, which continues four years: first
                    year, institutions of the canon law, of the civil law, and of natural law;
                    second year, institutions of public ecclesiastical law, and of criminal law, and
                    text of the civil law; third year, institutions of public ecclesiastical law.
                    text of the canon law, and text of the civil law, taught by a different
                    professor from that of the second year; fourth year, text of the canon law, and
                    textof the civil law, by both professors. 4. Notary course, obligatory for two
                    years: first year, logic, metaphysics, and ethice; second year, canon and civil
                    institutions. 5. Medical course; theory, four years, and two of practice. 6.
                    Surgical course, three years, and two of practice. 7. Pharmaceutic course, two
                    years; first year, chemistry and botany; second year, materia medica and
                    pharmacy. 8. Veterinary course, two years; veterinary medicine, comparative
                    anatomy, chemistry, botany, pharmacy, physiology, and materia medica. 9. Course
                    of philosophy and mathematics, four years; the first two are nearly the same as
                    in elementary philosophy; in the third and fourth years, fluxions, mechanics,
                    hydraulics, optics, and astronomy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Every student, before entering the university, must prove that he is possessed
                    of a monthly income of twelve scudi or dollars, this being the smallest sum on
                    which, it is believed, he can live respectably. The salaries of the professors
                    amount to from 300 to 400 dollars, and the students pay no fees. The scholastic
                    year begins on the 5th of September, and terminates on the 26th of June.
                    Deducting the holidays, there are but 104 days of lectures in the year. The
                    number of students is under 1000. The university library contains 150,000
                    volumes. There is also in the city another library, the gift of a clergyman,
                    containing 83,000 volumes and 4000 MSS.</p>
                <p>ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES.</p>
                <p>The English universities, like most of those which sprung up in remote times,
                    were formed on the model of the university of Paris, and in the earlier period
                    of their history bear a striking resemblance to the parent institution. Till
                    1836, England contained only two universities, those of Oxford and Cambridge.
                    The origin of both is involved in doubt and obscurity, and it is probably
                    impossible to decide at how early a period schools and places of general
                    education existed in either. The question of the comparative antiquity of the
                    two seminaries was agitated with great keenness in the seventeenth century, but
                    the industry of the respective antiquaries has not thrown much light on the
                    subject. Some of the more eager advocates of the remote antiquity of Oxford
                    contend that it was a seminary of learning immediately after the destruction of
                    Troy,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Oxonienses in

                <p>The honour of founding this celebrated university is usually assigned to Alfred,
                    who, according to John Rous, the antiquary of Warwick, who flourished in the
                    fifteenth century, “built in this city three halls in the name of the Holy
                    Trinity, for the doctors in grammar, philosophy, and divinity.”<note

                    marks of error,” acknowledges in his last work (Introduction to the Literature

                    name was formerly associated with it as its founder or restorer, had really no

                    document or well-authenticated history can be produced in which the name of
                    Alfred appears as a benefactor of the university. Soon after the reign of
                    Alfred, at least during the succeeding century, schools for the acquisition of
                    learning appear to have been established in Oxford; but these were either of a
                    private character, or were attached to the religious houses with which the town
                    abounded. It is certain that Oxford was a place of study in the reign of Edward
                    the Confessor (1041-1066)\;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Hallam, Mid. Ages, iii. 524.</p></note> but even at the time of the conquest
                    it does not appear to have enjoyed any greater pre-eminence than that which
                    naturally arose from the number of its monastic establishments, and from the
                    circumstance of its having been, during the preceding century, a favourite
                    residence of the English monarchs. Its schools might therefore be more numerous
                    and better attended than those in other towns, and might possibly derive from
                    royal favour some trifling privileges. When many of the secular scholars resided
                    in one house, it got the name of a hall or hostel; and governors or principals
                    were appointed over them, who superintended the discipline and civil affairs of
                    the house. the schools were divided into grammar-schools, sophistry-schools,
                    schools for arts, medicine or physic-schools, law-schools, divinity-schools,
                    &amp;c., names which, but for the literary remains of the early ages, would seem
                    to indicate something like a defined system of education. No traces, however, of
                    a regular plan can be discovered before the foundation of the first college in
                    the middle of the thirteenth century.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the twelfth century, Oxford is again mentioned as a place of
                    education. Robert Pulein, a theologian from Paris, expounded the holy Scriptures
                    under the patronage of Henry l., and gave new life to the study of theology in
                    England.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Malden on the

                    labours under the protection of Henry II. till he was called to Rome, and became
                    chancellor of the apostolic see. In the reign of Stephen, Vacarius, a Lombard by
                    birth, who had studied the civil law at Bologna, formed a school of Roman law at
                    Oxford; and it is reasonable to suppose, as Mr Hallam observes, that a foreigner
                    would not have chosen that city as the scene of his labours if he had not found
                    a seminary of learning already established there. The introduction of this new
                    science was opposed by the students; of philosophy and theology, who prevailed
                    upon the king to prohibit the lecturer from teaching, and to demand that all the
                    books of law should be delivered up to him. This prohibition however was not
                    carried into effect, since it appears from two decretals of Alexander III. in
                    1164 and 1170, that Vacarius remained in England in the reign of Henry II.; and
                    there is evidence that the school subsisted for some time after his death. The
                    difficulty and expense of obtaining copies of the original works on the Roman
                    law induced Vacarius to compile for the use of his pupils an abridgment of the
                    Pandects and Code which, according to Savigny,<note anchored="true"

                    year 1149. This opinion of Savigny is confirmed by Wood, who assigns 1149 as the
                    date of the introduction of the civil law into Oxford, and refers to the same
                    period, or to a time very little later, the introduction of the scholastic

                    for Oxford the title of doctor, no such distinction being at that time known in
                    the Parisian school. Of course the appellation, when first used, signified
                    merely a teacher, and was not a technical degree. Hallam’s Introduction, &amp;c.

                    special patronage of the clergy, obtained but little favour from the laity of
                    England. The circumstance of its being introduced from Italy, and recommended by
                    ecclesiastical authority, disposed all laymen to look upon it with suspicion,
                    while its rigid enactments accorded ill with the more liberal principles of the
                    common law. The attention even of the clergy was soon diverted from it by the
                    introduction of the canon law, which must have been taught at Oxford soon after

                    of St Maur mention the existence of an eminent school of the canon law at Oxford

                <p>Even in that rude age, education seems not to have been entirely neglected by the
                    English monarchs. Henry I. is said to have paid great attention to Oxford as a
                    seminary of learning, and to have granted to the teachers and scholars, in their
                    individual capacity, some important privileges. In the reigns of his two
                    immediate successors learning declined, but it again revived under the
                    encouragement of Richard I. New halls and schools were established under his
                    patronage, and money was issued from his exchequer for their support. To so

                    unfortunate incident which occurred in 1209 interrupted this course of
                    prosperity, and even threatened the destruction of the town as a seat of
                    learning. A student, while engaged in some active exercise, accidentally killed
                    a woman belonging to the town, and dreading the consequences, fled from justice.
                    The mayor and burgesses immediately surrounded the hall to which the supposed
                    murderer belonged; and failing to apprehend him, they seized three students
                    entirely unconnected with the affair, and hanged them without proof or trial.
                    The teachers and scholars, justly enraged at this barbarous act, unanimously
                    quitted Oxford, and retired, some to Cambridge, <pb break="no"

                    satisfied with this, they even applied to the pope, and obtained an interdict
                    against the town, and against all persons who should settle in it for the
                    purpose of teaching. The inhabitants finding themselves thus deserted by those
                    on whom the prosperity of the town chiefly depended, waited upon the pope’s
                    legate, and obtained absolution, on conditions which induced the students to
                    return to their former habitations. The king likewise bestowed on the students
                    some new immunities, exempting them from any foreign judicature, and even
                    granting them the power of taking cognisance in causes where one party was a
                    scholar, or the servant of a scholar, <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. d</hi>. 1214.)

                <p>Henry III. took advantage of a serious dispute which arose between the students
                    and citizens of Paris in 1229, to advance the interests of Oxford, and invited
                    the Parisian masters and scholars to settle there, promising them greater
                    privileges than those which they had enjoyed in Paris.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dyer’s Privileges, i. 437, &amp;c.</p></note>
                    A thousand accordingly accepted his invitation; but, presuming too much on the
                    immunities which had been held out to them, they introduced a levity of manners,
                    which gave rise to frequent tumults, and caused great alarm and disquiet in the
                    town. The reign of this monarch is particularly memorable in the annals of the
                    university. In the year 1244, he granted to it the first charter of privileges
                    as a corporate body,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Vol. i. pp. 206 and 266.</p></note> and in 1255 confirmed and extended the
                    privileges which he had formerly conferred. Previously to this period, the
                    scholars and students lodged and studied in halls rented from the townsmen; and
                    this was one great source of the numerous quarrels which constantly took place
                    between them. To remedy the evil, and also to encourage learning, several
                    public-spirited individuals purchased or built large houses for the reception of
                    the teachers and scholars, and thus set the example of appropriating funds for
                    the support of those who had not the means of prosecuting their studies to
                    advantage. Such was the origin of the English colleges, which at first modified,
                    and have at length entirely superseded, the universities. Additional charters,
                    some of fresh privileges, and others of general confirmation, were granted by
                    Edward I. in 1275, Edward II. in 1315, Edward III. in 1827, and by succeeding
                    kings. The English universities, it appears, solicited a recognition and renewal
                    of their privileges at the beginning of every new reign. Their privileges now
                    depend upon the act of the 13th Elizabeth, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 1570,
                    “concerning the Incorporations of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and
                    the Confirmation of the Charters, Liberties, and Privileges, granted to either
                    of them.” The <hi rend="italic">corpus Statutorum,</hi> or body of statutes, by
                    which the university of Oxford is governed, was compiled, chiefly from existing
                    statutes, by a committee appointed during the chancellorship of Archbishop Laud,
                    and was solemnly ratified by the king, chancellor, and convocation, in 1636.
                    These statutes, however modified by subsequent interpretations, additions, or
                    restrictions, still determine the law and constitution of the university; and

                    is said to have been 15,000. It may readily be granted that these statements are
                    greatly exaggerated; still they seem to imply that the real number was very

                    his assumed authority submitted to in silence, especially by the less able of
                    the English kings. It is clear, however, that by the more vigorous of the early
                    monarchs the authority of the pope in matters relating to the universities was
                    little regarded, or rather that it was utterly disclaimed. They considered the
                    universities as not amenable to ecclesiastical superintendence, but took them
                    under their own peculiar authority. Thus Henry III. on going to Gascony,
                    appointed the archbishop of York and two others guardians of the university, to
                    receive complaints during his absence, though, according to the canons, the
                    government of it was vested in the bishop of Lincoln, the bishop of the diocese,

                    Beside the unfortunate incidents already alluded to, others occurred which gave
                    a temporary check to its prosperity. In the reign of Edward I. a violent dispute
                    arose between the university and the bishop of Lincoln, in whose diocese Oxford
                    was then included, concerning the limits of the bishop’s jurisdiction in
                    university matters, which ultimately led to the total emancipation of the
                    learned body from ecclesiastical authority, under the <pb break="no"

                    diocesan. The advantages of this are very apparent. Instead of a distant
                    superior exercising only an occasional and appellative jurisdiction, the
                    chancellor was one of their body, and combined the offices which, in the
                    continental universities, were divided between the chancellor and
                    rector.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> The plague which broke out in
                    1349 nearly ruined the university, all the colleges and halls having been
                    deserted and shut up during its prevalence. The reign of Richard II. is
                    distinguished by the appearance at this university of John Wycliffe, who was the
                    first warden of Canterbury College, and whose lectures on divinity loosened the
                    shackles of popish thraldom, which Henry VIII. afterwards burst asunder, from
                    motives very different from those which animated the first of the reformers. The
                    succeeding reigns present little that is remarkable in the annals of the
                    university, except the religious dissensions, which had nearly caused its
                    dissolution. The reign of Henry VII. is entitled to the proud distinction of
                    having fostered, with more than ordinary success, the revival of learning.
                    Genuine scholarship had, during the preceding century, become exceedingly rare,
                    and the Greek language had not only fallen into general disuse, but was
                    affectedly held in contempt by a great body of the students, who formed
                    themselves into an association, under the name of Trojans. So strong indeed was
                    the prejudice against this language, that when Erasmus went to Oxford for the
                    purpose of teaching it, several leading men in the university read lectures
                    against him in the schools, and endeavoured to attach ridicule both to the man
                    and to the knowledge which it was his object to disseminate. Through the
                    vigorous efforts of Cardinal Wolsey, the Greek language was again received into
                    estimation, and a taste for elegant literature was introduced. In 1518, the
                    cardinal founded seven lectures for theology, the civil law, physic, philosophy,
                    mathematics, Greek, and rhetoric, and appointed to all of them the men who were
                    most distinguished for their abilities, and for their knowledge in these
                    respective branches of learning. After the commencement of the reformation under
                    Henry VIII., when the monastic orders were dissolved, and their property
                    confiscated, and when the church in its unsettled state presented but few
                    inducements to the study of theology, the number of scholars was very much
                    reduced.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edin. Rev. No.

                <p>The changes which took place in the religion of the court during the reigns of
                    Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, affected considerably the prosperity of the
                    university. The last-named sovereign granted to both universities the act of
                    incorporation; and her successor, in 1603, conferred upon them the privilege of
                    sending each two representatives to the national council. From the period of the
                    revolution the university of Oxford has continued to flourish; its revenues have
                    been increased; and the system of education now embraces the improvements which
                    have been effected in almost every branch of science. The doctrines of the
                    schools, it is true, received favour here for some time after they had been
                    expelled from the northern universities; but they have now given way to the more
                    rational views of experimental philosophy.</p>
                <p>One of the distinguishing peculiarities of the English universities, is the
                    existence of collegiate establishments, some of which were founded at a very
                    early period. We have already mentioned similar establishments in the university
                    of Paris; but the English colleges, being more richly endowed, have to a much
                    greater extent engrossed the powers and privileges of the universities. Of the
                    existing colleges of Oxford, three, University College, Balliol College, and
                    Merton College, were founded before the end of the thirteenth century, and in
                    the following century the number was increased to seven. The motive which led to
                    those foundations was the same which has been mentioned in treating of the
                    university of Paris: to furnish the students with lodgings, to relieve the
                    indigent from some portion of the expenses of their education, and to provide
                    more effectually for the discipline of the university. In Oxford, the chancellor
                    and his deputy combined the powers of the rector and the two chancellors in
                    Paris; and the inspection and control, chiefly exercised in the latter, through
                    the distribution of the scholars into nations,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>‘ “The division of the scholars into nations,
                    which prevailed in all the universities of the continent, was unknown in
                    England; probably because our insular situation prevented the influx of foreign
                    students. There was a tendency at one time at Oxford to establish a similar
                    distinction between the natives of the counties north and south of the Trent.
                    For some time the proctors were chosen, one from each division; but the schism
                    was healed. At Cambridge, by the composition between the scholars and the
                    burgesses, in the filty-fourth year of Henry III., conservators of the peace
                    were to be elected annually at the beginning of the academical year,
                    twenty-three in number (the original number of a jury), ten from the town, and
                    thirteen from the university; and of these latter, five were to be English,
                    three Scotch, two Welsh, and three Irish. This arrangement might easily have
                    given rise to a division of the scholars into nations, each choosing its own
                    conservators; but it was not attended by any such consequence,” Mulden on the

                    procurators, and deans, was in the former more especially accomplished by
                    collecting the students into certain privileged houses, subject to a principal,
                    who was responsible for the conduct of the members. But the number of the <hi

                    members was, for many centuries, small in comparison to <hi rend="italic">the
                    halls</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inns,</hi> in which the students lived chiefly
                    at their own expense, and were merely furnished with cheap and convenient
                    lodgings. At the commencement of the fourteenth century, the number of halls was
                    about <hi rend="italic">three hundred,</hi> while the colleges amounted only to
                    <hi rend="italic">three.</hi> For the establishment of a hall, nothing more was
                    necessary than that a few students, on a mutual agreement to live together,
                    should hire a house, find surety for a year’s rent, and choose for principal a
                    graduate of respectable character. The chancellor or his deputy could not refuse
                    to sanction the establishment, and to admit the principal to his office. The
                    halls were in general held only on lease; but, by a privilege common to most
                    universities, the rent was fixed every five years by sworn taxers, two masters
                    and two citizens; and houses once occupied by students could not be resumed by
                    the proprietors so long as the rent was punctually discharged. The halls were
                    governed by peculiar statutes, and were liable to be visited and regulated by
                    the university.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wood, as

                    halls, though that of the endowed colleges continued to increase. At the
                    commencement of the fifteenth century, while the students were diminishing, the

                    of them for a trifling sum. The old colleges thus extended their limits by easy

                    students who were not on the foundation, and provided for by endowment; but they
                    now began to receive independent members, and the diminution of the number of
                    students in the university rendered it possible to receive nearly all of them.
                    Since the beginning of the seventeenth century, only one college has been
                    founded; and three of the eight surviving halls have been changed by endowment
                    into colleges, but one of these is now extinct.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In addition to the want of endowments, it may freely be admitted, that the more
                    effectual superintendence and tuition which were supplied in the colleges, in
                    consequence of the greater number of graduates who were members of them,
                    contributed to the downfall of the halls. It remains only to mention the reason
                    which, in the most crowded state of the university, has prevented one from being
                    restored. Before the period of their downfall, the establishment of a hall was
                    easy, and the chancellor was not at liberty to refuse his sanction. A piece of
                    university legislation has effectually secured the monopoly to the colleges. The
                    earl of Leicester, when chancellor of the university, about 1570, “through the
                    absolute potency he had,” obtained from the university the right of nominating
                    the principals of all halls, and consequently in effect a <hi rend="italic"
                    >veto</hi> upon the institution of any; and this right is now vested by statute
                    in his successors. The heads of colleges being in reality the governing body,
                    have since prevented any interference with their monopoly, by the establishment
                    of a new hall.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. No.
                    10C, 412, and authorities there cited.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the earliest period of the university, the scholars lodged, without domestic
                    superintendence, in the houses of the citizens, as at Paris and Bologna, and
                    attended such lectures as they chose. In the year 1231, it was ordained “that
                    every clerk or scholar resident in Oxford must subject himself to the discipline
                    and tuition of some master of the schools;” i.e. should enter himself as the
                    pupil of one or other of the actual regents, while he was still left at liberty
                    to select his own place of residence. At the commencement of the fifteenth
                    century, however, it had become the established law, that all scholars should be
                    members of some college, hall, or entry, under a responsible head. The scholars
                    who frequented the lectures of the university, without attaching themselves to
                    any college or hall, were called <hi rend="italic">chamberdehyns,</hi> as in
                    Paris they were called <hi rend="italic">Martinets;</hi> and frequent and
                    decisive measures were adopted against them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    only the students of the faculty of arts who were obliged to place themselves
                    under collegiate superintendence; but in the English universities the graduates
                    and under-graduates of every faculty were equally required to be members of a
                    privileged house. It is necessary however to observe, that entrance at a college
                    or hall did not imply entrance under any particular tutor. “Young students, and
                    many in those days were mere boys, were placed by their friends under the care
                    of tutors; but these were private tutors, and the universities did not interfere
                    with the private arrangement. It was not till the time when Leicester was
                    chancellor, that the university undertook to regulate who might be tutors; and
                    it was not till the chancellorship of Laud, that it was made necessary to enter
                    under a tutor resident in the same college or hall with the pupil. Laud,
                    therefore, may be regarded as the author of the system of college tuition.”<note

                    professors, but was conducted by the graduates at large. Every graduate had an
                    equal right to teach, and even incurred the obligation of teaching publicly, for
                    a certain period, the subjects of his faculty, as the condition on which he
                    obtained his degree. Even the bachelor was obliged to give proof of his ability
                    in teaching, by reading a short course of’ lectures under the superintendence of
                    his faculty; and the doctor, after his promotion, immediately commenced <hi

                    still retained their privileges as members of the governing body. The period of
                    <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> regency was finally limited to one year; but
                    the masters were allowed to remain <hi rend="italic">voluntary</hi> regents <hi

                    master to become a member of the house of congregation, all continue regents for
                    two years. All professors and public lecturers, the masters of the schools, and
                    public examiners, are regents; and the name has been extended to all resident
                    doctors, to the heads of houses, and to the deans of colleges.<note

                <p>The ancient system of instruction was gradually superseded by the appointment of

                    the right was expressly reserved to every doctor and master, of lecturing in the
                    public schools on any subject pertaining to his faculty, its exercise was in a

                    statutes were digested under the authority of Archbishop Laud, there were,
                    besides the professors of the superior faculties, ten professors or public
                    readers of the seven arts and the three philosophies. They were appointed by the
                    house of congregation, that is, by the regents; and attendance on their lectures
                    was enforced by statute. In the time of Laud six of these enjoyed a permanent
                    endowment; four were paid partly by the fees of their pupils, partly by fines
                    levied on the regents whom they relieved from teaching. After the final

                    branches of the ancient Trivium. Of the Quadrivium, geometry and astronomy had
                    their professors endowed by the munificence of Sir Henry Savile, in 1619.
                    Provision was made by royal endowment for teaching the Greek and Hebrew

                    Music had its professor; but it was now separated from the faculty of arts.
                    There were also two professors of divinity, a professor of civil law, a
                    professor of medicine, and a praelector in anatomy, who ministered instruction
                    in the higher faculties. The regius professorships of Greek, Hebrew, divinity,
                    civil law, and medicine, were endowed by Henry VIII. in the years 1535 and 1540.
                    The Margaret professorship of divinity was of older date.”</p>
                <p>Before proceeding to give an account of the system of education at present
                    pursued in Oxford, it seems necessary for us to describe shortly the
                    constitution of the various colleges of which both universities are composed.
                    These may be regarded either as charitable foundations for the maintenance of a
                    certain number of students and of resident graduates, or as houses of education
                    in which young men desirous of obtaining degrees are lodged and placed under the
                    superintendence of tutors. In the first point of view, each college is an
                    independent corporation, wholly unconnected with the university, except in so
                    far as its members are subject to the statutes; it is governed by its own laws,
                    and is subject to the inspection of its own visitor, appointed in its charter of
                    foundation.</p>
                <p>Each college consists of a Head, called by the various names of provost, master,
                    rector, principal, or warden, of a body of fellows <hi rend="italic"
                    >(socii),</hi> and generally of scholars also, besides various officers or
                    servants. With the exception of one or two royal foundations, the heads of
                    colleges are elected by the fellows, from their own number, possess superior
                    authority in the discipline of the college considered as a place of education,
                    and exercise an important office in the government of the university. In most
                    colleges the beads are necessarily clergymen, and are allowed to marry. Their
                    incomes vary so much as to render it impossible to make a definite estimate of
                    them. They arise generally from the produce of a double fellowship, and from
                    college livings attached to the office. The office is held for life.</p>
                <p>The Fellows are the governing body of the college. The fellowships vary according
                    to the extent of the colleges, and were either constituted by the original
                    founder, or have been endowed by subsequent benefactors. In many colleges in
                    both universities the fellows are necessarily graduates, either by statute, or
                    by common usage; having passed the lowest degree, that of B. A., or student ill
                    the civil law. This rule, however, is subject to many exceptions.’ In New
                    College, Oxford, which is an establishment connected with Winchester College,
                    persons of the founder’s kin are fellows on their first admission, and the
                    others after a probation of two years. The classes of persons eligible to
                    fellowships are also limited by the statutes of each college. At Cambridge, the
                    limitation to particular schools, dioceses, and counties, is less common than at
                    Oxford; but, on the other hand, it is the general practice in the former
                    university for each college to confine the election of fellows to its own
                    students. At Oxford, some of the fellowships in every college are open to the
                    graduates of the whole university; but in some of these only is the election
                    made on the principle of free competition, the others are disposed of by private
                    interest and favour. In Downing College, Cambridge, graduates of both
                    universities are eligible. Some few fellowships may be held by laymen, but in
                    general they can be retained only by persons already in holy orders, or who are
                    ordained within a specified time. Those who decline to take orders vacate their
                    fellowships when the time allowed for the choice of a profession expires.
                    Fellowships are of very unequal value. The best at Oxford are said to be worth,
                    in good years, from L.600 to L.700, while many do not exceed L.100; and many at
                    Cambridge fall far short of that sum.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    most part received in corn-rents, and vary with the price of that commodity. The
                    senior fellowships are the most lucrative; but all confer upon their holders the
                    right to apartments in the college, and contain privileges as to commons or
                    meals. The fellowships are tenable for life, unless the holder marries, or
                    inherits estates which afford a larger revenue, or accepts one of the livings
                    belonging to the college. In some colleges, graduates who have been elected to
                    fellowships are required to pass a year of probation, during which they receive
                    no income.</p>
                <p>The Scholars are placed under different regulations, and enjoy different
                    advantages, in the different colleges. They are on the foundation, but their
                    connection with it is not so intimate as that of the fellows. They are always
                    chosen from the under-graduates, and are often elected before they have
                    commenced their residence at the university. At Oxford the scholars wear a
                    different gown from the rest of the under graduates, and in some colleges
                    succeed by rotation to fellowships. In respect of discipline and education, they
                    are on precisely the same footing as the independent students. The scholarships
                    vary, in point of emolument, from L.100 or L.80 to L.20, or less, per annum,
                    together with some advantages in the way of board.<note anchored="true"

                    some colleges the students corresponding to the scholars bear different names,
                    as the demies <hi rend="italic">(semicomunarii)</hi> of Magdalen, Oxford.</p>
                <p>Besides the scholars, there are in nearly all the colleges students named
                    Exhibitioners, who have exhibitions, or annual pensions, given in some instances
                    by the colleges, in others by free and endowed schools, to young men proceeding
                    generally to the universities, or to particular colleges. Some of these are very
                    valuable.</p>
                <p>There are also several classes of inferior students, who are maintained either
                    wholly or in part by the endowments. These poor students are generally required
                    to perform some menial offices in the college, and bear various names. At Oxford
                    they are named Servitors, Bible-clerks; and in Christ Church, Scholars; at
                    Cambridge they are generally termed Sizars. In the latter university their
                    position is more elevated than at Oxford.</p>
                <p>The Tutors who conduct the education of the students are selected from the
                    fellows. These, with the officers, as the Dean, who is the highest connected
                    with education, the Bursar, &amp;c., are sometimes the only resident
                    fellows.</p>
                <p>The university of Oxford is incorporated by the style of “The Chancellor,
                    Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford.” Its ancient charters were
                    confirmed by the legislature in the 13th of Elizabeth; and its statutes, as has
                    been already mentioned, were reduced into a digest in the chancellorship of
                    Archbishop Laud. The principal officers of the university are the chancellor,
                    the high steward, the vice-chancellor, two proctors, a public orator, a keeper
                    of the archives, a registrar, public professors and lecturers, two curators of
                    the theatre, two clerks of the market, the keeper of the Bodleian library, and
                    the keeper of the Ashmolean Museum. The first five are invested with magisterial
                    authority, and have the power of appointing deputies.</p>
                <p>The highest officer in the university is the Chancellor, who is elected by the
                    members of convocation, and holds his appointment for life. In the thirteenth
                    century the chancellor was nominated by the regents and non-regents, and
                    confirmed by the bishop of Lincoln, who was then the diocesan of Oxford. After
                    the reign of Edward III. he was elected and confirmed by the regents and
                    non-regents only. Till 1484, the office was held only for one, two, or three
                    years, and was always conferred on a resi. dent ecclesiastic until the time of
                    Sir John Mason, in 1552, who was the first lay-chancellor. For nearly two
                    hundred years it has been conferred on noblemen of distinction, who have been
                    members of the university. The duties of the chancellor are, to defend its
                    privileges, and to decide, either in person or by deputy, in all civil questions
                    in which a member happens to be involved.</p>
                <p>The Seneschallus or High Steward is appointed by the chancellor, and approved by
                    convocation, and retains the office for life. The high steward assists the
                    chancellor, vice-chancellor, and proctors in the execution of their respective
                    duties, and defends the rights, customs, and liberties of the university. If
                    required by the chancellor, he hears and determines capital causes, according to
                    the laws of the land and the privileges of the university, when a scholar or
                    privileged person is the party offending. He likewise holds the university
                    court-leet, at the appointment of the chancellor or vice-chancellor, either by
                    himself or deputy.</p>
                <p>The Vice-Chancellor is in effect the supreme judicial and executive authority in
                    the university. He is annually nominated by the chancellor, from the heads of
                    colleges; but the office is, in practice, held by rotation for four years. The
                    vice-chancellor appoints four deputies, from the heads of colleges, who perform
                    his duties in the case of illness, or necessary absence from the university.</p>
                <p>The Proctors, senior and junior, are two masters of arts, of at least four years
                    standing, and not more than ten, who are chosen annually from the several
                    colleges by turns, according to a peculiar cycle, fixed by the Caroline statutes
                    of Charles I.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Previously
                    to the year 1629, the proctors were chosen by the common suffrages of the
                    masters, and the canvass was generally attended with extreme tumult. To prevent
                    the breach of discipline usual on such occasions, Charles I. converted these
                    public elections into private ones; and that the office might be distributed
                    through every college according to an arithmetical proportion, a cycle was drawn
                    up by two celebrated mathematicians, which has since been followed.</p></note>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0535-0497"/>elected by the doctors and masters of arts; and
                    after their election they nominate four masters of arts as deputies, and may
                    depute their authority to a greater number if necessary. Their duties are, to
                    preserve the peace of the university, in which they are assisted by their
                    deputies, and have under their command the academical constabulary force; to
                    repress disorders among the students, and to inflict summary academical
                    punishments, as the imposition of tasks, confinement to college, &amp;c. They
                    have also an extensive police jurisdiction in the town. Their summary authority
                    extends both to under-graduates and bachelors of arts.</p>
                <p>The business of the university is transacted in two distinct assemblies termed
                    “Houses,” namely, the house of <hi rend="italic">Congregation</hi> and the house
                    of <hi rend="italic">Convocation.</hi> The chancellor or vice-chancellor, or in
                    his absence one of his four deputies, and the two proctors, or in their absence
                    their respective deputies, preside in both houses, where their presence is
                    indispensably requisite.</p>
                <p>The House of Congregation consists wholly of regents, either <hi rend="italic"
                    >neceesary</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ad placitum.</hi> Its business is
                    principally confined to the passing of graces and dispensations, and to the
                    granting of degrees. In the sole instance of supplications for graces, but in no
                    other, every member of the house, in addition to his right of suffrage, has a
                    suspending <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> upon each grace for three times, as
                    the grace is proposed in three distinct congregations; but previously to the
                    fourth supplication, he is required to state privately to the vice-chancellor
                    and proctors the ground and proof of his objection, which are subsequently
                    submitted to the judgment of the house for approbation or rejection. All
                    suffrages for or against graces and dispensations in congregation are to be
                    whispered secretly into the ear of the proctor, by a majority of which, given in
                    the word <hi rend="italic">placet</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nan-placet,</hi> the
                    fate of the measure is ultimately determined.</p>
                <p>The House of Convocation, which is, with some limitations, composed of regents
                    and non-regents alike, extends its power to all subjects connected with the
                    credit, interest, and welfare of the university. In the exercise, however, of
                    one particular branch of its privileges, the enacting of new or the explaining
                    of old statutes, some restriction is prescribed. No proposition to explain or
                    amend a royal or Caroline statute<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Caroline statutes, transmitted by Charles I., and
                    confirmed by convocation, are those only which relate to the hebdomadal meeting,
                    to the nomination of collectors in Lent, to the election of proctors, and to the
                    procuratorial cycle.</p></note> can be received without royal permission. A
                    proposition to enact any other new statute, or explain an old one, must be
                    previously referred to the hebdomadal meeting, which, if it approve the
                    proposition, draws up the terms in which it must be submitted to convocation;
                    and thus, in fact, takes the initiative in every measure.</p>
                <p>In both houses the chancellor or vice-chancellor singly, and the two proctors
                    jointly, are officially invested with an absolute <hi rend="italic"
                    >negative</hi> upon all proceedings, except in elections. When the negative of
                    these officers is not interposed (an interposition nearly as rare as the royal
                    veto in parliament), every question is decided by a majority. All elections,
                    except for members of parliament, are made by a private scrutiny, in which the
                    vice-chancellor presides, and the two proctors are scrutators. The members of
                    parliament are chosen by the vice-chancellor, doctors, regent and non-regent
                    masters, in convocation.</p>
                <p>The Hebdomadal Meeting consists of the vice-chancellor, proctors, and heads of
                    houses, who meet every Monday, and at other times when convened by the
                    vice-chancellor, to deliberate upon all matters relating to the preservation of
                    the privileges and liberties of the university, and to inquire into and consult
                    respecting the due observance of statutes and customs. All letters of the
                    chancellor, in the case of dispensations, which are addressed to convocation,
                    must, previously to a recital in the house, be sanctioned by their
                    approbation.</p>
                <p>The Professorships are of two kinds; those instituted by the crown, and those
                    established by private endowment. The regius professors are appointed by the
                    crown, the others according to the will of the founders. The professors as such
                    have no direct concern with academical instruction or discipline. Attendance on
                    their lectures is not, except in a few merely formal instances, necessary for
                    the attainment either of university rank or college emolument; although, for the
                    purpose of being admitted to holy orders, it is necessary for bachelors of arts
                    to attend the lectures of the regius professor of divinity for a short time,
                    unless they obtain a dispensation. The lectures of professors, therefore, are
                    attended only by voluntary students.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of the professorships, with the date of their foundation,
                    and patronage.</p>

                    bachelor in civil law, or master of arts. He is the secretary of the university,
                    writes letters and addresses on public occasions, presents those on whom the
                    honorary degree of master of arts is to be conferred, and delivers the annual
                    Creweian oration alternately with the professor of poetry.</p>
                <p>Every student admitted to the university is entered on the books of some college
                    or hall. At the time of matriculation, he takes an oath to observe the statutes
                    of the university, or submit to the penalties imposed for their violation, and
                    subscribes his assent to the thirty-nine articles. If there is room for him in
                    the college, he may commence residence immediately on matriculation; but this is
                    not necessarily required of him till three or four terms have elapsed. Lodging
                    in the town is in no case allowed to men under twelve terms standing. There is
                    no difference in respect of priority of degree, admission, &amp;c. between
                    gentlemen commoners and commoners. The only privileges of the former consist in
                    a particular dress, and in a separate table at the college <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=536" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0536-0498"
                    />dinner, with some trifling indulgences in particular colleges. In the case of
                    noblemen, however, and the eldest sons of baronets and knights, the time for
                    taking the first degree is shortened.</p>
                <p>The student, on entering his college, is assigned to the superintendence of some
                    one of the tutors. This, however, in most of the colleges, is little more than a
                    form, as the tutors, who are generally three, four, or five in number, usually
                    divide among themselves the discipline and instruction of the college; and the
                    student is equally under the superintendence of all. The instructions of the
                    tutors are directed solely to the preparation of the students for taking a
                    degree, and consist of catechetical lectures, mixed with reading and discussion,
                    on a portion of some classical or mathematical book in common use at the
                    university examinations. Of these lectures, the students at first generally
                    attend three or four daily. In the colleges which have a considerable number of
                    under-graduates, divinity is usually taught by the dean, and mathematics by a
                    separate tutor; but, with these exceptions, there is not much division of labour
                    between the tutors in the same house. The subjects which form the academical
                    education may be taken indifferently by any. Besides the class lectures, the
                    tutors have from time to time interviews with their pupils separately, for the
                    purpose of ascertaining more exactly their state of preparation for the public
                    examination, consulting with them on the most effectual means of removing their
                    peculiar difficulties, and arranging generally their plans of study. They also
                    prescribe weekly exercises in composition, in Greek, Latin, and English. In this
                    department, however, the college tutors are not the sole labourers. Although
                    recognised neither by the universities, nor by any particular college, a very
                    numerous class has long existed both at Oxford and Cambridge, who, under the
                    denomination of <hi rend="italic">Private Tutors,</hi> superintend and assist
                    the studies of individuals. Without interfering with the operation of the
                    college lectures, they are occupied rather in securing for the student the best
                    use of them, and, in the latter part of his course, in preparing him generally
                    for his public examination. The fee of a <hi rend="italic">private</hi> tutor at
                    Oxford is L.50 a year; at Cambridge, where the academical year is somewhat
                    shorter, L.40. The course of college lectures closes at the end of each term,
                    with a formal examination of the students separately, by the head and tutors.
                    This summing up of the business of the term is called, in the technical language
                    of the place, <hi rend="italic">collections</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >terminals,</hi> and occupies from two days to a week, according to the size of
                    the college or hall.</p>
                <p>According to the statutes, residence and attendance upon the university
                    professors are requisite for all degrees. Students in arts are required to
                    attend the lectures of the professors of that faculty during a period of four
                    years to qualify for bachelor, and during seven to qualify for master; the
                    particular branches for each year being also specified. The present practice,
                    however, is very different; it has already been stated that the professors have
                    been entirely superseded by the college tutors; and although the degrees emanate
                    from them, they have no share whatever in communicating the knowledge which is
                    requisite for their attainment. The degree of B. A. is the only one for which
                    residence is indispensable.</p>
                <p>The academical year is divided into four terms: 1. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Michaelmas,</hi> which extends from the 10th of October to the 17th of
                    December; 2. <hi rend="italic">Hilary,</hi> from the 14th of January to the day
                    before Palm Sunday; 3. <hi rend="italic">Easter,</hi> from the tenth day after
                    Easter Sunday to the day before Whitsunday; 4. <hi rend="italic">Trinity,</hi>
                    from the first Wednesday after Whitsunday to the Saturday after the act, which
                    is always on the first Tuesday in July. The year of academical residence thus
                    includes nearly seven months. The following is the time requisite for obtaining
                    the different degrees.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bachelor of Arts</hi> (B. A.); sixteen terms, for all except
                    the sons and the eldest sons of the eldest sons of peers and peeresses in their
                    own right, baronets, and the eldest sons of baronets and knights, who are
                    admissible to their degree after having completed three years. Of the sixteen
                    terms, however, twelve only are necessary in residence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Master of Arts</hi> (M.A.); twelve terms after admission to a
                    bachelor’s degree. A master of arts becomes a regent after the act subsequent to
                    his degree, and thereby obtains the privilege of voting in convocation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bachelor in the Civil Law</hi> (B. C. L.); three years, to be
                    calculated from the regency. For those who do not pass through acts,
                    twenty-eight terms are necessary, of which seventeen must be in residence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Doctor in the Civil Law</hi> (D. C. L.); five years from the
                    time at which the bachelor’s degree was conferred; shortened to four for those
                    who intend to practise at Doctors Commons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bachelor in Medicine</hi> (Μ. B.); twenty-eight terms after
                    matriculation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Doctor in Medicine</hi> (Μ. D.); three years after taking the
                    bachelor’s degree.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bachelor in Divinity</hi> (B. D.); seven years from the
                    regency.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Doctor in Divinity</hi> (D. D.); four years after taking the
                    bachelor’s degree.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Degrees in Music</hi> are merely honorary; but the performance
                    of some piece of music is required by way of exercise.</p>
                <p>Candidates for the degree of bachelor of arts are required in the sixth or eighth
                    term, unless dispensation be obtained for a later period, to undergo the
                    preliminary examination called <hi rend="italic">responsions;</hi> that is, to
                    answer questions publicly proposed by the masters of the schools.<note

                    proctors, annually, on the first day of Trinity term. The presence of two

                    terms. The public examination comprises, 1. The rudiments of religion, under
                    which head is required a competent knowledge of the gospels in the original
                    Greek; of the history of the Old and New Testament; of the thirty-nine articles
                    of the church of England; and of the evidences of religion, natural and
                    revealed. 2. The <hi rend="italic">Litera humaniores;</hi> under which head is
                    comprised a sufficient acquaintance with the Greek and Latin languages, and
                    ancient history; with rhetoric and poetry; with moral and political science, as
                    derived from the Greek and Roman writers, and illustrated, if necessary, from
                    modern authors; with logic, which is indispensably required from all candidates
                    for the first, second, or third classes; and with Latin and English composition.
                    3. The elements of the mathematical and physical sciences.</p>
                <p>With regard to the examination in some parts of the literae humaniores, and in
                    the elements of the mathematical sciences and of physics, the examiners have a
                    discretionary power; a knowledge of the latter branches not being indispensable.
                    They are however bound to examine all candidates in at least three Greek and
                    Latin classical writers, in logic or the first four books of Euclid, and to
                    ascertain their proficiency in translating from English into Latin. With respect
                    to the rudiments of religion, they possess no discretionary power; and any
                    failure in this part of the examination must preclude the candidate from his
                    degree, without regard to any other attainments.</p>
                <p>Such are the acquirements necessary to enable a student to obtain a degree. Those
                    who aspire to “honours” are required to embrace a wider field, and are subjected
                    to a more strict examination, which lasts three or four days. The candidate for
                    honours may attain them either in classical literature and moral philosophy <hi
                    rend="italic">(in literis humanioribus),</hi> or in mathematics (<hi
                    rend="italic">in disciplinis mathematicis et physicis),</hi> or in both. As a
                    preliminary condition, he must however satisfy the examiners of his proficiency
                    in divinity, though he is not in general subjected to a severer trial than those
                    who merely present themselves for a common degree. The candidate for
                    mathematical honours must, in the first instance, “pass” in classics. The
                    candidate for classical honours is allowed to choose his own books for
                    examination, which generally amount to fourteen or sixteen. Among those most
                    commonly chosen are, Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Sophocles, Horace, Virgil, and
                    Aristotle’s Rhetoric and Ethics. To these some add, according to their
                    inclination, Aristotle’s Poetics, Lucretius, or a scientific dialogue of Cicero,
                    part of Homer or Pindar, or Aeschylus, some plays of Aristophanes; and some few
                    take a selection from the orators, or from Polybius or Tacitus. The necessary
                    extent of knowledge in mathematics and physics, though inferior to that which is
                    required at Cambridge, embraces geometry, algebra, Newton’s Principia,
                    mechanics, hydrostatics, astronomy, and optics. The examinations are conducted
                    principally by means of printed papers.</p>
                <p>When the examinations are concluded, the names of those who have honourably
                    distinguished themselves, by passing a good examination in a wider range than
                    that necessary for a mere degree, are distributed in alphabetical order into
                    four classes, under the two divisions of <hi rend="italic">literae
                    humaniores</hi> and <hi rend="italic">disciplina mathematicae et</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=537"

                    gives the <hi rend="italic">number,</hi> without mentioning the names, of those
                    w ho, though they have obtained their <hi rend="italic">testimonium,</hi> are
                    not deemed worthy of any honourable distinction. Printed copies of the schedule
                    containing these classes are sent to the chancellor, vice-chancellor, the heads
                    of houses, the proctors, and to the refectory and common room of each college
                    and hall. The examinations for fellowships, scholarships, &amp;c., are conducted
                    in the same manner as those for honours, with this exception, that mathematical
                    knowledge generally goes for little in college competitions for fellowships,
                    unless the college should chance to be in want of a tutor in that
                    department.</p>
                <p>The examiners for degrees are, seven masters of arts, four in classics and three
                    in mathematics, who are appointed by the vice-chancellor and proctors, subject
                    to the approval of congregation and convocation.</p>
                <p>Degrees in the civil law and medicine are merely nominal honours, and are not
                    conferred on special examination; but they can only be obtained by those who
                    have passed a bachelor’s examination in arts. For degrees in divinity,
                    attendance on divinity lectures is requisite. There are, besides, disputations
                    and exercises enjoined by statute for all the higher degrees, the performance of
                    which is little more than nominal.</p>
                <p>The expenses of an under-graduate vary so materially, according to the taste and
                    habits of each individual, that it is impossible to present any satisfactory
                    statement of them. The whole expenditure, exclusive of a private tutor’s fee, an
                    expense which is incurred only by those who are preparing for honours, of such
                    commoners as live on the most economical scale, has been estimated from L.200 to
                    L.250 a year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>M’Culloch’s Stat. Acct. ii. 341.</p></note> The ordinary college account,
                    including university and college fees of all kinds, boarding, lodging, washing,
                    coals, and servants, varies from L.6O to L.100 at different colleges, for
                    commoners, and from L.30 to L 40 more for gentlemen commoners. The students dine
                    together in the college hall, sitting at different tables according to their
                    ranks and degrees. Their remaining meals are taken in their own rooms. The
                    university, as a corporation, possesses very little property except the
                    libraries and public buildings; and of these the most important have been raised
                    either by the munificence of individuals or by public subscription. The estates
                    which have been bequeathed to it have been appropriated either to the endowment
                    of certain professorships, or to the augmentation of the libraries.</p>

                <p> UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.</p>
                <p>It is probable that Cambridge first became a seat of education in the seventh
                    century, when, according to Bede, Sigebert, king of the East Angles, with the
                    assistance of Bishop Felix, instituted in his kingdom a school for learning, in
                    imitation of those which he had seen during his exile in France.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bede, Eccles. Hist. Gent.
                    Ang). lib. iii. cap. 18, at cited by Dyer, Hist. of the University of Cambridge,
                    vol. i. p. 47.</p></note> This school is supposed to have been fixed at
                    Cambridge, which then bore the name of Cairgrant, and was one of the most
                    celebrated towns in Britain, though the fact is not asserted by Bede. How long
                    the school thus founded continued to flourish, we are not informed; but the
                    complaint of Alfred that, in his youth, when he had leisure to be instructed, he
                    could not find teachers, would lead to the inference that in his time no public
                    seminaries existed. The merit of restoring, or probably of founding, the school
                    which formed the nucleus of the future university, is ascribed to Edward the
                    Elder, son of Alfred; who appears, from the chronicle of Hyde Abbey, to have
                    erected, “at his own expense, halls for the students, and chairs and seats for
                    the doctors at the same time appointing teachers, and adopting other necessary
                    measures, which seemed to secure the stability of the institution.<note

                    Britain, ii. 360.</p></note> The importance of the town, however, rendered it
                    liable to numerous vicissitudes, and exposed it to the ravages of the Danes and
                    Saxons. In the year 1010 it was burnt and plundered by the Danes; and towards
                    the end of the eleventh century, William the Conqueror destroyed a part of it,
                    to make room for the fortress which he found it necessary to erect for the
                    purpose of overawing the refractory monks of Ely. In all these reverses of
                    fortune the scholastic establishments had their full share.</p>
                <p>The reign of the succeeding monarch was not more favourable to the tranquillity
                    of the town, and the schools were therefore for some time abandoned. Henry L,
                    who is said to have been educated at Cambridge, conferred on the town some
                    valuable privileges, and induced the wandering students to return to their
                    former dwellings. In his reign (1109) Joffrid, abbot of Croyland, “sent to his
                    manor of Cottenham, near Cambridge, Gislebert, his fellow-monk, and professor of
                    divinity, with three other monks who had followed him into England. These being
                    well versed in philosophy and other sciences, went daily to Cambridge, and
                    having hired a public barn, made open profession of their sciences, and in a
                    little time collected a great concourse of scholars. In the second year after
                    their arrival, the number of their scholars from the town and country increased
                    so much, that there was no house, barn, or church capable of containing them.
                    For this reason they separated into different parts of the town, imitating the
                    plan of the university of Orleans.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    building is still pointed out as the representative of the barn in which these
                    missionaries taught. The number of students continued to increase, and the
                    school gradually acquired celebrity, till 1174, when nearly the whole town was
                    consumed by a fire “so merciless,” says Fuller, “that it only stopped for want
                    of fuel to feed its fury.” From this disaster the seminary appears to have
                    speedily revived; and, in 1209, it received an accession of numbers from Oxford,
                    in consequence of an act of severity on the part of King John, which has been
                    already alluded to. This, according to Mr Hallam.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mid. Ages, iii. 527, note.</p></note> is the
                    earliest authentic mention of Cambridge as a place of learning; though he admits
                    the reasonableness of the conjecture, that the Oxford scholars would not have
                    removed to a town so distant, if it had not already been the seat of academical
                    instruction. Cambridge was not yet permitted to enjoy the tranquillity which is
                    indispensable for the successful prosecution of study. In the year 1215, during
                    the contentions between King John and his barons, the town was laid waste; and
                    it shared the same fate afterwards in the civil war under Henry III. Previously
                    to this last disaster, the king had extended his patronage to the rising
                    seminary, in consequence of some of the Parisian scholars who had accepted his
                    invitation having settled there, and had by public letters confirmed the
                    authority of the academical officers, and checked the disorders which from time
                    to time manifested themselves. In these remote times the students lodged in the
                    houses of the citizens, or in halls or inns hired of them, under the
                    superintendence of principals, who were responsible to the chancellor for the
                    conduct of their pupils.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    disputes between the scholars and townsmen, and drew from the king in 1231 a
                    public letter ordaining that lodgings or hostels <hi rend="italic"
                    >(hospitia)</hi> “should be taxed according to the custom of the university,
                    namely, by two masters, and two respectable and lawful men of the town, and let
                    to the scholars according to their valuation." This order was repeated in
                    letters patent of the same king, with the addition that the valuation should be
                    renewed every five years.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The most important of the public instruments of Henry III. relative to the
                    university, besides those already mentioned, are, his letter addressed to the
                    sheriff of the county <hi rend="italic">(vicecomes)</hi>, calling upon him “to
                    repress the insubordination of the clerks and scholars, and to enforce obedience
                    to the injunctions of the bishop of Ely, either by imprisonment or banishment
                    from the university, according to the discretion of the chancellor and masters
                    his letter to the bishop of Ely, ordering that “clerks who were contumacious and
                    rebellious against the chancellor should be imprisoned or banished from the town
                    and his letter addressed to the sheriff, in the 26th year of his reign, in which
                    it is ordered that “when any clerk of the university of scholars studying at
                    Cambridge, has been guilty of any misdemeanour, and has been convicted by the
                    university, and sentenced to imprisonment, if the burgesses of the town are
                    negligent in carrying the sentence into effect, or are unable to do so, the
                    sheriff, on the warrant of the chancellor, is to cause such malefactor to be
                    committed to prison, and kept in safe custody, until the chancellor demand his
                    liberation.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>' Dyer’s

                    these documents is singular; the authority of the bishop of Ely, as diocesan, is
                    distinctly recognised; but delinquents are to be tried by the chancellor and
                    masters, and the civil power of the sheriff is necessary to carry their sentence
                    into execution. It likewise appears from what has already been stated, that
                    Cambridge, though not yet incorporated, was recognised as a university,<note

                    to Cambridge in a public instrument of 1223. Mr Hallam (Mid. Ages, iii. 527,

                    any of this monarch. It is probable, therefore, that Mr Hallam has mistaken <pb

                    undoubtedly authentic, or any which preceded him, that are of doubtful
                    authority, they all suppose the existence of a university, but say nothing of
                    its creation: nor, indeed, from the meaning of the word, does it seem to have
                    been necessary; the word was previously in use, and suited to a literary as well
                    as any other body: so it was insensibly adopted, without annexing to the term

                    royal enactment of the forty-fifth of Henry III. (1260), prohibiting “the king’s
                    justices from interfering in hearing and determining offences between scholars
                    and laymen;” meaning by the latter term those who were not scholars.<note

                <p>The royal support thus given to the university was not sufficient to check the
                    spirit of insubordination among the scholars, or to prevent them from engaging
                    in frequent conflicts with the townsmen. On one occasion the students from the
                    north and south, arranged in opposite sides, espoused the cause of two of their
                    countrymen who had quarrelled, and proceeding from words to blows, threw the
                    university and town into the utmost disorder. The chancellor interfered, but
                    academical authority was too weak; and the townsmen who were called to his aid,
                    mixing in the fray, contributed only to increase the confusion. Public plunder,
                    burning of records, and every species of horror ensued. The king sent a delegate
                    to inquire into the disputes, and to cause summary justice to be executed on
                    some of the delinquents. Sixteen of the townsmen were hanged, and others
                    belonging both to the university and town took refuge in the religious houses,
                    or were committed to the common gaol. By this means peace was restored; but many
                    of the scholars retired to Northampton, where they were allowed by the king to
                    form themselves into a literary society.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    university’ during their continuance, but gave rise to animosities which did not
                    easily subside. To remove this impediment to learning, Henry III. issued letters
                    patent, which were confirmed by Edward II.,, forbidding any tournament from

                    violence, which led to the destruction of the charters of the university, and

                    suppressed by the bishop of Norwich, and the principal leaders were punished.
                    The mayor was deprived of his office, and the liberties of the town were
                    declared forfeited, and bestowed on the vice-chancellor, in whom they were
                    vested till the reign of Henry VIII. when the corporation was restored, though
                    several of its former privileges were retained by the university.</p>
                <p>The university obtained its first formal charter of privileges from Edward I. in
                    the twentieth year of his reign (1291). This charter, besides confirming the
                    letters of Henry III. and the Composition, conferred upon the university some
                    new privileges, among which was one, that no one imprisoned by order of the
                    chancellor should be liberated by the mayor and bailiffs under pretext of a
                    king’s brief formerly issued.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    in the beginning of their reigns, as we have already found to be the case with
                    the university of Oxford. By these charters the university obtained the control
                    over victuallers of all sorts, with power to punish <hi rend="italic"

                    relating to laws, letting of houses, &amp;c., were made cognisable before the
                    vice-chancellor or his commissary. The jurisdiction of this officer was extended
                    to all cases, whether civil or criminal, except those of mayhem and felony, in
                    which one of the parties was a master or scholar. the assize of bread, wine, and
                    beer, with the supervision of weights and measures, which had formerly belonged
                    to the magistrates of the town, were exclusively lodged in the university; and
                    for these privileges the university was to pay into the exchequer a yearly
                    tribute of ten pounds. The mayor and bailiffs of the tow n were sworn every
                    year, before the vice-chancellor, to keep the peace of the university.</p>

                    and was less exposed than the sister university to ecclesiastical interference
                    at home. When Edward' II., in the tenth year of his reign (1316), granted to the
                    university a charter containing some additional privileges, he solicited a
                    confirmation of them from the papal see. A bull was accordingly issued at
                    Avignon, by John XXII., in the second year of his pontificate (1318), which,
                    after confirming the privileges conferred by former popes and former kings of
                    England, ordains “that there shall be thenceforth at Cambridge a <hi

                    there; and that the college and masters of the said <hi rend="italic"

                    any university whatsoever, lawfully established, can and ought to enjoy.”<note

                <p>We have already seen that the jurisdiction of the bishop of Ely, as bishop of the
                    diocese, was in ancient times distinctly acknowledged; but it was soon limited,
                    partly by the concessions of the bishops themselves, and partly by papal
                    authority. Hugh Balsham, the founder of St Peter’s College, disclaimed (1275),
                    by a public letter, any intention of derogating from the privileges of the
                    university, or disturbing the jurisdiction of the chancellor, but required all
                    suits to be brought before the chancellor in the first instance, restricting
                    himself to receiving appeals. In the following year the same bishop limited the
                    jurisdiction of his archdeacon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    thirty-sixth year of the same reign, letters patent were granted, by which the
                    scholars were protected from being summoned out of the university into any
                    ecclesiastical court; and appeals to any ecclesiastical court whatever were
                    prohibited in cases cognisable by the chancellor. These immunities were
                    confirmed by royal letters to the bishop of Ely in the 15th of Richard II.<note

                    This confirmation was however dispensed with by a bull of Boniface IX. in 1401;
                    and in 1430, Pope Martin V. appointed a commission to inquire whether the
                    university by grant or custom was subject to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of
                    the chancellor, and exempted from that of <hi rend="italic">all others;</hi>
                    empowering his delegates, if they should find it so, to confirm by his authority
                    that jurisdiction and exemption, which was accordingly done. The sentence of the
                    delegates was ratified by a bull of Eugenius IV. in 1433. The university was
                    thus relieved from the jurisdiction of the bishop of the diocese, but not from
                    that of the archbishop of the province. Two examples of metropolitan visitation
                    are recorded, the one in 1309, and the other in 1401; but in neither case does
                    the archbishop appear to have acted on his own authority. Mr Dyer<note

                    73.</p></note> shows that the former visitation was undertaken by the authority
                    of letters patent from the king. The proceedings of the latter, which had
                    special reference to the heresy of Wycliffe, were confirmed by act of
                    parliament. The right of visitation and inspection is vested in the
                    sovereign.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Henry V. the university obtained two remarkable privileges. The
                    one was a public statute, ordaining that none should practise the art of
                    medicine except those admitted in the universities, and approved by them;
                    offenders were to be punished at the discretion of the privy council. The other
                    was a mandate from the archbishop, granted with the consent of the prelates of
                    his province, that patrons should bestow ecclesiastical benefices only on
                    graduates and students of the university. Some additional privileges were
                    conferred by Edward IV. and Henry VII. The changes which took place in the
                    religion of the state during the four succeeding reigns affected considerably
                    the internal arrangements and prosperity of the university. Queen Elizabeth, in
                    the third year of her reign, granted to it an extensive charter; and by the act
                    of parliament 13 Eliz. c. 29, for the incorporation of the two English
                    universities, this and all preceding grants from Henry III. downwards were
                    confirmed, and the university was declared to be incorporated by the name of the
                    “Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars.”</p>
                <p>Our materials do not enable us to give so minute an account of the collegiate
                    foundations of Cambridge, and of other religious houses for the residence of
                    students, as we have already given respecting those of Oxford. In the early part
                    of the thirteenth century, the halls or hostels are said to have been very
                    numerous, and to have been crowded with students. This is indeed implied in the
                    public letters of Henry III.; and it would appear from the terms of the
                    Composition, that the <hi rend="italic">hospitia,</hi> to which it referred,
                    were liable to fluctuation and change. The principal houses were those of St
                    Mary, St Bernard, St Thomas, and St Augustin, assigned to artists; and St
                    Paulinus, St Nicholas, St Clement, and Hovens, to students of the civil and
                    canon law. Several of these houses were at length deserted, and sunk into decay;
                    others, being purchased by patrons of literature, and obtaining charters of
                    incorporation, are represented by the present colleges. Caius says there had
                    been twenty hostels, of which seventeen remained in his time.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dyer’s Hist. i. 60 and
                    63.</p></note> Of the existing colleges, Peter-house, or St Peter’s College, was
                    founded so early as 1257; five were incorporated during the succeeding century,
                    four in the fifteenth, six in the sixteenth, and one, Downing College, so late
                    as 1800. The term <hi rend="italic">hall</hi> is not applied, as at Oxford, to
                    houses without endowment, but is used indiscriminately with <hi rend="italic"
                    >college.</hi></p>
                <p>The university of Cambridge is incorporated (13 Eliz. c. 29) by the name of the
                    “Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge,” and consists
                    of seventeen colleges, or societies, devoted to the study of learning and
                    science. Each college is a body corporate, bound by its own statutes, but is
                    likewise controlled by the paramount laws of the university, each furnishing
                    members both for the legislative and executive government of the whole. The
                    statutes of Elizabeth are the foundation of the existing government, and form
                    the basis of all the subsequent legislation; indeed no grace of the senate is
                    considered valid which is inconsistent with these statutes, and certain nearly
                    contemporary interpretations of them, or with king’s letters, which have been
                    accepted and acted on by the university. The principal officers of the
                    university have nearly the same offices and titles as at Oxford; namely, the
                    chancellor, high steward, vice-chancellor, public orator, two proctors, a
                    librarian, two taxers (who regulate the markets, assize of bread, &amp;c.),
                    professors and public lecturers, two scrutators, &amp;c. There are also two
                    officers peculiar to Cambridge, styled moderators,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The moderators were first appointed in 1680.
                    Monk’s Life of Bentley, 11.</p></note> who are deputies of the proctors, and
                    whose office it is to superintend the exercises and disputations in philosophy,
                    and the examinations previous to the degree of bachelor of arts. There are,
                    besides, a commissary, who is an officer under the chancellor, and an assessor,
                    whose duty it is to assist the vice-chancellor in his court. The chancellor is
                    always a nobleman, and is elected by the senate. His office is biennial, or
                    tenable for a longer period by the consent of the university. The other officers
                    are elected nearly in the same manner as at Oxford.</p>
                <p>The business of the university is conducted by the Senate, which consists of two
                    Houses, denominated the Upper or Regent House, and the Lower or Non Regent
                    House. All masters of arts, or doctors in one or other of the faculties of
                    divinity, civil law, or physic, having their names upon the college-boards,
                    holding any university office, or being resident in the town of Cambridge, are
                    members of the senate. Masters of arts of less than five years’ standing, and
                    doctors of less than two, compose the regent or upper house, or, as it is
                    otherwise called, the <hi rend="italic">white, hood</hi> house, from the members
                    wearing their hoods lined with white silk. Masters of arts of more than five
                    years’ standing, but who have not advanced to the degree of doctor, constitute
                    the nonregent or lower house, otherwise called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >black-hood</hi> house, its members wearing black silk hoods. But doctors of
                    more than two years’ standing, with the public orator, may vote in either house,
                    according to their pleasure.</p>
                <p>Besides the two houses, there is a council called the Caput, chosen annually on
                    the 12th of October, by which every university grace must be approved before it
                    can be introduced in the senate. The caput consists of the vice-chancellor, a
                    doctor in each of the faculties of divinity, civil law, and physic, and two
                    masters of arts, who represent the regent and non regent houses. The
                    vice-chancellor is a member of the caput by virtue of his office; the other
                    members are chosen in the following manner: the vice-chancellor and the two
                    proctors severally nominate five persons properly qualified for the trust, and
                    out of the fifteen the heads of colleges, doctors, and scrutators, choose five.
                    The vice-chancellor’s list is, in general, honoured with the appointment. A few
                    days before the beginning of each term, the vice-chancellor publishes a list of
                    the days on which a Congregation or assembly of the senate will be held for
                    transacting university business; but in case of emergency, the vice-chancellor
                    summons a congregation for the despatch of extraordinary affairs. Any number of
                    members of the senate, not less than twenty-five, and including the proper
                    officers who are obliged to be present, constitutes a con-gregntion<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=541"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0541-0503"/>, and may proceed to business. There are also
                    statutable congregations, or days of assembling enjoined by the statutes, for
                    the ordinary routine of university affairs, such as conferring degrees, electing
                    officers, &amp;c. Every member has a right to present any proposition, or grace,
                    to the consideration of the senate; but previously to its being voted upon by
                    the two houses, it must be approved by the caput, each member of which has a <hi
                    rend="italic">negative</hi> voice. After a grace has passed the caput, it is
                    read in the nonregent house by the senior scrutator, and also in the
                    regent-house by the senior proctor, and the congregation is prorogued by the
                    vice-chancellor. It is read in like manner at the second congregation; and if a
                    <hi rend="italic">non placet</hi> is put in by a member of the non-regent house,
                    it is there voted; and if the number of <hi rend="italic">non-placets</hi> is
                    equal to or exceeds that of the <hi rend="italic">placets</hi>, the grace is
                    thrown out, and can proceed no farther. But if the <hi rend="italic"
                    >placet,</hi> exceed the <hi rend="italic">non placets,</hi> it is carried up to
                    the regent-house, where it undergoes the same process; and if it passes through
                    both houses, it is considered a regular act of the senate. No degree is ever
                    conferred without a grace for that purpose; those for bachelors of arts,
                    honorary degrees, and masters of arts of King’s College excepted, which require
                    to be read at one congregation only. A grace in this instance is termed a
                    Supplicat, and is signed by the praelector of the college to which the candidate
                    belongs, the subscriber being made responsible for the assertion which it
                    contains. An assembly of the senate held out of term-time is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">Convocation;</hi> in which case a grace is immediately passed to
                    convert the convocation into a congregation, when the business proceeds in the
                    ordinary manner.</p>
                <p>The Professors, as at Oxford, are not directly concerned in the public education
                    of the university. Many of them deliver courses of lectures, which are in
                    general better attended and more celebrated than those in the sister university;
                    but these are on branches of learning or science of recent growth, and not on
                    subjects included in the ancient and regular studies of the place. Attendance on
                    their lectures is in no way required, nor does the university take cognisance of
                    it. This rule is subject to two exceptions; students proceeding to the lower
                    degrees in the civil law and medicine, are required to present testimonials of
                    attendance on the lectures of particular professors. The professors are paid
                    from various sources, some from the university-chest, others by the government,
                    or from estates left for that purpose. Education is conducted entirely by the
                    tutors of the various colleges, assisted, as at Oxford, by private tutors. The
                    annual income of the university arises from various sources. The rectory of
                    Burwell, and a farm al Barton, produce about L.1000 per annum; the produce of
                    fees at matriculations, for degrees, &amp;c. averages about L 2000; and the
                    trading profits of the university press, arising chiefly from its share in the
                    monopoly of printing Bibles, is supposed to be about L.2000. The whole income
                    from every source is believed scarcely to exceed L.5500 per annum. The funds are
                    managed by the vice-chancellor, or by specific trustees, and the accounts are
                    examined annually by three auditors appointed by the senate.</p>

                <p>“The organization of the collegiate bodies, and their rules of government, at
                    Cambridge, vary from those of Oxford only in a few unessential particulars. The
                    three ranks of independent under-graduates in the former university are
                    noblemen, fellow-commoners (so called originally from having their commons, or
                    college dinner, at the same table with the fellows), and pensioners. With
                    respect to the discipline and government of those in <hi rend="italic">statu
                    pupillari,</hi> it is to be observer), that students at Cambridge do not
                    subscribe to the thirty-nine articles either at matriculation or afterwards;
                    although, on taking their degree of B A., they are obliged to sign a declaration
                    of adherence to the Church of England. Lodging in college is not enforced on
                    under-graduates if there be not room within the walls of the building to
                    accommodate them. It is chiefly to this circumstance that the great increase of
                    students at Cambridge of late years is to be attributed, the members of the
                    other university being necessarily limited by the amount of room for lodging
                    them. With regard to members on the foundation, the scholars of most colleges at
                    Cambridge, being generally elected by free competition from among the
                    undergraduate members, form rather a distinguished class among the students,
                    than a body distinct from the independent members, and chosen without free
                    competition, as is generally the case al Oxford. A distinction exists between
                    two different classes of fellowships in most houses at Cambridge, which is only
                    partially known at Oxford; viz. between the foundation-fellowships, and what are
                    termed the bye-fellowships and appropriated fellowships; the former being part
                    of the original endowments, and generally open to all the world; the latter,
                    founded by subsequent donations, and frequently limited by local and other
                    restrictions. In most colleges, the governing body is composed of the
                    foundation-fellows only; and they alone are eligible to college office. It has
                    been already staled, that the general usage, at Cambridge, is for each college
                    to elect its fellows from among its own members, whether scholars or
                    independent: the chief exceptions to this rule occur in the small colleges, when
                    they are in want of some individual to fill the office of tutor, and no
                    satisfactory candidate presents himself in their own number.</p>
                <p>“In general, it may be said that the Cambridge system is less strict in point of
                    external discipline, and the under-graduates under rather less close control,
                    than at the sister university; on the other hand, that emulation and close
                    attention to study are more favoured and encouraged. All the regulations, both
                    of the colleges and university, tend in this direction. Open competition, and
                    rank according to merit, form the cardinal principles of the academical
                    constitution, as far as it relates to students."<note anchored="true"

                    Lent, and Easter, and includes nearly seven months. The mode of admission on the
                    boards of a college is either by a personal examination before the tutors and
                    officers, or through a recommendatory certificate, specifying the age,
                    qualifications, <hi rend="italic">fee.</hi> of the candidate, signed by a master
                    of arts of the university, and accompanied by a deposit called
                    caution-money.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>' The
                    caution-money for a nobleman is L.50; for a fellow-commoner, L.25; for a
                    pensioner. L.15; and for a sizar, L.10. This money remains in the hands of the
                    tutor or sponsor and is not returned till a person takes his name off the
                    boards.</p></note> This is generally done before the end of Easter term; and if
                    the certificate be deemed satisfactory, the name is at once entered on the
                    boards of the college, and the student usually comes into residence about the
                    20th of October following, when the academical year begins. The following are
                    the principal regulations necessary for proceeding to degrees.</p>
                <p>The distinguishing characteristic of this university has, for nearly two
                    centuries, been the pursuit of mathematical studies, and of those branches of
                    natural philosophy which depend on them. To these the lectures, both public and
                    private, are chiefly devoted, and thus present to the student the only means by
                    which he can attain the honours and emoluments either of the university or of
                    his college. The study of classical literature, which is now prosecuted to an
                    extent not inferior to that in the sister university, is of comparatively recent
                    introduction. Original composition forms no part of the examination for honours,
                    but it is made a leading feature in the competition for scholarships and other
                    prizes.</p>

                <p>The system of public examinations which is pursued at Cambridge differs in many
                    respects from that which prevails at Oxford; and as these examinations are
                    intended to exhibit the result of the academical instruction, a short account of
                    them will couvey to the reader a pretty correct notion of its merits. The
                    examinations take place in the Lent team of each year, and are conducted by the
                    moderators, and by examiners appointed by the senate. It may be premised, that
                    the course of study preparatory to the degree of B. A. is comprehended under the
                    three heads of Natural Philosophy, Theology and Moral Philosophy, and the Belles
                    Lettres The first comprises Euclids Elements, the principles of algebra, plane
                    and spherical trigonometry, conic sections, mechanics, hydrostatics, optics,
                    astronomy, fluxions, Newton’s Principia, Increments, &amp;c.; the second,
                    Beausobre’s Introduction, Doddridge’s und Paley’s Evidences, the Greek
                    Testament, Butler’s Analogy, Paley’s Moral Philosophy, Locke’s Essay, and
                    Duncan’s Logic; and the third comprehends the most celebrated Greek and Latin
                    classics. The under-graduates are examined in their respective colleges yearly
                    or half-yearly, on the subjects of their studies; and, according to the manner
                    in which they acquit themselves in these examinations, their names are arranged
                    in classes, and those who obtain the honour of a place in the first class
                    receive prizes according to merit.</p>
                <p>The first university or “previous” examination (technically called the “little
                    go)” takes place in the Lent term of the second year from that in which the
                    student commences his academical residence, and is conducted by four examiners
                    appointed by the senate. The subjects of examination are one of the four
                    Gospels, or the Acts of the Apostles, in the original Greek, Paley’s Evidences
                    of Christianity, and one of the Greek and one of the Latin classics. Every
                    student is required to translate some portion of each of the subjects appointed,
                    to construe and explain passages of the same, and to answer printed questions
                    relating to the evidences of Christianity. After the examination, the students
                    are arranged in two classes; those who have passed with credit, and those to
                    whom the examiners have only not refused their certificate of approval. Rejected
                    candidates are required to attend the examination of the following year. A
                    certificate of having passed this examination is indispensable for proceeding to
                    the degrees of B. A., Μ. B., and B. C. L.</p>
                <p>The student has next to perform the usual exercises required by the statutes for
                    his degree; or, in academical language, to keep an Act under a moderator. This
                    exercise, which at Oxford has almost fallen into disuse, is performed at
                    Cambridge only by those who aspire to university honours.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By special composition between the university
                    and King’s College, its under-graduates do not keep any public exercises in the
                    schools, nor are they in any way examined for the bachelor of arts
                    degree.</p></note> In the Lent term of his third year, the moderator or examiner
                    gives notice to a student that he is to keep an act, who thereupon writes three
                    questions, which he proposes to maintain and defend. The first question is
                    always from Newton’s Principia, the second from some other mathematical work,
                    and the third from some moral or metaphysical writer. The moderator, on
                    receiving these, nominates three students, whose attainments, he thinks, will
                    enable them to prepare arguments on the other side. On the day appointed, the
                    moderator having taken his chair, the candidate for the degree, who is termed
                    the <hi rend="italic">respondent,</hi> reads a Latin thesis, usually on the
                    third subject; after which the others, styled <hi rend="italic">opponents,</hi>
                    propose their arguments, in syllogistic form, against the several positions, the
                    discussion being conducted in Latin. If the respondent can answer them, he does
                    so; if not, the moderator endeavours, by questioning him, to ascertain from what
                    defect in his knowledge this arises. Each opponent, as he is dismissed, is also
                    questioned by the moderator.</p>
                <p>To check the practice of “degrading,” or postponing for a year, the degree of B.
                    A., which had become common among the students, a statute was enacted in 1829,
                    by which degraders are not allowed to present themselves for university
                    scholarships, or any other academical honours, without special permission.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Senate-House Examination</hi> also takes place in the Lent
                    term, when all the men of the same year, except those who have degraded, are
                    brought into competition at the same time. The questionists,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Questionist</hi> is the name given to a student during the last six weeks of
                    preparation for taking his degree.</p></note> or candidates for the degree of B.
                    A., are divided into six classes, determined by the “exercises” in the schools
                    of the preceding year, and sometimes by the report of their college tutors. The
                    first four classes include those who are candidates for honours; those of the
                    two remaining classes are applicants merely for the degree.</p>
                <p>The examination of candidates for mathematical honours, technically called the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Tripos,</hi> is confined to mathematics and the
                    cognate sciences, with subsidiary questions in divinity, logic, and moral
                    philosophy. It lasts eight days, the first five of which are devoted entirely to
                    mathematics, the time of examination for each day being five hours and a half.
                    During the first four days the same questions are proposed to all the classes;
                    on the fifth a distinction is made in this respect between the first and last
                    two. The examination on the first day extends only to such parts of pure
                    mathematics and natural philosophy as do not require the method of the
                    differential calculus. On the second and third days, the questions from books
                    include, in addition to the above subjects, the parts of natural philosophy
                    somewhat more advanced, and the simpler application of the calculus. The fourth
                    day’s examination extends to subjects of greater difficulty, care however being
                    taken that there be some questions suitable for the lower classes. On the fifth
                    day the classes are arranged according to a settled plan, when the questions
                    proposed to all the classes are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=543" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0543-0505"
                    />fixed upon by the moderators and examiners in common; but the duty of
                    examining the answers to the questions is apportioned among the moderators and
                    examiners, as the plan directs. On the sixth day the four classes are examined
                    in logic, moral philosophy, and divinity. The mathematical examination is
                    resumed on the seventh day; and on the following morning are published the
                    classifications or <hi rend="italic">brackets,</hi> arranged according to the
                    order of merit, and each containing, alphabetically, those who have shown
                    themselves nearly equal. Those between whom the examiners cannot assign a
                    difference of merit are <hi rend="italic">bracketed</hi> as equals. At the close
                    of the examinations, a select number, thirty at least, of those who have most
                    distinguished themselves, are recommended to the proctors for their approbation,
                    and their names are set down according to merit, and classed in three divisions,
                    viz. wranglers, senior optimes, and junior optimes, which constitute the three
                    orders of honour. The highest of all is the senior wrangler for the year, “the
                    greatest of English academical honours.”</p>
                <p>The examination of the questionists of the fifth and sixth classes, who are not
                    candidates for honours, is conducted differently. The subjects and exercises
                    proposed are the same for all, and embrace Euclid’s Elements, arithmetic, and
                    algebra, with some of the elementary parts of natural philosophy; Homer and
                    Virgil,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The portions of
                    Homer and Virgil required in this examination are the first six books of the
                    Iliad and Aeneid.</p></note> including questions in grammar, history, and
                    geography; Paley’s Evidences, and Locke’s Essay. Of the six examiners, two
                    confine themselves to mathematics, two to classics, and two to moral philosophy.
                    The examination lasts six days, and is conducted entirely by printed papers. The
                    questions proposed are of an elementary character, and presuppose very moderate
                    attainments on the part of the questionists. The examiners are strictly enjoined
                    to take care that the number of the questions to be answered, and the length of
                    the passages to be translated, in any one paper, do not exceed what a person
                    well prepared may be expected to answer and translate in the time allowed. The
                    names of the candidates comprehended in these two classes are also arranged
                    numerically according to merit, but are not published in the calendar.</p>
                <p>The candidates are then required to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy,
                    and to observe the statutes of the university; and having also subscribed that
                    they are <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> members of the Church of England, are
                    admitted to their degrees by the vice-chancellor.</p>
                <p>In addition to the examination thus described, there is also an examination in
                    classical learning, or a <hi rend="italic">Classical Tripot,</hi> which takes
                    place on the fourth Monday after the general admission to the bachelor’s degree,
                    and continues five days. It is a voluntary competition, to which those only who
                    have obtained mathematical honours are admissible. Translations are required of
                    passages selected from the best Greek and Latin authors, with written answers to
                    questions arising immediately out of the passages; but no original composition
                    either in Greek or Latin. The names of those bachelors who pass this examination
                    with credit are arranged in three classes according to their respective
                    merits.</p>
                <p>Besides the honour of occupying a high place in the lrip09 lists, Cambridge holds
                    out to the ambitious student many strong inducements to exertion, in the prizes
                    which are annually submitted for competition. Those to which the greatest degree
                    of importance is attached are <hi rend="italic">Smith’s Prizes</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chancellor’s Medals.</hi> The former are assigned to two
                    commencing bachelors of arts, for proficiency in mathematics and natural
                    philosophy; and as the competition takes place soon after the mathematical
                    tripos, the adjudication of them forms a severe test of the accuracy of the
                    previous decision. It sometimes happens that the judgment of the tripos
                    examiners is reversed, and the second wrangler becomes first prizeman. The
                    chancellor’s medals are given to two commencing bachelors of arts, who must be
                    senior optimes at least in classical merit. For these there is also a separate
                    competition, but it generally happens that the first medal is gained by the
                    person whose name is at the head of the classical tripos.</p>

                <p>The following statistical information relating to the universities of Oxford,
                    Cambridge, and Dublin, was communicated to the meeting of the British
                    Association for the Advancement of Science, at Newcastle, in August 1838, by the
                    Rev. H. L. Jones.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Journal of the Statistical Society of London, vol. i. pp.
                    385-397.</p></note> The books used by Mr Jones in compiling his tables were the
                    Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin University Calendars; besides which, private
                    information was relied on in determining the value of fellowships, the number of
                    students resident, &amp;c, points on which the Calendars are silent. In cases of
                    doubt, care was taken to make the estimate below what was believed to be the
                    real value. We can only give the general abstract of Mr Jones’ tables.</p>

                <p> UNIVERSITY of LONDON.</p>
                <p>The university of London was constituted by a royal charter, dated the 28th of
                    November 1836, which confers on it the power of granting degrees in arts, law,
                    and medicine, under regulations to be determined by the university, subject to
                    the approval of the secretary of state. By a second charter, dated 5th December
                    1837, some of the powers granted in the first were modified, and two new members
                    of senate were named. the objects proposed to be effected by the institution, as
                    stated in the charter, are “the advancement of religion and morality, and the
                    promotion of useful knowledge,” by holding forth “to all classes and
                    denominations” of persons, without religious distinction, “encouragement for
                    pursuing a regular and liberal course of education,” and “rewarding” with
                    academic honours and distinctions those who, by the pursuit of such course of
                    education as the senate, with the concurrence of the government, shall
                    prescribe, have acquired certain ascertained degrees of “proficiency in
                    literature, science, and art.” The university consists of a chancellor,
                    vice-chancellor, and thirty-six fellows, who form the senate, or governing body,
                    and are invested with the sole power of managing and superintending its affairs,
                    and of forming regulations for examinations and the granting of degrees, such
                    regulations to be submitted to one of the secretaries of state, and “approved of
                    and countersigned by him.” The chancellor is appointed for life by the crown,
                    under the sign manual; the vice-chancellor, whose office is annual, is elected
                    by the fellows from their own number. The original fellows were appointed by the
                    crown, under the sign manual; and the charter provides that, “if at any time, by
                    death or otherwise, their number shall be reduced below twenty-five, exclusive
                    of the chancellor and vice-chancellor for the time being,” the members of the
                    senate “shall elect twelve or more fit and proper persons” to complete the
                    requisite number of thirty-six. The power of visitation is retained by the
                    crown. In contemplating the effects likely to result from an establishment
                    invested with such extensive powers, and directed to such noble ends, we cannot
                    but regard the university of London as calculated eventually to attain an
                    important station among similar institutions in the empire, and as destined to
                    give a powerful impulse to the advancement of learning and science.</p>
                <p>The university comprehends two colleges, named <hi rend="italic">University

                    of furnishing to the inhabitants of the metropolis, at a moderate price, a
                    general education, embracing a wider range of subjects than those in which
                    instruction is given at Oxford and Cambridge. Students are admitted without
                    reference to their religious opinions. The classes were opened in October 1828;
                    and a second charter of incorporation was granted in 1836. The constitution of
                    both colleges nearly resembles that of the Scotish and German universities, and
                    retains much of the simplicity by which the ancient academical seminaries were
                    characterized. The students do not reside in the college; and the academical
                    discipline is therefore confined to the classroom. The professors are dependent
                    on the fees which they receive from their pupils, and deliver their instructions
                    by means of public lectures, accompanied by catechetical examinations. There are
                    public examinations at the end of the session, when prizes are awarded to the
                    most distinguished students. The government is vested in a council, consisting
                    of a president, vice-president, and twenty-four other members, which has the
                    power to make regulations, accept endowments, appoint professors, tutors,
                    &amp;c. and to manage generally the affairs of the college. All the members of
                    council are elected by the proprietors. Instruction is provided in the three
                    faculties of arts, law, and medicine. The college contains thirty-two
                    professorships: nine in literature, six in mathematical and physical sciences,
                    three in ethical and political sciences, three in law, and eleven in medicine;
                    but some of these are held along with other professorships.</p>
                <p>King’s College was incorporated by royal charter in 1829, and is confined
                    principally to the education of members of the church of England. The funds for
                    the erection <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=545"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0545-0507"/>and support of the institution were raised partly
                    by donations, and partly by proprietary shares. The government is vested in a
                    council consisting of three classes; the visitor, who is the archbishop of
                    Canterbury; the perpetual governors by virtue of their ofiice, as the lord
                    chancellor, archbishop of York, bishop of London, and other high functionaries;
                    the governors for life, and those who are simply councillors. There are
                    thirty-four professorships, embracing the same faculties as in University
                    College, with the addition of lectures in divinity by the principal. By nothing,
                    perhaps, is the recent institution of these colleges more distinctly marked,
                    than by the provision which they have made for the cultivation of the modern
                    languages and literature. Each of them furnishes instruction in English, French.
                    Italian, and German; and even Chinese is taught by a professor.</p>
                <p>Besides the members of these two colleges, the university is empowered by the
                    charter of foundation to grant degrees in arts and law to candidates from such
                    institutions within the United Kingdom as are or shall be authorized under the
                    sign manual to issue certificates of proficiency, and also to prescribe the
                    courses of study, and the modes of education, necessary to entitle the
                    candidates to be admitted to examination. The following institutions have
                    consequently been empowered (1841) to issue certificates to candidates for
                    degrees in arts and law: St Cuthbert’s College, Ushaw; Stonyhurst College; Royal
                    Belfast Academical Institution; Bristol College; Manchester New College; St
                    Mary’s College, Oscott; Carlow College; St Edmund’s College, near Ware; Homerton
                    College; Highbury College; the Colleges of St Peter and St Paul, at Prior Park,
                    near Bath; Spring Hill College, Birmingham; and Stepney College. The senate,
                    with the approbation of the secretary of state, has also the power of selecting
                    the medical institutions and schools, “whether corporate or unincorporated," in
                    the metropolis or in other parts of the United Kingdom, “from which, either
                    singly, or jointly with other medical institutions and schools in this country
                    or in foreign parts, it may be proper to admit candidates for degrees in
                    medicine,” and to confer degrees on these candidates on their producing
                    certificates of having completed the course of instruction required by the
                    university. The list of “recognised medical institutions, schools, and
                    teachers," dated 9th April 1840, besides the various hospitals and medical
                    schools of the metropolis, comprehends the medical schools which have been
                    established in Birmingham, Bristol, Hull, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester,
                    Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sheffield, and York; the extra-academical lecturers,
                    composing Queen’s College, Edinburgh, and various teachers who are members of
                    the Royal College of Surgeons; two medical schools, besides lecturers in
                    Glasgow; and medical schools in Dublin, Cork, and Belfast.</p>
                <p>The Session of the university commences on the first of October for the medical
                    classes, and on the first of November for the remainder, and ends in May.
                    Students in arts, before being admitted, must produce a certificate of having
                    completed their sixteenth year, and are required to undergo a <hi rend="italic"
                    >bona fide</hi> exammation in the elements of mathematics, natural philosophy,
                    natural history, and some of the simpler doctrines of chemistry. They are also
                    examined in classics, in the grammatical structure of the English language, and
                    in the outlines of modem history and geography. Ancient history and geography
                    are embraced in the classical papers. The candidates who have passed are
                    arranged by the examiners in two divisions, each in alphabetical order; and any
                    candidate who has passed may, on producing a certificate that he has not
                    completed his nineteenth year, be examined for honours in mathematics and
                    natural philosophy, and also in classics; the range of examination being made
                    considerably more extensive than that for entrance. The candidates in each of
                    the two divisions are then placed in the order of merit; and to the first of
                    each class an exhibition of L.30. for two years, is assigned. Students of
                    medicine, before admission, are required to undergo a similar examination on the
                    same subjects, varied however to suit their professional views; and those who
                    are admitted have likewise an opportunity of obtaining honours, and of gaining
                    exhibitions of equal amount with those in the faculty of arts. The examinations
                    are conducted by means of printed papers; the power being left to the examiners
                    of putting <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi> questions on the written answers
                    when they appear to require explanation.</p>
                <p>The examinations for degrees take place once a year. The examinations in arts are
                    in May, and those in law and medicine in November. The course prescribed in each
                    faculty is extensive, and the plan of examination is comprehensive and
                    judicious; but our limited space prevents us from giving even an abstract of
                    them. The examinations are all conducted by means of printed papers, and are
                    placed under the superintendence of twenty-two examiners, appointed by the
                    senate, and paid by the government. Of these, fourteen are assigned to the
                    faculty of arts, one to the faculty of law, and thirteen to the faculty of
                    medicine. Some of them examine on more than one subject. The professors take no
                    part in the examinations. 1 n each of the faculties there are also examinations
                    for honours, and exhibitions are granted to the successful competitors. The
                    exhibitioners take the designation of University Scholars. The course for the
                    degree of B. A. is two years, and for Μ. A. four years; for LL. B. one year
                    after taking the degree of B. A.; for LL. D. two years after becoming LL. B.;
                    for Μ. B. four years; for Μ. D. a certain prescribed course after taking the
                    degree of Μ. B. The following are the fees for graduation: B A. L.10, Μ. A.
                    L.10, LL. B. L.10, LL. D. L.25. Μ. B. L.10, Μ. D. L.10. The estimated public
                    expense of the university, exclusive of the revenue derived from fees, for the
                    year from 1st April 1840 to 31st March 1841, was L.6318. 10s. This money it

                <p> UNIVERSITY OF DURHAM.</p>
                <p>The university of Durham was incorporated by a royal charter, dated the 1st of
                    June 1837, under the name of “The Warden, Masters, and Scholars of the
                    University of Durham,” which authorizes the body corporate to have perpetual
                    succession, and a common seal, and to enjoy all the rights and privileges which
                    “are incident to a university established by royal charter.” It consequently
                    possesses and exercises the right of granting degrees in all the faculties.</p>
                <p>The great and increasing population of the north of England, and its remoteness
                    from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, had long pointed out the
                    expediency of establishing in this part of the kingdom an institution which
                    should secure to its inhabitants the advantages of a sound yet not expensive
                    education. Accordingly the late bishop of Durham, with the dean and chapter,
                    believing that the means of supplying the deficiency might be provided from the
                    resources of that body, without contravening the principles on which it was
                    incorporated, agreed, by an act of chapter in 1831, to appropriate property
                    producing L.3000 per annum to the support of an academical institution in
                    connection with the cathedral church. The bishop, at the same time, promised to
                    provide eventually for the warden, the professor of divinity, and the professor
                    of Greek, by attaching prebendal stalls to the several offices. In pursuance of
                    this arrangement, an act of parliament was obtained in 1832, authorizing the
                    bishop, and the dean and chapter, to carry their munificent resolution into
                    effect, by empowering them to establish a university for the advancement of
                    learning in connection with their cathedral church. The university was opened in
                    October 1833, and a regular system of instruction commenced. After the course of
                    study had been finally fixed, and the arrangements for conducting the business
                    matured, a statute was passed by the dean and chapter, in July 1835, and
                    approved by the bishop, intrusting the ordinary management of the university,
                    under the bishop as visitor, and the dean and chapter as governors, to the
                    warden, a senate, and a convocation. A body of regulations for conducting the
                    studies and the general business of the university was soon after prepared, and
                    was approved by convocation on the 4th of March 1836. The various acts of the
                    dean and chapter were ratified by the charter of foundation in the following
                    year.</p>
                <p>The university consists of a warden or principal, a professor of divinity and
                    ecclesiastical history, a professor of Greek and clns. sical literature, a
                    professor of mathematics, two proctors, and read, ers in law, medicine, Hebrew,
                    history, and polite literature, natural philosophy, chemistry, and modern
                    languages; with graduates and scholars. The warden and the professors of
                    divinity and Greek are appointed by the bishop of Durham; the professor of
                    mathematics and the other officers are nominated by the dean and chapter. The
                    business of the university is conducted by the warden and a senate and
                    convocation. The senate, which consists of the chief officers of the university,
                    transacts the ordinary business, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=546" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0546-0508"
                    />and is competent to originate regulationi and other measures relating to it,
                    but such regulations and measures are not in force till they are confirmed by
                    the convocation. The convocation, which, besides the members appointed on the
                    first establishment of the university, consists of all persons regularly
                    admitted to the degrees of doctor in divinity, the civil law, and medicine, and
                    to the degree of master of arts, confirms or rejects what is submitted to it by
                    the senate, but has not the power to originate or amend.</p>
                <p>By the regulations of the university, provision has been made for a regular
                    course of general education similar to that which is given at Oxford and
                    Cambridge. The qualifications of the students are ascertained by examination
                    before admission: and their proficiency during the continuance of the course is
                    tested by pubic examinations held annually, particularly at the end of the third
                    year for the degree of bachelor of arts, and at the end of the fourth year for
                    the degree of master. Instruction in theology is likewise given; and those who
                    at the end of the course pass the requisite examination, and produce the
                    necessary testimonials, receive under the common seal of the university a
                    certificate of competency and character, which is called a license in theology.
                    In 1837, an important extension of the benefits of the university was made by
                    the establishment of a course of instruction for students in civil engineering
                    and mining, suggested by the extensive public works in the neighbourhood. The
                    students in this department are examined, on admission, in the Latin language,
                    in arithmetic, and the elements of mathematics. The full course of study extends
                    over three years: the competency of the students is tested by a public
                    examination at the end of each year; and those who have passed all the requisite
                    examinations are admitted to the “academical rank" of civil engineer. Besides
                    the regular courses of professional education, public lectures on various
                    branches of literature and science are also delivered from time to time, which
                    are open, under certain regulations, to persons who are not members of the
                    university.</p>
                <p>Six university fellowships have lately been endowed by the dean and chapter,
                    which are open to any member who has passed the examination for the degree of B.
                    A., and are tenable for six years. The fellowships are vacated by marriage, or
                    by holding preferment, office, or property real or personal, producing L.300 a
                    year or upwards. There are also twenty university scholarships of the annual
                    value of L.30 each; and others founded by the trustees of the last two bishops.
                    Prizes of various kinds are given for the encouragement of merit.</p>
                <p>University College was formed at the opening of the university, for the purpose
                    of uniting a system of domestic discipline and superintendence with academical
                    instruction; and residence within the college is enforced on every student,
                    unless a dispensation to reside elsewhere is granted by the warden. College
                    examinations, independent of those appointed by the university, are held at the
                    end of every term.</p>
                <p>Degrees are conferred by the warden and convocation, but every grace for a degree
                    must be allowed by the dean and chapter before it is proposed in convocation.
                    The academical year consists of three terms, of not less than eight weeks each,
                    called Michaelmas, Epiphany, and Easter. Michaelmas term commences not earlier
                    than the 10th of October, and Easter term ends not later than the 30th June. No
                    religious test is exacted till a student proceeds to his degree. For the terms
                    and exercises requisite for proceeding to the different degrees, See <hi

                <p> UN1VERSITY OF ST ANDREWS.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the fifteenth century, Scotland contained no academical
                    institution in which the higher branches of knowlege were taught The Scotish
                    youth who wished to obtain a more liberal education than the seminaries of the
                    country afforded, were under the necessity of seeking it in foreign
                    universities; in some of which colleges were early endowed for their reception.
                    Soon after the middle of the thirteenth century, Dervor-guilla, wife of John
                    Balliol, founded and endowed a college at Oxford for Scotish students; and in
                    1326, the Scotish College in the university of Paris was founded and endowed for
                    a similar purpose, by David Murray, bishop of Moray. The risk and inconvenience
                    attending the removal of the youth to foreign schools was long felt; and the
                    discerning part of the community were not insensible of the advantages which the
                    country would derive from the establishment of an institution within its own
                    limits, where the higher branches of education, in science, philosophy, and
                    theology, might be attained. One of the individuals who entertained these
                    sentiments was Henry Wardlaw, bishop of St Andrews, who took measures to remedy
                    the evil. Having ascertained that his sovereign James I., at that time a
                    prisoner in England, approved of his scheme, he resolved, with the consent and

                    erect a university in the ecclesiastical metropolis. The lectures commenced in

                    archdeacon of Lothian, immediately granted to the masters and students the
                    privileges belonging to a university. Benedict XIII. issued a bull of
                    confirmation on the 27th of August 1413, instituting a <hi rend="italic">studium

                    conferring degrees in these faculties, thereby investing him with the power and
                    dignity of chancellor. The pope on the same day signed other five bulls,
                    securing the rights and privileges of the university, which were ratified by

                <p>The university was formed on the model of those of Paris and Bologna. The
                    members, or <hi rend="italic">supposts,</hi> as they were called, were divided
                    into four nations, those of Fife, Angus, Lothian, and Albany, the last including
                    all who did not belong to any of the other three districts. The supposts, at a
                    congregation or general meeting, elected annually four procurators to watch over
                    their interests, and four intrants, or electors, by whom the rector was chosen.
                    The government was vested in the rector, of whom it was required as a necessary
                    qualification, that he should be a graduate in one of the faculties, and should
                    also be in holy orders. The university was represented in the rectorial court by
                    twelve assessors, three selected from each nation. With the advice and consent
                    of his assessors, the rector possessed supreme judicial power in all causes,
                    civil and criminal, relating to members of the university, with the exception of
                    crimes which inferred the highest punishment.<note anchored="true"

                    of degrees. The university was well supplied with teachers even at its
                    commencement. Before the papal bulls were issued, it included a professor of
                    divinity, four lecturers on the canon law, and three who taught the arts or
                    philosophy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>‘ Fordun, as

                    their admission and graduation; but the persons appointed to conduct the
                    different departments of study generally enjoyed endowments from other sources.
                    During the first twenty years of its existence, great inconvenience was suffered
                    from the want of public buildings; and the schools were held in the different
                    religious houses, which in consequence claimed to be considered as constituent
                    parts of the university. In 1430 a <hi rend="italic">Paedagogium</hi> was built
                    for the schools of the faculty of arts, and for chambers for the students of
                    that faculty; while the studies of the faculties of theology and law continued
                    to be conducted in other buildings. The congregations of the university were
                    held for at least 130 years in the Augustinian priory.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The university was liberally patronised by James I. after his return from his
                    long captivity in England; and being conducted by an active and devoted
                    priesthood, it soon acquired the confidence and respect of the country, and
                    attracted students from all parts of the kingdom. To provide more effectually
                    for their instruction, James Kennedy, the successor of Wardlaw in the see of St
                    Andrews, established in 1450 the College of St Salvator, which was sanctioned by
                    Pope Nicholas V. about the year 1455, and in favour of which new grants were
                    made by the same prelate, and by Pope Pius II. in 1458. The college was to
                    consist of thirteen persons, all of whom were to live within its walls; a
                    praepositus or provost, who was to be a doctor of divinity; a licentiate and a
                    bachelor of the same faculty; four masters of arts, and six poor scholars. The
                    provost was required to lecture in theology once a week, the licentiate twice,
                    and the bachelor every <hi rend="italic">readable</hi> day; the duty of
                    preaching at stated times to the people being also imposed on the two former.
                    Two of the masters of arts were to be annually chosen as regents, the one to
                    teach logic, and the other physics and metaphysics, according to the method of
                    the schools and the statutes of the university. The masters of arts and poor
                    scholars were to be elected by the provost, licentiate, and bachelor. The
                    benevolent founder granted as an endowment the rectorial tithes of four
                    adjoining parishes, constituting the three principal masters of the college
                    rectors of three of them, and reserving the fruits of the fourth as a common
                    fund for the maintenance and support of all members of the foundation, together
                    with their attendants and servants. About the year 1468, Pope Paul II. in
                    consideration of the rising reputation of the college, honoured it with the
                    privilege of conferring degrees in theology and the arts; thereby constituting
                    it a separate university, though with limited powers.</p>
                <p>In 1512, John Hepburn, prior of the Augustinian monastery, and Alexander Stewart,
                    archbishop of St Andrews, founded the College of St Leonard, which was in the
                    same year confirmed by a royal charter from James IV., accompanied, as in the
                    case of the university, with an exemption to its members and property from all
                    national imposts. The prior granted to this new erection the revenues of the
                    hospital of St Andrews, for the support of the principal master; four chaplains,
                    two of whom were to be regents; six graduates in arts, who were to be diligent
                    students of theology; and twenty scholars, students of philosophy. The
                    principal, who was to be nominated by the prior, from the canons of the chapter,
                    was constituted professor of divinity, and was invested with absolute
                    jurisdiction over all the members of the college. In conjunction with the prior,
                    he was to appoint the regents; and candidates for the scholarships, after
                    satisfactory examination by him, certified to the prior, were nominated by the
                    latter, who was enjoined to be influenced in the disposal of his patronage by
                    merit alone, and not by individual solicitation. As in the case of St
                    Salvator’s, all the members were to live within the walls of the college, and
                    were bound to conform to certain regulations as to dress, amusements, and
                    general conduct. Delinquencies were to be severely punished; and the power of
                    visiting the college and reforming its abuses was retained by the prior and the
                    chapter of the convent.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the superior advantages of the two endowed colleges, there were
                    still in the university professors and students who belonged to neither, and who
                    continued to frequent, the <hi rend="italic">Paedagogium,</hi> although they
                    were supported by but slender funds. The disadvantages to which they were
                    subjected in their competition with the rival colleges induced Archbishop
                    Alexander Stewart to make preparations for giving to the paedagogium a
                    collegiate form, which were frustrated by his premature death in the field of
                    Floddon. The design was resumed by his successor Janies Beaton, who in 1537
                    founded St Mary’s College, or as it was sometimes called, the New College, and
                    in the same year procured for it the confirmation of Paul III.<note

                    was founded for all the faculties; and by its charter of erection, obtained "the
                    power of conferring degrees, thus forming a third independent university. But
                    the college was not finally erected till 1553, when Archbishop Hamilton, under
                    the authority of a papal bull obtained in the year preceding, extended its
                    constitution, and endowed it with the tithes of six parishes. It was to consist
                    of thirty-six persons; a prefect or principal, who was to be a doctor or
                    licentiate in divinity, and who was to have jurisdiction over all members on the
                    foundation; two professors of divinity, the one a licentiate and the other a
                    bachelor; a professor of the canon law, who was to be in priest’s orders; eight
                    students of divinity, whose appointments were tenable for six years, and who,
                    besides attending regularly the lectures of the professors, were themselves
                    required to lecture; three professors or regents of philosophy, who were to
                    teach logic, ethics, physics, mathematics, and the other liberal arts; a
                    professor of rhetoric and one of grammar, who were to be masters of arts;
                    sixteen poor scholars, students of philosophy, who were to be well acquainted
                    with grammar and Latin; a provisor, a janitor, and a cook. The defence and
                    increase of the Catholic faith being the declared object of the erection of this
                    as well as the other colleges, the principal and professors had certain
                    extra-academical duties assigned to them. The principal was required to lecture
                    on the sacred Scriptures every Monday, the licentiate five times a week, and the
                    canonist to deliver the same number of lectures on the canon law. Appropriate
                    duties were assigned to the other members. The rector of the university, with
                    the principal of St Salvator’s College, and some of the highest ecclesiastics of
                    the city, were to elect the principal and the professors of divinity and the
                    canon law; and they again were to fill up all other vacancies as they occurred
                    in the college. The rector was empowereil to visit the college annually, and to
                    see that discipline was duly enforced. The college was to be exempted from all
                    public burdens. All vacations were to be disallowed, and absentees for a month
                    in the year, without permission from the principal, were to forfeit their
                    appointments. Nothing probably is more remarkable in the establishment of the
                    colleges of St Andrews, than the success of the founders in obtaining for them
                    the most celebrated teachers. Men who had distinguished themselves in the
                    foreign universities were urgently invited as professors, and appear to have
                    willingly embraced the opportunity to diffuse among their countrymen the
                    learning which they had themselves acquired.</p>
                <p>The constitutions of the colleges remained unaltered till the reformation, with
                    the exception of the appointment of a professor of humanity in each of the
                    colleges of St Salvator and St Leonard, answering to the professor of grammar in
                    St Mary’s. During the agitation of the religious controversy, the academical

                    arts were under the necessity of discontinuing the public exhibitions usual at

                    Immediately after the establishment of the reformation, the laws and practice of
                    the university were accommodated to the change which had taken place in the
                    religious establishment of the country; but the mode of teaching, and the
                    academical exercises, so far as related to philosophy and the arts, continued
                    nearly on their former footing. The students who entered a college at the same
                    time, formed a class, and were placed under the superintendence and tuition of a
                    regent, by whom their studies were conducted during the whole course. The
                    regular time of the course was four years, but it was more usually finished in
                    three years and a half. The session commenced on the first of October, and
                    continued till the end of July, the months of August and September<note

                    as a vacation. The regent assembled his class three hours every day, and read
                    and explained to them the books of Aristotle, beginning with dialetics or logic,
                    then advancing to ethics, next to physics, and concluding with metaphysics,
                    which were considered the highest branch of philosophy, and mathematics, which
                    included arithmetic. During their course the students were frequently exercised
                    in disputations and declamations, both privately in their class, and publicly
                    before the college and university. The principal frequently read lectures on the
                    higher branches of philosophy, which were attended by all the students of the
                    college.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Life of

                <p>In the middle of the third year, the students who obtained from their regent and
                    the principal of the college an attestation of regular attendance and good
                    conduct, were allowed to propose themselves as candidates for the degree of
                    bachelor. In the presence of three regents, annually selected from each college
                    as examiners, the candidates <hi rend="italic">determined</hi> a question in
                    logic or morals, and answered such questions as were proposed to them on any of
                    the branches of study with which they had been occupied. Those who acquitted
                    themselves to the satisfaction of the examiners were confirmed <hi rend="italic"
                    >bachelors</hi> by the dean, the rest were sent to a lower class. A similar form
                    was observed in the act of laureation at the end of the course; except that on
                    this occasion the candidates were examined on the whole circle of the arts, and
                    were required to defend a thesis which had been previously affixed to the gates
                    of the different colleges. They were then divided into classes, and their names
                    arranged according to merit, with a certain preference to persons of rank. When
                    the examinations were concluded, the degree of master of arts was solemnly
                    conferred by the chancellor, <hi rend="italic">in nomine Patris, Pitii, et

                    to other officers. Small annual fees seem originally to have been paid by the

                    introduce such improvements as might appear necessary. The commissioners,
                    finding that all the colleges had departed from their original foundations,
                    agreed upon a new form of instruction, which was laid before the ensuing meeting
                    of parliament, and ratified on the 11th of November 1579. St Salvator’s College
                    was to consist of a principal, and four professors or regents of humanity and
                    philosophy. The first regent was to teach the Greek grammar, and to exercise the
                    students in Latin composition during the first, and in Greek during the second
                    half year. The second regent, who was also considered a professor of humanity,
                    was to teach the principles of rhetoric, and the practice of it as exemplified
                    in the best Greek and Latin authors. This class was to spend an hour at least
                    every day in composition; and during the last half year the students were to
                    declaim once a month in Greek and Latin alternately. It was the duty of the
                    third regent to teach, in the original language, part of the Logic of Aristotle,
                    with the Ethics and Politics; and the Offices of Cicero in Latin. The fourth
                    regent was to teach the necessary parts of the Physics, and the doctrine of the
                    Sphere. Each regent was confined to his own department. Professors of
                    mathematics and law were also established, who were to lecture at least four
                    times every week; and the principal of the college was to act as professor of
                    medicine. Similar arrangements were made in St Leonard’s College; with this
                    difference, that no classes of mathematics and law were established in it, and
                    the principal was to lecture on the philosophy of Plato. St Mary’s College was
                    appropriated solely to the study of theology, and the languages connected with
                    it. The course of study was to be completed in four years, under the instruction
                    of a principal and four professors, each of the professors having under his care
                    only the students of one year. It embraced, in the first year, the elements of
                    Hebrew, Chaldee, and Syriac; during the next eighteen months, the same
                    languages, with critical explanations of the Pentateuch and historical books of
                    the Old Testament; and during the remaining eighteen months, the prophetical
                    books were examined in the same manner. During the whole four years, the fourth
                    professor was to explain the New Testament, by comparing the original with the
                    Syrian version; and the principal was to lecture on systematic divinity. The
                    students were required to attend the lectures of three professors every day
                    during the continuance of their theological course. Such was the form of
                    instruction drawn up by Melville, and recommended by Buchanan, which has been
                    well characterised by Dr M’Crie as “the most liberal and enlightened plan of
                    study which had yet been established in any European university.”<note

                    has been made,</p></note> This destination of the colleges continued till 1621,
                    when, by an act of the legislature, their original constitutions were restored,
                    “in all their heads, articles, and clauses,” so far as was consistent with the
                    reformed religion, with the single exception that St Mary’s should be confined
                    to the faculty of divinity. Professorships of mathematics and medicine were
                    instituted in 1668 and 1721. We have not the means of ascertaining the precise
                    number of students who belonged to the university at one lime. In ordinary cases
                    it appears not to have exceeded 200, and it did not fall much short of that
                    number during the latter half of the sixteenth century. Fewer had attended it
                    during the first half, and still fewer previously to that period.<note

                <p>The three colleges continued without further alteration till the year 1747. when,
                    in consequence of the inadequacy of the provi. sion for the principals and
                    professors of the two colleges of philosophy, a union of them was effected by
                    parliamentary enactment, which enabled them to consolidate their endowments, and
                    to make provision for a more extended course of instruction. By this statute the
                    United College of St Salvator and St Leonard was to consist of a principal, a
                    professor of Greek, three professors of philosophy, professors of humanity,
                    civil history, mathematics, and medicine, and sixteen bursars on the original
                    foundations. The same statute regulates the patronage of the professorships and
                    bursaries, and makes provision for the disposal of the funds of the college. No
                    change has since taken place in the constitution of the colleges, none of the
                    suggestions of the royal commissioners appointed in 1826 having been carried
                    into effect in any of the Scotish universities. The principal of United College
                    takes no active part in teaching; the professor of ethics delivers a course of
                    lectures on political economy, and the professor of medicine teaches chemistry
                    and chemical pharmacy. Tn St Mary’s College there is a principal, who is also
                    primarius professor of divinity, and conducts the department of systematic
                    theology; a professor of divinity, who confines his lectures chiefly to biblical
                    criticism; and professors of ecclesiastical history and oriental languages. The
                    members of the colleges have long ceased to live in common: the bursaries are
                    still paid to certain poor scholars, but chambers are no longer provided for
                    them, nor do they eat at a common table. The professors of United College
                    receive fees from their pupils, but those of St Mary’s have no remuneration
                    except their salaries, and a small grant of public money.</p>
                <p>The university consists of a chancellor, rector, two principals, and eleven
                    professors. These members, with the exception of the chancellor, form the
                    governing body of the university, under the name of the Academical Senate. The
                    Chancellor is the highest dignitary in the university, and the guardian of its
                    privileges. He was originally the fountain of honour, and entitled to confer all
                    academical degrees; but this part of his official prerogative has long been in
                    abeyance. According to the original charter, the bishop of the see, as in the
                    other Scotish universities founded by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=549" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0549-0511"
                    />ecclesiastics, was chancellor <hi rend="italic">ex officio.</hi> Since the
                    abolition of episcopacy, he has been elected by the senate, is generally a
                    nobleman, and retains his appointment for life.</p>
                <p>The Rector, who is the next office-bearer, is elected, according to the original
                    constitution of the university, by four intrants chosen by the four nations; the
                    retiring rector having a casting vote in the case of an equality in the votes of
                    the intrants. By the existing regulations, the only individuals who are eligible
                    are the two principals, and the professors of divinity and ecclesiastical
                    history. The rector nominates his substitutes and assessors from the senate, and
                    with their advice determines all causes which are brought before him. He acts as
                    a civil magistrate within the university, and possesses over the students the
                    power of expulsion.</p>
                <p>The Dean of the faculty of arts is chosen annually by the members of the faculty,
                    who are the principal and professors of United College. He presides in the
                    meetings of the faculty, and communicates with the senate respecting
                    applications for degrees.</p>
                <p>The Senatus Academicus is composed of the principals and professors of the two
                    colleges, with the rector as president. By this body alone degrees are
                    conferred; the faculty of arts merely exercising the privilege of recommending
                    to it such individuals as they consider entitled to that distinction. The senate
                    also manages the university business, superintends the arrangements connected
                    with the library, elects the chancellor, the professor of medicine, the
                    librarian, and the archbeadle. An appeal to it is competent, in certain cases,
                    from judgments pronounced by either of the colleges. All members of the senate,
                    previously to their admission, must sign the Formula of the Church of Scotland,
                    in presence of the presbytery of St Andrews.</p>
                <p>In United College the Session or annual term of attendance for the Latin and
                    Greek classes begins on or about the 20th of October; for the other classes, on
                    the first Thursday of November, and closes on the last Friday of April. In St
                    Mary’s College, it commences about the end of November, and terminates in the
                    beginning of April. In all the Scotish universitles the curriculum of arts
                    extends over four sessions; and at those of St Andrews, Glasgow, and Edinburgh,
                    whatever other classes are attended, the Greek must be taken the first year, the
                    logic the second, the moral philosophy the third, and the natural philosophy the
                    fourth. At all these seminaries, and also at the two Aberdeen colleges, it is
                    usual for the student to attend the junior Latin or humanity class along with
                    the Greek; and these two branches form his whole occupation for that session. In
                    his second session, at St Andrews, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, he enters the logic
                    class; the lectures delivered in which, at the two former universities, embrace
                    the subject of rhetoric also. At Edinburgh, rhetoric is taught in a separate
                    class, attendance on which is likewise required from candidates for degrees, but
                    without any particular year being assigned for it. In neither of the Aberdeen
                    colleges is there any logic or rhetoric class. The other classes which it is
                    customary to attend during the second year are the senior Greek, the senior
                    Latin, and the junior mathematics. In all the universities, except those of
                    Aberdeen, the class of moral philosophy is attended during the third session,
                    and natural philosophy in the fourth. Along with these the students of the third
                    year generally attend the senior mathematics, and frequently the advanced Greek;
                    those of the fourth year continue to advance in their mathematical studies. At
                    both the Aberdeen colleges the class of natural philosophy is attended in the
                    third year, and moral philosophy in the fourth. The qualifications required from
                    candidates for graduation are different in the different universities; and in
                    all, the professors are the examiners, each in his own department.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of each session, a code of laws is read by the principals to the
                    students of their respective colleges, compliance with which is strictly
                    enforced. Delinquents are first admonished privately by the principal, and, if
                    the offence is repeated, are brought before the academical courts. The students
                    of arts wear a particular dress, which varies with the rank of the wearer,
                    according as he is a <hi rend="italic">primar, secondar,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ternar.</hi> This dress was anciently worn at all times when the
                    student was out of his room, but is now dispensed with, except when he is within
                    the walls of the college. The students of both colleges are required to attend
                    divine worship every Sunday, except such as obtain dispensations from the
                    principals and professors. The students of St Mary’s assemble every morning in
                    the public hall, for prayers, reading a portion of scripture, and singing
                    psalms. The duly is performed by the students in rotation.</p>
                <p>The revenue of the university, as distinct from the colleges, is small, and is
                    appropriated chiefly to the support of the library. The regular income for 1826
                    was L.297. The endowments of the colleges have been much curtailed within the
                    last fifty years, by the augmentations of the stipends of those parishes, the
                    tithes of which were granted to them by the original founders. The revenue of
                    United College is derived partly from the funds of the original foundations,
                    from royal grants made at different periods, from the donations of private
                    individuals, and from property purchased by the college itself. In 1823, it
                    amounted, including bursary funds, to L.3021. 1s. 6d. St Mary’s College was
                    originally endowed with tithes only, to which some additions were made by James
                    VI. and William III. As in the case of United College, these have also been
                    diminished by the sums which have at various times been allocated for the
                    maintenance of the parochial clergy. The average income for the seven years
                    preceding 1826 was L.1076. 5s. 5½d. The following table contains the different
                    professorships, with the patronage, salary, and class-fees.</p>

                    produced by causes external to the universities themselves, and may be partly
                    accounted for by the small inducements which the learned professions hold out to
                    young men in Scotland; by the superior advantages which are offered by the arts,
                    manufactures, and commerce of the country; by the emigration of many young men
                    who would otherwise have received a university education; and by the schools,
                    chiefly medical, which have been established in the principal towns of England

                <p>In the year 1450, Pope Nicholas V., at the solicitation of William Turnbull,
                    bishop of Glasgow, issued a bull, establishing a <hi rend="italic">studium
                    generale,</hi> or university, “for theology, the ca <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=550" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0550-0512"
                    />non and civil law, the arts, and every other lawful faculty,” at Glasgow; and
                    granting to it all the rights and privileges belonging to the university of
                    Bologna. The archbishop of Glasgow was constituted chancellor, with the same
                    authority as was possessed by the heads of the Italian university, and
                    particularly with the power of conferring degrees and licenses on candidates
                    duly examined. No mention is made of medicine, as in the original erection of
                    the university of St Andrews; but it is implied in the expression, “quavis alia
                    licita facultate.” In the following year a body of statutes for its government
                    was prepared by the bishop and his chapter, which, with the papal bull, was
                    confirmed in 1453 by a royal charter from James II. The king likewise exempted
                    the members from taxes and all civic burdens; and in the same year various
                    privileges were conferred by the bishop, similar to those granted by Bishop
                    Wardlaw to the university of St Andrews.</p>
                <p>In the original constitution of the university, that of Bologna seems to have
                    been imitated as far as circumstances would permit. It consisted of a
                    chancellor, rector, deans of faculties, procurators, regents, masters, and
                    scholars; and was placed by the bishops beyond the control of the civil
                    magistrates. The supreme power was vested in the scholars who had been
                    marticulated, and whose names remained on the <hi rend="italic">album;</hi> and
                    these, in their <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> or congregations, enacted,
                    amended, or repealed the statutes. The <hi rend="italic">supposts,</hi> or
                    members of the university, were distributed into four nations,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The four nations were, <hi
                    rend="italic">Natio Clydesdaliae,</hi> comprehending the natives of Lanarkshire,
                    Renfrew, and Dunbarton, from Erickstane. the source of the Clyde, to Dunbarton;
                    <hi rend="italic">Natio Thevidalia,</hi> including the Lothians, Stirling, and
                    all the towns east of the river Urr; <hi rend="italic">Natio Albania,</hi>
                    embracing all the country north of the Forth; and <hi rend="italic">Natio
                    Rothsaia,</hi> including Ayrshire, Galloway, Argyle, with the Isles, Lennox, and
                    Ireland.</p></note> each having a procurator, elected annually from its own
                    number, who was invested with considerable trust and power. The supposts,
                    assembled in <hi rend="italic">comitia,</hi> also elected the rector through the
                    medium of intrants, and at the same time chose four deputies to form the
                    rectorial council. The rector, acting with the advice of his council, exercised
                    supreme judicial and executive power over all the members of the university: he
                    was invested with jurisdiction in all minor civil cases in which supposts were
                    concerned; graver offences were specially reserved for the decision of the
                    bishop himself. Permission was given to the supposts to bring their causes
                    either before the rector or the bishop, and liberty of appeal to the latter was
                    allowed to any one who thought himself aggrieved by the sentence of the former.
                    In 1461 an ecclesiastical jurisdiction was conceded to the rector; and such a
                    concession implies that this officer was always to be a person in holy orders.
                    All houses and lodgings for the supposts within the city were subjected to
                    regulations similar to those established by Gregory IX. in the university of
                    Paris. The magistrates and other officers of the city took a yearly oath to
                    observe and defend the privileges and liberties of the university.</p>
                <p>This university, at its first erection, was entirely unendowed, and for a
                    considerable time possessed no funds, with the exception of small perquisites
                    paid at promotions to degrees. Its meetings were held in the chapter-house of
                    the Blackfriars, or in the cathedral; and the teachers were furnished with
                    schools in the religious houses. In 1458, the faculty of arts commenced building
                    a <hi rend="italic">Paedagogium,</hi> at the expense of its common purse; but
                    this design was superseded by the liberality of the first Lord Hamilton, who in
                    the following year conveyed to the principal and the other regents of the
                    faculty, for their use and accommodation, a tenement in the High Street,
                    together with four acres of land. The donor required that the principal and
                    regents should, on their admission to office, promise on oath to commemorate
                    himself and his wife as the <hi rend="italic">founders of the college.</hi> The
                    annals of the university furnish scarcely any information respecting the means
                    of instruction which it provided, and the mode in which that instruction was
                    conveyed. In the higher faculties, the teaching seems to have been confined to
                    occasional lectures. More attention appears to have been paid to the inferior
                    branches of science. The records mention the admission of a regent of philosophy
                    within two years after the erection of the university. It may readily be assumed
                    that the want of salaries to the professors was the principal reason why the
                    higher branches of knowledge were neglected; and even the instruction which the
                    university diffused was furnished by men who derived their emoluments from other
                    sources. The professors of divinity, and of the canon and civil law, depended
                    for their support on the benefices which they held as ecclesiastics in various
                    parts of the country.</p>
                <p>By Lord Hamilton’s deed of bequest, the faculty of arts obtained the nucleus of
                    the college property; but it is not quite clear that the name of a college was
                    then, for the first time, conferred upon it. Two sets of records are preserved,
                    commencing with the origin of the university, one volume of which is entitled
                    “Annales <hi rend="italic">Collegii Facultatis Artium</hi> in Universitate
                    Glasguensi and if this title was prefixed to it so early as 1451, the college
                    must have existed as a corporate faculty before the charter of Lord Hamilton. It
                    is not however till 1462 that express mention is made of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Collegium Facultatis Artium;</hi> and it may be questioned if even at that time
                    the college was co-extensive with the faculty, and not rather a select body,
                    which assumed the government of the whole faculty, like the colleges of
                    faculties at Bologna. The exact imitation of all the customs of Bologna makes
                    the latter supposition probable. It is at least clear that at this early period
                    the term college had no reference to a building for common habitation or common
                    maintenance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Commissioners’ Report, p. 215. Malden, p. 156.</p></note></p>
                <p>The university remained in this state for about a hundred years, during which
                    time it appears, from the language of certain grants, that the university and
                    the college of the faculty of arts were frequently confounded. In the year 1557,
                    two years before the reformation, James Beaton, archbishop of Glasgow, conveyed
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Paedagogium,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">university,</hi>
                    and to the masters and regents in the same, an ecclesiastical benefice, which,
                    from the accompanying restrictions, was clearly intended for the benefit of the
                    whole university. Similar instances might be adduced. At what precise period the
                    two terms ceased to be used synonymously, and the existence of a separate
                    college to be recognised, does not appear.</p>
                <p>From its peculiar constitution, the university of Glasgow suffered more from the
                    change of religion at the reformation than the other learned seminaries of
                    Scotland. The professors in the higher faculties being all supported by their
                    livings in the church, and adhering to the old religion, successors could not be
                    appointed to them, owing to the total want of salaries. It likewise suffered
                    materially from the fraudulent alienation and unjust seizure of its slender
                    revenues.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>M‘Crie’s Life
                    of Melville, i. 70.</p></note> This evil was in some degree remedied in 1563 by
                    Queen Mary, who granted certain houses and lands for the benefit of the college
                    or university, and specially for the maintenance of five bursars. In 1572 the
                    magistrates of Glasgow granted a charter, which was confirmed by act of
                    parliament, conveying to the college certain church property for the support of
                    a professor of divinity, who was to be principal or provost, two regents of
                    philosophy, and twelve poor students. The regents and students were <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=551"

                    required to sign the Confession of Faith. It might be supposed that these gifts
                    would have been sufficient to place the college on a respectable footing; but it
                    appears that even then the whole funds did not exceed L.300 Scots, or L.25
                    sterling.</p>
                <p>Five years afterwards, James VI. new-modelled the constitution, and made a very
                    considerable addition to the revenue. The charter then granted forms the basis
                    of the present constitution, and is known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Nova
                    Erectio.</hi> According to it, the college was to consist of a principal and
                    three regents, to each of whom certain salaries were assigned, four poor
                    students, and servants. The principal, who was to have the ordinary jurisdiction
                    over the members of the college, and to reside there constantly, was to be a
                    proficient in sacred learning, and was required to lecture at least one hour a
                    day for five days in the week. He was to be nominated by the king; and failing
                    an appointment by the crown within thirty days, the election devolved upon the
                    chancellor, rector, dean of faculty, and five clergymen, including the minister
                    of Glasgow. The regents were to be elected by the rector, dean, and principal,
                    and were appointed each to a particular department of learning, a principle
                    which had never before been adopted in Scotland, instead of conducting the
                    students through all the branches of instruction included in the course. The
                    electors were invested with a visitorial power over the regents, and might
                    remove them. The principal, if negligent after three admonitions, was removable
                    by the rector, dean, and regents. The rector, dean, and minister of Glasgow were
                    to inspect and audit the accounts four times in the year, and to &lt;lirect the
                    surplus revenue to be applied to the necessary uses of the college. It is
                    obvious that the intention of this charter was to place the college under the
                    effectual superintendence of the university. In 1581, Archbishop Boyd granted to
                    the college an additional endowment for the support of a fourth regent, who is
                    believed to have been the professor of Greek. About the same time a new body of
                    statutes was framed by royal authority, which still regulates both the
                    university and college.</p>
                <p>The course of instruction prescribed by the <hi rend="italic">Nova Erectio</hi>
                    is an additional proof of the enlightened views entertained by the early leaders
                    of the Church of Scotland on the subject of public education; but having already
                    alluded to this subject in connection with the university of St Andrews, our
                    limits will not permit us to give it in detail. It may be sufficient to say,
                    that it embraced every improvement which the learning and experience of Andrew
                    Melville had been able to devise. Small fees, varying with the rank and standing
                    of the students, were to be paid at matriculation to the rector and beadle. New
                    students, as well as those who had attended the former year, were to be examined
                    in the beginning of October; and the examination of candidates for the degree of
                    master of arts was to be held on the third week of August. After due
                    examination, the dean and others were to decide on the qualifications of the
                    several candidates, and to arrange their names according to merit. The examiners
                    were to be the dean, principal, professors, and the master of the
                    grammar-school, all of whom were sworn to be faithful and impartial. Degrees
                    were to be solemnly conferred by the chancellor. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Honoraria</hi> were to be paid to the regents, according to the rank and
                    fortune of the students. Sons of the nobility and barons of Scotland were to pay
                    annually at least L.3; those of the second rank, who, though inferior to the
                    barons, possessed means sufficiently ample, were to pay L.2; those of the third
                    rank to pay L.l; the poor were to be admitted free of all charge.</p>
                <p>The constitution founded on the <hi rend="italic">Nova Erectio</hi> has at
                    different times been extended and improved by commissions of visitation. One
                    appointed by the General Assembly in 1639, and renewed in subsequent years,
                    recognised, in 1640, a class of humanity, and instituted a separate
                    professorship of divinity. In 1642, another professorship of divinity was
                    established by the university, and distinct departments of study were assigned
                    to the principal and the other two professors of this branch. A professorship of
                    medicine, which had existed for some time, was declared to be unnecessary. By
                    the same commission, strict regulations were made respecting the study of Greek
                    and Latin, the performance of public exercises, and the regularity of
                    attendance. The most material change effected on the constitution of James VI.
                    was this: “on the understanding that it was a disadvantage to students to change
                    their masters annually, it was required that every master, instead of continuing
                    to teach the same branch, should educate his own scholars through all the four
                    classes;"<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This mode of
                    conducting academical education was long followed in all the universities of

                    preference, continued to prevail at Aberdeen till 1800. Commissioners’ Report,

                <p>In 1727 a royal visitation made several important regulations, which have ever
                    since remained in force. It declared the right of electing a rector to be in all
                    the matriculated members, moderators, or masters and students; revised the
                    system of teaching introduced by the charter <hi rend="italic">of Nova
                    Erectio;</hi> and assigned permanent professors to the three classes of
                    philosophy. The <hi rend="italic">Semi</hi> Class was set apart for logic and
                    metaphysics, the <hi rend="italic">Bachelor</hi> Class for moral philosophy and
                    natural philosophy, and the <hi rend="italic">Magistrand</hi> Class for physics
                    and experimental philosophy. Besides the professors of humanity, Greek, and
                    philosophy, the visitation recognised pro fessors of divinity, law, medicine,
                    botany, anatomy, oriental languages, mathematics, and history, requiring them to
                    teach whenever five or more scholars presented themselves. The same commission
                    defined the powers of the faculty meetings, and sanctioned certain privileges
                    “which had been assumed by them in contradiction to the statutes, and which by
                    this time had passed into usages. As the meetings of the faculty were composed
                    only of professors, this interpretation tended to give the college greater power
                    of self-government, and to remove it from the control of the officers of the
                    university.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Malden, p.
                    159.</p></note></p>
                <p>The exclusive rights thus granted to the college were submitted to the Court of
                    Session in the years 1771 and 1772. The court declared that the whole revenue
                    and property of the college are vested in the principal and masters, and are not
                    subject to the control of the rector and his assessors. At the same time it
                    recognised the visitors appointed by the charter of foundation, and their right
                    to audit the college accounts, and to dispose of the surplus revenue. The right
                    of election to professorships, which the charter intrusted to the rector, dean,
                    and principal, was found to be in the rector, dean, and faculty meeting, or, in
                    other words, in the professors themselves. The distinctive privilege of
                    professors of the university, and of the college of Glasgow, was finally made in
                    1807, in a lawsuit which arose out of the appointment of a regius professor of
                    natural history. The incumbent claimed a right to participate in all the powers
                    and privileges of the faculty, and to be admitted as a member of the college,
                    which was resisted by that body. The Court of Session recognised the rank of the
                    incumbent as a professor in the university, but decreed that he was not a member
                    of the college, and not entitled to share its property, or to vote in any of its
                    meetings. This decision was acquiesced in by the crown; and, in all subsequent
                    appointments to regius professorships, restrictions have been introduced which
                    are intended to be in conformity with the deliverance of the court.</p>
                <p>The university at present consists of a chancellor, rector, dean of faculty,
                    principal, professors, and students. The business of the university is
                    transacted in three distinct meetings; those of the Senate <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Senatus Academicus),</hi> the Comitia or general Congregation, and the
                    Faculty. The <hi rend="italic">Senate</hi> consists of the rector, dean, members
                    of faculty, and the other professors. In this meeting the rector presides,
                    except when affairs are managed for which the dean is competent. Meetings of the
                    senate are held for the election and admission of the chancellor and dean of
                    faculty, the vice-chancellor and vice-rector, for electing a representative to
                    the General Assembly, for conferring degrees, for the management of the
                    libraries, and other matters belonging to the university. The constituent
                    members of the <hi rend="italic">Comitia</hi> are, the rector, dean, principal,
                    professors, and the matriculated students of the university. In this meeting the
                    rector or vice-rector presides. Meetings of the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi>
                    are held for the election and admission of the rector, for hearing public
                    disputations in any of the faculties previously to the conferring of degrees,
                    for the admission of professors, and for promulgating the laws and other acts of
                    the university and college courts. The <hi rend="italic">Meeting of Faculty, or
                    College Meeting,</hi> consists of the principal and professors of divinity,
                    ecclesiastical history, oriental languages, natural philosophy, moral
                    philosophy, mathematics, logic, Greek, humanity, civil law, medicine, anatomy,
                    and practical astronomy. In this meeting the principal presides, and has a <hi
                    rend="italic">casting,</hi> but not a <hi rend="italic">deliberative</hi> vote.
                    The members of the faculty have the administration of the whole revenue and
                    property of the college, with the exception of a few particular bequests, in
                    which the rector and other officers of the university are specially named. Along
                    with the rector and dean, they exercise the patronage of eight professorships,
                    which is vested in the college.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The Chancellor, who is the highest officer in the university, is elected by the
                    senate. As at St Andrews, he is usually a nobleman, and he holds his appointment
                    for life. The chancellor nominates<pb break="no"

                    deputy or vice-chancellor, and by himself or deputy has the sole privilege of
                    conferring degrees on persons found qualified by the senate.</p>
                <p>The Rector is elected by the comitia, divided into nations, according to the act
                    of visitation in 1727 This office in ancient times was invariably held by a
                    clergyman; and it was not till 1717 that the royal commission ordered that the
                    rector should not be a minister, nor bear any other office in the university. By
                    the statutes, the rector is an annual magistrate; but it has long been customary
                    to re-elect the same person for a second year. His duties were formerly
                    important; but the practice of electing men distinguished in literature and
                    politics, who are non-resident, has led to the remiss and inefficient discharge
                    of them. The rector nominates a vice-rector, generally a professor, who in his
                    absence is entitled to preside in the senate and comitia, and to exercise the
                    other duties of the office, with the exception of the visitorial power.</p>
                <p>The Dean of Faculties is elected by the senate, and generally holds his office
                    for two years. He is entitled to exercise a superintendence over the studies,
                    and, in conjunction with the masters, to judge of the qualifications of
                    candidates for degrees.</p>
                <p>The Principal, who must be a minister of the church of Scotland, is appointed by
                    the crown. In right of his office he is primarius professor of divinity; but the
                    duty of teaching has long been discontinued. He is the head of the college,
                    presides in all meetings of the faculty, and exercises the ordinary
                    superintendence of the deportment of all members of the university.</p>
                <p>The other officers are, a Factor, appointed by the college to collect the
                    revenue, keep accounts, &amp;c., who must not be principal, a professor, or
                    master, in the university; a librarian, janitor, beadle, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the original foundation, the Faculties of theology, the canon law, the civil
                    law, and the arts, are expressly enumerated; and medicine and music, though not
                    specified, are implied. Soon after the erection of the university, some efforts
                    were made to teach the canon and civil law, and professors of divinity are
                    occasionally men. tioned; but till the reformation there seems to have been no
                    regular course of instruction, except in the faculty of arts. The university now
                    contains four faculties; those of arts, theology, law, and medicine. The faculty
                    of law is confined to the single professor of the civil law; the other faculties
                    have the usual complement of professors. The professors of Greek, logic, moral
                    and natural philosophy, whose chairs were earliest endowed, are denominated
                    regents, and enjoy, in right of their regency, certain trifling privileges. The
                    regius professors, whose chairs have been recently founded and endowed by the
                    crown, are members of the senate only, and not of the faculty of the
                    college.</p>
                <p>The Revenues of the university and college are derived from estates, tithes, and
                    bequests, and, with some unimportant exceptions, are administered by the
                    principal and professors of the college, under the control of the ordinary
                    visitors. The <hi rend="italic">gross</hi> revenue, including royal grants,
                    which together make L.510, amounted in 1824 to L.9916. 18s. 3d. From this fund
                    the principal and thirteen faculty professors receive their salaries; the others
                    are endowed by grants from the crown.</p>
                <p>Connected with the college are twenty-nine foundations for Bursaries, whose
                    benefit extends to about sixty-five students. Their average annual value is L.1
                    165. 10s. 4d.; the highest being L.50, and the lowest L.4. 10s∙; and they are
                    tenable for periods varying from three to eight years. Besides the bursaries,
                    the principal and professors of the college possess the right of nominating
                    students, natives of Scotland, who have attended two sessions at the university
                    of Glasgow, or one session there and two at some other Scotish university, to
                    ten exhibitions at Balliol College, Oxford, on the foundation of John Snell.
                    Each exhibition is of the yearly value of L.132, and lasts for ten years.
                    Another foundation, by John Warner, bishop of Rochester, of L.20 a year, to each
                    of four Scotish students at the same college, during their residence at Oxford,
                    is generally given to the Glasgow exhibitioners; so that four of them have an
                    income of L. 152. Warner’s exhibitions are in the gift of the archbishop of
                    Canterbury and the bishop of Rochester, who usually nominate on the
                    recommendation of the master of Balliol College.</p>
                <p>The Session commences on the 10th of October, and ends in the beginning of May.
                    The only lectures delivered in summer are those of the professor of botany,
                    whose course continues front the 20th of April till the 20111 of July.</p>
                <p>Students in the faculty of arts may enter either the humanity <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> or Greek class, and must proceed regularly to the
                    logic, moral philosophy, and natural philosophy, in order to their obtaining
                    degrees, or being admitted to the classes of divinity. Such as are not natives
                    of Scotland may enter the logic class in the first year if found qualified.
                    There is no examination previously to admission; but soon after the commencement
                    of the session, the students of Greek, logic, moral and natural philosophy, are
                    publicly examined on the subject of their studies in the preceding year. This is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Blackstone Examination,</hi> and takes place in
                    presence of the principal, the professor whose class is proposed to be entered,
                    and of all others who choose to attend.</p>
                <p>The ordinary academical Discipline is conducted by the principal and the five
                    professors of the Gown classes, viz. the professors of humanity, Greek, logic,
                    moral and natural philosophy, who meet with the students on the Saturdays in the
                    common hall, and take cognizance of all petty delinquencies. Punishments are
                    inflicted by admonition, fine, and sometimes by extra exercises. Cases of a
                    graver character are brought before the faculty and rectorial court, whose
                    jurisdiction extends even to expulsion. The professors are at due pains to
                    enforce regular attendance, and to stimulate the industry of the students. All
                    students, except those who obtain dispensations, are required to attend divine
                    worship every Sunday in the college chapel. The students of languages and
                    philosophy wear gowns of scarlet cloth or frieze.</p>
                <p>The number of students in session 1839-40 was 940; Graduates in arts, 28; in
                    medicine, 66; in surgery, 13; in divinity, 6; in law, 2. The fees for graduation
                    in arts are L.3. ls.; in divinity, L.20; in medicine, L.25. 3s.; for LL.B. L.L0,
                    and for L.L. D. L.20.</p>

                <p>The fee here given in the Greek class is that for the public class. The fee for
                    the private class is L.1. 1s., and attendance is free after two sessions. The

                    the experimental course L.2. 2s. The professor of natural history has a class of
                    mineralogy, the fee for which is L∙1. 10s. 6d. The fee for the class of Scotish
                    law, which is taught by the professor of the civil law, is L.4. 4s. Part of the
                    salaries of the principal and the professors of divinity is payable in grain,

                    erected by the college: the expense of keeping them in repair, the taxes, and

                <p> UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN.</p>
                <p>The university of Aberdeen was founded in 1494, by a bull of Pope Alexander VI.,
                    issued on the representation of James IV., who was desirous to extend the
                    advantages of education to the northern districts of his kingdom. The papal
                    edict authorized the erection of a <hi rend="italic">studium generale et
                    universitas studii generalis,</hi> in the city of Aberdeen, for teaching
                    divinity, the canon and civil law, medicine, and the liberal arts; and conferred
                    upon it all the privileges and immunities which were enjoyed by the universities
                    of Paris and Bologna. The university was to consist of a chancellor, who was to
                    be the bishop of Aberdeen, a rector, and doctors of faculties, and was invested
                    with the power of conferring degrees, which were to be considered valid
                    throughout Christendom. Two years after, on the publication of the deed of
                    erection, the king granted a charter in favour of the university, bestowing upon
                    it certain ecclesiastical funds for the support of its members, and
                    communicating to it all the rights, liberties, and advantages which his
                    ancestors had given to St Andrews and Glasgow. Its privileges were finally
                    established by a papal bull issued in 1500. In erecting this new seminary, the
                    model of Paris seems to have been mainly followed. The supposts were divided
                    into four nations, who seem to have elected their procurators (<hi rend="italic"
                    >procuratores gentium)</hi>; but they took no further part in elections, or in
                    the government of the university, the procurators acting as their
                    representatives.</p>
                <p>In 1505, William Elphinstone, bishop of the diocese, for the purpose of
                    increasing the revenues of the new university, and enlarging the number of its
                    members, founded and endowed a college in honour of the Trinity and the Virgin
                    Mary, which was in the following year confirmed by the head of the church, and
                    soon after by the reigning monarch. The college was to consist of thirty-six
                    ordinary members, the chief of whom was to be a doctor or licentiate of
                    divinity, who was to be styled principal, and to whom all the members were to
                    yield obedience. Next to him were doctors and licentiates of the canon and civil
                    law and medicine; a master of arts, who was to be regent and sub-principal; and
                    another who was to teach the elements of literature. Besides these there were
                    five masters of arts, students of divinity, who were to retain their
                    appointments for a limited number of years, and thirteen poor scholars of
                    respectable talents and proficiency, who were to be students of arts. All the
                    members, with the exception of the doctor of medicine, were to be ecclesiastics,
                    and were required to live within the college. The rector of the university, if
                    not a member of the college, and if he was, the dean of the faculty of arts, and
                    the official of Aberdeen, were constituted visitors, with power to remedy
                    whatever was found defective.</p>
                <p>A new erection was prepared by the bishop, and officially published in 1531,
                    increasing the number of the members of the college, improving their comforts,
                    and introducing a more efficient system of instruction. By this new charter,
                    which, though modified by time and circumstances, still regulates, in a great
                    degree, the form and practice of the university, the members of the seminary
                    were to be forty-two. The first class consisted of four doctors; a doctor of
                    divinity, who was to be principal, and whom all the other members were
                    respectfully to obey; and doctors of the canon and civil law, and medicine, or
                    licentiates if doctors could not be found. In the second class were eight
                    masters of arts, the first of whom, skilled in philosophy and the arts, was to
                    be sub-principal; the second was to be conversant in poetry, grammar, and
                    rhetoric; and the other six, from whom the regents were to be elected, were to
                    be students of divinity, and to retain their appointments for six years. The
                    next class was formed of students of law, who were to study the civil law, and
                    to attend the lectures delivered on that subject. All these, with the exception
                    of the doctor of medicine, were to belong to the priesthood, and were
                    occasionally to say mass for the founders. There were, besides, thirteen
                    students of arts, retaining their endowments for three years and a half, the
                    usual curriculum in that faculty; and eight prebendaries, who were to attend to
                    sacred music, one of them being styled Cantor, and another Sacrist, and six boys
                    for the choir. For all these accommodation was to be provided in the college.
                    The revenues were placed under the charge of a procurator or factor, who was to
                    be appointed by the principal officers of the college.</p>
                <p>The principal was to be elected by the rector of the university, the procurators,
                    doctors, sub-principal, regents of arts, humanist, theological students, cantor,
                    and sacrist, and to be admitted by the chancellor. His duties were to govern the
                    college, to preside in its meetings, to direct the regents in the delivery of
                    their lectures, and to punish such as were deficient in their duty, to profess
                    every day in philosophy and the arts, and to give lectures in divinity to the
                    people six days in the year. The doctors, who were to be appointed by nearly the
                    same electors, were likewise to be admitted by the chancellor, and to lecture to
                    the students, each on the subjects belonging to his faculty. The election and
                    admission of the sub-principal and humanist were to be conducted in a similar
                    manner. The former was required to lecture in philosophy and the arts <hi
                    rend="italic">quolibet legibili die,</hi> to instruct the students in manners
                    and virtue, to preside at public disputations among the students, to inflict
                    fines on such as absented themselves from divine worship, and, along with the
                    principal, to take a general superintendence of the affairs of the college. The
                    students of theology and the arts were to be elected by the sub-principal, the
                    regents, and the doctors of faculties, and admitted by the principal. The
                    theological students were required to apply themselves to the study of their
                    science, and to be qualified within three years to take their bachelor’s degree.
                    Their places, when vacant, were to be filled up from the students of arts. The
                    college was exempted from all civic burdens.</p>
                <p>From this statement it appears that the northern seminary closely resembled in
                    its constitution the colleges of St Andrews and Glasgow. The connection between
                    the college and the university is distinctly marked in the charter of
                    foundation, in which it is recommended that the permanent and higher offices
                    should be supplied from the inferior members if they were qualified, if not,
                    from the members of the university of Aberdeen; and failing these, recourse was
                    to be had to other universities. As at Oxford, Cambridge, and St Andrews,
                    however, the university has disappeared, and the incorporated and endowed
                    college only remains. The college is co-extensive with the university, or rather
                    the university is confined to the limits of the college; nor is any distinction
                    between them preserved, as at Glasgow.</p>
                <p>This college remained in nearly the same state for more than a century, without
                    however escaping the deterioration which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=554" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0554-0516"
                    />seems to be incident to all exclusive bodies. In 1619 Bishop Forbes obtained a
                    commission of visitation, by which the abuses that had gradually been engendered
                    were reformed, and the original foundation, with some exceptions, restored. By
                    the introduction of the reformed religion, some of the offices were rendered
                    unnecessary; and accordingly the General Assembly, in 1639, ordered those of the
                    canonist and cantor to be abolished. After the abolition of episcopacy, Charles
                    I. resolved to apply part of the revenues of the different sees to the support
                    of the universities, and appointed a commission to inquire into the state of
                    those of Old and New Aberdeen; the result of which was his executing a charter,
                    uniting them as one university, under the name of King Charles’s University of
                    Aberdeen.” The colleges however continued distinct, and are separately
                    recognised in the act of 1641, by which the grant of the rents of the bishopric
                    of Aberdeen was ratified; nor do they appear ever to have acted together as one
                    university. Bishop Elphinstone’s seminary has since retained the name of King’s
                    College. Another attempt to form both into one university was made about the
                    year 1784, which after long negociation and discussion was abandoned; and a
                    similar result is likely to attend the labours of the commission appointed in
                    1836 and 1837.</p>
                <p>From the period of its institution down to the earlier part of the last century,
                    various improvements were introduced by royal and parliamentary commissions. The
                    General Assembly also extended its jurisdiction to the college; and the
                    chancellor of the university and the ordinary visitors appear to have watched
                    over its interests. In what manner the rector and his assessors were elected,
                    and how frequently their visitations took place, are unknown for a period of 129
                    years after the institution of the college. Subsequently this court appears to
                    have been efficient, and to have been instrumental, in several instances, in
                    giving effect to improved plans of education. The senate, consisting of the
                    reguar officers of the college, likewise applied themselves to the same laudable
                    object, and from time to time introduced such alterations as a change of
                    circumstances or the advancement of knowledge rendered necessary. About the year
                    1620 a professorship of divinity was instituted by the college, and was
                    confirmed two years after by royal charter. Weckly discourses on catechetical
                    doctrine were established; and in 1764 a professorship of oriental languages was
                    founded, for which an endowment out of the bishops’ rents was afterwards
                    obtained. In 1753 the teaching of the elements of Latin was abolished, and the
                    scholarship of the class raised to the standard of the other universities. In
                    the same year, the senate, taking into consideration the whole state of the
                    college, approved of certain statutes intended to regulate the length of the
                    session, the management of the bursaries, and the plan of instruction. On this
                    last head, after mature deliberation, it was determined, chiefly, it is alleged,
                    through the influence of the celebrated Dr Reid, who was at that time one of the
                    regents, that the old system of the same regent conducting the students through
                    the whole course should be continued, as at once more beneficial to the
                    students, and more advantageous to the cause of literature and science. And it
                    is a curious fact, that the system thus sanctioned by high authority prevailed
                    till the year 1800, when the practice of the other universities was here
                    introduced.</p>
                <p>The university and college at present consist of a chancellor, rector, principal,
                    sub-principal, and nine professors; the office of sub-principal being always
                    held by one of the professors. The college contains the four faculties, and, as
                    at St Andrews and Glasgow, the senate, besides managing the business of the
                    college, and administering the revenues, exercises the patronage of certain
                    academical offices. The chancellor and rector are appointed by the senate. The
                    office of the rector is annual: his four assessors, who constitute his court,
                    are elected by the senate at the same time with himself. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >procuratores gentium</hi> are called into existence only for the purpose of
                    assisting in the election of certain office-bearers, and are then appointed by
                    the senate. The office of dean of faculty has also fallen into desuetude,
                    excepting in the case of a vacancy in the professorship of divinity, when a dean
                    of the faculty of divinity is chosen by the senate, he being by the charter
                    nominated one of the electors. The principal and sub-principal are elected by
                    the rector, procurators, and professors, and admitted by the chancellor. The
                    principal presides in the meetings of the college, but has long ceased to take
                    any part in academical instruction. The sub-principal presides in the meetings
                    of the faculty of arts, and, in the absence of the principal, in the meetings of
                    the senate, and collects the fines imposed on the students for any breach of
                    discipline.</p>
                <p>The Revenue of the college arises from certain properties acquired under the
                    foundation charters, from others obtained subsequent to the dates of these
                    charters, and from royal grants. A great part, of the original grants consisted
                    of tithes, which, being subject to the burden of supporting the parochial
                    clergy, have been much diminished. The total nett revenue for 1836 amounted to
                    L.2364, the royal grants being L.1148. 6s. 8d. King’s College possesses
                    thirty-two foundations for bursaries, the benefit of which is extended to 134
                    students. Their aggregate value amounts to L.1771∙ 13s. 10d., and they vary from
                    L.50 to L.5 and under. About eighty of these are open to public competition. The
                    bursars are required to attend the junior humanity and Greek classes during the
                    first session, and at the commencement of the following session are examined as
                    to the proficiency which they have made in these languages during the vacation.
                    They are also admitted to all the classes on the payment of modified fees in
                    proportion to the amount of their bursaries.</p>
                <p>The Session commences on the first Monday of November, the previous week being
                    employed in deciding, by comparative trial, the vacant bursaries in the gift of
                    the college, and in ascertaining the attainments of the bursars presented by
                    private patrons. It terminates at the end of twenty-one weeks. It has long
                    ceased to be the practice of the students to live within the walls of the
                    college; and the discipline of the professors is therefore chiefly confined to
                    the class room. Strict attendance is enforced, and various methods are adopted
                    to fix the attention of the students on the subjects of study. The regular fees
                    exigible from the students who do not hold bursaries are, for the classes of
                    Greek, mathematics, moral and natural philosophy, L.3. 3s.; first humanity and
                    second Greek classes, 10s.; second humanity class, 15s.; chemistry and natural
                    history, L. 1.1 ls. 6d.; oriental languages, L. 1. 1 1s. 6d.; civil law, L.1.
                    ls. These fees are modified, in the case of bursars, in proportion to the amount
                    of the bursaries. An academical dress is prescribed by the charter of
                    foundation, and is still imperative on all students except those of medicine and
                    divinity. The students are required to attend the college chapel; but a
                    dispensation is granted to all who produce a written request from their parents
                    or guardians.</p>

                <p>MARISCHAL COLLEGE.</p>
                <p>Marischal College, in New Aberdeen, was founded by the Earl Marischal, under
                    royal authority, in 1593; and in the same month received the sanction of the
                    General Assembly. In July following it was ratified by an act of parliament,
                    which granted to it all the privileges and jurisdiction appertaining to any free
                    college within the realm, but, contrary to the ancient practice, subjected all
                    its members to the jurisdiction of the magistrates of the city, in all things
                    done or committed by them beyond the walls of the college. The college was
                    denominated an <hi rend="italic">Academy,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Seminary of
                    Learning,</hi> and was to consist of a chancellor, rector, dean of faculty,
                    principal, three regents, six alumni, and two inferior persons to manage the
                    internal affairs of the seminary. The principal was to superintend the whole
                    establishment, and to exercise jurisdiction over all its members; being invested
                    with the power of censuring the regents, and of expelling them from the college,
                    with the concurrence of the rector and dean, after three admonitions. He was to
                    be well instructed in sacred literature and in the learned languages,
                    particularly in Hebrew and Syriac, and was required occasionally to teach
                    divinity, anatomy, physiology, the principles of geography, chronology, and
                    astronomy, and the elements of Hebrew grammar and construction; duties
                    presupposing an extent of acquirement which the founder would have some
                    difficulty in obtaining. He was also invested with the power of conferring
                    degrees in arts on such as he deemed worthy of the distinction. The first regent
                    was required to teach the elements of arithmetic and geometry, and the sciences
                    of ethics and politics; the second was to teach the principles of logic, and to
                    exercise the students in writing and declaiming in Latin and Greek; and the
                    third, who was the lowest, was appointed to teach Greek, combining with it,
                    during the first six months, Latin composition, afterwards the writing of Greek,
                    and adding a short account of the elementary principles of logic. It thus
                    appears that, from the commencement of the college, the regents had particular
                    professions assigned to them; and it was expressly ordained that no regent
                    should undertake a new professorship. The Earl Marischal reserved to himself and
                    his heirs the patronage of the professorships; the examination and admission of
                    the persons nominated being vested in the chancellor if he were a clergyman, the
                    rector, dean, the principal of King’s College, and three clergymen,· including
                    the minister of Aberdeen. By the forfeiture of the Marischal family, the
                    patronage devolved upon the crown. The election of the bursars was likewise
                    retained by the founder, and their admission vested in the members of the
                    college. No vacation was allowed; and, that the members of the college might
                    devote themselves exclusively to their respective duties, they were prohibited
                    from holding any public office, and even from acting as rector or dean of
                    faculty.</p>
                <p>The chancellor, rector, and dean, were instructed to visit the college three
                    times a year, for the purpose of correcting whatever might be wrong in doctrine
                    or discipline. The rector was to be elected by all the students, through the
                    medium of procurators appointed by them when divided into four nations, to have
                    jurisdiction over the college, and to preside in its meetings, after taking the
                    oath of office. The dean of faculty was to be elected by the senate and the
                    minister of Aberdeen; his duties being to preside at examinations, to administer
                    the oath of fidelity to the examiners, and to take cognizance of the doctrine
                    and diligence of the regents. He was invested with all the privileges belonging
                    to the dean of faculty nt St Andrews, or in any other university. A charter of
                    confirmation was granted by William Earl Marischal in 1623, and a new
                    confirmation was given by Charles II. in 1661. It is a curious fact, that,
                    neither in the charter of foundation, nor in any of the acts of parliament which
                    relate to the college, is it recognised as a separate university. It
                    nevertheless confers degrees in all the faculties, founding, as it seems
                    unquestionably entitled to do, on the clause in the first act of confirmation,
                    by which it acquired all the privileges belonging to any <hi rend="italic"
                    >college</hi> within the realm.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the precautions of the founder, innovations were soon macle on
                    the constitution of the college. A few years after its institution, another
                    regent was appointed, additional members were admitted, and each professor, in
                    conformity with the general practice, conducted his students through the whole
                    course. In 1700 the privy council of Scotland assigned the Greek department to
                    one professor; and in 1703 the system was finally altered by the senate. A
                    professorship of mathematics was founded about 1613, and in 1616 a professorship
                    of divinity. From this time the principal seems to have confined himself to the
                    superintendence of the business and discipline of the college. The state of the
                    college was the subject of frequent visitations appointed by the king, the privy
                    council, and the parliament, by means of which, and by the interposition of the
                    senate, a system of instruction differing but little from that which at present
                    prevails was at a comparatively early period introduced.</p>
                <p>Marischal College at present consists of a chancellor, rector, dean of faculty,
                    principal, and thirteen professors. No division of the professors into faculties
                    has ever been made. When degrees are conferred, promoters in the different
                    faculties are appointed. The rector and his assessors, four in number, are
                    elected annually by the students, according to the charter of foundation; but as
                    it is the usual practice to elect a distinguished individual who is nonresident,
                    the extensive powers which belong to the office have long been in abeyance. The
                    dean of faculty is annually appointed by the senate and the minister of
                    Aberdeen. The senate consists of the chancellor, rector, dean, principal, and
                    professors. The first three are seldom present, and the affairs of the college
                    are conducted by the ordinary members.</p>
                <p>The Revenue of the college, including L.550. 6s. 8d. annually granted by the
                    crown, amounted in 1836 to L.1638. 9s. 2d., to which must now be added the
                    endowment of the chair of humanity, which is to be L.200. There are forty-five
                    foundations for bursaries, for the benefit of 115 students. Their aggregate
                    value is about L.1160 annually; and they vary from L.30 to L..5 and under.
                    Sixty-seven of them are open to public competition; the patronage of the others
                    is vested in societies, and in private individuals. The two highest are awarded,
                    by comparative trial, for excellence in mathematics, to students who have
                    completed two sessions.</p>
                <p>The Session in arts commences with a competition for bursaries on the last Monday
                    of October, and ends on the first Friday of April. The session in the other
                    faculties is somewhat shorter. Lectures in botany and conveyancing are given in
                    summer. Toward the end of the session, the students in arts are examined in the
                    public hall in presence of the principal and professors.</p>
                <p>The professors have the power of correcting any impropriety of conduct in their
                    respective classes, by the imposition of a fine, or by expulsion from the class;
                    but an appeal may be made to the senate, the rectorial court, and the
                    chancellor. A public school, consisting of all members of the college, is
                    assembled once a fortnight, for the purpose of investigating and correcting any
                    breach of discipline. The bursars, as in King’s College, must attend the
                    curriculum in a particular order, and are examined at the commencement of each
                    session before they are admitted to higher classes. The students who intend to
                    graduate in arts are required to undergo an entrance-examination; and before
                    obtaining their degree, are examined on all the branches of the course,
                    including the evidences of Christianity. For ten years preceding December 1840,
                    candidates for the degree of doctor in medicine were required to take the
                    preliminary degree of master of arts. By the present regulations this
                    restriction has been removed, and an improved course of study prescribed.</p>
                <p>The number of students in 1839-40 was 351; Graduates in arts, 21; in divinity, 0;
                    in law, <hi rend="italic">2;</hi> in medicine, 2.</p>
                <p>The fees for graduation in arts are, to alumni of the college. L.2. 14s. 8d.; to
                    those who are not alumni, L.8; in divinity and law, L.15; in medicine, for Μ. B.
                    L.l, for Μ. D. L.ll.</p>

                    foundation, patronage, and the total emoluments of those which existed in

                <p> UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH.</p>
                <p>the university of Edinburgh owes its origin to James VI. In 1582 “the wise
                    monarch” granted a charter, empowering the lord provost, magistrates, and
                    council of the city to repair and build houses for the reception and habitation
                    of professors and students of the liberal arts, humanity, philosophy, divinity,
                    medicine, law, and any other liberal sciences <hi rend="italic">(quarumeungue
                    aliarum liberalium scientiarum).</hi> The same charter constitutes the municipal
                    authorities, with the advice of the ministers <hi rend="italic">(cum avisamenlo
                    ministrorum),</hi> electors of all the professors, with the power of dismissing
                    them should they find it necessary; and, with strange inconsistency, prohibits
                    all persons not admitted by the patrons from professing or teaching any of the
                    sciences within the liberties of the city. The king, who was ambitious of being
                    commemorated as the founder and greatest benefactor of this literary
                    establishment, inserted in the charter an imposing list of ecclesiastical
                    properties for its support, which however were found to possess little more than
                    a nominal value. Even the ground on which the college was built (the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kirk of Field)</hi> could only be obtained by purchase from a
                    menial servant of the king, who had acquired a title to it; and, in like manner,
                    the other royal benefactions proved in a great measure delusive.<note

                    and the patrons, being unfettered by the minute prescriptions contained in the
                    foundation charters of the older universities, have had fewer difficulties to
                    encounter in adapting it to the existing state of philosophy and science.</p>
                <p>The design of founding a college in the metropolis had been contemplated by the
                    magistrates within two years after the reformation; but their endeavours were
                    thwarted by the bishops, who were jealous of the reputation and prosperity of
                    the seminaries placed under their immediate and official protection.<note

                    certain ecclesiastical property within the city, to be applied, among other
                    things, for “collegis for leirning and upbringing of ye youth but received an
                    evasive answer. Renewing their application the following year, they obtained a
                    grant of “the Kirk-of-Field, to big ane schule but seem to have been prevented
                    from carrying their design into effect. It was not till 1579 that successful
                    measures were adopted. In this year the magistrates, encouraged by the ministers
                    and other public-spirited individuals in the city, commenced building apartments
                    for the accommodation of professors and students, and three years after obtained
                    from the crown the charter of erection and confirmation. The chief promoter of
                    the design was James Lawson, the successor of Knox as minister of Edinburgh, by
                    whose recommendation Robert Rollock, one of the regents at St Andrews, and a man
                    of high intellectual endowments, was selected in 1583 to fill the arduous
                    situation of first and indeed sole regent in the new institution. The college
                    was accordingly opened in October 1583, under the newly appointed regent; the
                    number of students, who, as in the other universities, probably all belonged to
                    the faculty of arts, was eighty-four. Rollock was engaged only for a year, with
                    a promise of continuance and promotion if he conducted himself faithfully, and
                    complied with the rules and injunctions of the patrons. His salary was to be
                    L.40 Scots, or L.3. 6s. 8d., with a quarterly allowance of L.30 Scots for board,
                    in addition to the fees to be paid by the students. According to the contract,
                    he was to receive “for a year’s education to the sons of burgesses, L.2 Scots,
                    and to others at least L.3 Scots; a small sum, apparently, but not
                    disproportionate to the scale on which the professor was maintained.”<note

                    xv.</p></note> This rate of fees continued till 1595, when the town council
                    ordained that the sons of gentlemen not burgesses of Edinburgh should pay L.8
                    Scots a year, and the sons of burgesses half that sum.</p>
                <p>A second regent was appointed soon after the opening of the college; and in 1586,
                    the town council, “having sufficient proif and experience of the lyfe and
                    conversatioun” of Rollock, “and of his qualificatioun and learning,” constituted
                    him principal master, with all the emoluments of the appointment, committing to
                    him all the authority vested in the principal of any college in the universities
                    of the realm, and subjecting to his jurisdiction the regents established or to
                    be established, with all other members of the college. He was required to attend
                    to their doctrine and conversation, and to punish delinquents; but the council
                    reserved to themselves the right of deposition, and of enacting statutes for the
                    regulation of the seminary. A third regent was nominated in the same year, a
                    fourth in 1589, and in 1597 a regent of humanity. Till 1620 the principal was
                    regarded as professor of divinity, and his prelections were confined to that
                    department. In this year a second professor of divinity was appointed; but
                    several of the succeeding principals continued to read theological lectures.
                    Those of Dr Leighton were published after his death.</p>
                <p>The charter of erection was soon (1584) followed by another, in which the king,
                    gratified by the success of the new seminary, conveyed to the magistrates and
                    council certain property for its support. In 1612 another charter was granted by
                    the king, ratifying those which had previously been given; and in 1621, an act
                    of the Scotish parliament was passed, confirming various grants of property
                    which had been made to the town of Edinburgh for the support of the institution.

                    />constitution which the college possesses, deserves particular notice. After
                    detailing the establishment of the college, and the purposes for which it was
                    instituted, the grants made for carrying these into effect, the expense incurred
                    by the city in erecting the buildings, and various bequests made by
                    well-disposed persons for the support of the professors, the act declares the
                    anxious desire of the king for the increase of learning within the borough, his
                    willingness to confirm the former grants made to the college, and to extend to
                    it all the immunities enjoyed by any other college within the realm, and
                    ratifies and approves the infeftments previously granted by his majesty under
                    his great seal, “togidder with the erection of the said gryit ludging, manss,
                    and hous of the Kirk-of-Feild, in ane colledge for professioun of theologie,
                    philosophie, and humanitie.” The ratification concludes by declaring that the
                    college shall “in all tyme to cum be callit King James Colledge,” and conferring
                    on the magistrates as patrons, and the rectors, regents, bursars, and students,
                    “all liberties, fredoms, immunities, and priviledges, appertening to ane free
                    colledge, and that in als ample forme and lairge maner as any colledge hes or
                    bruikis within this his majestie’s realme.” It is true that the term <hi
                    rend="italic">university</hi> is not applied to the seminary, either in this act
                    or in the royal charter of 1582; but the clause which has just been quoted
                    confers upon it all the powers and privileges of a university, and these
                    necessarily involve the name.</p>
                <p>From the first institution of the college, the town council, with the advice of
                    the ministers and some eminent lawyers, regulated the mode of teaching, the
                    discipline, the fees, and the accommodation of the students. Students were
                    admitted on application to a magistrate, under whose authority they were
                    enrolled; as in other universities, they were matriculated by the rector or
                    principal. It was the intention of the founders that all the students should
                    lodge within the walls of the college, and wear an academical dress. The annual
                    rent of a chamber to a stranger student, having a bed to himself, was L.4 Scots;
                    for which sum the town furnished seats, beds, tables, and shelves. Students
                    whose parents were burgesses paid no rent, but furnished the rooms at their own
                    expense. The increase of numbers gradually put a stop to this practice. So
                    lately, however, as the year 1710, the English dissenters offered to contribute
                    L.1000 a year, for the support of a <hi rend="italic">hospitium,</hi> on
                    condition that their students might participate in the benefit.<note

                <p>The system of instruction originally pursued in the university did not differ
                    materially from that of the other Scotish universities. Each of the four regents
                    conducted his students, during the four years they remained under his care, over
                    the entire curriculum of literature and philosophy, while the prelections of the
                    principal were confined to theology. The following interesting account of the
                    course of study and early discipline is given by Principal Lee.<note

                    xxviii-xxx.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> “During the first year,
                    about six months were spent chiefly in the study of the Greek and Roman
                    classics, accompanied by fre. quent exercises in translation and original
                    composition. The remainder of the session was occupied in the study of the
                    Dialectics of Ramus, without however discontinuing the reading of Greek and
                    Latin authors, and committing to memory and reciting large portions of the
                    ancient poets and orators. In the second year, besides being exercised in Greek
                    themes and versions, the students proceeded in the study of logic, rhetoric, and
                    some part of mathematics. The philosophical works of Aristotle were not
                    neglected; and in the later months of the session, the practice of oratory was
                    encouraged by public declamations. The third session, carrying forward the
                    public studies and classical learning, introduced the youth to the knowledge of
                    some branches of natural history and philosophy, and gave every one an
                    opportunity of becoming acquainted with the elements of the Hebrew tongue. In
                    the fourth session, ethics, physics, and metaphysics formed the principal object
                    of study; but great part of the time was occupied in the practice of
                    disputation. The regent prescribed the subject, and every candidate was matched
                    with an antagonist, with whom it was necessary •or him to carry on a debate in
                    presence of his teacher. The regents were required to exercise a habitual
                    inspection of their charge, both in the public class and in the hours of
                    recreation in the fields. The principal was bound to maintain a daily
                    superintendence, presiding in the public devotions, and keeping a watchful eye
                    over all the regents, students, and officers of the establishment, so that, when
                    admonition or discipline was required, it might not be omitted or postponed till
                    insubordination and irregularity became inveterate or scandalous Every Lord’s
                    day was partly employed in the religious instruction of the students in their
                    private classes, and chiefly in the public solemnities of divine worship.” This
                    course of study, which must have obtained the sanction of the patrons, goes far
                    to justify the powers which had been vested in them by the charter of erection;
                    and when carried into effect by the energy of the regents, readily accounts for
                    the celebrity which the metropolitan university early acquired. The practice of
                    each regent teaching the same class during the whole period of the course was
                    discontinued in 1708, in consequence of a regulation by the parliamentary
                    commission of visitation appointed in 1690. Since that time every professor has
                    been limited to one particular department.</p>
                <p>“The most striking circumstance,” say the royal commissioners,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Report, pp. 99,
                    100.</p></note> in the establishment of the university of Edinburgh, is, “that
                    it is not erected into an independent seminary, but is subjected, in all
                    essentia) points, to the provost, magistrates, and council of the city. To them
                    is committed the superintendence of it, the appointment of the professors, and
                    the privilege of removing them when so strong a step seemed expedient. The whole
                    body is enjoined to obey the regulations emanating from the council; and even
                    the powers of the principal are limited by the same authority. In fact, to the
                    college, as a college, nothing seems to be given but immunities and privileges
                    common to the other universities, and which do not seem to have any reference to
                    its internal administration. No senatus academicus, or college meeting, with
                    special authority to regulate the course of education, is recognised. Every
                    thing specified is granted with a view to the magistrates and council; and in
                    the only clause which may seem to imply that the college received a separate and
                    independent jurisdiction, the mode in which it is introduced evinces that this
                    could not have been the case.” Accordingly, the council have always claimed and
                    exercised the privileges which are conferred on them by the charter.</p>
                <p>The number of professors, which in 1620 was seven, including the principal, was
                    raised in 1708 to fifteen, one of whom was professor of Greek, the study of that
                    language being required of all students of arts after the reformation. The
                    present number is thirty-three. The right of instituting new professorships is
                    vested in the patrons; and the promptitude which they have shown in adopting the
                    best measures for the advancement of academical instruction is deserving of
                    great credit. Some years ago the clergy of the city put forward their claim to a
                    voice in the election of professors, on the ground that, in the original
                    charter, the right of appointment was to be exercised <hi rend="italic">cum
                    avisa-mento ministrorum.</hi> The claim was for some time keenly agitated, and
                    steps were taken to enforce it; but on application being made to the Court of
                    Session in the case of a particular election, the court refused to grant an
                    interdict, and the question was accordingly dropped. Eleven professorships have
                    at various times been founded by the crown, of nine of which it has retained the
                    patronage; but the exercise of this power is disputed by the council, as an
                    infringement of their sole right of control, and a protest is regularly taken
                    that it shall not hurt or prejudge their rights. In the case of some of the
                    professorships, certain public bodies have been admitted to a share of the
                    patronage, in consequence of contributing a part of the salaries of the
                    professors. The professor of botany holds two commissions, one from the crown,
                    and another from the town council.</p>
                <p>The right of the patrons to interfere in regulating the course of study was of
                    late years disputed by the principal and professors, and the subject was brought
                    before the <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=558"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0558-0520"/>Court of Session for adjudication. The court
                    decided that the sole government of the university in all points, even in
                    regulating the conditions of graduation, the course of study, and method of
                    instruction, is vested in the town council. The council however has the
                    discretion to leave matters of discipline and ordinary detail to the principal
                    and professors; and the regulations which are from time to time made by them,
                    are considered valid unless they are disallowed by the patrons.</p>
                <p>For a considerable period the college was limited to the faculty of arts; the
                    other faculties were successively recognised, as the course of instruction was
                    extended. The medical school, which has of late years become so famous, had its
                    origin so recently as the end of the seventeenth century, there being no
                    professor of medicine previously to the year 1685. The school of law is still
                    more modern. The class of public law was instituted in 1707, of civil law in
                    1710, of Scotish law generally, in 1722, and that of the theory and practice of
                    conveyancing in 1825.</p>
                <p>From what has already been stated, it will appear that the constitution of the
                    university of Edinburgh differs essentially from that of other universities.
                    Indeed it cannot, be said to have any independent or well-defined constitution;
                    the patrons being invested with the powers generally given to the universities
                    themselves. No power is conferred upon it by the charter as an independent
                    conjuration, nor is any provision made for the appointment of public officers.
                    There is no mention made of a chancellor; and although in early times the name
                    was occasionally taken by the provost of the city, this must be regarded as an
                    unauthorized assumption. For a long time there has been no chancellor of the
                    university. The case in regard to the offices of rector and dean of faculty is
                    nearly the same. “This important office,” (the office of rector), say the
                    commissioners,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Report,
                    p. 114.</p></note> “has been much less efficient in Edinburgh than in the other
                    universities; and the existence of the office itself has been, apparently at
                    least, suspended.” It was held by several persons, though with frequent
                    intervals, till 1640, when the council resolved to elect a rector annually, with
                    six assessors, two members of council, two ministers, and two professors. But in
                    the beginning of last century the office of rector was permanently annexed to
                    that of lord provost, who, as head of the council, already possessed all the
                    authority which could be deputed to the rector, and consequently the office,
                    till within these few years, had become obsolete even in name. “It is,
                    accordingly, explicitly asserted that no chancellor or vice-chancellor, rector
                    or dean of faculty, exercises any authority or jurisdiction over the principal,
                    professors, or students in the university of Edinburgh.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Report, p. 115.</p></note> The business of
                    the college is managed by a section of the town council, under the name of the
                    college committee, who take charge of the revenue, communicate with the senate,
                    and exercise a general superintendence over the seminary.</p>
                <p>The Principal occupies an anomalous position; he holds the same rank as the
                    cognominal officers in the other universities, but apparently without any of the
                    powers which the others exercise. Notwithstanding the stipulations made by the
                    patrons to Kollock when he was promoted to the office, his authority seems to be
                    extremely limited. The principal has long ceased to teach a class, and he has
                    not fur a considerable period taken an active part in superintending the
                    instruction of any of the classes. He presides in the meetings of the senate,
                    and is the official organ of the university in communicating with the crown, the
                    patrons, and the public. Beyond this he does not appear, so far as we have been
                    able to ascertain, to possess any real power or authority. The present principal
                    reads lectures on biblical criticism, and has revived the ancient practice of
                    delivering an annual address to the students.</p>
                <p>The Academical Senate is composed of the principal and professors, who, in right
                    of their appointment, become constituent members. The principal presides, and
                    has both a <hi rend="italic">deliberative</hi> and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >casting</hi> vote. The senate claims the right of instituting new faculties,
                    and of fixing the privileges and immunities belonging to them. This court,
                    however, is not mentioned in the charter, nor does it appear to have ever been
                    recognised by the patrons, as possessing any independent powers. The meetings of
                    the senate are called by the principal, or any member of the theological
                    faculty.</p>
                <p>The university contains the four Faculties of divinity, law, medicine, and arts,
                    each of which has a dean, chosen by the faculty. The term Faculty was originally
                    employed to denote the whole body of professors in their corporate capacity, but
                    this application of it has long been supplanted by the designation of the
                    senate. After the institution of a separate professorship of divinity, the two
                    sets of professors were designated as the faculty of arts, and the faculty of
                    divinity; but the precise time at which the distinct sections were recognised is
                    nowhere recorded. It is to be borne in mind, however, that the four faculties
                    merely perform certain duties under the senate, without whose sanction their
                    proposals and regulations cannot be carried into effect. The faculty of arts
                    comprehends the professors of languages and philosophy, with those of
                    mathematics, rhetoric, practical astronomy, and universal history. The professor
                    of natural history belongs to the faculty of medicine. The professors of
                    agriculture and music have not yet been attached to any of the faculties.</p>
                <p>The total Revenue of the university, derived from original property, from
                    parliamentary enactments, from royal grants, and from the benefactions of
                    individuals, amounted in 1825 to about L.3770. In this sum was included the
                    income of the bursars, amounting to L.420. Of the remainder, the principal part
                    was made up of the royal grants, which then amounted to L.1435, and were given
                    as salaries to certain professors. A large portion of the college funds,
                    amounting to L.13,119, having been under the management of the magistrates and
                    town council, and being involved in the late embarrassment of the city’s
                    affairs, the act of settlement in 1838 provides an annual “sum of L.2500 for the
                    maintenance and support of the college and schools of the said city, in full of
                    all demands," &amp;c.; and adds, that the said sum “shall be applied by the lord
                    provost, magistrates, and council of the city, in defraying the obligations and
                    payments incumbent upon them in relation to the debts due by the said city to
                    the said college, in paying the salaries and house-rents due to or on account of
                    the professors, in repairing and maintaining the college buildings, and in the
                    other necessary expenses thereof, and the remainder towards the schools and
                    educational purposes of the city in consideration of which payment, the “college
                    debt” of L.13,119 is declared to be extinguished.</p>
                <p>By the will of General Reid, dated 1806, a large bequest was made to the senate
                    for endowing a professorship of music, adding to the library, and otherwise
                    promoting the general interest of the university. This bequest, after being
                    liferented by the testator’s daughter, lately became available to the
                    university. It amounted, after deduction of legacy-duty and expenses, to
                    L.62,500. A professorship of music has since been established, and the series of
                    annual concerts appointed by the will has been commenced.</p>
                <p>The Bursaries attached to the university are thirty-four, the benefit of which is
                    extended to eighty students: their aggregate value is L.1172 a year. Three are
                    of the annual value of L.100; the others vary from L.30 to L.5 and under.</p>
                <p>There are two Sessions. The winter session commences on the first Tuesday of
                    November, and closes in the end of April. The summer session, during which a few
                    classes of the medical faculty are taught, begins on the first Monday of May,
                    and terminates at the end of July. The theological session is somewhat shorter.
                    Each student pays a matriculation fee of L.1. No certain order for the
                    attendance of classes, is prescribed by the statutes. Attendance on certain
                    classes, however, is requisite for those who are destined to particular
                    professions, or who aspire to academical degrees. It is recommended to students
                    who mean to follow out a regular course of study in the faculty of arts, and it
                    is enjoined on those preparing for the church, or proceeding to degrees, that
                    they commence with the classes of languages and mathematics.</p>
                <p>Candidates for the degree of Master of Arts must be in the fourth year of their
                    academical studies, and must have attended the classes of humanity, Greek,
                    mathematics, logic, rhetoric, moral and natural philosophy. They are required to
                    give in their names to the dean of faculty on or before the last day of March.
                    The examinations take place in April, and continue for three days, from twelve
                    to four each day. The candidates are required to give written answers to
                    questions, and translations of passages from classical authors put into their
                    hands. Those who are found entitled to the degree are classified in the order of
                    their proficiency, as ascertained by the results of the examinations; and the
                    list of graduates so classified is affixed to the college gates, suspended in
                    the library, and advertised in the newspapers. Students at the close of the
                    third year of the regular curriculum of arts are admitted to that part of the
                    examination which relates to classical proficiency; and those who avail
                    themselves of this permission are examined in mathematics and philosophy at the
                    close of the fourth year of their studies. The examinations are conducted by the
                    professors of the faculty.</p>
                <p>Arrangements have lately been made by the theological faculty for reviving the
                    degree of B. D. Students who have finished <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=559" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0559-0521"
                    />their theological curriculum, and who have previously taken the degree of A.
                    Μ., are allowed to present themselves as candidates for this new honour, and are
                    required to undergo a strict examination on the evidences and doctrines of
                    Christianity, in ecclesiastical history, and in oriental languages. Those by
                    whom the examination is successfully undergone, receive from the faculty a
                    certificate, which entitles them, on obtaining license, to apply to the
                    university for the actual conferring of the degree. This we are inclined to
                    consider as a great improvement, and as likely to form a powerful stimulus to
                    students of divinity. It is to be presumed that the faculty intend this
                    arrangement as preliminary to conferring on the bachelors the higher degree.</p>
                <p>The celebrity of Edinburgh as a school of medicine seems to demand of us a
                    general statement of the course of study necessary to obtain a Medical Degree.
                    No student can be admitted to the examinations for the degree of doctor of
                    medicine, who has not been engaged in medical study for four years, during at
                    least six months in each, either in the university of Edinburgh, or in some
                    other university where the degree of Μ. D. is given, unless, in addition to
                    three Anni Medici in a university, he has attended, during at least six winter
                    months, the medical or surgical practice of a general hospital which
                    accommodates at least eighty patients, and during the same period a course of
                    practical anatomy, in which case three years of university study are admitted.
                    Candidates must give sufficient evidence that they have studied, once at least,
                    each of the following departments of medical science, under professors of
                    medicine, namely, anatomy, chemistry, materia medica, and pharmacy, institutes
                    of medicine, practice of medicine, surgery, midwifery and the diseases peculiar
                    to women and children, general pathology, and practical anatomy, during a course
                    of six months; clinical medicine, that is, the treatment of patients in a public
                    hospital, under a professor of medicine, by whom lectures on the cases are
                    given, during a course of six months, or during two courses of three months; and
                    clinical surgery, medical jurisprudence, botany, natural history, including
                    zoology, during a course of at least three months. They must attend the
                    university of Edinburgh at least one year, must submit to the examiners a
                    medical dissertation composed by themselves, and a written declaration that they
                    are twenty-one years of age. Before candidates are examined in medicine, the
                    faculty ascertain, by examination, that they possess a competent knowledge of
                    the Latin language; and being satisfied on this point, they proceed to examine
                    them, either <hi rend="italic">viva voce,</hi> or in writing, on anatomy,
                    chemistry, botany, institutes of medicine, natural history, materia medica,
                    pathology, practice of medicine, surgery, midwifery, and medical jurisprudence.
                    The examinations take place in May, June, and July, and the successful
                    candidates are admitted to their degrees on the first lawful day of August. All
                    degrees are conferred in the name of the senate. Honorary degrees alone are
                    granted in the faculties of law and divinity.</p>
                <p>The professors exercise no superintendence over the students, except within the
                    walls of the college. Delinquents are brought before the senate, and admonished
                    by the principal, or, if guilty of a grave breach of discipline, are expelled.
                    The students wear no academical dress, nor are they required to attend any
                    particular place of worship. Accommodation for 200 is provided in one of the
                    churches in the immediate neighbourhood of the college.</p>
                <p>The number of students in 1839-40 was 1298; graduates in arts, 4; in medicine,
                    111.</p>
                <p>Fees for graduation in arts, L.3. 3s.; in medicine, L.25, including the stamp.
                    The degrees in law and divinity being honorary, are always given without the
                    payment of any fee.</p>

                <p> UNIVERSITY OF DUBLIN.</p>
                <p>Ireland is represented by her native historians as being, in the sixth, seventh,
                    and eighth centuries, the university of Europe; and the manuscript remains of
                    Irish literature belonging to that period, which are still preserved in various
                    libraries, strongly corroborate the statement. During the three succeeding
                    centuries, little is known of the state of learning; and the subjugation of the
                    country by Henry II. in the twelfth century seems to have extinguished the
                    feeble spark which still burned. Soon after the beginning of the fourteenth
                    century, a university was established by a bull from John XXII., in connection
                    with the cathedral church of St Patrick’s, which continued for some time to
                    support a feeble existence.</p>
                <p>The present university was founded in 1592, through the exertions of Archbishop
                    Loftus, who prevailed on the corporation of Dublin to appropriate for its
                    support the ground and buildings of the dissolved monastery of All-Hallows, on
                    Hoggin Green, in the eastern suburbs of the city, at that time valued at L.20
                    per annum. A charter was soon after obtained from Queen Elizabeth, incorporating
                    the university under the name of “The Provost, Fellows, and Scholars of the
                    College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, founded by Queen Elizabeth, near
                    Dublin and empowering it to accept such lands and contributions for its
                    maintenance as any of her charitable subjects should bestow, to the amount of
                    L.400 a year. This was the extent of the royal bounty; no funds were provided
                    for the erection of buildings, or for the support of the members of the college.
                    The liberality of the Irish gentry was appealed to by circular letters from the
                    lord-deputy, and a sufficient sum of money was by this means raised to enable
                    the archbishop to commence the buildings. The first stone was laid on the 13th
                    of March 1591, and the college was opened for the reception of students January
                    9, 1593. The whole income of the university, including voluntary and temporary
                    contributions amounted in 1594 to the sum of L174. 18s., and in 1600 it was
                    increased by certain allowances granted by the queen to L.544. 13s. 4d. Such was
                    the foundation of the university of Dublin; and on this scanty provision it had
                    to struggle for existence, often reduced, by the nonpayment of rents, to the
                    very brink of dissolution, tiD the beginning of the reign of James I., when it
                    was endowed by that monarch with lands, which have since become valuable, in the
                    province of Ulster, besides a pension of L.388. 15s. English, paid annually from
                    the exchequer.</p>
                <p>By the charter of foundation, the body corporate was to consist of a provost,
                    three fellows, and three scho lars, with power to increase their number as the
                    funds of the college permitted. To the provost and fellows was intrusted the
                    power of enacting statutes for themselves, and of appointing such acts and
                    exercises as they might consider necessary to qualify for degrees. To them also
                    belonged the duties of tuition, the scholarships being intended as foundations
                    for the maintenance of the poorer students. The provost and fellows constituted
                    the only university convocation or senate recognised by the charter, and with
                    them resided exclusively the power of conferring degrees.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From this statute it is obvious that the
                    university of Dublin is simply a <hi rend="italic">college</hi> with university
                    privileges and powers, and therefore differs in its constitution from the
                    universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which are corporations distinct from the
                    colleges or balls founded within their jurisdiction. In Dublin the provost and
                    fellows are invested with the power of electing officers and conferring degrees,
                    which, in the English universities, belongs to a body consisting of masters of
                    arts and doctors in the higher faculties. At an early period forms were
                    instituted for the public conferring of degrees by the vice-chancellor, in a
                    solemn meeting of doctors and masters; and these, sanctioned by time, have long
                    since become the established rule of the university.</p></note> The fellows were
                    to elect their provost on every vacancy of this office; and fellowships were
                    tenable for seven years only after taking the degree of M. A. William Cecil Lord
                    Burghley was nominated by the charter the first chancellor of the university,
                    with a provision, that on all future occasions, the election of chancellor,
                    vice-chancellor, and proctors, should belong to the provost and fellows.</p>
                <p>In this, the original constitution of the university, many obvious defects soon
                    began to show themselves. The election of a provost was a continual source of
                    discord; and the authority of this officer being by the charter scarcely greater
                    than that of the other fellows, was insufficient for the preservation of
                    discipline in the college. The three fellows nominated by the charter were
                    ecclesiastics, whose sacred duties prevented them from engaging in the actual
                    labours of instruction; and accordingly, when the business of education really
                    commenced, it was found necessary to obtain additional aid. The poverty of the
                    society not admitting of their endowing permanent fellowships, an expedient was
                    resorted to which afterwards led to an important alteration in the constitution
                    of the college. About the year 1600, fous <hi rend="italic">masters,</hi>
                    afterwards increased to seven, were appointed as lecturers of the junior
                    classes, and, about 1610, were regularly constituted, by statute, probationer or
                    junior fellows; from these the senior fellowships, instituted by charter, were
                    filled up on every vacancy. About 1615, the number of senior fellows was fixed
                    by statute at seven, and the number of probationer fellows at nine; the
                    scholars, as at present, amounted to seventy. The junior fellows were to have no
                    part in the government of the college, and were to be considered in every
                    respect as <hi rend="italic">scholars,</hi> except that they were recognised as
                    college tutors, and employed in instructing others. This increase in the number
                    of the fellows and scholars was most probably made soon after the income of the
                    college was augmented by the grants of King James I. Though productive of
                    beneficial effects to the college, by increasing the number of its instructors,
                    it was at first the occasion of some very serious difficulties. The junior
                    fellows claimed for themselves an express right by the charter to have a voice
                    in the government and elections of the college; which was resisted by the
                    governing body, on the ground that the title of <hi rend="italic">fellows</hi>
                    had been conferred on them, not as a matter of right, but by courtesy and <hi
                    rend="italic">honoris causa,</hi> and that their rights, as determined in the
                    charter, were those of scholars only. Accordingly, Bishop Bedell’s statutes,
                    framed in 1627, provided against the difficulty, by dividing the scholars into
                    nine <hi rend="italic">socii scholares,</hi> or probationer fellows, and seventy
                    <hi rend="italic">scholares discipuli,</hi> or scholars, commonly so called, as
                    being still <hi rend="italic">in statu pupillari.</hi> the dissensions to which
                    we have already alluded continued to increase, and at last rendered the
                    interference of the legislature absolutely necessary. Accordingly Archbishop
                    Laud, who had been elected chancellor of the university in 1633, and bad lately
                    completed a revision of the statutes of Oxford, as chancellor of that
                    university, undertook<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=561" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0561-0523"/>
                    to remodel the statute-book which had hitherto been in use in the university of
                    Dublin. The new charter and statutes, after encountering the most violent
                    opposition, were read and published in the chapel of the university on Trinity
                    Monday, June 5, 1637, and the oaths prescribed to the provost, fellows, and
                    other officers, administered by the archbishops of Armagh and Dublin, the new
                    visitors of the college. The opposition was' not however quieted by the
                    promulgation of the statutes. After Laud had fallen from his power, and was no
                    longer able to protect his favourites, a vigorous prosecution was commenced in
                    the Irish parlia-mentagainst Bishop Chappel, the provost, by whose assistance
                    the work of reformation had been carried into effect; but the rebellion of 1641,
                    and the subversion of the British monarchy which so soon followed, diverted the
                    attention of parliament to more important matters. The clamour appears to have
                    subsided during the commonwealth, when the university became nearly extinct, and
                    it was not revived after the restoration. The Laudian constitution, with some
                    slight modifications, has continued till the present day; and to it the
                    university owes much of its celebrity and usefulness.</p>
                <p>The alterations made by the new charter in the constitution and government of the
                    university were important, and had special reference to the dissensions which
                    had been occasioned in the body by its former mode of government. The election
                    of provost, and the power of enacting and repealing statutes, were taken from
                    the fellows, and reserved to the crown. Fellowships, which had hitherto expired
                    at the end of seven years after taking a master’s degree, were made tenable for
                    life. The nine probationer fellows were admitted members of the corporation,
                    under the name of “junior fellows but the entire control, both as to discipline
                    and finance, was vested in the provost and seven senior fellows, subject to the
                    jurisdiction of visitors nominated by the crown, in whom the right of ultimate
                    appeal was vested. In cases not provided for by the statutes, the provost and
                    senior fellows were empowered to make new statutes not repugnant to those
                    granted by the king, which new statutes were to be confirmed by the visitors,
                    and to remain in force till the enacting body should think proper to rescind
                    them. The election of officers, as chancellor, proctors, &amp;c., was continued
                    in the provost and fellows, the chancellor being permitted to nominate the
                    vice-chancellor. The number of visitors was reduced from eight to two, viz. the
                    chancellor, or, in his absence, the vice-chancellor, and the archbishop of
                    Dublin. A special clause provided that no person should profess or teach the
                    liberal arts in any other place in Ireland, without a special license from the
                    crown. The changes since made in the statutes have consisted merely in the
                    repeal of certain clauses which were found to be inconvenient; the augmentation
                    of salaries, the foundation of professorships, and the regulation of the
                    library; but no alteration has been made affecting the constitution of the
                    college, except the foundation of additional junior fellowships by different
                    sovereigns, whereby their number was increased from nine to eighteen. By a
                    statute of Queen Victoria, dated on the 6th of May 1840, the statute of Charles
                    1., enjoining celibacy on the fellows, has been repealed, and provision made for
                    founding ten new fellowships. The addition to the fellowships, according to the
                    new statute, is to “be made by the annual election, at the accustomed time and
                    place, of one new fellow in this (1840) and in each of the next succeeding nine
                    years, over and above the vacancies which may occur in the subsisting body.” Of
                    the ten additional fellows, only the four seniors for the time being are to be
                    appointed tutors; but the remaining six are to enjoy “all the other rights,
                    profits, and emoluments, and perform all other the duties and functions of
                    junior fellows, and to be eligible to all other offices to which any junior
                    fellows may now be elected or appointed.” After the year 1849, when the number
                    of additional fellows shall have been completed, though no vacancy should occur
                    in the body of fellows, there is still to be an annual election of one, who
                    shall succeed to the first vacancy, “unless there be at the same time two or
                    more such persons so elected, in which case the senior of them shall succeed to
                    the first vacancy.” It is also ordained, " that after the year 1849, there shall
                    be no more than two persons elected, whether as fellows or candidate fellows, in
                    any one year, whatever number of vacancies may occur in the body.”</p>
                <p>James I., by his charter in 1613, granted to the provost, fellows, and scholars,
                    the right of returning two representatives to the Irish parliament. The act of
                    Union in 1800 restricted this number to one; but by the Irish reform bill, the
                    original number was restored, and the right of election extended to all members
                    of the university of twenty-one years of age, who at that time had, or who
                    should thereafter obtain, a fellowship or scholarship, the degree of master of
                    arts, or any higher degree.</p>
                <p>The entire government of the university is vested in the following Officers: the
                    chancellor, who is elected by the provost and senior fellows, and whose office
                    is tenable for life; the vice-chancellor, nominated for life by the chancellor,
                    an&lt;l who has the power to appoint a pro-vice-chancellor in special cases; the
                    provost, appointed by the crown; the vice-provost, an annual officer, who is
                    usually the first of the seven senior fellows; two proctors, chosen annually,
                    one from the senior and the other from the junior fellows, for regulating the
                    forms for taking degrees; two deans and a censor, whose duty it is to inspect
                    the details of moral discipline; two librarians; a registrar, who performs the
                    duty of secretary to the provost and senior fellows; a registrar for the
                    electors admitted under the reform act; an auditor; six university preachers;
                    four morning lecturers; and nine examiners. The ordinary affairs of the college
                    are managed by a Board, consisting of the provost and senior fellows, who hold a
                    meeting every Saturday. The provost must be in holy orders, and a doctor, or at
                    least a bachelor in divinity, and not less than thirty years of age. The fellows
                    are all bound to enter into priests’ orders, except three; one of whom is
                    elected <hi rend="italic">Medicus</hi> by the provost and senior fellows; the

                <p>The System of Instruction is conducted by means of professorships, lectures, and
                    periodical examinations. According to the statutes of Laud, all professorships
                    were to he held by fellows. The provost was to appoint from the body of fellows,
                    senior and junior, such a number as he thought fit, to be college tutors; and
                    the fees paid by pupils, together with the emoluments of lectureships,
                    professorships, and other offices, were to constitute the salaries of the
                    fellows. At this period the only professorship in the university was that of
                    divinity, which however was not recognised as the regius professorship till the
                    year 1674. Two professorships, of jurisprudence and medicine, were appointed by
                    statute, and the fellows who devoted themselves to these professions were
                    exempted from the obligation of entering into holy orders. The increase of
                    students, by augmenting the duties as well as the emoluments of the tutors, has
                    now broken in upon the original spirit of the statutes; and the increased value
                    of the college lands has supplied the means of assigning to the senior fellows
                    ample salaries without subjecting them to the necessity of acting as tutors.
                    Accordingly some annual offices, with several professorships, are now held
                    exclusively by senior fellows, while the duties of tuition have been for many
                    years confined to the junior fellows. By some recent regulations, four of the
                    latter now hold offices incom <pb break="no"

                    />patible with that of tutor, and have consequently resigned their pupils; so
                    that the number of tutors is limited to fourteen.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This was the number previous to the statute
                    of Victoria. When the additional fellows provided for by this statute are
                    elected, the number of tutors will be increased to eighteen.</p></note> It was
                    not till the latter end of last century that the principle was recognised of
                    having professors in the university who were not fellows. In 1761 a statute was
                    passed, which obliged the regius professor of divinity, on his appointment to
                    that office, to resign his fellowship; and in the same year the regius
                    professorship of feudal and English law was founded upon the same condition, if
                    filled by a fellow. In 1774 Provost Andrews bequeathed to the college an
                    endowment for a professor of astronomy. A school of medicine was established by
                    act of parliament in 1785, consisting of three professorships not tenable with
                    fellowships; and besides these, two professorships of modem languages were
                    founded in 1777. These, with the exception of the professorship of political
                    economy, moral philosophy, and biblical Greek, are the only professorships which
                    can be held by persons who are not fellows.</p>

                    of foundation, and the patronage.</p>

                <p>The professorial system, as established in the university, has never been
                    efficient. Some of the professorships and lectureships are annual offices, and
                    these, with others which are not annual, are all held by persons whose time is
                    occupied by other duties; and besides this, the lectures of the professors are
                    not sufficiently connected with the education of such as are looking for
                    university honours or degrees. The education of the students in arts is
                    intrusted almost exclusively to those of the Junior fellows who exercise the
                    functions of tutors.</p>
                <p>The academical year is divided into three terms, Michaelmas, Hilary, and Trinity.
                    Those of Michaelmas and Hilary are followed each by a short recess; that of
                    Trinity by a vacation of three months. Terms are kept, during the under-graduate
                    course, not by residence, as at Oxford and Cambridge, but by answering at the
                    examinations held for the purpose at the beginning of each term. Students of
                    divinity, law, and medicine are required to attend the lectures of the
                    professors, and therefore reside either in the college or in the city. The
                    under-graduate course consists of four years, in each of which the students are
                    distinguished by the titles of junior and senior <hi rend="italic"

                    before the university; a doctor in music must be Mus. B. of five years, and
                    perform a similar exercise. The fees for B. A. are L.7. 17s. 6d., for Μ. A.
                    L.9.19s. 6d., for B. D. L.13. 15s., for D. D. L.26, for LL. B. L.11. 15s., for

                <p>The students are arranged in four Ranks: I. Noblemen and baronets, styled
                    nobiles, filii nobilium, and equites, who are entitled to the degree of B. A.
                    <hi rend="italic">per specialem gratiam.</hi> 2. Fellow commoners, who are
                    entitled to graduate at the commencement of their fourth or senior sophister
                    year. These two classes pay a high annual stipend, and dine at the same table
                    with the fellows in the commons hall. 3 Pensioners, who constitute the great
                    body of the students. 4. Sizars, who have their commons free, and are exempted
                    from annual fees. The number of sizars is limited to thirty-six, and admission
                    is obtained after a very strict examination held annually to supply vacancies,
                    the endowment being tenable for four years. Each of these classes is
                    distinguished by a particular dress. The mode of admission is by an examination,
                    held at the beginning of each term, in the public theatre of the college. The
                    examiners for entrance are the junior fellows. The senior lecturer commences the
                    examination by proposing to the candidates a subject, on which they are required
                    to write in Latin, or else by giving them a few sentences in English to
                    translate into that language. After a sufficient time allowed for this exercise,

                    lectures to the first three classes, each to his own pupils. The subjects of
                    these lectures are the science, and sometimes also the Latin book, appointed by
                    the college fur the examination of the ensuing term; and they are conducted in
                    the same way as in the English universities. Besides the lectures of the private
                    tutors, all under-graduates who reside in the college or in the city are bound
                    to attend the lectures on science and Greek delivered by the college lecturers.
                    Freshmen are also required to attend weekly catechetical lectures. Three
                    distinct Courses are appointed, one in mathematics and physics, another in logic
                    and moral philosophy, and a third in classics, in any one or more of which a
                    student, according to his taste and inclination, may contend for honours at his
                    degree examination. In each course two ranks of honour-men are formed, called
                    senior and junior Moderators, the number in each rank being limited to one
                    fortieth of the entire class.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    mean students who are in their first, second, &amp;c. year.</p></note> The
                    science taught in the first year of the course is mathematics; in the second,
                    logic; in the third, astronomy and physics; in the fourth, ethics; in addition
                    to which the student must be prepared to answer in a certain portion of Latin
                    and Greek, selected from the classical writers. An extended course of studies is
                    prescribed for those who aspire to academic honours. At the examinations, senior
                    and junior freshmen are accountable for the science taught ill all the preceding
                    terms from the beginning of the course; senior and junior sophisters, for the
                    science taught from the beginning of the third or junior sophister year; but,
                    except for honours at the degree examination, the science of the freshmen
                    classes is not carried beyond the second year. To keep his class, a pensioner
                    must have credit for two out of the three examinations of that class, one of
                    which must be the third or October examination, if he is either a senior
                    freshmen or a senior sophister. A senior sophister who may not have secured
                    credit for his October examination, may qualify himself for his degree by
                    answering in the same business at any subsequent examination of senior
                    sophisters; and a senior freshman may repair the like omission in the same way
                    at the first examination of the senior sophister year. Fellow commoners and
                    sizars are subject to the same rule, with some slight exceptions.</p>
                <p>Each term commences with an Examination, not only of the studies of that
                    immediately preceding, but, with the exceptions already stated, of the substance
                    of most of those which had been previously gone over. These examinations are of
                    peculiar importance in the university of Dublin, from their effect upon the
                    students generally, and because they constitute, to a very large proportion of
                    those who graduate there, the only university education they receive. We have
                    already alluded to that peculiarity of discipline by which residence is not
                    enforced on under-graduates. Any student, unless he be a scholar, is permitted,
                    at his own discretion, to prepare himself for the examinations without residing
                    in the college or in the city; and on his being represented by his tutor as a
                    resident in the country, no other academic duties are required of him. The
                    expense of residence would be an insuperable obstacle to many who are at present
                    in the university; and therefore, by the admission of non-resident students,
                    some part of the advantages of a university education are extended to a large
                    number of individuals by whom, if residence were enforced, not even that part
                    would be attainable. Thus, while five or six hundred students annually receive
                    at Dublin all the advantages that residence and college discipline can
                    communicate, about an equal number are induced to study, and are furnished with
                    the means of attaining one at least of the objects proposed by a university
                    education, namely, the power of acquiring knowledge. The examiners are the
                    fellows, masters of arts, or doctors, resident in the college, who are selected
                    by the provost and senior fellows. The students of the same class or year
                    assemble together for examination, and are separated into <hi rend="italic"
                    >division,</hi> not exceeding forty, to each of which three examiners are
                    assigned, one in science, one in Latin, and one in Greek. The examination of
                    each class occupies four days; the first two days being devoted to the
                    determination of <hi rend="italic">judgments,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The examiners are required to fix the merit

                    has been long in use for this purpose. The highest degree of merit is marked by
                    the judgment <hi rend="italic">optime,</hi> which however is very rarely given,
                    and is therefore regarded as a very high honour. The remaining degrees are <hi

                    rend="italic">vix mediocriter bene.</hi> The student who receives this last

                    >cautioned;</hi> that is to say, the examination in which he is thus disgraced
                    is not suffered to count in the number required for keeping his year, or for his

                    cla»s; and if cautioned again, on the succeeding examination, he is put down
                    into a lower class. The classical examiner gives three judgments, one for Greek,
                    another for Latin, and another for a theme. The number of judgments given by the
                    science examiner varies from one to four, according to the subjects read by the
                    class.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> and the remaining two to the
                    separate examination of honour-men. The examiners of the first two days select
                    from their divisions such as they deem qualified to become candidates for
                    honours or prizes, and return their names to the senior lecturer. The
                    examination of those who have not been selected for honours is then concluded;
                    but on the third day the candidates selected for honours in science are examined
                    by a separate court of examiners; and on the fourth day, the candidates for
                    honours in classics; the examination, as in the former case, being conducted
                    partly <hi rend="italic">viva voce,</hi> and partly by written papers. The
                    prizes, during the first three years, are books of the value of L.4 and L.2,
                    given al the close of the year to the best answerers during the three
                    examinations. The number of prizes is subject to the same limitation as the
                    honours. At the Michaelmas examination of the fourth year, the examiners of the
                    first two days select from among the candidates for degrees those whom they deem
                    qualified to become candidates for honours in any of the three departments of
                    the academical course. Those belonging to the same department are then examined
                    together by a body of examiners during two days, by whom they are arranged in
                    two divisions of senior and junior moderators. The limit to the number of
                    moderators of each division is determined, as in the case of honours and prizes,
                    at the previous examinations. At the conclusion of each examination, lists of
                    the successful candidates for prizes, honours, or moderatorships, are made out
                    by the senior lecturer, who is required to insert them in his book, and also to
                    have them affixed to the college gates, and published in the newspapers. The
                    successful candidates of each rank are arranged according to the order of their
                    standing on the college books, excepting only the senior moderators, who, at the
                    degree examination, are placed according to the order of merit.</p>
                <p>The Comitia, or commencements, for conferring degrees, are held twice a year; on
                    Shrove Tuesday and the Tuesday next before the eighth of July. The grace of the
                    house for a degree in any faculty must first be granted by the provost and
                    senior fellows before it can be proposed to the caput. Those who have been
                    admitted to a degree at the board are then <hi rend="italic">presented</hi> to
                    the vice-chancellor and the whole university, at a public congregation, by the
                    regius professor of the faculty in which the degree is to be taken; or if it be
                    a degree in arts, by one of the proctors. If no member of the caput objects, the
                    presenting officer <hi rend="italic">supplicates</hi> the congregation for their
                    public grace, and collects their suffrages; if the <hi rend="italic"

                    who confers the degree, according to a formula fixed by the university
                    statutes.</p>
                <p>The examination for Scholarships is held annually on the Thursday and Friday
                    before Whitsunday. The examiners are the provost and senior fellows.
                    Scholarships are open to all students, being Protestants, who have reached their
                    third under-graduate year, and are tenable till the holder is entitled to the
                    degree of master of arts. Students of higher standing are also permitted to
                    become candidates, but an extended course of reading is required of them. The
                    course appointed includes all the classics read for entrance and in the extended
                    course for under-graduates, to the end of the second examination of the junior
                    sophister year; or, should the candidate be of higher standing than that of
                    junior sophister (reckoned from the time of his entrance), to the end of the
                    last examination which he might have answered had he proceeded regularly with

                <p>The college has at its disposal twenty-one lucrative benefices in the northern
                    dioceses, and the vacancies are supplied by the fellows. By the late act for
                    regulating the established church in Ireland, the archbishops of Armagh and
                    Dublin were required to select a benefice, not exceeding the annual value of
                    L.1000, out of each of the ten extinguished bishoprics, to which benefices, when
                    vacant, they are to nominate a fellow or ex-fellow of the college. The incomes
                    of the senior fellows arise partly from the stipends of the professorships which
                    they hold, and partly from the college lands. The provost derives his income
                    from lands appropriated to his use.</p>
                <p>The number of students matriculated in 1839 was 38 fellow commoners, and 340
                    pensioners. Students on the books, December 1840, 1100.</p>
                <p>CONTINENTAL UNIVERSITIES.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of the existing European universities, exclusive of those
                    of Great Britain, Ireland, and France. The number of students for the years
                    previous to 1840 has been taken chiefly from the
                    “Genealogisch-his-torisch-statistischer Almanach für das Jahr 1840,” published
                    at Weimar. When the year is not mentioned, the number of students given may be
                    taken as the average attendance.</p>

                <p>ROYAL UNIVERSITY OF FRANCE.</p>
                <p>France, before the revolution, contained twenty-three universities, of which the
                    most important have already been described. The others were those of Aix,
                    Angers, Avignon, Besançon, Bourges, Bordeaux, Caen, Cahors, Dijon, Douai,
                    Nantes, Orange, Pau, Perpignan, Poitiers, Pont-à-Mous-soo, Reims, Strasburg, and
                    Valence. These venerable institutions disappeared during the revolution, and the
                    public education of the country was for some time left without any legislative
                    protection. After several unsuccessful attempts to establish a national system,
                    an Imperial University was instituted in 1808, which, with some modifications,
                    has survived the various changes of government which the country has since
                    undergone. The <hi rend="italic">Royal University of France</hi> embraces the
                    whole system of national education, and includes all the institutions for
                    imparting instruction which are spread over the whole kingdom, from the lowest
                    schools up to the royal colleges. The term may thus be considered as synonymous
                    with the French national system of education. The university is placed under the
                    direction of a council of six members, called the “royal council of public
                    instruction,” of which the minister of public instruction is the official
                    president. Each counsellor has the special charge of one or more divisions of
                    public instruction. Subordinate to this council are the inspectors-general of
                    the university, who are required to examine once a year the institutions of
                    every description, each within a certain district assigned to him, and to
                    transmit a report to the council. The university is composed of twenty-six <hi
                    rend="italic">academies,</hi> each of which comprehends two, three, or more of
                    the departments into which the kingdom is divided, and contains one or more
                    royal colleges. The presiding officer of each academy is the rector, who is
                    appointed by the minister of public instruction, and is assisted by two
                    inspectors and a council. The governing body of each academy has the
                    superintendence of all the communal colleges, institutions, <hi rend="italic"
                    >pensions</hi> (boarding schools), normal schools, or schools for the education
                    of teachers, and primary schools, within the district which the seminary
                    comprehends. Besides the superintending body, the academy includes the teaching
                    corps, or faculties; namely, the faculties of letters, science, medicine, law,
                    and theology, all of which however do not actually exist in every academy; in
                    some, indeed, there is no organization of faculties. The faculties consist of a
                    variable number of professors, one of whom is dean, and a committee of whom
                    examine candidates for degrees. There arc however some institutions which are
                    not subject to the jurisdiction of the university; as the College of France, the
                    Museum of Natural History, the <hi rend="italic">Ecole des Chartes,</hi> School
                    of Oriental Languages, the French Institute, and societies of all kinds for the
                    advancement of knowledge.</p>
                <p>The royal colleges are supported chiefly by the government, and the salaries of
                    the professors, which are generally from L.80 to L.160, are paid from the budget
                    of the minister of public instruction. The students are divided into two
                    classes, the <hi rend="italic">internes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >erlernet,</hi> or boarders and day-scholars. The communal colleges are
                    supported principally by the communes in which they are situate; some of them
                    have endowments, but the majority depend chiefly for their support on the fees
                    paid by the students. The professors or teachers receive but small salaries,
                    varying from L.40 to L.120. In 1833 a law was passed, ordaining that every
                    commune by itself, or by uniting with others, should have one school of
                    elementary instruction; that every commune the population of which exceeded
                    6000, should also have a school for superior instruction; and that every
                    department should have a normal school, either by itself, or in conjunction with
                    some other department. In the schools of elementary instruction, reading,
                    writing, arithmetic, and the established system of weights and measures, are
                    taught; and the schools for superior instruction, in addition to the
                    acquirements of the lower schools, embrace the elements of geometry. and its
                    application to the arts: the elements of chemistry and natural history, as
                    applied to the ordinary habits and pursuits of life; the elements of history and
                    geography, and more especially the history and geography of France. Since the
                    passing of this law, the cause of education has advanced rapidly; the number of
                    schools has greatly increased, and the proportion of children at school, though
                    less than in some of the neighbouring countries, is about one third greater than
                    before 1833. The following is a tabular view of the institutions comprised in
                    the University of France in 1836.</p>

                <p>There are six faculties of <hi rend="italic">Catholic theology,</hi> at Aix,
                    Bordeaux, Lyon, Paris, Rouen, and Toulouse; and two of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protestant theology,</hi> one, of the Lutheran or Augsburg Confession, at
                    Strasburg, and another, of the Calvinist or Helvetic Confession, at Montauban,
                    under the academy of l’oulouse. The faculties of law are nine, at Aix, Caen,
                    Dijon, Grenoble, Paris, Poitiers, Rennes, Strasburg, and Toulouse. There are
                    three faculties of medicine, at Grenoble, Paris, and Montpellier; with seventeen
                    secondary schools of medicine. The faculties of science are nine in number, at
                    Paris, Bordeaux, Strasburg, C⅛en, Toulouse, Montpellier, Dijon, Lyon, and
                    Grenoble; those of letters or literature, seven, at Paris, Strasburg, Bordeaux,
                    Toulouse, Caen, Dijon, and Besançon. In order to become a student in the faculty
                    of law or theology, a person must have taken the degree of bachelor of letters;
                    and a course of three years in either faculty is requisite to obtain the degree
                    of bachelor; for the degree of doctor, four years; and to obtain the degree of
                    doctor in divinity, the candidate must defend a final and general thesis.
                    Candidates for the degree of doctor in medicine must have taken the degree of
                    bachelor of letters, and also of sciences, and must complete a course of four
                    years. The faculties of law and medicine at Paris are greatly distinguished. The
                    former has sixteen professors, and had in 1838 upwards of 3000 students; the
                    latter twenty-seven professors, and, in 1836, about 4000 students.</p>
                <p>At the end of 1837, the total number of schools, public and private, throughout
                    France, was 53,920; 39,504 for boys, and 14,416 for girls. The number of pupils
                    at the same period was 2,651,492; 1,552,847 boys, and 1,098,645 girls. The
                    masters of the elementary schools have a residence, and receive a yearly salary
                    of 200 francs, or little more than L.8; the masters of the superior schools have
                    a residence and a salary of 400 francs, or somewhat more than L.16. The whole
                    charge to the stale of the department of public instruction, according to the
                    budget of 1838, was 19,006,673 francs, or nearly L.800,000, which was
                    distributed as follows :—</p>

                <p>To render our account of the seminaries for higher education as complete as
                    possible, we have added, from the “American Almanac for 1841,” a list of the
                    colleges in the United States, which are sometimes dignified with the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Universities;</hi> but it must be borne in mind that a large
                    proportion of these furnish instruction only to a limited extent; and none of
                    them, we believe, will bear a comparison with the great majority of the European
                    seminaries. We have subjoined, from the same source, lists of the medical,
                    theological, and law schools.</p>

                <p>PART II—SCHOOLS.</p>
                <p>The length to which the first part of this article has extended leaves us room
                    merely to mention what was intended to form the subject of the second. In thus
                    extending the first part, to the exclusion of the second, we have been
                    influenced by a wish to furnish accurate and satisfactory information on a
                    subject which is important and interesting, while to the general reader it is by
                    no means easily accessible. The subject of schools does not yield to the other,
                    either in importance or interest; but it is one of which something is more
                    generally known, and on which extended information can be more readily
                    obtained.</p>
                <p>The duty of providing schools for the education of the people has been generally
                    acknowledged and acted upon by the governments of modern Europe; and accordingly
                    we find established in the various countries a national system of instruction
                    more or less extensive, according to the circumstances and capabilities of each.
                    To this rule, which is all but universal, England forms a remarkable exception.
                    Here no system of public instruction has been established by the authority of
                    the legislature; and the education of the people has been left to individual
                    beneficence, and to the exertions of public societies. Nearly all the
                    grammar-schools in the kingdom owe their origin to the former source; and there
                    is perhaps no country in which so large an amount of property has been
                    appropriated for the education of youth. The estates and other property left for
                    educational purposes would, it is believed, if properly managed, yield an annual
                    revenue of L.400,000. The amount actually realized falls far short of this, and
                    its utility is further impaired by the conditions and restrictions under which
                    it is applied. The grammar and endowed schools, which are numerous, were
                    principally intended for the upper and middle classes; and some of them, as
                    Eton, Westminster, and Winchester, are now attended solely by the sons of the
                    nobility and higher gentry. It was not till a comparatively recent period that
                    any vigorous effort was made to supply the lower classes with education, or to
                    bring this powerful instrument of civilisation within the reach of the children
                    of the poor. Much however has been done during the present century, and many
                    schools have been founded for this laudable purpose. These consist chiefly of
                    what are called Sunday Schools, National Schools, and British and Foreign
                    Schools. The <hi rend="italic">Sunday Schools</hi> owe their origin to the
                    benevolent efforts of Mr Robert Raikes, a printer of Gloucester, by whom they
                    were established in that town in 1781. Being patronized by many pious and
                    philanthropic individuals, the plan extended rapidly, and has been productive of
                    incalculable benefit to the poor. The meetings are held in the afternoon of
                    Sunday; and the pupils consist of adults as well as children. Though intended
                    chiefly for the communication of religious instruction, in many of these schools
                    reading and writing are also taught. According to the official returns, there
                    were in England and Wales, in 1833, no fewer than 16,828 Sunday schools,
                    attended by 1,548,890 children and adults. Of these, 6247 schools, attended by
                    750,107 children and adults, belonged to dissenters. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >National Schools</hi> are under the control of the “National Society for
                    promoting the Education of the Poor,” established in 1811, and are conducted on
                    the system recommended by the late Dr Bell of Madras. This society is supported
                    solely by members of the established church, and the church catechism is used in
                    its schools. According to the report for 1839, the schools and scholars
                    were.—4291 <hi rend="italic">placet,</hi> with 4382 Sunday and daily, and 2197
                    Sunday schools, containing 180,767 boys and 146,752 girls as Sunday and daily
                    scholars, and 122,084 boys and 130,828 girls as Sunday scholars only; making,
                    with the Infant Schools, in all 6778 schools, with 597,911 scholars. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Schools of the British and Foreign School Society</hi> are not
                    connected with any religious sect, but are open to all pupils, of whatever
                    creed. This society maintains a considerable number of schools in all parts of
                    the country, and has contributed extensively towards the diffusion of elementary
                    education among the working classes. The system adopted is that of Joseph
                    Lancaster, through whose exertions the society was formed in 1810. According to
                    the education returns in 1833, the number receiving instruction in daily schools
                    was 1,276,947. At an average of England and Wales, perhaps from one-tenth to
                    one-eleventh part of the population may be attending schools and seminaries of
                    various kinds. We believe however that, speaking generally, the education
                    communicated is of an inferior description, and that, in point of quality, it is
                    decidedly below the standard of Holland, Prussia, Scotland, and some other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, in addition to the schools on the parochial system, of which a short
                    account will be found in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Scotland,</hi> much
                    has of late years been done fur the more general diffusion of education among
                    the great mass of the people. The “Society for propagating Christian Knowledge”
                    maintains 139 schools in different parts of the kingdom, which are attended by
                    12,619 scholars; and the “Committee of the General Assembly,” whose exertions
                    are directed chiefly to the Highlands and Islands, have under their care 126
                    schools, which are attended by 12,000 scholars. Nor have the various dissenting
                    bodies been backward in contributing towards the same benevolent object. The
                    schools supported by them in the large towns amount to a considerable number.
                    The state of primary education in Scotland will be best exhibited by the
                    following abstract from the Parliamentary Report (Session 1837), prepared from
                    returns by the parochial clergy.</p>

                <p>It appears that, taking the largest amount of attendance, a ninth of the whole
                    population of Scotland is, on an average, receiving education in public schools,
                    either parochial or non-parochial. This is exclusive of private boarding
                    schools, both for males and females, and of those who are educated under
                    domestic tutors.</p>
                <p>The schools under the superintendence of the “Board of Education” in Ireland, of
                    the origin of which an account will be found in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ireland,</hi> continue to extend over every part of the island, notwithstanding
                    the violent opposition which the system has had to encounter. The number of
                    schools in December 1839 was 1581, which were attended by about 205,090
                    scholars. In August 1840, 200 schools had been added to this number; and at that
                    date there were before the board 309 applications for aid, about 200 of which
                    were from presbyterians. (<hi rend="smallcaps">b. w.</hi>)</p>
