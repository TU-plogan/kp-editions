                    of the Hebrides Islands. South Uist is situate in 57° 7' and 57° 25' N. lat.,
                    and 7° 12' and 7° 28' W. long. Its extent is twenty-one miles, its greatest
                    breadth about eight miles and a half, and its superficial extent is calculated
                    at 127 square miles. The population in 1831, including small islands attached to
                    it, amounted to 6890. North Uist is separated from South Uist by the island of
                    Benbecula. It is situate between 57° 40' and 57° 48' N. lat, and 7° 1' and 7°
                    30' W. long. It is of an irregular triangular shape, and has a length of nearly
                    seventeen miles, a breadth of about twelve miles, and contains a superficial
                    extent of 118 square miles. The population in 1831, including the island of
                    Boreray, amounted to 4603. The rocks of both islands are gneiss, and both
                    present nearly the same physical appearance, being broken up by innumerable
                    branches of the sea, and having their surface covered by a multiplicity of
                    fresh-water lakes, a few feet in depth, so as to render it difficult to
                    determine whether water or land prevails. They are also completely destitute of
                    wood, and the land may be said to be rather extensive series of peat-bogs and
                    sand-levels, than of soil. In South Uist there are three distinct groups of
                    hills, which exclusively occupy the eastern side, the highest of which is
                    Heckla, rising to an elevation of 2940 feet; while the western division is a
                    level tract of peat, which terminates, at the extreme west, in sand. Barley,
                    oats, rye. and potatoes, are cultivated here, by the use of seaweed and the
                    ordinary manure. Portions also of the middle tract are cultivated, where the
                    ground is firm, and naturally drained by means <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    lakes. North Uist also rises on its eastern side, towards the north, into a low
                    ridge of hills, which gradually increase toward the south, till they rise to an
                    elevation of 2000 feet. Westward from this there is a large brown, peaty, and
                    boggy flat tract, comprising nearly half the area of the island, and producing
                    scanty and wretched herbage. The south-west part however terminates in an uneven
                    tract of good land, the soil of which contains clay; and this being aided by
                    peat and drift seaweed, and mixed with sand, forms an excellent open mould,
                    applicable to the cultivation of barley and potatoes. This forms the principal
                    part of the arable land in North Uist. In both islands, however, the peat is
                    undergoing a gradual amelioration toward mould, by the diffusion of the sand,
                    formed for the most part of various comminuted shells, which is blown by the
                    wind over the surface. The rearing and exporting of cattle, the fisheries, and
                    the manufacture of kelp, which is now in a very depressed state, are the means
                    by which the inhabitants earn their subsistence. There are various remains of
                    military works and barrows found in North Uist. The population of the two
                    islands being 11,493, and their superficial extent 245 square miles, the number
                    of inhabitants for each square mile is forty-seven; while in the rest of
                    Scotland the proportion is eighty-six to each square mile. Even this small
                    number is too great for the unproductive state of the soil. The growing scarcity
                    of fish, and the fearful over-population, have reduced the greater part of the
                    inhabitants to a state of wretchedness. Education is in a very backward
                    condition. In 1831 the number of well-educated persons was thirty-three, and the
                    number of those above six years of age unable to read was 7400. In 1838 the
                    number of schools was 15, and of scholars 590.</p>
