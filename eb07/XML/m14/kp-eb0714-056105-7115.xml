                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Every</hi> branch of the mathematies which has for its
                    object the comparison of geometrical quantities, and the determination of their
                    proportions to each other, may be comprehended under the general name <hi
                    rend="italic">Mensuration.</hi> So that, taking the term in its most extensive
                    sense, whatever is delivered in this work under the titles <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Geometry, Trigonometry, Conic Sections,</hi> part of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Algebra,</hi> and a very considerable portion of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fluxions,</hi> may be considered as constituting particular branches of this
                    general theory.</p>
                <p>The term mensuration, however, is also frequently used in a less extensive sense,
                    and is applied to a system of rules and methods by which numerical measures of
                    geometrical quantities are obtained. And it is to this limited view of the
                    subject that we propose to confine our attention in the present treatise. In
                    general, it will only be necessary to give the practical rules, as we have
                    already explained their foundation when treating of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Geometry, Conic Sections,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Fluxions</hi>; but, in
                    addition to the rules, in a few instances, we shall give their
                    demonstrations.</p>
                <p>In all practical applications of mathematies it is necessary to express
                    magnitudes of every kind by numbers. For this purpose a line of some determinate
                    length, as one inch, one foot, _&amp;c., is assumed as the measuring unit of
                    lines, and the number expressing how often this unit is contained in any line,
                    is the numerical value or measure of that line.</p>
                <p>A surface of some determinate figure and magnitude is assumed as the measuring
                    unit of surfaces, and the number of units contained in any surface is the
                    numerical measure of that surface, and is called its <hi rend="italic"
                    >area.</hi> It is usual to assume, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207128"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7128-0562"/>as the measuring unit of surfaces, a square, whose
                    side is the measuring unit of lines.</p>
                <p>A solid of a determinate figure and magnitude is in like manner assumed as the
                    measuring unit of solids, and the number of units contained in any solid is its
                    solidity or content. The unit of solids is a cube, each of whose edges is the
                    measuring unit of lines, and consequently each of its faces the measuring unit
                    of surfaces.</p>
                <p>A right angle is conceived to be divided into ninety equal angles; and one of
                    these, called an angle of one degree, is assumed as the measuring unit of
                    angles.</p>
                <p>The measures generally employed in the application of mensuration to the common
                    affairs of life, and their proportions to each other, are expressed in the
                    following tables:</p>

                    but they were the measures in common use before that time. The length of the

                    part of mensuration. But as these are fully investigated and explained in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Plane Trigonometry,</hi> it is not necessary to
                    deliver them also here. Referring therefore to that article, we shall employ the
                    remainder of this section in the application of trigonometry to the mensuration
                    of heights and distances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mensuration of Heights and Distances.</hi></p>
                <p>By the application of geometry the measurement of lines, which, on account of
                    their position or other circumstances, are inaccessible, is reduced to the
                    determination of angles, and of other lines which are accessible, and admit of
                    being measured by methods sufficiently obvious.</p>
                <p>A line considered as traced on the ground may be measured with rods or a Gunter’s
                    chain of sixty-six feet; but more expeditiously with measuring tapes of fifty or
                    one hundred feet. By these, if the ground be tolerably even, and the direction
                    of the line be traced pretty correctly, a distance may, by using proper care, be
                    measured within about three inches of the truth in every fifty feet, so that the
                    error may not exceed the 200th part of the whole line.</p>
                <p>Vertical angles may be measured with a quadrant furnished with a plummet and
                    sights in the manner indicated by the annexed figures. Ifan angle of elevationis
                    to be measured, as the angle contained by a horizontal line AC, (fig. 1,) and a
                    line drawn from A to B the top of a tower, hill, or other eminence; or to a
                    celestial body, as a star, &amp;c.; the centre of the quadrant must be fixed at
                    A, and the instrumenti moved about A, in the vertical plane, till to an eye
                    placed at G, the object B be seen through the two sights D, <hi rend="italic"
                    >d.</hi> Then will the arch EF, cut otf by the plumb-line AF, be the measure of
                    the angle CAB.</p>
                <p>An angle of depression CAB (fig. 2), is to be measured exactly in the same
                    manner, except that here the eye is to be placed at A the centre of the
                    instrument, and the measure of the angle is the arch EF.</p>
                <p>But the most convenient instrument for measuring angles, whether vertical or
                    horizontal, is the <hi rend="italic">Theodolite.</hi> This instrument has
                    undergone various alterations and improvements since it was described (we
                    believe, for the first time) by Sisson. Its principal parts are,</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The horizontal limb.</hi> This consists of two circular
                    plates A A, the upper or vernier plate, and BB, the graduated limb. The former
                    moves freely above the latter, without actual contact, and both have a
                    horizontal motion about a vertical axis C, which consists of two parts, one
                    external, fixed to the graduated limb B, and another internal, fixed to the
                    vernier plate A. Their form is conical, and they are ground and accurately
                    fitted into each other, so as to have a perfectly steady motion. The external
                    centre also fits into a ball at D, and the parts are held together by a screw at
                    the lower end of the internal axis.</p>
                <p>The lower plate is broader than the upper, and its edge is chamfered off and
                    covered with silver to receive the graduations.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The verniers.</hi> These arc short scales on the upper
                    plate, and on opposite sides of it, or 180° asunder. They are chamfered, so as
                    to form with the chamfered edge of the lower plate a continued conical surface,
                    and are covered with silver, and graduated in such a manner as to subdivide the
                    divisions of the lower plate into minutes. By means of microscopes which are
                    generally fixed over the verniers, the half or even the fourth of a minute may
                    be estimated.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The parallel plates</hi> F and G. These serve for levelling
                    the instrument, and are held together by a ball and socket at D. Four
                    milled-headed screws H, H, &amp;c., enter and work in the lower plate, while
                    their upper ends press against the lower side of the upper plate; and being set
                    in pairs opposite to each other, they act in contrary directions, and by this
                    means the instrument is set up level for observation.</p>
                <p>Beneath the parallel plates is a female screw adapted to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >staff-head,</hi> which is united by brass joints to three mahogany legs, so
                    constructed, that when shut up they form one round staff, and are secured in
                    that form by rings put on them. When opened out they make a very firm stand, and
                    the parallel plates may be made horizontal, although the ground may be
                    uneven.</p>
                <p>The lower plate of the horizontal limb can be fixed in any position by tightening
                    the clamping screw I, which causes the collar K to embrace the axis C, and
                    prevents its moving; but the final adjustment is to be given by means of the
                    slow-motion tangent screw L which is attached to the upper parallel plate. In
                    like manner the upper or vernier plate can be fixed to the lower by a elamp Μ,
                    which is also furnished with a slow motion, produced by a tangent screw.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Spirit levels</hi> N, N. There are two of these at right
                    angles to each other, with proper adjusting screws, on the plane of the vernier
                    plate. Their use is to determine when the horizontal limb is set truly
                    level.</p>
                <p>ð. The <hi rend="italic">compass.</hi> This is on the middle of the vernier
                    plate, but of course it cannot be shewn in a side view of the instrument. .</p>
                <p>6. The <hi rend="italic">vertical arc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">telescope.</hi>
                    The arc is placed on a horizontal axis, the ends of which are supported by two
                    frames, (only one of which can be shewn in the figure.) At one end of the axis
                    is an arm R, with a clamping screw S, by which the axis is held when the
                    telescope is nearly in the proper position: and there is a tangent screw T, by
                    which a slow angular motion is given to the vertical arc and telescope to direct
                    the latter accurately to an object. One side of the vertical arc is inlaid with
                    silver, and by means of its vernier V can be read off to single minutes. The
                    other side shews the difference between the hypothenuse and the base of a right
                    angled triangle, or the number of links to be deducted from each chain length to
                    reduce hypothenusal to horizontal lines.</p>
                <p>The level which is shewn under, and parallel to, the telescope is attached to it
                    at one end by a joint, and at the other by a capstan headed screw for raising or
                    lowering that end: there is another screw at the jointed end for lateral
                    adjustment: by their united action the level is placed parallel to the optical
                    axis or <hi rend="italic">line of collimation</hi> of the telescope.</p>
                <p>The telescope has two collars or rings of: bell metal, ground truly eylindrical,
                    on which it rests on its supports X, X, called Y’s; and it is confined in its
                    place by the clips Z, Z, which may be opened by removing the pins Y, Y, for the
                    purpose of reversing the teleseope or allowing it a circular motion round the
                    axis during the adjustment.</p>
                <p>In the focus of the eye glass are placed three lines formed of spider’s web, one
                    horizontal and two crossing it obliquely at equal angles so as to include a
                    small angle between them. These are preferable to a single perpendicular wire,
                    because a station staff at a distance can be made to bisect the angle formed by
                    the oblique wires with more certainty than the staff can be bisected by a
                    vertical wire.</p>
                <p>Three of the four screws for adjusting the cross-wires arc shewn at <hi
                    rend="italic">a, a, a,</hi> two of which are placed at right angles to the other
                    two, so that by easing one of each pair and tightening the other opposite to it,
                    the intersection of the wires may be placed exactly in the line of
                    collimation.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207154" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7154-0564"/>
                <p>The object glass of the telescope is fixed in a tube which slides within the
                    outer tube, and may be thrust out or drawn backward by turning the milled head
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> on the side of the telescope. By this motion the
                    optical image of any object to which the telescope is directed may be brought to
                    the intersection of the cross wires.</p>
                <p>Before the theodolite can be applied to accurate practice its parts must be
                    adapted to each other by means of the clamps and screws and levels. The
                    operations by which this is performed are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >adjustments.</hi></p>
                <p>The first adjustment is that of the line of collimation, which must coincide with
                    the axis of the cylindrical rings on the telescope, and pass through the
                    intersection of the cross wires. The second places the level attached to the
                    telescope parallel to the rectified line of collimation. The third makes the
                    axis of the horizontal limb truly vertical by means of the telescope level,
                    which is most to be depended on; and then the levels on the vernier plate are
                    adjusted by their screws so that their air bubbles may remain at rest in the
                    middle of their tubes while it makes a complete revolution on its axis. When
                    these adjustments are perfect the vernier of the vertical arc must be set so
                    that its index may point to <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> on the arc; or else its
                    deviation from <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> must be noted and applied as an index
                    error.</p>

                <p>OF LAND-SURVEYING.</p>
                <p>The instruments most commonly employed in land-surveying, are the Chain, the
                    Plane Table, and Cross.</p>
                <p>A statute acre of land being 160 square poles, the chain is made four poles, or
                    sixty-six feet in length, that ten square chains, or 100,000 square links) may
                    be equal to an acre. Hence each link is 7 ’ 92 inches in length.</p>
                <p>The plane table is used for drawing a plan of a field, and taking such angles as
                    are necessary to calculate its area. It is of a rectangular form, and is
                    surrounded by a moveable frame, by means of which a sheet of paper may be fixed
                    to its surface. It is furnished with an index by which a line may be drawn on
                    the paper in the direction of any object in the field, and with scales of equal
                    parts by which such lines may be made proportional to the distances of the
                    objects from the plane table when measured by the chain, and its frame is
                    divided into degrees for observing angles.</p>
                <p>The cross consists of two pair of sights set at right angles to each other upon a
                    staff having a pike at the bottom to stick into the ground. Its use is to
                    determine the points where a perpendicular drawn from any object to a line will
                    meet that line; and this is effected by finding by trials a point in the line,
                    such that the cross being fixed over it so that one pair of the sights may be in
                    the direction of the line, the object from which the perpendicular is to be
                    drawn may be seen through the other pair; then the point thus found will be the
                    bottom of the perpendicular, as is evident.</p>
                <p>A theodolite may also be applied with great advantage to land-surveying, more
                    especially when the ground to be measured is of great extent.</p>
                <p>In addition to these, there are other instruments employed in surveying, as the
                    perambulator, which is used for measuring roads and other great distances.
                    Levels, with telescopic or other sights, which are used to determine how much
                    one place is higher or lower than another. An ofsett-staff for measuring the
                    ofsets and other short distances. Ten small arrows, or rods of iron or wood,
                    which are used to mark the end of every chain length. Pickets or staves with
                    flags to be set up as marks or objects of direction; and, lastly, scales,
                    compasses, &amp;c. for protracting and measuring the plan upon paper.</p>
                <p>The observations and measurements ^are to be regularly entered as they are taken,
                    in a book which is called the field book, and which serves as a register of all
                    that is done or occurs in the course of the survey.</p>

                    follows: Let PCQ be a semicircle, and AB, BC,CD, &amp;c., several successive
                    sides of a regular polygon inscribed in it. Conceive<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194207284" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7284-0574"/> the semicircle to revolve
                    about the diameter PQ as an axis, then the arch ABODE will generate a portion of
                    the surface of a sphere, and the chords AB, BC, CD, &amp;c., will generate The
                    surfaces of frustums of cones; and it is easy to see that the number of chords
                    may be so great that the surface which they generate shall differ from the
                    surface generated by the arch ACE by a quantity which is less than any assigned
                    quantity. Bisect AB inL, and draw AF, LM, BG, CH, &amp;c., perpendicular to PQ.
                    For the sake of brevity, let <hi rend="italic">cire.</hi> A F denote the
                    circumference of a circle whose radius is AF. Then because AF, BG, LM, are to
                    each other respectively as <hi rend="italic">circ.</hi> AF, <hi rend="italic"
                    >circ.</hi> BG, <hi rend="italic">circ.</hi> LM, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Geom.</hi> part i. sect. vi. prop. 4. cor. i.), and because ½ (AF + BG)=LM,
                    therefore ½ <hi rend="italic">(circ. NFA-circ.</hi> BG)=circ. LM. Now the area
                    of the surface generated by the chord AB is ½ <hi rend="italic">(cire.</hi> AF
                    <hi rend="italic">A-circ.</hi> BG) ×AB, (prob. 3), therefore the same area is
                    also equal to <hi rend="italic">(circ.</hi> LM) ×AB. Draw AO parallel to FG, and
                    draw LN to the centre of the circle. Then the triangles AOB, LMN are manifestly
                    similar; therefore AB: AO :: NL: LM :: <hi rend="italic">cire.</hi> NL: <hi
                    rend="italic">cire.</hi> LM; and hence AO ×czrc. NL=AB×circ. LM. But this last
                    quantity has been proved equal to the surface generated by AB, therefore the
                    same surface is equal to AO ×cfre. NL, or to FG ×circ. NL, that is, to the
                    rectangle contained by FG and the circumference of a circle inscribed in the
                    polygon. In the same way it may be shown that the surfaces generated by BC, CD,
                    DE, are respectively equal to <hi rend="italic">Gü×circ.</hi> LN, HI <hi
                    rend="italic">×circ.</hi> LN, IK×czrc. LN. Therefore the whole surface generated
                    by the chords AB, BC, CD, DE, &amp;c., is equal to(FG+GH + HI+IK) × <hi
                    rend="italic">circ.</hi> LN=FK × <hi rend="italic">circ.</hi> LN. Conceive now
                    the number of chords between A and E to be indefinitely increased; then,
                    observing that the limit of the surface generated by the chords is the surface
                    generated by the arch ABCDE, and that the limit of NL is NP, the radius of the
                    generating circle, it follows that the spherical surface or zone generated by
                    the arch ACE is equal to the product of the circumference of the sphere by FK
                    the height of the zone.</p>

                <p>This rule has been investigated in <hi rend="smallcaps">Fluxions,</hi> sect. 163.
                    But it may be proved in a more elementary manner by means of the following
                    axiom. <hi rend="italic">If two solids be contained between two</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">parallel</hi><hi rend="italic">planes, and if the sections of
                    these solids by a third plane parallel to the other two, at any altitude, be
                    always equal to one another, then the solids themselves are equal. Or more
                    generally thus. If two solids between two parallel planes be such, that any
                    sections of them by a third plane parallel to the other two have always to each
                    other the same given ratio, then the solids themselves are to one another in
                    that ratio.</hi> We have given this proposition in the form of an axiom, for the
                    sake of brevity, but its truth may be strictly demonstrated, as has been done
                    when treating of pyramids and the sphere, in <hi rend="smallcaps">Geometry,</hi>
                    part ii. sect. ii. and iii.</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose ABE to be a quadrant, C the centre of the circle, AFEC a
                    square described about the quadrant, and CF the diagonal of the square. Suppose
                    the figures to revolve about AC as an axis, then the quadrant will generate a
                    hemisphere, the triangle ACF will generate a cone, and the square AE a cylinder.
                    Let these three solids be cut by a plane perpendicular to the axis, and meeting
                    the plane of the square, in the line DHBG, and join CB. Then because CDB is a
                    right-angled triangle, a circle described with CB as a radius is equal to two
                    circles described with CD and DB as radii. <hi rend="smallcaps">(Geom.</hi> part
                    i. sect. vi. prop. 4, cor. 2). But CB=DG, and since CA=AF, therefore CD=DH;
                    therefore the circle described with the radius DG, is equal to the sum of the
                    circles described with the radii DH, DB; that is, the section of the cylinder at
                    any altitude, is equal to the corresponding sections of the sphere and cone
                    taken together. Consequently, by the foregoing axiom, the cylinder is equal to
                    the hemisphere and cone taken together, and also the segment of the cylinder
                    between the planes AF, DG is equal to the sum of the segments of the hemisphere
                    and cone contained between the same planes. Put 2 CE, or 2 AF, the diameter of
                    the circle, <hi rend="italic">—d,</hi> and AD, the height of the spherical
                    segment, <hi rend="italic">=h.</hi> Then AC=½ &lt;7 and 2 CA—2 AD=2 CD=&lt;7-2
                    A. Let <hi rend="italic">n</hi> denote the number ∙7∙854. Then the area of the

                <p>To demonstrate this rule, let AGC and BHD be two equal semi-parabolas lying in

                    Let AD, BC be ordinates to the curves. Complete the rectangle AB CD, and
                    conceive it to revolve about AB as an axis; then the rectangle will generate a
                    cylinder, the radius of whose base will be AD, and the two semi-parabolas will
                    generate two equal paraboloids having the same base and altitude as the
                    cylinder. Let a plane be drawn perpendicular to the axis, and let FHGÉ be the
                    common section of this plane and the generating figure. Let P denote the

                    to the corresponding sections of the paraboloids taken together. Consequently
                    (by the axiom) the cylinder is equal to both the paraboloids taken together;
                    hence each is half a cylinder of the same base and altitude agreeing with the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gūaging</hi> treats of the measuring of casks, and other
                    things falling under the cognizance of the officers of the excise, and it has
                    received its name from a guage or rod used by the practitioners of the art.</p>
                <p>From the way in which casks are constructed, they are evidently solids of no
                    determinate geometrical figure. It is, however, usual to consider them as having
                    one or other of the four following forms:</p>
                <p>1. The middle frustum of a spheroid.</p>
                <p>2. The middle frustum of a parabolic spindle.</p>
                <p>3. The two equal frustums of a paraboloid.</p>
                <p>4. The two equal frustums of a cone.</p>
                <p>We have already given rules by which the content of each of these solids may be
                    found in cubic feet, inches, &amp;c. But as it is usual to express the contents
                    of casks in gallons, we shall give the rules again in a form suited to that mode
                    of estimating capacity. Observing that in each case the lineal dimensions of the
                    cask are supposed to be taken in inches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Problem</hi> I.</p>

                <p>The truth of this rule may be proved thus. Put B for FG, the bung diameter, (see
                    fig. next page) H for AH the head diameter, and L for AD, the length of the
                    cask, then (by prob. 14.) the content of the cask is (2B <hi rend="superscript">

                    The following rule, however, given by Dr. Hutton in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treatise on Mensuration,</hi> will apply equally to any cask whatever; and as
                    its truth had been proved by several casks which have been actually filled with
                    a true gallon measure, after their contents were computed by it, we presume it
                    is more to be depended upon than the others.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule.</hi></p>
                <p>Add into one sum thirty-nine times the square of the bung diameter, twenty-five
                    times the square of the head diameter, and twenty-six times the product of the
                    diameters; multiply the sum by the length, and the product by •00003147; the
                    last result gives the content in Imperial gallons.</p>
                <p>In investigating this rule the author assumed as a hypothesis, that one-third of
                    a cask at each end is nearly the frustum of a cone, and that the middle part may
                    be taken as the middle frustum of a parabolic spindle. This being supposed, let
                    AB and CD be the two right-lined parts and BC the parabolic part; produce AB and
                    DC to meet in E, and draw lines as in the figure. Let L, B, and H denote the
                    same as before. Then, since AB has the same direction as EB at B, ABE will be a
                    tangent to a parabola BF, and therefore FI=½ El.</p>
                <p>But BI=½ AK, and hence, by sim. triangles, EI=½ EK; consequently FI=½ EI=⅜ EK=½
                    FK= <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ (B—H); so that the common diameter BL=FG—2
