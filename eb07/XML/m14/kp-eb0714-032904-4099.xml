                    name from the city Thebes in Egypt, flιere it was raised. It was sent by
                    Diocletian to check he Bagaudae, who had excited some disturbances in Gaul,
                    laurice having carried his troops over the Alps, the Em-eror Maximinian
                    commanded him to employ his utmost xertions to extirpate Christianity. This
                    proposal was ≡ceived with horror both by the commander and by the )ldiers. The
                    emperor, enraged at their opposition, com- ∣anded the legion to be decimated;
                    and when they still eclared that they would sooner die than do any thing
                    rejudicial to the Christian faith, every tenth man of those ho remained was put
                    to death. Their perseverance exted the emperor to still greater cruelty; for
                    when he saw ∣at nothing could induce them to relinquish their relion, he
                    commanded his troops to surround them and cut .em in pieces. Maurice, the
                    commander of these Chris- 'ιn heroes, and Exuperus and Candidus, officers of the
                    gion, who had chiefly instigated the soldiers to this noble sistance, signalized
                    themselves by their patience and eir attachment to the doctrines of the
                    Christian religion, ιey were massacred at Agaune in Chablais, on the 22d
                    September 286. Notwithstanding many proofs in sup-rt of this transaction,
                    Dubordier, lĭottinger, Moyle, ιrnet, and Mosheim, are disposed to deny the fact.
                    But, the other hand, it is defended by Hicks, an English iter, and by Dorn
                    Joseph de Lisle, a Benedictine monk the congregation of Saint Vannes, in a work

                    ∙nxtorum</hi> for the month of September. The martyrdom ( this legion, written
                    by St Eucherius, bishop of Lyons, was transmitted to posterity in a very
                    imperfect manner by Surius. Chifflat, a Jesuit, discovered and gave to the
                    public an accurate copy of this work; and Don Ruinart maintains that it has
                    every mark of authenticity. St Maurice is the patron of a celebrated order in
                    the dominions of the king of Sardinia, created by Emanuel Philibert, duke of
                    Savoy, to reward military merit, and approved by Gregory XIII. in 1572. But the
                    commander of the Theban legion must not be confounded with another St Maurice,
                    mentioned by Theodoret, who suffered martyrdom at Apamea in Syria.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Maurice,</hi><hi rend="italic">St,</hi> a small city in
                    Switzerland, in the canton of Valais. It is remarkable as a pass between lofty
                    rocks through which the river Rhone has wrought a passage, and over which there
                    is a bridge of one arch. It was deemed by the Romans an important pass, and was
                    therefore strongly fortified by them; and many of their antiquities are now
                    found there. The name is taken from the leader of the Theban legion, who,
                    according to tradition, here destroyed the idols of the heathen inhabitants. It
                    now contains 1250 inhabitants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Maurice</hi><hi rend="italic">de Nassau,</hi> Prince of
                    Orange, succeeded to the government of the Low Countries after the death of his
                    father William, who was killed in 1584 by the fanatic Gérard. The young prince
                    was then only eighteen years of age, but his courage and abilities were above
                    his years. He was appointed captain-general of the United Provinces, and he
                    reared that edifice of liberty of which his father had laid the foundations.
                    Breda submitted to him in 1590; Zutphen, Deventer, Hulst, Nimeguen, in 1591. He
                    gained several important advantages in 1592, and in the following year he made
                    himself master of Gertruydenburg. When he had performed these splendid services,
                    he returned to the Low Countries by the way of Zealand. His fleet was attacked
                    by a dreadful tempest, in which he lost forty vessels, and he himself had very
                    nearly perished. His death would have been considered by the Hollanders as a
                    much greater calamity than the loss of their vessels. They watched over his
                    safety with exceeding care. In 1594, one of his guards was accused of an
                    intention to take away his life, and it was generally believed that he had been
                    bribed to do this service by the enemies of the republic; but he fell a
                    sacrifice at Bruges, either to his own fanaticism, or to the jealous anxiety of
                    the friends of Maurice. The Prince of Orange defeated the troops of the Archduke
                    Albert in 1597, and drove the Spaniards entirely out of Holland. In 1600 he was
                    obliged to raise the siege of Dunkirk; but he took ample vengeance upon Albert,
                    whom he again defeated in a pitched battle near Nieuport. Before the action,
                    this great general sent back the ships which had brought his troops into
                    Flanders. “My brethren,” said he to his army, “we must conquer the enemy or
                    drink up the waters of the sea. Determine for yourselves; 1 have resolved I
                    shall either conquer by your bravery, or never survive the disgrace of being
                    conquered by men in every respect our inferiors.” This speech elevated the
                    soldiers to the highest pitch of enthusiasm, and the victory was complete.
                    Rhinberg, Grave, and Ecluse, cities in Flanders, submitted in the following year
                    to the conqueror. Maurice, however, not only laboured for the commonwealth, but
                    also for himself. He coveted the sovereignty of Holland, but in the prosecution
                    of his design was opposed by the pensioner Barneveldt. But the zeal and activity
                    of this wise republican cost him his life. He was an Arminian; and at this time
                    Maurice defended Gomar against Arminius. In 1619, the prince, taking advantage
                    of the general odium under which the Arminians lay, found means to get
                    Barneveldt condemned. His death, which was wholly owing to the ambition of the
                    Prince of Orange, made a deep impression on the minds of the Hollanders. The
                    truce with Spain having expired, Spinola laid siege to Breda in 1624; and in <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194204112" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4112-0330"/> six months he
                    took the place, though with great slaughter , of his troops. The Prince of
                    Orange, having proved unsuccessful in every attempt to raise the siege, died of
                    vexation in 1625, at the age of fifty-five, being reputed the greatest warrior
                    of his time. “The life of this stadtholder,” says the Abbé Raynal, “was almost
                    an uninterrupted series of battles, of sieges, and of victories. Of moderate
                    abilities in everything else, he shone conspicuous in his military capacity. His
                    camp was the school of Europe; and those who received their military education
                    in his armies augmented, perhaps, the glory of their master. Like Montecuculi,
                    he discovered inimitable skill in his marches and encampments; like Vauban, he
                    possessed the talent of fortifying places, and of rendering them impregnable;
                    like Eugene, the address to find subsistence for great armies in countries
                    barren by nature, or ravaged by war; like Vendôme, the happy talent of calling
                    forth, in the moment when they became necessary, greater exertions from his
                    soldiers than could reasonably be expected; like Condé, that infallible
                    quickness of eye which usually decides the fortune of battles; like Charles XII.
                    the art of rendering his troops almost invincible to cold, hunger, and fatigue;
                    like Turenne, the secret of making war with the least possible expense of human
                    blood.” The Chevalier Folard maintains that Maurice was the greatest commander
                    of infantry since the time of the Romans. He studied the military art of the
                    ancients, and applied their rules with great exactness in the various
                    occurrences of war. He not only took advantage of the inventions of others, but
                    he also enriched the science of war with several improvements. Telescopes were
                    first used by him for military purposes; and, besides a kind of gallery in
                    conducting a siege, and the plan of blockading a strong place, which were of his
                    invention, he greatly improved the art by his method of pushing an attack with
                    great vigour, and of defending, for the greatest length of time, and in the best
                    manner, a place besieged. In short, the many useful things which he practised or
                    invented placed him in the highest rank amongst military men. On one occasion, a
                    lady of quality asked him, “Who was the first general of the age? Spinola,”
                    replied he, “is the second.” It was his constant practice, during sleep, to have
                    two guards placed by his bed-side, not only to defend him in case of danger, but
                    to awake him if there should be the least occasion. The war between Spain and
                    Holland was never carried on with greater vigour and animosity than during his
                    administration. The grand signior, hearing of the quantity of blood shed in this
                    contest, thought that a great empire must be depending on the decision. When the
                    object of so many battles was pointed out to him on a map, he said coldly, “If
                    it were my business, I would send my pioneers, and order them to cast this
                    little corner of earth into the sea.” Maurice was succeeded by Frederick Henry,
                    his brother.</p>
