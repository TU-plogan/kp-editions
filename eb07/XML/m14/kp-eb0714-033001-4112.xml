                <p><label type="entry">MAURITANIA</label>, an ancient kingdom of Africa, bounded on
                    the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by Getulia or Libya Interior, and
                    on the north by the Mediterranean, and comprehending the greater part of the
                    kingdoms of Fez and Morocco. Its ancient limits are not exactly mentioned by any
                    historian; neither can they now be ascertained by any modern observations, these
                    kingdoms being but little known to Europeans.</p>
                <p>This country was originally inhabited by a people called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mauri,</hi> concerning the etymology of whose name authors are not agreed. It
                    is probable, however, that the country, or at least great part of it, was first
                    called <hi rend="italic">Phut,</hi> since it appears from Pliny, Ptolemy, and St
                    Jerome, that a river and territory not far from Mount Atlas went by that name.
                    It likewise appears, from the Jerusalem Targum, that part of the Mauri may be
                    deemed the offspring of Lud, the son of Misraim, since his descendants,
                    mentioned in Genesis, are there called <hi rend="italic">Mauri</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mauritani.</hi> It is
                    certain that this region, as well as the others to the eastward of it, had many
                    colonies planted by the Phoenicians. Procopius tells •us that in his time were
                    to be seen two pillars of white stone, containing the following inscription in
                    the Phoenician language and character: “We are the Canaanites who fled from
                    Joshua the son of Nun, that notorious robber.” Ibnu Rachic, or Ibnu Raquig, an
                    African writer cited by Leo, and also Evagrius and Nicephorus Callistus, make
                    the same statement.</p>
                <p>The Mauritanians were, according to Ptolemy, divided into several cantons or
                    tribes. The Metagonitae were situated near the Straits of Hercules, now those of
                    Gibraltar; the Saccosii, or Cocosii, occupied the coast of the Iberian Sea; and
                    under these two petty nations the Masices, Vernes, and Verbicae or Vervicae,
                    were settled. The Salisae or Salinsae were situated lower, towards the ocean;
                    and, still more to the south were the Volubiliani. The Maurensii and Herpiditani
                    possessed the eastern part of this country, which was terminated by the Mulucha.
                    The Angaucani or Jangacaucani, Nectiberes, Zagrensii, Baniubae, andVa-cuntae,
                    extended from the southern base of Ptolemy’s Atlas Minor to his Atlas Major.
                    Pliny mentions the Baniurae, whom Father Hardouin takes to be Ptolemy’s
                    Baniubae; and Mela speaks of the Atlantes, whom he represents as possessing the
                    western part of this district.</p>
                <p>The earliest prince of Mauritania mentioned in history is Neptune; and next to
                    him were Atlas and Antaeus his two sons, both famous in the Grecian fables on
                    account of their wars with Hercules. Antaeus, in his contention with that hero,
                    seems to have behaved with great bravery and resolution. Having received
                    reinforcements of Libyan troops, he cut off numbers of Hercules’s men. But that
                    celebrated commander, having at last intercepted a strong body of Libyans sent
                    to the relief of Antaeus, inflicted on him a total overthrow, in which both he
                    and the greater part of his forces were put to the sword. This decisive action
                    put Hercules in possession of Libya and Mauritania, and consequently of the
                    riches of these kingdoms. Hence arose the fable, that Hercules, finding that
                    Antaeus, a giant of enormous size with whom he was engaged in single combat,
                    received fresh strength as often as he touched his mother earth when thrown upon
                    her, at last lifted him up in the air and squeezed him to death. Hence likewise
                    may be deduced the fable, which intimates that Hercules took the globe from
                    Atlas upon his own .shoulders, overcame the dragon which guarded the orchards of
                    the Hesperides, and made himself master of all the golden fruit it produced.
                    Bochart thinks that the fable alluded chiefly to naval engagements, in which
                    Hercules was for the most part victorious, though Antaeus from time to time
                    received succours by sea; but that at last FIercules, coming up with one of his
                    squadrons which had a strong reinforcement on board, made himself master of it,
                    and thus rendered Antaeus incapable for the future of making head against him.
                    The same author likewise insinuates, that the notion of the gigantic stature of
                    Antaeus, which prevailed for so many centuries amongst the Tingitanians, pointed
                    out the size of the vessels of which his fleets and squadrons were composed. As
                    for the golden apples so frequently mentioned by the old mythologists, they were
                    the treasures which fell into Hercules’s hands upon the defeat of Antaeus; the
                    Greeks giving to the oriental word Hxo, <hi rend="italic">riches,</hi> the
                    signification affixed to their own term <hi rend="italic">μriκa,</hi>
                    apples.</p>
                <p>With regard to the age in which Atlas and Antaeus lived, the most probable
                    supposition seems to be that of Sir Isaac Newton. According to that illustrious
                    author, Ammon, the father of Sesak, was the first king of Libya, or of that vast
                    tract extending from the borders of Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean, the conquest of
                    which country was effected by Sesak in his father’s lifetime. Neptune
                    afterwards<pb break="no" facs="nls:194204125" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4125-0331"/>
                    excited the Libyans to a rebellion against Sesak, and slew him, and then invaded
                    Egypt under the command of Atlas or Antaeus, the son of Neptune, Sesak’s brother
                    and admiral. Not long after, Hereules, the general of Thebais and Ethiopia,
                    reduced a second time the whole territory of Libya, having overthrown and slain
                    Antaeus near a town in Thebais, from that event called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antoea</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Antocopoli</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    s</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> Such is the notion advanced by Sir Isaae Newton,
                    who endeavours to prove that the first reduction of Libya, by Sesak, happened
                    about a thousand years before the birth of Christ, as the last, by Hercules, did
                    some years afterwards. Now, although we do not pretend to adopt every particular
                    cireumstance of Sir Isaae Newton’s system, yet we cannot forbear observing, that
                    it appears evident from Scripture, that neither the western extremity of Libya,
                    nor even the other parts of that region, could possibly have been so well
                    peopled before the time of David or Solomon, as to have sent a numerous army to
                    invade Egypt, since Egypt and Phoenicia, whence came the greater part of the
                    ancestors of the Libyans, and which were much nearer the place whence the first
                    dispersion of mankind took place, could not have been greatly overstocked with
                    inhabitants any considerable time before the reign of Saul. That such an
                    invasion, however, happened in the reign of Neptune, or at least in that of his
                    son Antaeus, has been most fully evinced by this distinguished chronologist.</p>
                <p>From the defeat of Antaeus nothing remarkable occurs in the history of Mauritania
                    till the times of the Romans, who at last brought the whole kingdom under their
                    jurisdiction. With regard to the customs and manners of this people, it would
                    seem, from what Hygimis insinuates, that they fought only with clubs, until one
                    Belus, the son of Neptune (as that author calls him), taught them the use of the
                    sword. Sir Isaac Newton is of opinion that this Belus was the same with
                    Sesostris king of Egypt, who overran a great part of the then known world.</p>
                <p>All persons of distinction in Mauritania went richly attired, wearing gold and
                    silver on their clothes. They took great pains in cleansing their teeth, and
                    curled their hair in a curious and elegant manner. They combed their beards,
                    which were long, and always had their nails closely paired. When they walked out
                    in any numbers they never touched one another, for fear of disconcerting the
                    curls into which their hair had been formed.</p>
                <p>The Mauritanian infantry, in time of action, used shields made of elephants’
                    skins, being clad in those of lions, leopards, and bears, which they kept on
                    both night and day. The cavalry of this nation were armed with broad, short
                    lances, and carried targets or bucklers made of the skins of wild beasts. They
                    used no saddles. Their horses were small and swift, had wooden collars about
                    their necks, and were so much under the command of their riders, that they
                    followed them like dogs. The habit of these horsemen was not much different from
                    that of the foot already mentioned; they constantly wore a large tunie of the
                    skins of wild beasts. The Phutaei, of whom the Mauritanians were a branch, were
                    eminent for their shields, and the excellent use they made of them, as we learn
                    from Homer, Xenophon, Herodotus, and Scripture. Nay, Herodotus seems to intimate
                    that the shield and helmet came from them to the Greeks.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the fertility of their soil, the poorer sorts of the Mauritanians
                    never took care to manure the ground, being strangers to the art of husbandry,
                    but roved about the country in a wild and savage manner, like the ancient
                    Scythians or <hi rend="italic">Arabes</hi><hi rend="italic">Scenitoe.</hi> They
                    had tents, or <hi rend="italic">mapalia,</hi> so extremely small that they could
                    scarcely breathe in them. Their food was corn, herbage, &amp;c. which they
                    frequently ate green, without any manner of preparation, being destitute of
                    wine, oil, and all the elegancies as well as many necessaries of life. Their
                    habit was the same both in summer and winter, consisting chiefly of an old
                    tattered though thick garment, and over it a coarse rough tunic, which answered
                    probably to that of their neighbours the Numidians. Most of them lay every night
                    upon the bare ground, though some of them strewed their garments thereon, not
                    unlike the Kabyles and Arabs of our day, who, according to Dr Shaw, use their
                    hykes for a bed and covering in the night.</p>
                <p>If the most approved reading of Horace may be admitted, the Mauritanians shot
                    poisoned arrows, which clearly intimates that they had some skill in the art of
                    preparing poisons, and were excellent bowmen. This last observation is
                    countenanced by Herodian and Aelian, who entirely come into it, affirming them
                    to have been in such continual danger of being devoured by wild beasts, that
                    they durst not stir out of their tents or mapalia without their darts. Such
                    perpetual exercise must have rendered them exceedingly skilful in hurling that
                    weapon. The Mauritanians sacrificed human victims to their deities <hi
                    rend="subscript">?</hi> like the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and other
                    nations.</p>
                <p>The country people were extremely rude and barbarous; but those inhabiting cities
                    must have had at least some smattering of the literature of the several nations
                    from whom they deduced their origin. That the Mauritanians had some knowledge of
                    naval affairs seems probable, not only from the intercourse they had with the
                    Phoenicians and Carthaginians, as well as the situation of their country, but
                    likewise from the statement of Orpheus or Onomacritus, who asserts that they had
                    made a settlement at the entrance into Colchis, to which place they came by sea.
                    To magic and sorcery, divination and witchcraft, they appear to have applied
                    themselves in very early times. Cieero and Pliny say that Atlas was the inventor
                    of astrology and the doctrine of the sphere, which he first introduced into
                    Mauritania. This, according to Diodorus Siculus, gave rise to the fable of Atlas
                    bearing the heavens upon his shoulders. The same author relates that Atlas
                    instructed Hercules in the doctrine of the sphere and astrology, or rather
                    astronomy, and that the latter afterwards brought these sciences into
                    Greece.</p>
