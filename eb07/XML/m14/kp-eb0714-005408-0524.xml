                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MALDIVE <hi rend="smallcaps">Islands</hi></label>. This large
                    chain of low islands and rocks, formed from coral, in the Indian Ocean, extends
                    from the equinoctial line to the eighth degree of north latitude, and is
                    situated between the seventy-second and seventy-fourth degrees of east
                    longitude. The greatest breadth of the range is said to be from twenty to
                    twenty-four leagues, and it is formed of large groups or clusters called
                    Attollons. Of these groups there are seventeen, which are most of them round;
                    some, again, are of an oval form, and are separated from one another by narrow
                    channels, which are unsafe for ships of burden, the bottom being coral, and the
                    anchorage near the rocky shore, on which the billows of the ocean beat with
                    incessant fury. The large islands are inhabited, and produce cocoa-nuts; but a
                    great proportion of the chain consists of mere rocks, rocky shoals, and
                    sand-banks, which are flooded at spring-tide. The houses of the natives are
                    built of wood, and covered with the leaves of the cocoa-nut tree, and are
                    scattered about very irregularly. The royal palace is of two stories in height,
                    and a handsome building; and near it are a good many cannon, and also a
                    magazine. These islands carry on a considerable trade with each other, and also
                    with the continent of India; and each island has its respective tradesmen, the
                    brewers residing in one group, the goldsmiths in another, and the locksmiths,
                    mat-makers, turners, &amp;c. reside each in their respective group. This
                    intercourse is carried on by means of a peculiar kind of boats with a small
                    deck, which are occasionally absent a twelvemonth from their own island; and on
                    these occasions their male children are taken with them, in order to accustom
                    them to a seafaring life. These islands were formerly much frequented by trading
                    ships from India. But they now arrive in their own boats, of thirty tons burden,
                    at Balasore, in Orissa, with the southwest monsoon, loaded with coir, cocoa-nut
                    oil, and all the other produce of the cocoa-nut tree, their grand staple; also
                    cowries, salt-fish, turtle-shell, &amp;c. They sail during the north-east
                    monsoon in December, with their return cargoes, namely, rice from Bengal, sugar,
                    hardware, broad cloth, manufactured cotton and silk goods, cutlery, silk stuffs,
                    coarse cottons, tobacco, &amp;c. This commerce has tended greatly to civilize
                    their manners, and to render them hospitable to strangers. Dried shark-fins are
                    exported to the Chinese market, where they are esteemed by that nation as an
                    excellent seasoning for soup. The poverty of these islands has preserved them
                    from invasion. The Portuguese erected a fort on one of them, but they were
                    quickly driven away; and their conquest was meditated by Hyder Ali, but he was
                    otherwise occupied by his wars with the British and the Mahrattas. The climate
                    is intensely hot, and too unhealthy for Europeans. The Maldivians profess the
                    Mahommedan religion, though mixed with other idolatrous superstitions. One of
                    their superstitious practices consists in loading a small vessel with perfumes,
                    gums, and odoriferous flowers, and turning it adrift at the mercy of the winds
                    and waves, as a peace-offering to the spirit of the winds, or to the king of the
                    sea. They are described as a mild, hospitable, and inoffensive race. It does not
                    appear that they ever go to war with each other; and the crew of a French
                    vessel, wrecked on one of the islands, was received in the kindest manner by the
                    chief and his subjects.</p>
