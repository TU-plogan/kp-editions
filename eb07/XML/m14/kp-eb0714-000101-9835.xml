                <p><label type="entry">MAGNETISM, ANIMAL</label>.</p>
                <p>THE term Animal Magnetism has been employed to denote an agency or influence to
                    which certain singular phenomena, occurring, or said to occur, in the economy of
                    particular individuals, have been supposed to be attributable. The phenomena
                    which;this agency has been conceived to produce in those to whom it is applied,
                    may be comprehended under two distinct classes; those which occur whilst the
                    person operated upon remains awake, and those which take place whilst the
                    patient is in a state of sleep, or in a state resembling it. To the former class
                    of effects belong, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> various sensations, more or
                    less painful, experienced particularly in those parts of the body that are the
                    seat of disease, and which enable the practitioner to detect what that seat
                    actually is; <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> convulsive and other nervous
                    affections, which have been regarded by the advocates of animal magnetism as
                    salutary crises; and, <hi rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> the removal of any
                    diseases with which the persons magnetised may be affected, the magnetic
                    influence proving in this respect an universal curative of disease and
                    preservative of health. Under the latter class of effects, or those occurring
                    whilst the persons magnetised are in the state of magnetic sleep, may be
                    included the power they acquire of carrying on a continued conversation with
                    their magnetiser, without being at all sensible of the presence or conversation
                    of others, and sometimes in a language, and upon matters, with which they are
                    little if at all acquainted; the power of discovering the secret thoughts of
                    others; the power of receiving, through the medium of the epigastrium, or other
                    parts of the circumference of the body, those impressions of external objects
                    which, in ordinary circumstances, are received only through the peculiar organs
                    or, external sensation, or that power which, in the technical language of
                    magnetism, is shortly termed the transference of the senses; the power of
                    detecting the internal alterations which have been produced by disease in their
                    own bodies, or in those of others with whom they may be placed, in the relation
                    of animal magnetism; the power of foretelling the nature of the changes which
                    are to occur in their own maladies, or in the maladies of others; the power of
                    instinctively suggesting the remedies by which these changes-may be best
                    promoted, and the cure of the diseases accomplished; together with various other
                    extraordinary, or, as they have usually been deemed where they have been
                    supposed to occur, preternatural powers of a similar kind.’</p>
                <p>These two classes of phenomena belong to different periods of the history of
                    animal magnetism. To those of the first class chiefly the early practitioners of
                    this mysterious art confined their pretensions; and it was only at a later
                    period that the magnetisers laid claim to the power of producing the wonderful
                    manifestations included under the second class. In the following article we
                    purpose briefly to trace the history of the opinions entertained respecting the
                    occurrence of the first class of phenomena, and the nature of the powers,
                    agencies, or dispositions, to which they ought to be ascribed; reserving the
                    consideration of the phenomena of the second class for the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Somnambulism.</hi></p>
                <p>The history of animal magnetism is interesting, from the illustration it affords
                    of some of the peculiar difficulties, arising out of the complex nature of the
                    human economy, and the various agencies, physical, vital, and mental, by which
                    it may be influenced, which present themselves to the medical inquirer, in his
                    endeavours to ascertain the real nature and the specific operations of remedial
                    agents. It is interesting, also, from the light it seems to throw upon that
                    disposition in human nature which has led man, in all ages and nations of the
                    world, to believe in the existence and agency of marvellous, magical, and
                    supernatural powers. But of the various effects which have been supposed to
                    result from the operation of such powers, none has obtained a more universal or
                    lasting belief than that of the cure of diseases, by influences or agencies
                    altogether different, in their nature and mode of operation, from those ordinary
                    remedial means, in the use of which the experience and studies of medical men
                    have taught them to place all their hopes of success in the practice of their
                    art. There seems reason to believe, however, that the existence and operation of
                    those spontaneous processes by which the animal economy is in a great number of
                    instances restored from a morbid to a healthy condition, have at all times
                    mainly contributed to produce and to foster such beliefs. The public in general,
                    and perhaps <pb break="no" facs="nls:194199848" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9848-0002"
                    />even the medical profession itself, have very inaccurate notions what share in
                    those changes on which the restoration of health depends, is attributable to the
                    remedies employed, and what share to circumstances occurring in the economy
                    independently of medical aid; and consequently no very great address has ever
                    been required on the part of pretenders to extraordinary powers in the cure of
                    diseases, to persuade both the learned and the unlearned, that the means which
                    they have administered or recommended were entitled to the whole merit of the
                    cures that ensued.</p>
                <p>The remarkable property which the loadstone or magnet possesses, of attracting
                    iron, appears to have very early excited the attention of philosophers.
                    Aristotle informs us that Thales, who lived six hundred years before our era,
                    ascribed this property of the magnet to its being endowed with a soul, without
                    which, he conceived, no motion of any kind could take place. It does not seem
                    surprising, that a substance manifesting such singular physical properties as
                    those which the magnet possesses, should by analogy have been conceived to be
                    capable of exerting some special influence upon the human economy; and
                    accordingly we find that various remarkable, but at the same time very opposite
                    properties, were ascribed to it by the old authors, one regarding it as a
                    substance capable of acting upon the moral, and another upon the physical part
                    of the economy; some looking upon it as possessing decidedly noxious and
                    morbific qualities, and others considering it as an agent endowed with highly
                    salutary medicinal powers. Thus the loadstone was superstitiously believed to
                    have the power of exciting love, of detecting adultery, and of re-establishing
                    conjugal fidelity and happiness. Its use was resorted to by some under the
                    belief that it ¼'as capable of prolonging the period of youth, whilst, by
                    others, properties directly deleterious were ascribed to it. Hence, in several
                    medical works, we find it ranged in the list of poisons, and its antidotes duly
                    pointed out. Hippocrates, in his <hi rend="italic">Essay on Internal
                    Diseases,</hi> recommends the use of the <hi rend="italic">magnesian</hi> or
                    loadstone as a purgative; and Dioscorides and Galen inform us that the natural
                    magnet was in their time employed in a pulverized state as an evacuant,
                    particularly in cases of melancholy and dropsy. By more modern authors, and
                    especially by Rattray, Reuss, Zwinger, and other physicians of the fifteenth and
                    sixteenth centuries, the internal use of the powdered loadstone was extended to
                    the treatment of a number of other diseases, such as catarrhs, diarrhoeas,
                    haemorrhagies, burns, erysipelas, quartan fevers, cancer, worms, nervous
                    affections, and various diseases of the eye, spleen, and uterus.</p>
                <p>But besides being administered as an internal remedy, the loadstone in a
                    pulverized state was likewise employed as an external application. Pliny says
                    that the powder of the magnet is useful in diseases of the eyes, and for the
                    cure of burns and scalds; and Serapion, a medical author of the ninth century,
                    mentions that powder as an ingredient in a plaster which he had applied to
                    poisoned wounds, evidently in the belief that by its attractive power it would
                    be instrumental in extracting from these wounds the poisons with which they
                    might happen to be impregnated. Platearius, in the thirteenth century,
                    recommended the application of the loadstone to wounds, both in the form of a
                    simple powder, and as an ingredient in an attractive vulnerary plaster. This
                    magnetic, or divine plaster, as it was sometimes termed, appears to have been
                    very generally used in the surgery of those times. Boet de Boet speaks of it as
                    a remedy adapted for the cure of all kinds of wounds, as calculated to purify
                    them from all malignity, to favour the generation of new flesh, and to avert all
                    those accidents with which wounds are liable to become complicated during the
                    progress of their treatment. Paracelsus imagined that the pulverized magnet,
                    formed into a plaster, was capable of attracting any particles of iron which
                    might happen to be lodged in wounds inflicted with steel weapons; and
                    accordingly it was employed for that purpose by several of his followers, and
                    applied also as an attractive plaster in gout and in mania, and as an
                    alexipharmic remedy in the plague.</p>
                <p>Dr Gilbert of Colchester, in his excellent <hi rend="italic">Experimental
                    Treatise on the Magnet,</hi> published in 1600, first distinctly stated that the
                    loadstone has its magnetic properties completely destroyed by being reduced to
                    the state of a powder, and consequently that in this state it could act on the
                    animal economy only as a ferruginous substance. Yet, notwithstanding the
                    knowledge of this precise and incontrovertible fact, the pulverized magnet
                    continued to be Used by various medical practitioners, both as an internal
                    expulsive remedy, and as an external attractive application, up to the beginning
                    of the eighteenth century. Since that period the employment of the powdered
                    loadstone appears to have been entirely abandoned, both in medicine and in
                    surgery; and it is now, in the retrospect, singular, and indeed somewhat
                    humiliating, to remark how many delusive and groundless fancies existed amongst
                    well-informed medical men regarding the peculiar action and virtues of that
                    substance, and in what decided language many respectable authors have spoken
                    both of its noxious and salutary effects; knowing, as we now do, that it was
                    physically impossible it could possess any of the properties attributed to it,
                    or indeed exercise any physiological or therapeutical powers beyond those which
                    depended on its containing a portion of iron in its composition. In the strange
                    medley of superstitious beliefs and practices which have been enumerated, we
                    have a remarkable and instructive example of that sort of knowledge which has
                    not unfrequently been denominated medical experience. The history of the materia
                    medica furnishes but too many examples of remedies which have enjoyed, in the
                    confidence of the public, and of the medical profession, an equally high and
                    undeserved place with the magnet, and which are now wholly discarded from the
                    pharmacopoeia. How many of those much-vaunted remedies that are still in popular
                    repute, and in use even with medical men, are destined, in the progress of
                    therapeutical science, to undergo the same fate, time only can reveal.</p>
                <p>A slight account of the virtues attributed to the action of the magnet in its
                    entire state, upon the human economy, will be found to be not less illustrative
                    of the difficulties which occur in judging between the real and the supposed
                    effects of therapeutic agents, and particularly between the operation of
                    physical and mental influences in the relief and cure of diseases, than that
                    which has just now been given of the supposed virtues of the magnet employed in
                    a pulverized form. Aetius appears to have been the first Greek author who
                    mentioned the use, in medicine, of the magnet in its natural or unpulverized
                    state. He says, that when held in the hand of the patient, it had been reported
                    to prove beneficial in allaying the pains of gout, and in curing convulsions.
                    The employment of the magnet in this form, and for nearly the same purposes, is
                    alluded to by other Greek, and by some Arabian physicians; but the author who
                    first brought the virtues of the <hi rend="italic">entire</hi> magnet most
                    prominently into repute, was the celebrated Paracelsus. In his works, published
                    at Basel in the earlier part of the sixteenth century, this author has made the
                    medicinal virtues of the magnet, in all its forms and preparations, but
                    particularly in its entire state, the subject of much theoretical and mystical
                    explanation, not to add exaggerated panegyric. He attributes to it the property
                    of dislodging and attracting towards itself all material diseases; and in this
                    list he includes uterine discharges, fluxes of the belly, jaundice, dropsy,
                    hernia, ulcers, hysteria, epilepsy, spasms.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194199861" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9861-0003"/>
                <p>tetanus, convulsions of pregnant women, defluxions of the eyes, ears, nose,
                    mouth, and external parts, cancers, fistulae, and congestions of blood. To this
                    copious list of diseases said by Paracelsus to be susceptible of being relieved
                    or cured by the magnet in its entire state, a considerable number was added by
                    his more immediate followers, and by several medical authors of the seventeenth
                    and the commencement of the eighteenth centuries; more especially by Van
                    Helmont, Borel, Reichel, Klarich, and Kircher. The use of this remedy was
                    extended by these authors to the treatment of mania, palsy, palpitations,
                    &amp;c.; and its employment in convulsions, and in painful affections,
                    particularly in toothach and rheumatism, was highly recommended.</p>
                <p>The belief in the efficacy of the magnet, whether administered internally or
                    applied externally, in curing diseases, seems, with most of those who adopted
                    it, to have constituted only a part, of a great ∙ system, in which they
                    recognised magnetism as a general power or principle, pervading the whole
                    universe, and establishing particular connections between all its various parts.
                    To these mutual relations of the different parts of the universe, material and
                    animated, they gave the names, sometimes of attraction and repulsion, and
                    sometimes of sympathy and antipathy. Gilbert, to whose work upon the magnet
                    reference has already been made, conceived that the earth is a great magnet,
                    which acts and is acted upon by the other planets in the universe; and that this
                    planetary influence operates upon all the bodies, animate and inanimate, which
                    exist upon the surface of our globe. Fludd, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophia</hi><hi rend="italic">Moysaica,</hi> published in 1638, developed a
                    theory of the universe, in which its phenomena were mainly accounted for by the
                    attractive or magnetic virtue, and the antipathy of bodies. Man, considered as
                    the microcosm, he held to be endowed with a magnetic virtue, subject to the same
                    laws as that of the great world; having his poles like the earth, and his
                    favourable and contrary winds. He describes the circumstances which produce
                    negative or positive magnetism between different persons; and states, that when
                    the latter subsists, not only the diseases and particular affections, but even
                    the moral affections, are communicated from the one person to the other.
                    Kircher, in his work on the magnet, published at Rome in 1641, describes the
                    influence of magnetism, not only as it is universally diffused throughout the
                    planetary system, but also as acting upon and existing in minerals, plants, and
                    animals. He seems to have been the first author who made the distinction
                    between, and employed the terms of, mineral, vegetable, and animal magnetism.

                    Digby, and others, was founded.</p>
                <p>The medicinal virtues of the loadstone in its entire state continued occasionally
                    to engage the attention of medical men up to the middle of the eighteenth
                    century, when, in consequence of the great improvements that had been made in
                    forming artificial magnets possessing stronger attractive powers than the
                    natural loadstone, and admitting of a much more ready application in the
                    treatment of diseases (from their being of comparatively small size, and capable
                    of being adapted to all parts of the body), these were substituted instead of
                    the loadstone. Numerous reports were soon published in medical journals, and in
                    separate publications, of the great efficacy and success of these instruments.
                    One of those who distinguished themselves the most in the formation and use of
                    artificial magnets, was Μ. le Noble, a French abbé, who obtained for the magnets
                    which he had manufactured the approbation of the Royal Academy of Sciences at
                    Paris. In applying his magnets to different parts of the body, Μ. le Noble
                    employed them sometimes temporarily, and of great size and power; but, for more
                    general and permanent use, he had them formed into different pieces of
                    ornamental or useful dress, such as caps or bandeaux for the head, necklaces,
                    crosses, bracelets, girdles, and garters. By numerous and frequent trials, he
                    convinced himself, and satisfied many of his patients, that his magnetic dresses
                    and ornaments were often speedy and effectual means of cure in a great variety
                    of diseases. After having been engaged for a number of years in forming
                    artificial magnets, and in adapting them to the different parts of the body, Μ.
                    le Noble was, in 1777, induced to apply to the Royal Society of Medicine of
                    Paris, and to request that they would appoint a committee of their body to make
                    an experimental trial of the medicinal virtues of his magnets. The society, in
                    compliance with his wishes, appointed two of its members, Messieurs Andry and
                    Thouret, to undertake this task, and to report to them the result of their
                    investigations. These gentlemen appear to have bestowed unwearied diligence and
                    taken uncommon pains in their trials of Μ. le Noble’s magnets and ornamental
                    dresses, in the treatment of the diseases of no fewer than forty-eight patients,
                    whom they selected for the purpose. We learn by the very full and circumstantial
                    report which they drew up of these cases (read to the Royal Society of Medicine
                    on the 29th August 1780, and afterwards published in its Memoirs), that they
                    were fully convinced, by the trials which they themselves had made, as well as
                    from the previous records of medicine, that the magnet is capable o producing a
                    great variety of salutary effects upon the human economy in different states of
                    disease, “The diseases,” MM. Thouret and Andry remark, “in which w¢ have
                    employed the magnet, have <hi rend="italic">been, first,</hi> different kinds of
                    painful affections, as those of the teeth, nervous pains in the head and of the
                    kidneys, rheumatic pains, and that particular affection of the face known under
                    the name of tic-douloureux; and, <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> spasmodic
                    affections, such as spasms of the stomach, convulsive hiccough, cramps of tin
                    extremities, and palpitations, different kinds of tremblings convulsions,
                    epilepsy, and vertigo.” The experimenters were convinced of the medicinal
                    efficacy of the magnet <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> by their observing that in
                    most instances its application was either immediately or in a short time
                    followed by the total cessation, or great alleviation, of the diseased
                    affections for which it was employed; <hi rend="italic">secondly</hi> by the
                    sudden return of these affections when the magnet was withdrawn or accidentally
                    displaced; and, <hi rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> by their frequently observing
                    the great relief which many of their patients experienced in having their
                    magnetic dresses renewed when their influence had been exhausted or had become
                    effete. Besides the salutary effects which resulted in painful and spasmodic
                    affections, from the use of the magnets and of magnetic dresses, MM. Andry and
                    Thouret mention also a variety of other physiological phenomena which they had
                    observed in their experiments; such <pb break="no" facs="nls:194199874"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9874-0004"/>for instance, as the sudden excitement of
                    anomalous and remarkable sensations of heat or cold, of itchiness or pricking
                    pains in the parts to which the magnet was applied, and sometimes even the
                    aggravation instead of the alleviation of the old pains, or the production of
                    pains entirely new; together with the sudden and considerable increase of
                    different secretions, such as those of perspiration, the urine, and other alvine
                    excretions. In one instance the use of magnetised water was observed to be
                    constantly followed by an evacuation of the bowels. It is mentioned by Andry and
                    Thouret that several of their patients affirmed that they saw the skin dart
                    forward to the magnet when it was brought near to their bodies; and that that
                    instrument produced its curative effects when it was kept at some distance from
                    the body, as well as when it was brought into contact with the diseased parts.
                    MM. Andry and Thouret acknowledge, that in a variety of instances they had
                    failed in procuring relief for their patients by magnetism, and this they
                    ascribe partly to the magnet’s having been too weak, or applied for too short a
                    period of time, and partly also to the incurable nature of the diseases with
                    which some of their patients were affected.</p>
                <p>In reviewing this laborious and most minute investigation of the numerous and
                    greatly varied effects which were observed to occur after the application of
                    artificial magnets, we cannot but feel some degree of surprise that no suspicion
                    should have arisen in the minds of the experimenters, that some of these effects
                    might be the result of those spontaneous operations of the economy itself,
                    which, from the earliest periods of medical science, have been known under the
                    appellation of the <hi rend="italic">Vires</hi><hi rend="italic">Conservatrices
                    et Médicatrices</hi><hi rend="italic">Natures</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that
                    others were the effect of a proper and stricter attention perhaps to clothing,
                    diet, and regimen than had been previously employed; and that the greater part
                    of the sudden cures were probably the result of hope, engendered by belief in
                    the efficacy of the remedy and confidence in those who applied it, or of other
                    mental impressions, the influence of which in producing remarkable and sudden
                    effects upon the corporeal and mental functions of the human economy, and in
                    promoting the operation of remedial agents, has long been recognised by medical
                    men under the general, but not always accurately defined, term of the power of
                    imagination.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the very favourable nature of the report of MM. Andry and
                    Thouret, the use of the magnet as a therapeutical agent does not appear to have
                    been promoted by it in France; a circumstance which must in a great measure be
                    ascribed to the public attention having been at that time particularly engaged
                    by the more ostentatious pretensions and splendid apparatus of certain other
                    curative processes, which will be presently noticed. Since that period, however,
                    several French authors have alluded in their writings to its use. Professor
                    Alibert, in his work on Therapeutics, speaks of its action on the human economy
                    as incontestable. The late Μ. Laennce, in his excellent treatise on Diseases of
                    the Chest, states that he had in his own practice employed with marked success
                    magnetised steel plates applied to the chest in asthma or painful affections of
                    the lungs, and in angina pectoris, or painful affections of the heart. MM. Mérat
                    and Lens, in their dictionary of Materia Medica (1829), seem inclined to concede
                    to the magnet a certain degree of medicinal action, and cite several
                    distinguished Parisian physicians of the present day (MM. Recamier, Cayol, and
                    ChomeD as having observed facts corroborative of those mentioned by MM. Andry
                    and Thouret. We are even assured that the application of strong magnets was
                    extensively employed at Vienna by Drs Becker and Schmidt, in the treatment of
                    cholera during its epidemic prevalence in that city, and with most beneficial
                    effects; and lately one of these gentlemen (Dr Schmidt) has endeavoured to call
                    the attention of English practitioners to its use as a medicinal agent, in a
                    paper published in the London Medical and Surgical Journal for November
                    1835.</p>
                <p>As nearly allied to the magnet in their mode of application and operation, and in
                    the effects described as arising from their employment for the cure of diseases,
                    may be noticed here the instruments invented by Mr Perkins of Connecticut in
                    North America, towards the end of last century, and denominated by him metallic
                    tractors. These instruments, which were all fashioned after one particular
                    pattern, consisted of an alloy of different metals. They had a semi-globular
                    shape at one end, and at the other terminated in a sharp, sword-like point. In
                    employing the tractors, Mr Perkins directed that the diseased and neighbouring
                    parts should be slightly rubbed or touched with the sharp point, for a longer or
                    shorter time, according to circumstances; and in some cases the instruments were
                    ordered to be drawn over the affected part in one particular direction, and in
                    other cases in a different direction. Mr Perkins, from numerous experiments
                    which he made with his instruments, was convinced that their employment had
                    proved beneficial in a great number of diseases, as in different kinds of
                    inflammation, in diseases of the nerves, bums, contusions, envenomed wounds,
                    ophthalmia, erysipelas, herpes, rheumatism, gout, headach, toothach, pain of the
                    breast, and other topical diseases. The state of Connecticut, in consideration
                    of the value of Mr Perkins’ discovery, granted him a patent for the manufacture
                    of his instruments. Soon afterwards his son came over to England, and practised
                    for some time the medicinal employment of the tractors with great fame and
                    success in London. At the same time, their use was introduced into Denmark, and
                    other parts of the continent of Europe, by different individuals; and several
                    pamphlets were published, both abroad and in this country, containing accounts
                    of their wonderful efficacy.</p>
                <p>In 1799, being the year subsequent to that in which the younger Perkins came to
                    England, and when the employment and effects of the metallic tractors were
                    exciting in a very great degree the attention of the English public, both
                    professional and non-professional, the late Dr Haygarth of Bath determined to
                    perform some experiments with a view of putting to the test the accuracy of the
                    effects attributed to these instruments, and of endeavouring to trace the nature
                    and cause of their effects. The first suggestion of the experiments that were
                    performed for this purpose was originally communicated by that gentleman to Dr
                    Falconer. “The tractors,” he observed, “have obtained such high reputation at
                    Bath, even among persons of rank and understanding, as to require the particular
                    attention of physicians. Let their merit be impartially investigated, in order
                    to support their fame, if it be well founded, or to correct the public opinion,
                    if merely formed upon delusion. Such a trial may be accomplished in the most
                    satisfactory manner, and ought to be performed without any prejudice. Prepare a
                    pair of false exactly to resemble the true tractors. Let the secret be kept
                    inviolable, not only from the patient, but every other person. Let the efficacy
                    of both be impartially tried, beginning always with the false tractors. The
                    cases should be accurately stated, and the reports of the effects produced by
                    the true and false tractors be fully given in the words of the patients.”
                    Experiments of the kind suggested by Dr Haygarth were made on a number of
                    persons affected with the diseases in which the metallic tractors had been
                    represented to prove beneficial,—at Bath by Drs Haygarth and Falconer, at
                    Bristol by Mr Smith, and in Germany by Schumacher; and the results which were
                    obtained, particularly as regards the removal of uneasy sensations, and the
                    production of various feelings not previously experienced, were not less
                    wonderful than those <pb break="no" facs="nls:194199887"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9887-0005"/>which the advocates of the genuine tractors had
                    recorded. We shall content ourselves with quoting, from the very valuable
                    reports furnished to Dr Ηaygarth by Mr Smith, the notes of two cases in which
                    the spurious tractors were employed; the one illustrating the disappearance of
                    pain and stiffness in a joint, and the other the appearance of intense pain and
                    other symptoms, during, and to all appearance in consequence of, the employment
                    of these instruments.</p>
                <p>“Robert Thomas, aged forty-three, who had been for some time under the care of Dr
                    Lovell in the Bristol infirmary,-with a rheumatic affection of the shoulder,
                    which rendered his arm perfectly useless, was pointed out as a proper object of
                    trial by Mr T. W. Dyer, apothecary to the house. Tuesday, April 19th, having
                    everything in readiness, I passed through the ward, and, in a way that he might
                    suspect nothing, questioned him respecting his complaint. I then told him that I
                    had an instrument in my pocket which had been very serviceable to many in his
                    state; and when I had explained to him how simple it was, he consented to
                    undergo the operation. In six minutes no other effect was produced than a warmth
                    upon the skin; and I feared that this <hi rend="italic">coup d’essai</hi> had
                    failed. The next day, however, he told me that ‘he had received so much benefit
                    that it had enabled him to lift his hand from his knee, which he had in vain
                    several times attempted on the Monday evening, as the whole ward witnessed.’ The
                    tractors I used being made of lead, I thought it advisable to lay them aside,
                    lest, being metallic points, the proof against this fraud might be less
                    complete. Thus much, however, was proved, that the patent tractors possessed no
                    specific power independent of simple metals. Two pieces of wood, properly shaped
                    and painted, were next made use of; and, in order to add solemnity to the farce,
                    Mr Barton held in his hand a stop-watch, whilst Mr Lax minuted the effects
                    produced. In four minutes the man raised his hand several inches, and he had
                    lost also the pain in his shoulder usually experienced when attempting to lift
                    any thing. He continued to undergo the operation daily, and with progressive
                    good effect; for on the 25th he could touch the mantel-piece. On the 27th, in
                    the presence of Dr Lovell and Mr J. P. Noble, two common iron nails, disguised
                    with sealing-wax, were substituted for the pieces of mahogany before used. In
                    three minutes ‘ he felt something moving from his arm to his hand,’ and soon
                    after he touched the board of rules, which hung a foot above the fire-place.
                    This patient at length so far recovered that he could carry coals, &lt;fcc. and
                    use his arm sufficiently to assist the nurse; yet previous to the use of the
                    spurious tractors, ‘ he could no more lift his hand from his knee than if a
                    hundredweight were upon it, or a nail driven through it;’ as he declared in the
                    presence of several gentlemen, whose names I shall have frequent occasion to
                    mention. The fame of this case brought applications in abundance; indeed, it
                    must be confessed, that it was more than sufficient to act upon weak minds, and
                    induce a belief that these pieces of wood and iron were endowed with some
                    peculiar virtues.”</p>
                <p>“April 20th, I requested Mr Barton to operate upon Peter Seward, aged thirty-two,
                    who had, for four years, been troubled with pains and weakness in his right arm.
                    From the minutes taken by Mr Lax, I learned that he had experienced a good deal
                    of pain during the operation. The next day I was assisted by Mr Bernard and Mr
                    Lowe jun.; and as the case is rather curious, I shall copy verbatim the notes
                    written upon the spot. In one minute, ‘ feels the pain coming on at the same
                    place as yesterday; the limbs feel warm; pain higher up and sharper ;’ in two
                    minutes, ‘ pain increases ;’ in three and a half, ‘ very acute, darting towards
                    the collar-bone, and begins to give him so much uneasiness that he will not have
                    it done any longer ;’ perspires profusely, and is gone to bed.</p>
                <p>“It was fortunate for me that the above gentlemen could bear witness to the
                    remarkable effects of the imagination; it was, notwithstanding, I believe,
                    generally thought in the house that the account was exaggerated. On the 25th,
                    however, in the presence of Messrs Jolliffe, Barton, Gaisford, Emery, and Wylde,
                    Dr Lovell made use of one bit of mahogany, whilst I gently drew down the man’s
                    arm with the point of the other. When he sat down he was ‘ perfectly easy.’ In a
                    few seconds ‘ the pain commenced as before ;’ in two minutes it was very acute
                    at the elbow and collar-bone; in four he became very uneasy, looked very red in
                    the face, and begged the operation might be discontinued. This request was
                    complied with, and he immediately went to bed with a pulse at 120°. Three
                    quarters of an hour after, being still in bed, I asked him how he felt himself.
                    He replied that he was in more pain than when the surgeon took five pieces of
                    bone from his leg, in a compound fracture which he unfortunately met with in
                    Wales. It may, perhaps, be thought that he feigned all this. I cannot assert
                    that he did not; but he could have no point to gain by such a conduct, and he
                    certainly must have been a very excellent mimic to deceive so many people. This
                    case excited much curiosity; and, on the second of May, Dr Moncrieffe, Messrs
                    Noble, Greatman, Clayfield, Probert, Notcutt, Lax, and Jolliffe, were assembled
                    to view the effects produced by those two wonder-working pieces of wood. The man
                    dreaded the operation so much, that he requested to have it done in bed. Mr
                    Clayfield and myself used the tractors. In a few seconds, a spasm was evident
                    upon the <hi rend="italic">biceps flexor</hi><hi rend="italic">cubiti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> in two minutes, pain in the arm and collar-bone; in three,
                    increased in the hand and armpit, and he continued in pain some time after the
                    operation, which had considerably accelerated his pulse. This patient could
                    scarcely be prevailed upon to submit any longer to their use, although he
                    confessed that upon the whole he had received much benefit.”</p>
                <p>The nature of the facts elicited by the experiments of Dr Haygarth, Mr Smith, and
                    others, was such as to prove to the satisfaction of every one that the metallic
                    tractors of Mr Perkins did not produce their effects upon the human system by
                    any action peculiar to themselves, but by some influence or agency altogether
                    independent of the particular materials of which the instruments were composed,
                    and common to them with every other substance mineral and vegetable, that was
                    employed in the same manner. Dr Haygarth himself had no hesitation in ascribing
                    these effects to the influence of the imagination. “I have long been aware,”
                    says he, “of the great importance of medical faith. Daily experience has
                    constantly confirmed and increased my opinion of its efficacy. On numerous
                    occasions I have declared that I never wished to have a patient who did not
                    possess a sufficient portion of it. The trials with the false tractors place its
                    efficacy in a very conspicuous point of view, and must even astonish persons who
                    have particularly attended to this subject; they clearly prove what wonderful
                    effects the passions of hope and faith, excited by mere imagination, can produce
                    upon diseases. On this principle we may account for the marvellous recoveries
                    frequently ascribed to empirical remedies, which are commonly inert drugs, and
                    generally applied by the ignorant patient in disorders totally different from
                    what the quack himself pretends that they can cure. Magnificent and unqualified
                    promises inspire weak minds with implicit confidence.”</p>
                <p>These experiments are worthy of being recalled to the attention of the public,
                    and of being kept in mind by those who are at present endeavouring to revive the
                    use of natural or artificial magnets as therapeutic agents; the more so that it
                    does not appear to have occurred to MM. Andry and Thouret, nor to those who have
                    since employed the magnet, to put the results which they obtained from <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194199900" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9900-0006"/> the use of that
                    agent to the test, by a comparative series or trials of the description
                    suggested by Dr Haygarth.</p>
                <p>After this slight sketch of the various fates of the mineral magnet as a
                    therapeutical agent, we come now to consider those practices which have usually
                    been comprehended under the name of animal magnetism, or which might perhaps be
                    more properly denominated Mesmerism. These practices were invented and brought
                    into full operation and high repute by Mesmer, a German physician, whose claims
                    to original, wonderful, and useful discovery have been, and still continue to
                    be, so differently estimated. The character and procedure of this remarkable
                    person arc, we conceive, so intimately interwoven with the credibility of his
                    discoveries, as to render his personal history a leading and most essential
                    consideration, in any view that can be taken of animal magnetism.</p>
                <p>Mesmer appears to have been, from the commencement of his medical career,
                    strongly inclined to the study of the occult and astrological sciences. On
                    taking his degree in physic at Vienna, in 1766, he chose for the subject of his
                    inaugural dissertation, the Influence of the Planets on the Human Body; a choice
                    which indicated the natural bias of his mind, and which could not fail to
                    determine in some degree the course of his future speculations and pursuits. Me
                    have not had an opportunity of seeing that dissertation, but, from the account
                    given of its contents by Mesmer himself in his subsequent writings, it would
                    appear that in it he had endeavoured to prove that the planets not only act upon
                    one another through the medium of a fluid universally diffused, but that they
                    likewise exercise an unceasing influence, by means of this fluid, over the
                    nervous systems of animated beings. That property of the animal economy which
                    renders it susceptible of the action of this principle, Mesmer informs us he
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">animal magnetism.</hi> He conceived that the <hi
                    rend="italic">intension</hi> and <hi rend="italic">remission</hi> of this
                    magnetic fluid produces in the animal economy a flux and reflux similar to that
                    which the sea exhibits in the ebbing and flowing of its tides; and he attributed
                    to this flux and reflux the periodical changes which appear in the economy of
                    the female sex, and, in general, those periodicities which physicians of all
                    times and of all countries have observed to occur in the course of diseases. To
                    this train of investigation Mesmer informs us that he was led by a persuasion
                    which he had early adopted, that there arc few of the opinions which have been
                    very generally entertained by mankind, however erroneous or absurd they may
                    appear to us, which have not had some foundation in nature, and consequently
                    which do not contain in them something true and useful.,</p>
                <p>After taking his degree in physic, Mesmer settled as a physician ⅛ Vienna. He is
                    said to have made an advantageous marriage; and he himself alludes, in one of
                    his writings <hi rend="italic">{Précis Historique,</hi> p. 67), to his being
                    easy or independent in his circumstances. The first public account that was
                    given of Mesmer’s discovery of animal magnetism as a remedial agent is to be
                    found in a letter of date 5th January 1775, addressed by him to Dr Unzer of
                    Altona, which was printed in the <hi rend="italic">Nouveau Mercure Savant</hi>
                    of that city, and which he appears to have soon afterwards circulated
                    extensively amongst the different learned societies and academies of Europe.
                    From the statement contained in this letter, it appears that, during the two
                    preceding years, Mesmer had had living in his house, under medical treatment,
                    Mademoiselle Oestcrline, a lady twenty-nine years of age, who was suffering from
                    a very complicated nervous disorder, consisting, as he informs us, of repeated
                    attacks of an hysterical fever, conjoined at intervals with obstinate vomitings,
                    inflammations of the different viscera, retentions of urine, violent toothachs
                    and ear-achs, melancholic and maniacal delirium, opisthotonos, faintings,
                    blindness, suffocations, palsies of several days’ duration, and other symptoms.
                    In the progress of this case, Mesmer found, that though he succeeded, by great
                    attention, and by the employment of the usual remedies, in obtaining a temporary
                    abatement or cessation of the symptoms, these recurred from time to time. But he
                    came at last to be able to foresee these relapses, their progress, duration, and
                    declension; and was led, as he informs us, to conceive the idea of establishing
                    in the body of his patient a kind of <hi rend="italic">artificial tide,</hi> by
                    means of the magnet. This project he communicated to Father Hell, astronomer to
                    their imperial majesties, who approved of it, and offered his assistance. Father
                    Hell caused some pieces of the magnetic steel to be constructed, which, says
                    Mesmer, he had invented fourteen years before, and had these artificial magnets
                    made of such shapes that they fitted conveniently to the different parts of the
                    body. The following is the account which Mesmer gives, in the document referred
                    to, of the results of his experiments with Father Hell’s magnets.</p>
                <p>“The patient having suffered a relapse in the month of July last, 1774, I
                    attached to her feet two concave magnets, and placed another of a heart-shape
                    upon her chest. She immediately experienced a burning and lancinating pain,
                    which mounted from the feet to the crest of the ossa ilii; there it became
                    united with a similar pain, that descended on one side from the place where the
                    magnet was attached to the chest, and mounted on the other side up to the head,
                    where it terminated on the crown. This pain, in dissipating, left in all the
                    joints a burning heat like fire. The magnetic vapour appeared sometimes to break
                    and disperse in different parts, sometimes to reunite with impetuosity. The
                    patient and the assistants were frightened at this phenomenon, and wished the
                    experiment to be put a stop to. But I insisted on its being continued, and
                    applied additional magnets to the lower parte. She then felt the pains which had
                    tormented the upper parts of the body descend impetuously. This transportation
                    of the pain continued the whole night, and was accompanied with abundant
                    perspiration on the side which had been paralysed since the previous attack. At
                    length all the symptoms gradually disappeared, and the patient having become
                    insensible to the action of the magnet, was cured of that attack. She has since
                    had some relapses, which have been easily and promptly cured. I attribute these
                    relapses to her extreme debility, and to the disease being of so long standing.”
                    In concluding his account of this case, Mesmer states, that he advised his
                    patient constantly to wear some magnets, and that subsequently to her doing
                    this, she had recovered and was in good health.</p>
                <p>It is of some importance, as we shall afterwards find, to attend to the fact,
                    that at the time of his letter to Unzer, Mesmer seems to have had no doubt that
                    the beneficial effects which he had been able to produce in Mademoiselle
                    Oesterlinc, and in other patients, depended upon the employment of the magnets.
                    “I had occasion,” says he, “in the treatment of this disease, to make several
                    very curious experiments. I discovered the rules which determine in what cases,
                    on what parts, in what quantity, for how long a time, and with what precautions,
                    the magnet <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be applied. I communicated these rules to
                    Father Hell, and to some physicians. Of the great number of very astonishing
                    observations which I made,” he continues, “I shall here relate some, which have
                    been established in presence of Father Hell, and of other respectable persons. I
                    have observed, that the magnetic matter is almost the same thing as the electric
                    fluid, and that it is propagated, like it, through the medium of other bodies.
                    Steel is not the only substance susceptible of it; I have rendered magnetic,
                    paper, bread, wool, silk, leather, stones, glass, water, different •metals,
                    wood, men, dogs, in a word, every thing that I touched, to such a degree, that
                    these substances produced on the patient the same effects as the magnet.” This,
                    it <pb break="no" facs="nls:194199913" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9913-0007"/>may be
                    remarked, is the only proof which Mesmer adduces of these substances having had
                    magnetism communicated to them.</p>
                <p>The account of-Mademoiselle Oesterlinc s case, given by Mesmer in a subsequent
                    publication, viz. his Memoir on the Discovery of Animal Magnetism, published at
                    Paris in 1779, differs from that contained in his letter to Unzer in several
                    respects. It differs to a considerable degree in the detail of her symptoms, and
                    in the statement of the effects produced upon her by the application of the
                    magnets; but it differs in a still greater degree in the view that it gives of
                    the effects which this case produced upon the progress of his own opinions. In
                    the memoir, instead of boasting how much he had added to the knowledge of
                    magnetism,· he states, that his observation of the effects produced in this
                    3ase, combined with his ideas of the general system of the universe, threw a new
                    light on his views. “In confirming,” says he, “my previous ideas on the
                    influence of the general agent, it taught me that another principle caused the
                    magnet to act, it being of itself incapable of this action upon the nerves; and
                    showed me that I had only some steps to make to arrive at the imitative theory
                    which formed the object of my researches.” <hi rend="italic">{Méìnoire,</hi> p.
                    17, 18.) It may be proper to notice, that the <hi rend="italic">other
                    principle</hi> alluded to by Mesmer, is one of which he does not himself appear
                    ever to have given any distinct explanation, constituting apparently the secret
                    which he repeatedly professes to retain in his own hand. By some of his
                    followers this principle has been supposed to consist in the influence of
                    volition.</p>
                <p>Again, in speaking of the communication which he received from the academy of
                    Berlin, in answer to the copy of his letter to Unzer which he had transmitted to
                    that body, Mesmer says that the academy confounded the properties of animal
                    magnetism which he announced, with those of the magnet, of which he spoke only
                    as a conductor, “It has not,” he adds, “been this academy alone which has fallen
                    into the error of confounding animal with mineral magnetism, though I have
                    constantly persisted, in my writings, in maintaining, that the use of the
                    magnet, though serviceable, was always imperfect without the assistance of the
                    theory of animal magnetism. The philosophers and physicians with whom I have
                    been in correspondence, or who have endeavoured to discover my secret (à <hi
                    rend="italic">me</hi><hi rend="italic">pénétrer),</hi> in order to usurp this
                    discovery, have pretended and affected to say, some that the magnet was the only
                    agent which I employed, others that I joined electricity to it, and <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> because they knew I had made use of these two means.
                    Most of them have been undeceived by their own experience; but instead of
                    acknowledging the truth which I announced, they have concluded from their not
                    themselves obtaining success from the use of these two agents, that the cures
                    which I professed to have obtained were supposititious, and that my theory was
                    illusory. The desire of setting aside for ever such errors, and of completely
                    establishing the truth, has made me resolve, since 1776, no longer to make any
                    use of electricity, or of the magnet.” <hi rend="italic">{Mémoire,</hi> p.

                <p>In comparing these statements, it seems impossible to doubt, that, subsequently
                    to the date of his letter to Unzer, Mesmer’s views with regard to the use of the
                    magnet underwent a great change; for in that letter there is no hint of the
                    magnet being merely a conductor, and of secondary importance only in the cures
                    which he had effected. It appears from the memoir, that the friendly relations
                    which seem to have existed between him and Father Hell at the date of the letter
                    were soon broken off. He represents Father Hell as claiming for his own magnets
                    the power of curing diseases of the nerves, and as alleging that Mesmer’s cures,
                    to which he referred in confirmation of the truth of this power, had been
                    undertaken at his suggestion. It appears to have been, in part at least, for the
                    purpose of overturning this pretension on the part of Father Hell, that Mesmer
                    broached the doctrine of animal magnetism being totally distinct from and
                    independent of the magnet. <hi rend="italic">{Mémoire,</hi> p. 19.) Both parties
                    seem to have appealed to the public in support of their respective pretensions;
                    but Mesmer complains that the scientific reputation of his opponent procured for
                    Father Hell, on this occasion, undeserved credit from the public.</p>
                <p>Another circumstance, which could not fail to make it desirable for Mesmer to
                    establish a distinction between common magnetism and the agent by which he
                    professed to effect his cures, was the strong opinion expressed by the Berlin
                    Academy of Sciences, as to the erroneous nature of the discoveries which he
                    pretended to have made in magnetism; for a careful perusal of the judgment
                    pronounced by that body completely satisfies us of the truth of Μ. Bertrand’s
                    observation <hi rend="italic">{Du Magnétisme-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Animal</hi><hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">France,</hi> p. 25), that
                    the members to whom the consideration of Mesmer’s letter was referred could not
                    possibly have deceived themselves so grossly as Mesmer endeavours to insinuate,
                    respecting the nature of the discovery to which he laid claim in that
                    document.</p>
                <p>It deserves also to be remarked, that the period at which Mesmer first became
                    aware of the independence of animal magnetism upon the magnet, is not the only
                    circumstance in the early history of his discoveries respecting which there
                    exists a discrepancy of statement. Two different accounts, at least, have been
                    given to the public, of the manner in which he first became aware that he
                    himself possessed a magnetic quality. One of these is contained in a discourse
                    of Μ. Mesmer’s, published in the <hi rend="italic">Recueil des Effets
                    Salutaires</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Aimant dans les
                    Maladies.</hi> Geneva, 1782. “One day,” says he, “being near a person who was
                    being bled, I perceived that, as I approached or receded, the course of the
                    blood varied in a remarkable manner; and having repeated this experiment in
                    other circumstances, with the same phenomena, I concluded that I possessed a
                    magnetic quality, which was not perhaps so striking in others, but which they
                    might possess in a greater or less degree.” The other account of his discovery
                    of his possessing a magnetic quality in his own person, is related by a pupil
                    and admirer of his, Μ. Picher-Grandchamp of Lyons. “It has been said,” observes
                    this gentleman, “that Newton derived the first idea of his system of
                    gravitation, since so learnedly developed, from perceiving an apple fall from a
                    tree. Dr Mesmer had the first idea of his system from observing, that every time
                    when, at table or elsewhere, a servant or person of his acquaintance placed
                    themselves behind him, by a particular sensation, and without perceiving them by
                    sight, he was able to announce that it was such or such a person who procured
                    him this observation. Born very sensitive, and naturally a great observer, it is
                    from these first effects, and from these first causes, that he has drawn and
                    built his system, established his doctrine, and applied them to the cure of
                    diseases. He has several times repeated this anecdote to me.” Which of these is
                    the genuine statement, we profess ourselves unable to determine; nor does it
                    appear at what time the discovery of these extraordinary powers had actually
                    been made, who ther previously to, subsequently to, or during the progress of,
                    his magnetic experiments on Mademoiselle Oesterline. <hi rend="superscript">
                    v</hi> The dispute in which Mesmer had become involved with Father FIell was
                    soon followed by another with Dr Ingenhousz, who was established under the
                    imperial patronage as an inoculator for small pox at Vienna. Mesmer informs us,
                    that a few days before the publication of his letter to Unzcr, he learned that
                    Dr Ingenhousz had spoken of his operations as chimerical, and that he even came
                    to his house to persuade him to suppress their publication. “I told him,” says
                    Mesmer, “that he had not enough of information on the* subject to give me this
                    advice, and that <pb break="no" facs="nls:194199926"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9926-0008"/>I should be happy to convince him of this on the
                    first proper opportunity. This occurred two days after. Mademoiselle Oesterline
                    experienced a fright and a cold, which occasioned a sudden suppression of her
                    periodical return. She fell into her usual convulsions. I invited Dr Ingenhousz
                    to come to my house, and he came, accompanied by a young physician. The patient
                    was then in a faint, accompanied with convulsions. I informed him that this was
                    a favourable occasion for him to convince himself of the existence of the
                    principle which I had announced to him, and of the property which he himself
                    possessed of communicating it. I made him go near the patient, from whom I
                    retired, desiring him to touch her; he did so; she did not move. I called him
                    back, and taking him by the hand, communicated to him the animal magnetism; I
                    then made him go again near the patient, keeping myself always at a distance,
                    and desired him to touch her a second time, the result of which was, her being
                    thrown into convulsive motions. I made him repeat this touch several times,
                    which he did with the point of his finger, varying its direction each time; and,
                    to his great astonishment, he produced always a convulsive effect in the part
                    that he touched. At the termination of these operations he told me he was
                    convinced. I proposed to him a second trial. We retired from the patient, so as
                    not to be perceived by her even if she should recover her consciousness. I
                    presented to Dr Ingenhousz six porcelain cups, and begged him to point out the
                    one to which he wished me to communicate the magnetic virtue. I touched that
                    which he chose, and made him apply successively the six cups to the hand of the
                    patient; when he came to that which I had touched, her hand moved, and she
                    appeared to feel pain. Dr Ingenhousz having repeated the experiment with the six
                    cups, the same effects were produced. I then put back the cups into the place
                    from which they had been taken, and after a short time taking hold of one of his
                    hands, I desired him to touch with the other any of the cups which he pleased;
                    he did this, and the cups being brought into contact with the patient, the same
                    effects as before took place. The communicability of the principle having been
                    established to the satisfaction of Ingenhousz, I proposed to him a third
                    experiment, in order to make him acquainted with its action at a distance, and
                    its penetrating virtue. I directed my finger towards the patient at the distance
                    of eight paces; a moment after, her body became convulsed, so as to raise it
                    upon her bed with the appearances of pain. I continued in the same position to
                    direct my finger towards the patient, placing at the same time Ingenhousz
                    between her and me. She experienced the same sensations. These trials being
                    repeated at the pleasure of Ingenhousz, I asked him if he was satisfied with
                    them, and convinced of the wonderful properties I had announced to him,
                    offering, if he was not, to repeat our trials. His answer was, that he had
                    nothing more to desire, and that he was convinced; but he exhorted me, by the
                    regard which he had for me, not to communicate any thing relative to this matter
                    to the public, in order to avoid exposing myself to its incredulity. We
                    separated; 1 went back to my patient to continue the treatment. It had the most
                    happy result. I succeeded the same day in re-establishing the ordinary course of
                    nature, and by this put a stop to all the symptoms which the suppression had
                    occasioned. Two days afterwards, I learned with astonishment that Μ. Ingenhousz
                    used in public, language very different from what he had held at my house; that
                    he denied the success of the different experiments which he had witnessed,
                    affected to confound animal magnetism with the magnet, and endeavoured to
                    tarnish my reputation, by spreading a report, that, with the aid of some
                    magnetised pieces, with which he had provided himself, he had succeeded in
                    unmasking me, and in establishing that it was only a ridiculous and preconcerted
                    trick.” It is deserving of notice, that in these experiments performed upon
                    Mademoiselle (Esterline in Dr Ingenhousz’s presence, Mesmer makes no mention of
                    his having used Father Hell’s magnets.</p>
                <p>Mesmer alludes <hi rend="italic">(Alémoire,</hi> p. 29, note) to a letter upon
                    animal magnetism and the electrophorus, addressed by Klinkosch, professor of
                    medicine at Prague, to Μ. le Comte de Kinszky, and inserted in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Actes des</hi><hi rend="italic">Savans de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Boheme,</hi> for the year 1776 (tom. ii.), as containing Ingenhousz’s
                    representation of these transactions. This letter we have not had an opportunity
                    of seeing. It would not, however, be difficult to suggest various considerations
                    likely to occur to Ingenhousz, in reflecting upon the scene in which he had
                    performed a part at Μ. Mesmer’s house, and to excite in him the suspicion of a
                    deception having been attempted to be practised upon him. To believe that the
                    phenomena he had witnessed depended upon the causes to which Mesmer attributed
                    them, it would have been necessary for Ingenhousz to admit that Mesmer not only
                    possessed this remarkable virtue himself, and was capable of exercising it at a
                    considerable distance, but also that he was able to transfer a limited portion
                    of it to another individual, and even to a piece of earthen ware, either by
                    immediate contact, or through the medium of another person’s body. Had
                    Ingenhousz been convinced of the validity of Mesmer’s discovery of a new and
                    unknown agent, and of his power of employing this agent in producing such
                    extraordinary phenomena as those which he had been called to witness in
                    Mademoiselle Oesterline, is it possible to conceive that he would not have felt
                    an irresistible inclination to return to Mesmer’s house, to see the same effects
                    reproduced in Mademoiselle Oesterline, or the same influence exerted on some
                    others of the patients who were under Mesmer’s care? Is it possible to conceive
                    that he would not have wished himself to be possessed of such a. power, or that
                    the knowledge of it should, for the benefit of all ranks, be communicated to
                    others? Such a perversity of disposition as that attributed to Ingenhousz never
                    existed, we believe, in any rational or sane mind, and is totally inconsistent
                    with his philosophical curiosity and habits, and with the respectable character
                    which he held in society.</p>
                <p>In finding himself thus in open hostility with two such formidable antagonists as
                    Father Hell and Dr Ingenhousz, Mesmer became desirous to obtain the countenance
                    of Baron Stoerck, president of the Faculty of Medicine at Vienna, and first
                    physician to her majesty the empress queen, and who, in that capacity, was in
                    some sort minister for medical affairs in Austria. Baron Stoerck was a
                    countryman of his own, and Mesmer says he was particularly acquainted with him.
                    Mesmer represents Baron Stoerck as having manifested great fickleness in their
                    intercourse on the subject of animal magnetism. “Being attached to him, I
                    offered to communicate to him all my means of operation, without any reserve,
                    urging him to satisfy himself of the truth with his own eyes. This physician,
                    too timid for the place which he occupies, has never been able to take a decided
                    part. He has always vacillated according to the circumstances of the moment.
                    Sometimes he was afraid of compromising himself, or of my compromising the
                    faculty; sometimes he agreed to my demonstrating the utility of my principles in
                    an hospital; then he had not the courage to make a report be presented to him of
                    the effects which I there produced. He constantly refused me a commission of the
                    faculty, which I asked for, and appeared himself at the head of a deputation,
                    for which I did not ask. On that occasion he loudly joined his suffrages to
                    those of the public, assuring me, in presence of witnesses, how much he
                    regretted having so long delayed to favour with his avowal the importance of mv
                    observations; and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194199939"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9939-0009"/>yet he never had courage to avow or defend this at
                    times when it might have been serviceable. Lastly, I have letters from him, in
                    which he acknowledges his opinion: I have an order from him, in which he taxes
                    me with trickery.” <hi rend="italic">(Précis Historique,</hi> p. 14, 15.)</p>
                <p>Beginning to despair <hi rend="italic">(Mémoire,</hi> p. 32) of success in his
                    magnetical practice at Vienna, Mesmer made a journey, in 1775, through Suabia,
                    Bavaria, and Switzerland, and performed a number of cures, publicly as well as
                    privately, in these countries. His success, indeed, was such as to encourage him
                    to repeat his journey in 1776. In visiting Ratisbon, he had occasion to observe
                    the performance of cures there, without the aid of medicines or of magnets,
                    which were not less wonderful than his own. These cures were performed by
                    Gassner, an ecclesiastic, who had long enjoyed a great reputation for his
                    success in curing diseases, particularly those occasioned by demoniacal
                    possession. This person, after having been settled as a parish priest, near to
                    Coire in Switzerland, his native country, became afflicted with a disorder which
                    resisted all the ordinary powers of medicine, and produced a state resembling
                    melancholic mania. In reflecting upon his disorder, he was led to believe that a
                    great portion of the diseases to which human nature is liable is produced by the
                    agency of the devil; and conceiving that his own ailments might have that
                    origin, he was led, by the study of books upon exorcism, and by his reflection
                    on the powers which had been communicated to him by the church in his ordination
                    as a priest, to believe in the possibility of his being able to eject the devil,
                    and to cure himself, simply by adjurations and commands given in the name of
                    Jesus Christ. The employment of this curative process was followed with complete
                    success; and Gassner was encouraged to extend to those in his neighbourhood
                    afflicted with the same species of disorder, the benefit of the means which he
                    had found so successful in his own case. The reputation of his cures and the
                    number of his patients increased rapidly; so that whilst he remained in the
                    district of Coire, many hundreds of patients flocked to him annually from all
                    the surrounding countries. But neither Gassner’s mode of conducting himself as a
                    parish priest, nor his exorcismal cures, being quite to the satisfaction of the
                    bishop of the diocese, he was dismissed from his charge. Sprengel informs us <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hist, de</hi><hi rend="italic">la Médecine,</hi> vi. 89), that
                    “Gassner went, in the month of June 1774, to Moersburg, the residence of the
                    Prince Bishop of Kostnitz, but he practised his miraculous cures there only for
                    a few weeks; for the cunning which he employed was soon discovered, and the wise
                    bishop expelled him from his diocese in the month of August, stating, as the
                    chief ground of complaint against him, that in his exorcisms he did not conform
                    to the ritual of the Roman church. At the same time he wrote to the Bishop of
                    Coire, to request him to recall his priest. His desire was accomplished; but
                    Gassner remained only two months in his diocese, for the Bishop of Ratisbon
                    expressed a wish to see him at Ellwangen. He consequently went there in the
                    month of November 1774, and this town became for some time the theatre of his
                    miraculous performances. The Bishop of Ratisbon gave him the titles of chaplain
                    of the court, and ecclesiastical councillor; and several thousand patients, and
                    persons supposed to be possessed with the devil, were seen to flock to him, all
                    of whom he threw into the most frightful convulsions, by the abuse which he made
                    of the name of God and of Jesus Christ.” From Ellwangen he was brought to
                    Ratisbon, where Mesmer saw him. In his “Mémoire,” Mesmer alludes to Gassner in
                    the followir⅛g terms: “It was from the year 1774 to 1775 that an ecclesiastic, a
                    man of good faith, but of an excessive zeal, performed in the diocese of
                    Ratisbon, upon different patients of a nervous constitution, effects which
                    appeared supernatural in the eyes of the least prejudiced and most enlightened
                    men of that country. His reputation extended to Vienna, where the public was
                    divided into two parties; one treated these effects as impostures and trickery,
                    whilst the other regarded them as miracles wrought by divine power. Both,
                    however, were in error; and my experience had by that time taught me that this
                    man was merely in this matter the instrument of nature. It was only because his
                    profession, seconded by chance, determined near him certain natural
                    combinations, that he renewed the periodic symptoms of diseases, without knowing
                    the cause of this. The end of these paroxysms was regarded as real cures; time
                    alone could disabuse the public.” <hi rend="italic">(Mémoire,</hi> p. 32-3.) And
                    in a later work Mesmer remarks, “I have said in one of my writings, in reference
                    to Μ. le Curé Gassner, that he produced real effects, but that he was ignorant
                    of the cause of them. I repeat the same here.” <hi rend="italic">(Precis</hi><hi

                <p>Several circumstances seem to have contributed at this period, in Austria, to
                    create doubts in the minds of the medical practitioners of that country, and of
                    the government, with regard to the existence and frequent occurrence of diseases
                    depending on witchcraft, or on demoniacal possession; and also with regard to
                    the pretensions of those who affected to cure diseases by exorcismal or
                    supernatural powers. Amongst these may be mentioned, first, the great increase
                    of demoniacal diseases, which seemed to take place in consequence of the success
                    of Gassner’s practice; and, secondly, the results of the clinical observations
                    of Dr de Haen, who had been engaged for a long series of years in detecting and
                    exposing feigned diseases, and particularly those attributed to demoniacal
                    possession, in patients who were placed under his inspection at the desire of
                    the Empress Maria Theresa, and her son the Emperor Joseph II. De Haen was
                    satisfied, from the authority of Scripture, of the possible occurrence of
                    magical and miraculous events; but in no one of the patients sent to him by the
                    authority of the government, pretending or said to be affected with demoniacal
                    diseases, could he discover the slightest evidence of such a disease. In all of
                    them the symptoms were feigned, and that not unfrequently in deceitful collusion
                    with others. It seems to have been the results of his own personal observation,
                    his knowledge of Gassner’s miraculous cures, and perhaps the more recent
                    pretensions to similar powers upon the part of Mesmer, that called De Haen’s
                    attention, in a particular manner, to the investigation of feigned and
                    demoniacal diseases at this period, and which gave rise to two remarkable essays
                    which he composed; the first in defence of the existence of magic, as described
                    in Scripture, dedicated to Cardinal Eugenius, in October 1774; and the second
                    upon Miracles, dedicated to the same person, dated Vienna, February 1776.</p>
                <p>It is curious to observe how very generally the object and tendency of these
                    writings of De Haen have been misunderstood and misrepresented. In the essay on
                    Miracles, he seems to have had for his particular object the determination of
                    the criteria or conditions by which true miracles are and must be characterised,
                    and infallibly distinguished from those that are pretended and spurious. By
                    these conditions he examined, in a most minute and circumstantial manner, the
                    miraculous cures of Gassner, and demonstrated undeniably the total
                    groundlessness and absurdity of these and of all similar pretensions. The whole
                    of this essay is in every respect worthy of its learned and distinguished
                    author. The fifth and last chapter, in particular, contains an accredited
                    statement of Gassner’s exorcismal cures, derived from the most authentic
                    sources; from a great number of publications, some by Gassner himself, and from
                    a protocol of a regular examination of these cures, instituted by the authority
                    of the Archbishop of Ratisbon, which was sent to the empress of Austria, and by
                    her transmitted for De Haen’s <pb break="no" facs="nls:194199952"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9952-0010"/>inspection and judgment. In this chapter, De Haen
                    states, Is/, that Gassner’s miraculous cures were, and had been for a long time,
                    by their number, continuance, and surprising nature, the admiration of Austria,
                    and of surrounding countries: 2&lt;∕, that Gassncr, in consequence of his
                    discovery, that a great number of diseases were the work of the devil,
                    distinguished diseases into demoniacal, natural, and mixed: 3<hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi>, that Gassner admitted that his cures were confined to demoniacal
                    diseases, and to the diabolical part of mixed diseases; and affirmed that they
                    were accomplished solely by his using the sacred name of Jesus Christ, and by
                    the faith of his patients in that name: 4∕A, that by his use of, and faith in,
                    that name, he could make the devil reproduce diseases which were absent or
                    latent at the time, in one, two, or more paroxysms, according to his pleasure:
                    <hi rend="italic">5th,</hi> that he had made the devil excite in his patients
                    the states of laughing, howling, anger, rage, and fury, and even the appearance
                    of death, and could repeat in the same day the same phenomena, without any
                    injury to the health of even the most delicate females: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gth,</hi> that he frequently questioned the devil in the same person for
                    several days, two or three hours at a time, and convicted him of lies, though he
                    sometimes had an opportunity of praising him for speaking truth: <hi
                    rend="italic">7th,</hi> that Gassner ascertained, from tEe same competent
                    authority, that instead of a legion, there might be some thousands or millions
                    of demons in the same person: <hi rend="italic">8th,</hi> that he seldom cured
                    any one possessed by demons at once, but usually after repeated exorcisms: 9zΛ,
                    that he had contracted a great familiarity with the devil, and frequently
                    conversed with him audibly, and usually in the Latin language, about matters
                    quite foreign to his patients or their diseases: 10i∕z, that after making the
                    devil produce convulsions, excite rage, or utter blasphemies, he could
                    immediately bring back his patients to a sound state of mind and body: 1 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">1/ä,</hi> that he could transfer to others the power which he
                    had received from his ordination as a priest, of casting out devils, and that
                    even to laics, and his ordinary patients: <hi rend="smallcaps">12/ā,</hi> that,
                    amongst other wonders, he could produce any kind of pulse in his patients,
                    great, small, or intermittent, which the medical men attending his more wealthy
                    patients might desire him to produce: 1 <hi rend="italic">3th,</hi> that in
                    performing his cures, he always held a crucifix in his right hand, wore a red
                    cloak bound round his loins with a black girdle, and had a chain hung from his
                    neck, to which was attached a cross, containing a small portion of the true
                    cross: 14√∕i, that he sent his patients, after he had cured them, to the
                    apothecary’s shop at Ellwangen, in order to purchase there some article which he
                    had blessed, and to the use of which they might confidently resort for a cure in
                    the event of a return of their disorder: 5<hi rend="italic">th,</hi> that his
                    miracles were worked, first, to show the power of faith in the name of Jesus
                    Christ; secondly, the services which, from the confessions of the devil, the
                    society of Jesuits had rendered to the church for two centuries; and, thirdly,
                    the disadvantages that were likely to accrue from the suppression of that order,
                    which had been decreed by the see of Rome a short time before the regular
                    examination and protocol of Gassner’s cures had been commenced. “A very
                    remarkable circumstance,” says Sprengel, “is, that the devil, in speaking by the
                    mouth of possessed persons, always painted the Jesuits as his irreconcileable
                    enemies. Accordingly it was they who most cried up to the skies the miracles of
                    Gassner, pretending that not to believe in them was a sufficient proof of want
                    of religion.”</p>
                <p>The various purposes, personal and ecclesiastical, to which Gassner rendered his
                    pretensions subservient, leave it doubtful whether he ought to be regarded more
                    as the dupe of his own enthusiasm, or as a knave. But his proceedings were put a
                    stop to by an order from his superior,, for his being shut up in a fraternity of
                    priests at Ponton, in the neighbourhood of Ratisbon, where no one was allowed to
                    see him or to be cured by him, without an express permission to that effect
                    obtained from the bishop. Sprengel states, that the Archbishop of Prague issued
                    an order to the bishops and curates under his jurisdiction, exposing to them the
                    malpractices of Gassner, and warning them against falling into similar errors.
                    Subsequently to this, his miraculous power completely ceased; “and of the deluge
                    of publications,” adds Sprengel, “almost all detestable, to which this devilry
                    had given rise, there remains now nothing but the titles preserved in the
                    archives of literature.”</p>
                <p>It would appear that Μ. le Roux, who subsequently accompanied Mesmer to Paris,
                    was also his companion in his journey to Bavaria, and transmitted some account
                    of his proceedings at Munich and Augsburg, in a letter to the editor of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gazette d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Agriculture,</hi> in 1777. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anti-Magnétisme,</hi> p. 126.) This letter, however, we have not
                    seen. Mesmer mentions, that he performed, at Munich and Ratisbon, a number of
                    experiments in the presence of Mr Elliot, envoy from England to the diet of
                    Ratisbon, and communicated to him, at his request, a summary of his doctrines,
                    which was transmitted, in 1776, to the Royal Society of London. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mémoire,</hi> p. 54, note.)</p>
                <p>On returning to Vienna, -after his second journey to Bavaria, in 1776, Mesmer
                    tells us that he refused till the end of that year to undertake the magnetical
                    treatment of any patients. At length, however, he yielded to the solicitation of
                    his friends, and to the hope of being able, by some striking cure, to establish,
                    in a triumphant manner, the truth of his doctrines. Amongst other patients'whose
                    cure he undertook at that time, was one whose case gave rise to much unpleasant
                    discussion, and led him, according to his own statement, to resolve definitively
                    on quitting Vienna. This was Mademoiselle Paradis, a musical girl, eighteen
                    years of age, who had been blind from her infancy with a complete amaurosis,
                    accompanied with convulsions, which made her eyes start out from their sockets.
                    This girl, who was a pensioner of the empress, was boarded with Mesmer in the
                    beginning of the year 1777. Nothing can be more contradictory than the accounts
                    that are given by Mesmer and by his opponents, of the state of this patient’s
                    vision, and of the degree of improvement that took place in it whilst she was
                    under his treatment. A most violent altercation took place between Mesmer and
                    the girl’s father, the former insisting on retaining her in his house till her
                    cure should be completed, the latter demanding that she should be restored to
                    her family. It was upon this occasion that Baron Stoerck issued the order
                    alluded to in the passage formerly quoted from Mesmer. “I received, in fact,”
                    says Mesmer, “through Μ. Ost, physician to the court, an order in the writing of
                    Μ. Stoerck, in his quality of first physician, dated Schoenbrunn (the imperial
                    palace), 2d May 1777, which enjoined me to put an end to that trickery <hi
                    rend="italic">(supercherie'),</hi> and to restore Mademoiselle Paradis to her
                    family, if I thought it could be done without danger.” It was alleged by
                    Mesmer’s opponents that he received a communication also from the Archbishop of
                    Vienna, Cardinal Migazzi, intimating to him that he would do well to go
                    elsewhere to play his pantomimes. Mesmer speaks of the allegation of his having
                    been enjoined by the authorities to quit Vienna, as a useless calumny, alleging
                    in disproof of it that he was recommended to the Austrian ambassador in France,
                    by the minister of foreign, affairs at Vienna, and that his excellency never
                    disavowed him.</p>
                <p>Another account of the circumstances under which Mesmer left Vienna is given by
                    Sprengel (Sendschreiben über Thicrischen Magnetismum mit Zusatzen, Halle, 1788,
                    p. 104), on the authority of a work entitled Magnetist, published by C. L.
                    Hoffmann, at Frankfort, in 1787. That <pb break="no" facs="nls:194199965"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9965-0011"/>author states that a commission was named by the
                    Empress Maria Theresa, for the investigation of magnetism, and particularly of
                    the cure said to have been effected on the girl Paradis. Before an assemblage of
                    more than 300 persons, medical men and others, the girl was called on to
                    distinguish bright colours, and she made the distinction quite correctly. Some
                    of the commissioners, however, remarked, that Mesmer was giving his patient
                    certain signs, and he was requested to withdraw. After many protestations, he
                    reluctantly complied, and now the girl was unable to distinguish any one of the
                    colours that were laid before her. On the gentlemen of the commission declaring
                    to her that she could see nothing, she with tears protested that she had
                    supposed seeing to consist in the recognition of the signs that had been given
                    her. When the commissioners had made their report to the empress, it is added,
                    that Mesmer received an imperial order to leave Vienna within twenty-four hours.
                    We are unable to say how much of these statements is correct. But certain it is
                    that Mesmer actually left Vienna early in 1778, and proceeded to Paris, where he
                    arrived in the month of February of that year.</p>
                <p>In Paris, Mesmer might reasonably expect to find a theatre infinitely more
                    favourable for the exhibition of his new discoveries, peculiar modes of
                    practice, and wonderful cures, than by long and persevering trials he had found
                    Vienna to be. The lively imagination of the French people, their love of
                    novelty, the power of fashion, of which Paris was at that time the centre, and
                    the influence of court favour, if it could be obtained, were all of them
                    circumstances likely to prove powerful auxiliaries to the promotion of his
                    views. He has given an account of his proceedings, subsequently to his removal
                    to Paris, in his <hi rend="italic">Mémoire sur la Découverte du Magnétisme
                    Animal,</hi> published in 1779; and in bis <hi rend="italic">Précis Historique
                    des faits relatifs au Magnétisme Animal,</hi> published in 1781. In these works
                    he represents himself as having arrived in Paris without any determinate object
                    beyond that of spending a few months there; and as having been induced to engage
                    in expounding the principles of animal magnetism, and illustrating their
                    application to the treatment of diseases, rather in compliance with the
                    solicitations of others, than from any views of his own. Μ. le Roi, director,
                    and Μ. le Comte Maillebois, member of the Academy of Sciences, seem, from his
                    own account, to have been the persons in Paris from whom his doctrines first met
                    with a favourable reception. In the course of a few months, he had also become
                    acquainted with Messrs Mauduit, Andry, Desperneres, and the Abbé Tessier, all
                    members of the Royal Society of Medicine. In their presence he seems to have
                    performed various detached experiments with a view to establish the existence of
                    the magnetic principle; and he at length consented, for their satisfaction, to
                    undertake the performance of a series of cures by means of this agent. Besides
                    engaging that he should not enter on the treatment of any patients till their
                    state had been previously ascertained by physicians of the Faculty of Paris (in
                    order that a correct judgment might be formed of the success of his practice
                    from an inspection of the patients after their treatment should be concluded),
                    he agreed, he says, to make every patient that he was to treat be presented in
                    succession to the Society of Medicine, in order that it might satisfy itself of
                    the solidity and truth of the certificates; and he agreed also to place the
                    reports, certificates, and attestations of the faculty, in the hands of the
                    Society of Medicine. In proceeding, however, to carry these preliminary
                    arrangements into effect, discord arose. On the first patient being submitted to
                    Messrs Mauduit and Andry, they declared themselves not to be satisfied with the
                    evidence adduced respecting her malady, and wished to take measures for
                    satisfying themselves in regard to it. To these, Mesmer says, her relations
                    objected. He undertook the charge of her on his own responsibility, and sent, he
                    tells us, no more patients to be examined by these gentlemen. Mesmer represents
                    himself as having entered into communication with the above-named members of the
                    Society of Medicine as private individuals, and not in any official capacity.
                    However this may have been, the society looked upon the matter in a different
                    light; for on the 6th May, the secretary, Μ. Vicq d’Azyr, addressed a letter to
                    Mesmer, stating that he was desired by the society to return him, unopened, the
                    certificates which had been transmitted to it on his account. “The commissioners
                    whom it has named, agreeably to your request,” continues Μ. Vicq d’Azyr, “to
                    follow your experiments, cannot and ought not to give any opinion without having
                    previously ascertained the state of the patients by careful examination. As your
                    letter announces that this examination and the necessary visits do not enter
                    into your plan, and that, instead of these, it is in your opinion sufficient for
                    us to have the word of honour of your patients and certificates, the society
                    announces to you that it has withdrawn the commission with which it had charged
                    some of its members on your business. It is the duty of the society not to
                    pronounce any judgment on matters of which it is not placed in a position to
                    obtain a full and entire knowledge, particularly when it is called upon to
                    consider novel assertions. This circumspection, which it owes to itself, it
                    always has observed, and always will.” In recording this letter, Mesmer protests
                    that he had made no application to the society for a commission, but, on the
                    contrary, when the members of that body with whom he was in communication had
                    proposed such a step, that he had formally and repeatedly rejected it.</p>
                <p>Having collected a sufficient number of patients for his experiments, Mesmer, in
                    the course of the month of May, retired with them to the village of Créteuil,
                    two leagues distant from Paris, where they remained under treatment for a period
                    of from three to four months. On the 20th and 22d of August, he addressed
                    letters to Μ. Vicq d’Azyr for the Society of Medicine, and to Μ. le Roi for the
                    Academy of Sciences, inviting the two bodies to examine into the actual
                    condition of his patients, and to compare that condition with the certificates
                    of their state at the time of their coming under his treatment. The Society of
                    Medicine simply replied, that having no knowledge of the previous condition of
                    the patients whom he had had under treatment, they could pronounce no judgment
                    upon the matter; and, according to Mesmer’s statement, the reading of his letter
                    to the Academy of Sciences was interrupted at the instigation of Messrs
                    d’Aubenton and Vicq d’Azyr, who formally opposed its interfering in the
                    matter.</p>
                <p>Subsequently to this correspondence, Mesmer returned to Paris; and though he
                    describes his patients as having made wonderful improvement under his charge, he
                    represents himself as being, if possible, still further removed than he had been
                    before the commencement of his experiments, from the prospect of obtaining a
                    fair judgment of his pretensions. About this time, however, in the month of
                    September 1778, he had the good fortune to form an acquaintance with Μ. d’Eslon,
                    doctor regent of the faculty of medicine, and physician to the Count d’Artois,
                    the brother of the king. This acquaintance speedily ripened into an intimate
                    friendship, which exercised, whilst it lasted, and even after it had ceased,'a
                    most important influence over the fame and success of Mesmer in Paris; at first
                    by assisting him to procure the patronage of the great and powerful, and
                    afterwards by its leading to those measures which enabled him to realize the
                    fortune with which he retired from that capital.</p>
                <p>In witnessing the surprising effects of the magnetic treatment, Μ. d’Eslon became
                    a sincere convert to Mesmer’s opinions, and extremely desirous to assist in
                    communicating<pb break="no" facs="nls:194199978" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9978-0012"/>
                    a knowledge of these, and of the benefits of animal magnetism, to the medical
                    profession and to the public. With this view he endeavoured to interest the
                    faculty of medicine in Mesmer’s discoveries; but failing in this, he persuaded
                    twelve members of that body to come to his house and hear Mesmer read an account
                    of his doctrines. Three only of that number, however, could be induced to
                    observe and to follow out the new practice at the magnetic institution which
                    Mesmer had opened, viz. MM. Bertrand. Malloet, and Sollier. This they did for a
                    period of seven months; but at the end of this time, the results of their
                    observation did not incline them to adopt Mesmer’s opinions, nor to believe in
                    the efficacy of his magnetic treatment.</p>
                <p>In the course of the year 1779, Mesmer published his memoir relative to his
                    discovery of animal magnetism, in which, besides a narrative of the difficulties
                    he had experienced in Germany, he stated his peculiar doctrines in the form of
                    twenty-seven distinct propositions. This memoir gave rise to some controversy at
                    the time of its first appearance, and was made the subject of a strict critical
                    examination four years afterwards by Μ. Thouret.</p>
                <p>In the month of July 1780, Μ. d’Eslon published his observations on animal
                    magnetism, in which he gave an account of a number of surprising cures that he
                    had seen effected by the magnetic processes which Mesmer employed, and defended
                    himself against various attacks that bad been made upon him in consequence of
                    his connection with Mesmer. This publication, and the avowal of his adoption of
                    Mesmer’s opinions, incurred in a high degree the displeasure of his colleagues
                    in the medical faculty. A meeting of that body was held on the 18th of September
                    of the same year, when one of its members, Μ. Vauzêmes, accused Μ. d’Eslon of
                    being associated with Mesmer in his magnetical practices, and of having become
                    the defender of his doctrines. In reply, D’Eslon temperately but firndy
                    expressed his conviction of the importance of Mesmer’s discoveries, recommended
                    to the faculty an examination of them, and proposed, in the name of Mesmer, that
                    the faculty, in making this examination, should, Is/, solicit the intervention
                    of the government; 2J, that twenty-four patients should be selected, twelve of
                    whom should be treated by Mesmer, and the other twelve by members of the medical
                    faculty; and, 3d, <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> in order to avoid all suspicion
                    of party spirit, that the persons appointed by the government as judges of the
                    comparative effects of the magnetical and usual modes of treatment, should not
                    belong to the medical profession. After having read these proposals on the part
                    of Mesmer, and placed a copy of them on the table, D’Eslon retired to allow the
                    faculty time to deliberate upon them. When he was called back, it was announced
                    to him that the faculty had resolved, Is/, to enjoin him to be more circumspect
                    for the future; 2&lt;7, to suspend him for a year from a deliberative voice in
                    its meetings; 3&lt;7, that unless, at the end of a year, he should have
                    disavowed his opinions on animal magnetism, his name should be erased from the
                    list of its members; and, 4√7z, to reject Mesmer’s proposals. These measures on
                    the part of the faculty of medicine were considered, by a great portion of the
                    public, as the effects merely of professional jealousy, and served to promote
                    rather than to injure the popularity of Mesmer’s magnetic treatment.</p>
                <p>When this rupture took place with the Faculty of Medicine, Mesmer felt, he tells
                    us, the necessity of addressing himself at length directly to the government.
                    Appearances seemed to promise success; but when he wished to place himself in
                    personal communication with those in authority, he found, he says, the avenues
                    blocked up in such a way as to obstruct his progress. Suddenly he learned that
                    Μ. de Lassonne, first physician to their majesties, from whom, upon his first
                    arrival in Paris, he had met with an unfavourable reception, had expressed
                    himself very decidedly as being convinced of the existence and utility of his
                    dis« covery; and Μ. d’Eslon received encouragement to address himself to that
                    gentleman, as being instructed to draw up a plan for effecting an arrangement
                    between Mesmer and the government. Accordingly, Μ. d’Eslon laid before Μ. de
                    Lassonne a memorial, stating the conditions on which Mesmer was Willing to
                    treat. He proposed that commissioners should be named by the government, not to
                    witness any new cures performed, but to collect and authenticate those which had
                    been performed upon previous occasions. At the same time, Mesmer says, he
                    instructed Μ. d’Eslon to say verbally, that, though unwilling to come under any
                    formal engagement to perform experiments before the royal commissioners, they
                    would find him ready to give all reasonable satisfaction in this respect. Some
                    difficulties as to the powers of the commissioners to be appointed having been
                    arranged, eight persons were agreed upon as suitable for the duty, and
                    everything seemed in the way of being adjusted, when Μ. de Lassonne announced to
                    Μ. d’Eslon that the persons named declined the commission. On this point Mesmer
                    states that he ascertained that the persons proposed as commissioners never had
                    been spoken to on the subject.</p>
                <p>“I now,” says Mesmer, “no longer hesitated to announce to my patients, that as I
                    was to quit France immediately, my practice would be terminated on the 15th of
                    April following (1781). This intelligence naturally displeased persons who had
                    lost all confidence in ordinary medicine, and no longer placed any except in
                    mine. Their alarms penetrated to the foot of the throne. Her majesty the queen
                    was pleased to charge a person in her confidence to say to me that she
                    considered the abandonment of my patients as contrary to humanity, and that she
                    thought I ought not to leave France in this way. I replied in substance that my
                    long sojourn in France could leave her majesty no doubt of the desire I had to
                    prefer her dominions to all others excepting my native country; but that
                    despairing, for many reasons, of seeing in France a conclusion of the important
                    affair which had brought me there, I had resolved to take advantage of the new
                    season to commence operations, which I had, to my great regret, long put off;
                    and that, besides, I beseeched her majesty to consider that there was sufficient
                    time before the 15th of April for the government to come to a determination, if
                    the necessity of adopting one was at length acknowledged.” A few days after
                    this, Μ. d’Eslon and he were requested to wait upon a person of rank, having
                    authority to treat with them; and after a long conference, Mesmer agreed (14th
                    March) to subscribe a series of propositions, the principal of which were, that
                    the government should name five commissioners, two of whom only should belong to
                    the medical profession, to make the final inquiries that might be judged
                    necessary in order to leave no doubt as to the existence and the utility of the
                    discovery of animal magnetism; that if the report of these commissioners should
                    be favourable to the discovery, the government should, ]s∕, by a ministerial
                    letter, declare that Μ. Mesmer had made a useful discovery. 2<hi rend="italic"
                    >dly,</hi> That to recompense Μ. Mesmer, and to engage him to establish and
                    propagate his doctrine in France, the king should give him, in free gift, an
                    establishment, suitable for the treatment of patients in the most advantageous
                    manner, and for communicating his knowledge to medical men. On the margin of
                    this proposition was written the name of a particular <hi rend="italic"
                    >chateau</hi> and estate, which Mesmer preferred to every other, <hi
                    rend="italic">⅜dly</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> That in order to fix
                    Μ. Mesmer in France, and to reward his services, a yearly pension of 20,000
                    livres should be granted to him. <hi rend="italic">⅛thly</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> That his majesty would require of Μ. Mesmer that he should
                    remain in France till he had completely established his doctrine and practice,
                    and that he should not quit it without <pb break="no" facs="nls:194199991"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9991-0013"/>the permission of the king. These arrangements
                    were to be binding on Mesmer only upon condition of their being carried into
                    effect by the 15th of April.</p>
                <p>A few days after they were signed (28th March), he was sent for by a minister of
                    state, and told that the king, being informed of his repugnance to be examined
                    by commissioners, would dispense with this formality, and at once grant him a
                    pension of 20,000 livres, and pay, besides, an annual rent of 10,000 livres for
                    the house which he should consider most suitable for forming pupils, of whom
                    three were to be named by the government, he being left to take such an
                    additional number for his own behoof as he might judge advisable. These
                    proposals Mesmer declined to accept. For this refusal he has assigned a number
                    of reasons, in some of which he endeavours to make it appear that he was
                    actuated by regard to his own dignity. It is impossible, however, we should
                    think, for his most zealous partisans to doubt that the true reason of his
                    refusal was his being dissatisfied with the pecuniary arrangements. Indeed, in
                    professing regret at having signed the propositions of the 14th of March, he
                    declares his willingness still to act up to them, if the free gift of a
                    territorial possession suitable for the establishment he projected, which was
                    obviously meant to be of a very costly description, was added to the pension of
                    20,000 livres. “If I have rigorously abstained,” says he, “during my residence
                    in France, from bringing into question my personal remuneration, I have never a
                    single instant doubted that it should be worthy of the French nation, and of the
                    greatness of the monarch who governs it.” “It is a territorial possession, and
                    not money that I demand.” “I know very well that the terms which I demand form a
                    considerable sum; but I also know very well that my discovery is above all
                    price.”</p>
                <p>On his return from his interview with the minister, Mesmer addressed a letter to
                    the queen, full of expressions of respect and devotion, in which, in declaring
                    that he renounces all hope of arrangement with the French government, he
                    postpones his departure from France to the 18th of September, the anniversary of
                    the meeting of the Faculty of Medicine, at which his propositions had been
                    rejected. With this letter to the queen, Mesmer concludes his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Précis Historique.</hi> In the account we have given of his proceedings up to
                    this period, we have followed very closely his own statements. Trusting to
                    these, it would be necessary to believe, that, both in Vienna and in Paris, all
                    with whom he came into contact, however eminent their situation, or respectable
                    the character which they held in society, had entered into a universal
                    combination to thwart and deceive him; and that he alone pursued an open,
                    honest, and consistent course. This, however, would be a greater stretch of
                    confidence than any individual can hope to receive from an impartial public; and
                    it would, we believe, be easy to show, from an examination of Mesmer’s
                    proceedings, particularly as regards his love of concealment, and his desire for
                    pecuniary reward, that it would be a much higher compliment to his candour and
                    integrity than is merited by him.</p>
                <p>Before quitting France definitively, Mesmer went to Spa, partly, it was said, on
                    account of his own health, and partly that he might complete the cures of some
                    of his patients. Whilst there, he learnt that Μ. d’Eslon, on being summoned
                    before the Medical Faculty to make his recantation, or have his name erased from
                    the list of its members, so far from renouncing animal magnetism, had professed
                    himself a practitioner of that art. The faculty, upon this declaration, deprived
                    Μ. d’Eslon of his title of doctor regent, and afterwards adopted most
                    injudicious andeven discreditable proceedings against a considerable number of
                    its own body, who, on witnessing the effects of Μ. d’Eslon’s magnctical
                    treatment, had become convinced of the efficacy of that mode of practice. On
                    hearing of D’Eslon’s resolution, and the success of his practice in an
                    institution which he had established for that purpose, Mesmer became greatly
                    alarmed and depressed in spiyts, and was often heard to exclaim that he was a
                    ruined man; that he had been cruelly used by those who had betrayed his
                    confidence, and who wished to deprive him of the reward that was due to him for
                    his discoveries. Several of his patients, who believed that they owed to him
                    relief from disease and suffering, sympathized with him in his distress, and
                    became anxious that some means should be devised and adopted to secure the
                    continuance of the benefits of magnetism, and to reward its discoverer. After
                    various deliberations on this subject, it was at last suggested (in 1783,
                    according to Foissac) by Μ. Bergasse, a member of the Faculty of Advocates, who
                    believed himself much indebted to Mesmer for the improvement of his own health,
                    that a subscription should be entered into by a hundred persons, of one hundred
                    louis d’ors each, for the purpose of raising a sum of money to render Mesmer
                    independent in his circumstances, and to enable him to communicate to the
                    public, without injury to himself, the benefits of animal magnetism. This
                    subscription was filled up chiefly by men of rank and fashion, and by a few
                    members of the medical profession from Lyons and from other parts of France.
                    Mesmer, who had in the mean time returned to Paris, and opened a magnetic
                    institution, seems to have commenced his lectures and course of clinical
                    instruction about the beginning of April 1784, and to have continued it for a
                    period of nearly two months, to the general satisfaction of the public and the
                    high gratification of his pupils. To this there appears to have been only one
                    exception in Μ. Berthollet, afterwards so distinguished as a chemical
                    philosopher, and who, at that time, was physician to the Duke of Orleans, at
                    whose desire he became a subscriber to, and attendant upon Mesmer’s
                    instructions. In about a month after the commencement of the course, Μ.
                    Berthollet gave up attendance, and laid upon Mesmer’s table a declaration to the
                    following effect:—</p>
                <p>“After having attended more than the half of Μ. Mesmer’s course, of the month of
                    April 1784; after having been admitted into the wards of cures and crises, where
                    I have been occupied in making observations and experiments; I declare that I
                    have not recognised the existence of the agent named animal magnetism by Μ.
                    Mesmer; that I have considered the doctrine which has been taught us, during the
                    course, as being contrary to the best established truths relative to the system
                    of the world, and to the animal economy in particular; and that I have perceived
                    nothing in the convulsions, spasms, and crises, which are said to be produced by
                    the magnetic processes (when the symptoms actually occurred), which ought not to
                    be altogether attributed to the imagination, to the mechanical effect of the
                    frictions upon very nervous parts, and to that law, long ago recognised,
                    according to which an animal has a tendency to imitate, and to place itself,
                    even involuntarily, in the same position in which it sees another animal, a law
                    on which convulsive diseases so frequently depend. Lastly, I declare that I
                    regard the doctrine of animal magnetism, and the practice to which it leads, as
                    perfectly chimerical; and I consent to any use being henceforward made of this
                    declaration. (Signed) <hi rend="smallcaps">Berthollet. 1sZ</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The following circumstances respecting Mesmer’s lectures on animal magnetism are
                    mentioneíl by Μ. Picher-Grandchamp of Lyons, in a letter prefixed to his edition
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Mémoire de F. A. Mesmer sur ses Découvertes,</hi>
                    Paris, 182G, and seem worthy of being noticed. The letter is addressed to Μ.
                    Bourdois de la Motte, who was named, in 1825, president of a commission charged
                    by the Royal Academy<pb break="no" facs="nls:194200004"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-0004-0014"/> of Medicine to examine into animal magnetism.
                    “Courses of that doctrine being announced, and the number of pupils or auditors
                    fixed, MM. Faissole, Orelut, Bonnefoi, and myself, all physicians of Lyons, from
                    the curiosity natural to our profession, set out for Paris, wishing principally,
                    if possible, to augment or correct our medical knowledge. We were, during more
                    than fifteen days, rigorously examined on our attainments in physics, on our
                    capacity and our morality, and admitted as pupils, or adepts if you will, with
                    reciprocal conditions written and signed. We were, if I remember rightly, forty
                    or fifty in number, amongst whom there were physicians, surgeons, advocates, <hi
                    rend="italic">savans,</hi> counsellors of parliament, intendants, and persons of
                    high rank. I have lost the printed list which I possessed of all these
                    gentlemen; but my memory recalls the following :— Monseigneur le Duc de Coigni,
                    MM. de Montesquiou, de Lafayette, de Puysegur, de Chatelux, Bergasse, the first
                    commissary of police, Μ. Judel (formerly a deputy, now physician at Versailles),
                    the late Prince de Condé, the present Duc de Bourbon, and others. The course
                    lasted two months, and a treatment, established in the saloons and chambers of
                    crises, as they were called, joined at the same time practice to theory. I have
                    never yet heard that any member of that brilliant and honourable assembly has
                    not remained perfectly convinced of the reality of an active principle, and of
                    the great utility of the discovery. Some select medical men, of whom I had the
                    honour to be one, were alone permitted to enter into the crises chambers, and
                    take the direction of them. This exclusive arrangement did not aftect their
                    serene highnesses Monseigneurs de Condé and de Bourbon. There, agitations,
                    sweats, crises by all the emunctories, weeping, sleeps, respecting which, for
                    particular reasons, we had not yet been instructed, excited our meditations. Tn
                    the midst of a second course, which we followed with, if possible, still more
                    ardour and assiduity, along with a part of the company who attended the first
                    course, and a new one composed of the same class of persons, it was proposed
                    that these courses, and the doctrine in general, should be printed. A decided
                    and successfill opposition was made to this proposition, particularly on the
                    part of some <hi rend="italic">savans</hi> and gentlemen of the court, resting
                    on the following considerations: ‘ Medicine,’ they said, ‘ has lost much of its
                    consideration, of the kind of reverence which surrounded its existence and
                    decrees, of the public esteem and confidence with which it was honoured, since
                    the art of printing has revealed the whole science, its maxims, its fundamental
                    truths, its faults, its errors, and even its occult and mysterious practices.
                    All this is now in the hands of the whole world. Ignorance and avarice there
                    unceasingly search for maxims which they travesty, as well as tor receipts and
                    remedies called <hi rend="italic">secret;</hi> hence a general and fearful
                    empiricism. The educated physician has continually to contend against the
                    prejudices, the errors, the preventions, and the obstinacy of patients, in
                    consequence of this vulgar publicity; and science loses its true lustre and its
                    value, seeing itself, too, every day turned into ridicule upon the stage, and
                    that even by writers of note.’ <hi rend="italic">Cette sortie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fut frappante.</hi> It was determined, that without regard to the
                    expense, all the elements, principles, and applications of this new science
                    should be carefully engraved; that in order to preserve to them a suitable and
                    merited dignity, only one copy should be delivered to those who should be
                    collectively authorized to establish a magnetical institution and courses of
                    instruction, in some towns that were fixed upon. We (the physicians of Lyons)
                    acquired one of these copies, secured against an indiscreet publicity by the
                    precaution of having the essential and technical words expressed by figures or
                    signs, of which we were furnished with the key. Hence the reasons why a sort of
                    mystery has surrounded that science and its practice, which undoubtedly would
                    have been always very useful in the exercise of ordinary medicine. As survivor,
                    I possess this engraved work in all its integrity.” “I have the honour to offer
                    to you, and to the commission over which you are to preside, this engraved work
                    in all its purity and integrity; and at the same time to deliver to you the key.
                    It contains the whole system, the whole doctrine, the processes, and the other
                    elements of which this science consists.”</p>
                <p>We are not aware that this mysterious volume has yet seen the light. It appears,
                    however, that Mesmer dictated to his pupils a series of propositions, exhibiting
                    a general view of his system and practice, upon which he commented in his
                    lectures. These were published at Paris in the course of the same year (1784),
                    by Μ. Caullet de Veau-morel, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aphorismes</hi><hi rend="italic">de Μ. Mesmer.</hi></p>
                <p>Towards the conclusion of these courses, a quarrel arose between Mesmer and his
                    pupils, who had formed themselves into a society, under the name of the Society
                    of Harmony. The pupils conceived that they had acquired a right to diffuse the
                    knowledge of animal magnetism, and wished for that purpose to institute a public
                    course of instruction for those who were desirous to be initiated in its
                    doctrines and practices; whilst Mesmer maintained that they had come under an
                    obligation of secrecy to him, and though they might practise animal magnetism in
                    isolated cases, from motives of benevolence, that they were bound by their
                    engagements not to communicate a knowledge of his discoveries to others without
                    his consent and approbation. Those who are curious will find an account of this
                    quarrel in Bertrand’s <hi rend="italic">History of Animal Magnetism</hi> It may
                    be mentioned, however, that Μ. Bergasse, the originator of the subscription,
                    published a memoir in justification of the Society of Harmony. The issue of the
                    quarrel was, that Mesmer endeavoured, though without success, to raise
                    subscriptions for courses of instruction throughout several towns in France, at
                    half the price that had been paid for his instructions in Paris; whilst the
                    Society of Harmony patronised a public course on animal magnetism, given by Μ.
                    Desprémenil, one of their own members, and opened establishments to the number
                    of thirty, for the practice of animal magnetism in various towns of France, and
                    in other parts of the Continent.</p>
                <p>We have already hinted at the considerations on which Mesmer, in removing to
                    Paris, might have rested his hopes of success in that quarter; and the
                    circumstances we have mentioned show that such anticipations, if formed, did not
                    fail to be realised. It has been justly observed by a late author on animal
                    magnetism, that “the progress of animal magnetism in Paris was greatly
                    accelerated in consequence of the successful magnetic treatment of some patients
                    from amongst the more respectable classes of society, who published accounts of
                    their cures; and, being astonished at the result of the means employed, took
                    occasion to bestow the most extravagant panegyrics upon Mesmer and his remedial
                    art.” “It is a very great mistake to suppose that all learned and intelligent
                    men were opposed to the doctrine of Mesmer. On the contrary, he had a
                    considerable number of adherents amongst the most respectable and best-educated
                    classes of society Μ. de Segur the elder, formerly ambassador from France at the
                    court of St Petersburg, in his amusing publication entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires,</hi> informs us that he himself was one of the most zealous disciples
                    of Mesmer, as were also MM. de Gebelin, Olavides, Desprémenil, de Jaucourt, de
                    Chas-tellux, de Choiseul Gouffier, de Lafayette, and many others, all
                    enlightened and talented men.” It has not been in the case of Mesmer alone that
                    the higher classes of society have shown a discreditable facility in listening
                    to those who have pretended to possess extraordinary powers in curing diseases.
                    The following anecdote, related by Madame Campan in her Journal, whilst it
                    throws some <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200017" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0017-0015"
                    />light on Mesmer’s proceedings, reminds us in a lively manner that the
                    importance of testimony in matters of this kind, is not in all cases to be
                    estimated by the rank, nor even by the general intelligence, of the person by
                    whom it is given. “At the time,” says she, “when Mesmer made so much noise at
                    Paris with his magnetism, Μ. Campan was his partisan, like every person who
                    moved in high life; to be magnetised was-then a fashion. In the drawing-room
                    nothing was talked of but the new discovery; people’s heads were turned, and
                    their imaginations heated to the highest degree. To accomplish this object, it
                    was necessary to bewilder the understanding; and Mesmer with his singular
                    language produced that effect. To put a stop to the fit of public insanity was
                    the grand difficulty, and it was proposed to have the secret purchased by the
                    court. Mesmer fixed his claims at a very extravagant rate; however, he was
                    offered fifty thousand crowns. By a singular chance, I was one day led into the
                    midst of the persons under magnetic influence. Such was the enthusiasm of the
                    numerous spectators, that in most of them I could observe a wild rolling of the
                    eye, and a convulsed movement of the countenance. A stranger might have fancied
                    himself amidst the unfortunate patients of Charenton (a lunatic asylum in the
                    neighbourhood of Paris). Surprised and shocked at seeing so many people almost
                    in a state of delirium, I withdrew full of reflections on the scene I had just
                    witnessed. It happened that about this time my husband was attacked with a
                    pulmonary disorder, and he desired that he might be conveyed to Mesmer’s house.
                    Being introduced into the apartment occupied by Μ. Campan, I asked the worker of
                    miracles what treatment he proposed to adopt. He very coolly replied, that to
                    insure a speedy and perfect cure, it would be necessary to lay in the bed of the
                    invalid, at his left side, one of three things; namely, a young woman of brown
                    complexion, a black hen, or an empty bottle, ‘ Sir,’ said I, ‘ if the choice be
                    a matter of indifference, pray try the empty bottle.’ Μ. Campan’s side grew
                    worse, he experienced a difficulty of breathing and a pain in his chest; all the
                    magnetic remedies that were employed produced no effect. Perceiving his failure,
                    Mesmer took advantage of the period of my absence, to bleed and blister the
                    patient. Mesmer asked for a certificate to prove that the patient had been cured
                    by means of magnetism only, and Μ. Campan gave it. Here was a trait of
                    enthusiasm; truth was no longer respected. When I next presented myself to the
                    queen, their majesties asked what I thought of Mesmer’s discovery. I informed
                    them of what had taken place, earnestly expressing my indignation at the conduct
                    of the bare-faced quack. It was immediately determined to have nothing more to
                    do with him.”</p>
                <p>It was in this divided and uncertain state of the public mind, and when the
                    subscription for Mesmer’s first course of lectures was in progress, that
                    commissioners to investigate the nature and effects of animal magnetism were
                    appointed by the government. On the 12th of March 1784, the king named four
                    members of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, MM. Sallin, d’Arect, Guillotin, and
                    Majault, to enter into the examination, and to lay before him an account of
                    animal magnetism as practised by Μ. d’Eslon; and, on the petition of these
                    physicians, his majesty associated with them in this examination five members of
                    the Royal Academy of Sciences, MM. Franklin, le Roi, Bailly, de Bory, and
                    Lavoisier. On the 5th of April following, MM. Poissonnier, Caille, Mauduit,
                    Andry, and Jussieu, were named by the Baron de Brĕteuil, agreeably to the orders
                    of the king, as a commission of the Royal Society of Medicine, likewise to
                    follow Μ. d’Eslon’s practice in the application of animal magnetism to the
                    treatment of diseases, and to report upon it. The medical men in these two
                    commissions have been represented by some as persons who were prejudiced against
                    animal magnetism, and all those who practised it; but we have not been able to
                    discover any proofs of their having yielded to such prejudices, either in the
                    trials to which they subjected animal magnetism, or in the accounts which they
                    gave of these trials. Of the members of the Academy of Sciences who were
                    conjoined with the first commission, three of them at least, MM. Bailly,
                    Lavoisier, and Benjamin Franklin, must be allowed to have been no incompetent
                    judges in matters of science, observation, or common sense; and they cannot be
                    suspected of having been influenced in the judgment which their examination led
                    them to form of the nature and merits of Mesmer’s discoveries, by any feelings
                    of professional jealousy. In the introduction to an English translation of the
                    report of the joint commission of the Faculty of Medicine and Academy of
                    Sciences, published at London in 1785, it is stated (p. xv.) that “Μ. Mesmer
                    refused to have any communication with these gentlemen (the commissioners); but
                    Μ. d’Eslon, the most considerable of his pupils, consented to disclose to them
                    his principles, and assist them in their inquiries.” How far this statement is
                    correct, we are unable to say; but certain it is that the commissions, as
                    issued, were for the examination of animal magnetism as practised by D’Eslon. On
                    the same day on which the royal commission to the Faculty of Medicine is dated,
                    Μ. Thouret was desired by the Royal Society of Medicine to draw up and
                    communicate to them a history of animal magnetism, a subject on which he was
                    known to have been for a long time engaged.</p>
                <p>These commissions occasioned the production of no fewer than five separate
                    reports. The first, that of Μ. Thourct, was given in to the Royal Society of
                    Medicine on the 9th July 1784; the second, a report to the government, for
                    publication, by the joint commission of the members of the Royal Academy of
                    Sciences, and of the Faculty of Medicine, was dated the 4th of August following;
                    the third, a private report, by the same commissioners, to the king, of the same
                    date, treated of some particular effects of animal magnetism; the fourth, the
                    report of the Royal Society of Medicine to the government, was dated 16th of
                    August; and the fifth, a separate report by Jussieu, one of the commissioners of
                    that society, who held some opinions peculiar to himself, was dated 12th of
                    September. These reports exercised a most important influence on the opinions of
                    a great portion of the public, and on the manner in which magnetism was
                    afterwards practised in the different countries of Europe; and we shall
                    therefore endeavour, as briefly as possible, to make our readers acquainted with
                    their contents.</p>
                <p>The report of the commissioners of the Faculty of Medicine and Academy of
                    Sciences, whom we shall in future designate as the <hi rend="italic">joint
                    commissioners,</hi> is understood to have been drawn up by Μ. Bailly, whose
                    various writings, particularly those relating to astronomy, sufficiently
                    establish his claims to the character of a philosopher; as his conduct during
                    the progress of the French Revolution, up to the period when he became the
                    victim of its barbarities, justly entitle him to the appellation of a virtuous
                    patriot. The more popular style of this report, and the greater celebrity of
                    some of those from whom it proceeded, have thrown comparatively into the shade
                    the report presented by the commission of the Society of Medicine. Yet it is
                    impossible to read the latter document without coming to the conviction that it
                    is the production of men thoroughly versed both in theoretical and practical
                    medicine.</p>
                <p>Die title of Μ. 1 houret’s report, <hi rend="italic">Researches and Doubts on
                    Animal Magnetism,</hi> indicates the two objects which the author had in view in
                    its composition^ In the historical part, or researches, Μ. Thouret undertakes to
                    prove that the doctrine of animal magnetism announced by Mesmer as an entirely
                    new discovery, had prevailed very generally, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200030"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-0030-0016"/>under the same name, during a century at least,
                    having been adopted by a great number of partisans, and made the subject of
                    numerous dissertations and writings. By passing successively in review the
                    several propositions to which Mesmer had reduced his system, Μ. Thouret
                    endeavours to show that there existed not only a general similarity of doctrine
                    between Mesmer and former writers on magnetic medicine, particularly Kircher,
                    Maxwell, and Santanelli, but also the strictest conformity between them in
                    matters of detail. A similar and not less able review of Mesmer’s propositions
                    is to be found in an anonymous work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Anti-Magnétisme,
                    ou Origine·, Progrès,</hi><hi rend="italic">Decadence,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Renouvellement, et</hi><hi rend="italic">Refutation</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Magnétisme Animal,</hi> à Londres, 1784. In the critical part of his report, or
                    the doubts which he suggests regarding the correctness of Mesmer’s views, Μ.
                    Thouret briefly illustrates the sources of fallacy to which we are exposed in
                    attributing the effects which manifested themselves, during the operations of
                    the magnetisers, to the agency of a single and peculiar principle, and points
                    out distinctly various ways in which these effects might be accounted for,
                    independently of such an agent. “Ces details,” says he towards the conclusion of
                    his work, “paroitront peut-être bien rigoureux, mais ils m’ont semblé
                    nécessaires. Ils font naitre au moins une réflexion qu’il est en général utile
                    de présenter. C’est que pour déterminer la confiance dans une doctrine, il ne
                    suffit pas de répéter qu’il y a des faits en sa faveur. N’en a-t-on pas cité à
                    l’appui de toutes les impostures ?” “On parle toujours de faits, on parle sans
                    cesse d’observer. Mais il y a peut-être autant de fausses observations, qu’on a
                    fait des faux raisonnemens. Tout dépend d’une chose dans ces deux objets, de la
                    manière d’y procéder. Il est aussi commun, aussi possible d’observer mal, que de
                    mal raisonner. Ce n’est done ni à l’apparence ni à la multitude des faits qu’ on
                    doit s’arrêter; mais à leur qualité, à leur nature particulière. C’est ici la
                    discussion qui doit terminer, et non la première apparence. On a été tant de
                    fois séduit par des tentatives du même genre, qu’on a droit d’exiger de la
                    sévérité dans l’examen, et de mettre de la reserve dans sa croyance.”</p>
                <p>The doubts which it was the province of Μ. Thouret merely to suggest, or at most
                    to illustrate from the previous records of medicine, the other commissioners
                    were called upon, by the nature of their appointment, to bring to the test of
                    practical observation and experiment. But before noticing the judgments which
                    the commissioners have expressed respecting animal magnetism, we shall quote
                    from the reports their accounts of the practices which they saw employed for its
                    administration, and of the effects which they saw to result from their
                    employment.</p>
                <p>With regard to the arrangements of the apartments in which the magnetic practices
                    were conducted, the commissioners of the Iloyal Society of Medicine mention the
                    following particulars: “Is/, A vessel of wood, closed above, very large, of an
                    oval form, about twenty-four inches in height, which has been called the bucket
                    <hi rend="italic">(baquet),</hi> occupies the middle of the apartment. The lid
                    which covers the bucket is pierced on its borders, and throughout its whole
                    circumference, with holes, whence there arise rods of polished iron, of the
                    thickness of the finger, terminating in a rounded point, bent, and alternately a
                    long and a short one. ¶he extremities of the rods can at pleasure be plunged
                    into the bucket, drawn back, or entirely removed. At the base of the rods are
                    attached long cords, nearly of the same thickness as the rods themselves. 2<hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>, The patients are placed around the bucket; they are seated
                    on chairs, each separately, and form, according to their number, one, two, or
                    three rows. Each patient directs the extremity of one of the iron rods towards
                    the part which is regarded as the seat of his ailment, and applies it to that
                    part. They at the same time make several coils of the cord attached to the rod
                    round the parts in which they usually experience pains, or which they believe to
                    be affected with disease. The bucket is regarded by the persons who employ
                    animal magnetism, as being suited for collecting and concentrating the fluid or
                    agent the existence of which they assume; being, according to them, as it were,
                    a reservoir. The iron rods and the cords are considered as conductors. It is
                    important to mention, that we have not observed any proof of these assertions,
                    nor been furnished with any. The bucket accordingly is not considered as
                    essential, but only as accessory. 3<hi rend="smallcaps">d</hi>, The doors and
                    windows of the apartment are kept closed; curtains prevent the entrance of more
                    than a soft and feeble light; silence is observed, the only conversation being
                    in a low tone; all noise and tumult are forbidden. From these precautions it
                    results, first, that the atmosphere becomes heated, and the patients respire a
                    heavy and vitiated air, such as is met with in all close places in which a great
                    number of people are assembled; and, second, that the appearance of the
                    apartment predisposes to reflection and meditation; the spectacle before their
                    eyes is in general that of persons in suffering, and who have a melancholy
                    aspect; the only distraction from this picture is the manipulations practised by
                    the magnetisers, or the agitation and movements of the magnetised, who fall into
                    convulsions; the quiet which prevails is interrupted only by yawnings, sighs,
                    sobbings, lamentations, sometimes cries, in short, by the different expressions
                    of exhaustion or pain. In some apartments there is a pianoforte, on which a
                    number of airs are performed, particularly towards the termination of the
                    sittings. <hi rend="italic">Mlι,</hi> Servants supply the patients, when they
                    ask for drink, with water in which cream of tartar has been dissolved.”</p>
                <p>As to the mode in which the magnetic fluid or influence is transmitted to the
                    person or persons to be magnetised, the same commissioners mention that “there
                    are two ways of magnetising; by immediate contact, and by the direction of a
                    finger, or of a conductor at some distance. Is/, The most ordinary process, in
                    magnetising by contact, consists in applying the hands to the hypochondria, the
                    extremities of the fingers being directed towards the umbilicus. Frequently the
                    thumbs, or the extremities of the two fore-fingers, are applied to the
                    epigastrium. It is likewise common to place the hands upon the region of the
                    kidneys, particularly in magnetising women. The other parts that are touched are
                    determined by the seat of the disease; but whatever be the part operated on,
                    besides simple contact, frictions are performed over a larger or smaller extent
                    of surface, and with more or less force, and these are practised particularly
                    upon the umbilical and epigastric regions. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, In
                    magnetising at a certain distance, the finger or a conductor is presented under
                    the nostrils, at the mouth or eyes, at the bottom of the neck, and, behind,
                    between the shoulders. The finger or conductor is presented also on the crown of
                    the head, forehead, and behind the head. They are carried likewise in the
                    direction of the arms, along the sides of the body, and upon the thighs and
                    legs; sometimes the straight or elongated fingers are brought near to, but not
                    in contact with, one another, and the hands are shaken as if the operator were
                    making hasty sprinklings of the fluid, which is supposed to emanate from the
                    fingers that are shaken. When the patients have fallen into convulsions, the
                    magnetising is usually continued by contact with one hand, and at a certain
                    distance by means of the other. Whilst this latter operation is continued, the
                    patients have, at intervals, remissions and fresh paroxysms of convulsions.”</p>
                <p>Of the perceptible effects produced upon those who are magnetised, the joint
                    commission of the Faculty of Medicine and the Academy of Sciences has given the
                    following account: “The patients present a very varied spectacle, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200043" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0043-0017"/>from the difference of their
                    conditions. Some of them are calm, tranquil, and unconscious of an effect;
                    others cough, spit, feel some slight pain, a local or a universal heat, and are
                    thrown into perspiration; others are agitated and tormented by convulsions.
                    These convulsions are extraordinary, from their number, their duration, and
                    their violence. As soon as one convulsion commences, several others succeed. The
                    commissioners have seen some last for more than three hours; they are
                    accompanied with the expectoration of a turbid and viscid water, brought away by
                    the violence of the efforts. Sometimes streaks of blood are to be seen in the
                    expectoration, and, amongst other cases, they saw a young man wdio frequently
                    brought up blood in considerable quantity. The convulsions are characterised by
                    rapid involuntary motions of all the extremities, and of the whole body, by a
                    sense of suffocation, by subsultusof the hypochondria and epigastrium, by
                    distraction and wildness of the eyes, by piercing cries, weeping, hiccoughing,
                    and immoderate laughter. They are preceded or followed by a state of languor or
                    reverie, by a sort of dejection, and even drowsiness. The smallest unexpected
                    noise occasions startings, and it has been remarked, that changing the key and
                    the time of the airs played on the pianoforte had an effect on the patients, so
                    that they became still more agitated with a quicker motion, and the vivacity of
                    their convulsions was renewed. Nothing,” add the commissioners, “can be more
                    astonishing than the sight of these convulsions. Without having seen it, it is
                    impossible to form an idea of it; and in beholding it, one is equally surprised
                    by the profound repose of one portion of these patients, and by the agitation
                    manifested by the others, by the repetition of the various phenomena, and by the
                    sympathies that are developed. Patients are seen seeking each other exclusively,
                    and in precipitating themselves towards one another, smiling, conversing
                    affectionately, and mutually soothing each other’s crises. All are under the
                    authority of the magnétiser; and though they may appear to be in a state of
                    extreme drowsiness, his voice, or a look or sign from him, rouses them from it.
                    It is impossible not to recognise, in these constant effects, a great power
                    which agitates the patients, and obtains the mastery over them, and of which the
                    magnétiser appears to be the depositary.”</p>
                <p>With regard to the persons who fall into those convulsive movements that have
                    been called crises, the commissioners of the Society of Medicine make the
                    following importantstatements: “1st, That this occurs only to persons who,
                    whether from constitution or from the effect of disease, are exceedingly
                    sensitive: 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, That persons do not fall into convulsions
                    till after having been submitted for a longer or shorter time to the processes
                    of animal magnetism by immediate contact; it being so rare to meet with persons
                    in whom this state is produced by the simple direction of the finger, or of a
                    conductor, that scarcely any examples of it are referred to: 3<hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi>, That persons, even though very sensitive, who are magnetised
                    separately, with difficulty, and very seldom, experience convulsions, whilst,
                    when the same persons are magnetised in a place where a number of patients are
                    collected together, they are sooner and more frequently thrown into convulsions:
                    4√A, That there are much fewer men than women susceptible of convulsions, and
                    more women in affluent than in indigent circumstances: and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >5th,</hi> That it is not till after having remained for some length of time in
                    the place where the magnetising is carried on, that the persons who fall into
                    convulsions become thus affected.”</p>
                <p>We shall next state, in distinct propositions, what appear to have been the
                    results of the experimental investigations instituted upon this occasion, and
                    illustrate each of them by a few examples. On most points there is a perfect
                    agreement in the statements contained in the several reports.</p>
                <p>I. It is established in all of them, that the magnetic fluid, if it exists, is
                    incapable of being recognised by any sensible or physical properties. The joint
                    commissioners inform us, that the first object to which they directed their
                    attention, was to determine how far the existence of magnetism was capable of
                    being demonstrated. They soon satisfied themselves, that if it exists in us and
                    around us, it is in an absolutely insensible manner; it cannot be seen, heard,
                    smelt, tasted, nor touched. Some, indeed, of those who have been magnetised,
                    have said that they have seen it passing out at the extremities of the fingers
                    of the magnétiser, which served as its conductors, or felt its passage when his
                    fingers were moved about before the face or upon the hand; and some, that they
                    had been able to smell the fluid. These observations, the commissioners were
                    convinced, were erroneous, and they have endeavoured to give an explanation of
                    some of the sources of fallacy from which the mistakes had originated. Μ.
                    d’Eslon himself admitted to them, that the only way in which he could
                    demonstrate the existence of the magnetic fluid, was by the changes it produces
                    on animated beings. Similar and corresponding statements on this point are made
                    by the commissioners of the Society of Medicine, and by Μ. Jussieu.</p>
                <p>II. It is admitted in all the reports, that many persons who were operated upon
                    exhibited none of the magnetic phenomena. In comparing the results of their
                    experiments, the joint commissioners found, that of fourteen sick persons
                    operated on by them, five only appeared to experience any effect, whilst nine
                    experienced none whatsoever. Of the first-mentioned five, in two the effects
                    were not of a nature to require or admit the supposition of their depending on
                    magnetic influence, so that there were in fact only three out of the fourteen
                    cases in which the agency of magnetism could be supposed to have operated. These
                    three persons were of the lower class of society, and the commissioners were
                    strongly disposed to believe that moral circumstances had had a very principal
                    share in producing the sensations they professed to experience; and the more so,
                    as they found that no effect was produced by the operation of magnetising upon
                    children. To the same purpose the commissioners of the Society of Medicine
                    mention the case of a young lady, sixteen years of age, whose intellectual
                    faculties were impaired, and who was subject to attacks of epilepsy that
                    recurred every three or four days. “On being submitted to the different
                    processes of animal magnetism for sixty-five minutes, this girl did not
                    experience any effect from it; at least she did not make her governess, who is
                    accustomed to judge of her feelings, aware of any, and she had no attack of
                    epilepsy, as, the partisans of magnetism say, should usually happen to those who
                    are subject to it.” Jussieu likewise enumerates a considerable number of
                    instances of persons who were subjected to magnetism, without any effect being
                    produced upon them; and from the number of cases of this kind with which he was
                    acquainted, he expresses his conviction that the magnetic fluid, if it exists,
                    has not, on most meh, whether in a state of health or of disease, an action that
                    can manifest itself by sensible signs.</p>
                <p>III. It is distinctly stated in all the reports, that many persons who were led
                    to believe that they were under magnetic operation, when they were not actually
                    so, exhibited precisely the same phenomena as those who were magnetised. The
                    commissioners of the Society of Medicine give an account of two persons whom
                    they had been magnetising, after having blindfolded them, and on whom they
                    ceased to operate without their being aware of it. “Thinking,” they say, “that
                    we were continuing the process of magnetism, they have, during that
                    interruption, which has been of long duration, declared that they experienced
                    sensations in different parts. We have several times,” they add, “repeated and
                    varied, in different persons<pb break="no" facs="nls:194200056"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-0056-0018"/>, in health and in sickness, these experiments,
                    and the results have always been the same.” One of the best ,illustrations that
                    have been given of the production of the so-called magnetic phenomena,
                    independently of magnetic operations, is the following experiment, which is
                    related in the report of the joint commissioners. “When a tree has been
                    touched,” they remark, “according to the principles and method of magnetism,
                    every person who stops under it ought to experience, in a greater or less
                    degree, the effects of this agent; there have been some in this situation who
                    have swooned, or experienced convulsions. We communicated our purpose respecting
                    the following experiment to Μ. d’EsIon, who replied that it ought to succeed,
                    provided the subject operated on were extremely susceptible; and it was agreed
                    with him that it should be performed at Passy, in the presence of Dr Franklin.
                    The necessity that the subject should be susceptible, suggested to the
                    commissioners, that to render the experiment decisive and unanswerable, it was
                    necessary it should be made upon a person chosen by Μ. d’Eslon, and whose
                    susceptibility to the operation of magnetism he had already put to the proof. Μ.
                    d’Eslon, therefore, brought with him a boy of about twelve years of age; an
                    aprico-tree was fixed upon in the orchard of Dr Franklin’s garden, considerably
                    distant from any other tree, and consequently calculated to retain the
                    magnetical power which might be impressed upon it. Μ. d’Eslon was led thither
                    alone to magnetise the tree, the boy in the mean time remaining in the house,
                    and another person along with him. The commissioners could have wished that Μ.
                    d’Eslon had not been present at the subsequent part of the experiment, but he
                    declared that it might fail if he did not direct his cane and his countenance
                    towards the tree, in order to augment the action of the magnetism. It was
                    therefore resolved that Μ. d’Eslon should be placed at the greatest possible
                    distance, and that some of the commissioners should stand between him and the
                    boy, so as to satisfy themselves of the impracticability of any signals being
                    made by Μ. d’Eslon, or of any intelligence being maintained between them. The
                    boy was then brought into the orchard with his eyes covered with the bandage,
                    and presented successively to four trees upon which the operation had not been
                    performed, and caused to embrace each of them for the space of two minutes,
                    agreeably to what had been directed by Μ. d’Eslon himself. Μ. d’Eslon, present,
                    and at a considerable distance, directed his cane towards the tree which was
                    really magnetised. At the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> tree, the boy, being
                    interrogated at the end of a minute, declared that he perspired in large drops;
                    he coughed, spat, and complained of a slight pain in his head; his distance from
                    the magnetised tree was about twenty-seven feet. At the <hi rend="italic"
                    >second</hi> tree he felt stupified, and the pain in his head continued; the
                    distance was thirty-six feet. At the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> tree the
                    stupefaction and headach increased considerably; he said that he believed he was
                    approaching to the tree which had been magnetised; he was then about
                    thirty-eight feet from it. Lastly, at the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi>
                    unmagnetised tree, and at the distance of about twenty-four feet from the tree
                    which had been magnetised, the boy fell into a crisis; he fainted away, his
                    limbs stiffened, and he was carried to a neighbouring grass plot, where Μ.
                    d’Eslon hastened to his assistance and recovered him. This experiment,” the
                    commissioners remark, “is entirely conclusive: the boy knew that he was about to
                    be led to a tree upon which the magnetical operation had been performed; his
                    imagination was struck, it was exalted by the successive steps of the operation,
                    and at the fourth tree it was raised to the height necessary to produce the
                    crisis.”</p>
                <p>IV. It is established by all the reports, that many persons who were subjected to
                    magnetic operation without their being aware of it, did not exhibit the usual
                    phenomena, even though these same persons had on former trials been found to be
                    very susceptible of magnetic influence. The commissioners of the Society of
                    Medicine mention the case of a woman who complained of oppression and uneasiness
                    whenever she saw the finger of a magnétiser or his conductor directed towards
                    her in front, or perceived that they were presented to her behind; she entreated
                    that the action upon her might be discontinued, as she was about to become sick.
                    “One of us having fixed her looks upon some object, and in this way arrested her
                    attention, another presented his finger behind her for ten minutes without her
                    perceiving it, and without her having said that she had experienced any
                    sensation.” As illustrative of the dependence of the production of the magnetic
                    phenomena on the belief the person entertains of being operated upon, the joint
                    commissioners relate the following very conclusive experiment. Having made
                    choice of two rooms contiguous to each other, and united by a door of
                    communication, they caused the door to be taken away, and a frame of wood
                    substituted in its place, covered with two folds of paper. In one of these rooms
                    was placed a commissioner to make minutes of what might occur, and a lady, who
                    was given out to be just arrived from the country, and to have linen which she
                    wished to be made up. Madlle. B. a sempstress by profession, who had been
                    already employed in the experiments at Passy, and whose sensibility to the
                    magnetism was well known, was sent for. Everything was arranged before her
                    arrival, in such a manner that there was but one seat upon which she could place
                    herself, and that seat stood in the recess of the door of communication, so that
                    she was as if in a niche. The commissioners were in the other room, and one of
                    them, a physician, who had upon former occasions performed the magnetical
                    operation with success, was charged with the magnetising of Madlle. B. through
                    the paper partition. It is a principle in the theory of animal magnetism, that
                    this agent passes through wooden doors, walls, &amp;c. A partition of paper
                    could therefore be no obstacle; besides, Μ. d’Eslon had positively declared that
                    the magnetism passes through paper. Madlle. B. was accordingly magnetised during
                    half an hour, at the distance of a foot and a half. During the operation, she
                    conversed with much gaiety; and, in answer to an inquiry concerning her health,
                    she readily replied that she was perfectly well. At Passy she had fallen into a
                    crisis in the course of three minutes: on the present occasion, when ignorant of
                    the magnetism being applied, she underwent the operation without any effect for
                    thirty minutes. Only one objection, the commissioners conceive, can be suggested
                    to this experiment; that Madlle. B. might at that particular time be indisposed
                    to receive the magnetic fluid, and less susceptible to its operation than usual.
                    The commissioners, foreseeing this objection, made the following experiment. As
                    soon as they had ceased to magnetise the patient through the paper partition,
                    the same commissioner passed into the other room, where he found no difficulty
                    in engaging Madlle. B. to submit to the magnetical operation. It was accordingly
                    repeated in precisely the same manner as in the former experiment, at the same
                    distance of a foot and a half, and by the intervention of gestures only,
                    together with the employment of the right finger and the rod of iron. In three
                    minutes she felt a sensation of uneasiness and suffocation; to these succeeded
                    an interrupted hiccough, a chattering of the teeth, a pressure at the throat,
                    and an extreme pain in her head; she was restless in her chair; she complained
                    of a pain in her loins; now and then she struck her foot with extreme quickness
                    on the floor; afterwards she stretched her arms behind her, twisting them
                    extremely, as she had done at Passy; in a word, the convulsive crisis was
                    complete, and perfectly characterised. All these symptoms appeared in twelve
                    minutes, though the same process employed for <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200069" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0069-0019"/>thirty minutes, a little
                    before, had not produced any effects whatever. The commissioner who magnetised
                    her having said aloud ‘ that it was time to have done,’ at the same time
                    continued his magnetic operation in the mode he had practised it through the
                    whole of this experiment; no actual alteration therefore had been made, and the
                    same process being continued, the same impressions ought also to have continued.
                    But the declared intention of the operator was sufficient to put a stop to the
                    crisis; her heat and the pain in lier head ceased. <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> The magnetist pursued the malady from place to place, announcing at the
                    same time that it was going to disappear. In this way the contraction of the
                    throat ceased, and then successively the affections of the breast, of the
                    stomach, and of the arms. The whole required only three minutes, after which
                    Madile. B. declared that she no longer felt any sensation, but was perfectly
                    restored to her usual state.</p>
                <p>V. It is distinctly shown in all the reports, that mistakes analogous to those
                    mentioned in the two last articles were committed by many persons as to the seat
                    in which they experienced magnetic sensations; that is, from misconception as to
                    the proceedings of the magnétiser, these persons experienced sensations in parts
                    not operated on, and none in parts against which the magnetic conductor was
                    directed. The joint commissioners mention the case of a woman, who, on being
                    magnetised on the forehead, but without touching her, said that she felt a
                    sensation of heat. Μ. Jumelin, the magnétiser, moving about his hand, and
                    presenting the five extremities of his fingers over the whole of her face, she
                    said that she felt as if a flame were moving from place to place. On being
                    magnetised upon the stomach, she said that she felt heat there; when magnetised
                    on the back, she said she felt the same heat there; she likewise declared that
                    she felt hot in every part of her body, and that her head ached. But when this
                    woman was blindfolded and magnetised, the phenomena no longer corresponded to
                    the places against which the magnetism was directed. Being magnetised
                    successively on the stomach and on the back, she felt only heat in the head,
                    pain in the right eye, and in the left eye and ear. Her eyes being unbandaged,
                    and Μ. Jumelin having applied his hands upon her hypochondria, she said she felt
                    heat there; and some minutes afterwards she said she was becoming sick, and this
                    was found actually to be the case. On her recovery, her eyes were again bound,
                    Μ. Jumelin was removed, silence ordered, and the woman made to believe that she
                    was again magnetised. The effects were the same, though she was not acted upon
                    either near or at a distance; she experienced the same heat, the same pain in
                    the eyes and ears; and she also felt heat in the back and in the kidneys. After
                    a quarter of an hour had elapsed, a sign was made to Μ. Jnmelin to magnetise her
                    on the stomach; she felt nothing of it; and when magnetised on the back, was
                    actually insensible to it. The sensations diminished instead of increasing; the
                    pains of the head continued; the heat in the back and in the kidneys ceased.
                    “Two men,” say the commissioners of the Society of Medicine, “one of them still
                    young, and from birth very sensitive and irritable, the other older, and in a
                    state of bad health, both declared that they experienced sensations in the parts
                    against which the finger or a conductor was directed. Their sensations appeared
                    to correspond to the different movements that were executed. We bandaged their
                    eyes, and during all the time that we kept them deprived of light, the
                    sensations which these two men declared they experienced no longer corresponded
                    regularly with the different movements which we executed. They frequently named
                    a part as the scat of a sensation whilst we were operating on a very distant
                    part, in which they said they felt nothing.”</p>
                <p>VI. From the results of the experiments which they witnessed, the joint
                    commissioners of the Faculty of Medicine and Academy of Sciences, and the
                    commissioners of the Society of Medicine, with the exception of Μ. Jussieu,
                    considered themselves as authorized to conclude that the effects upon the human
                    economy attributed by Mesmer and his followers to the influence of animal
                    magnetism, ought to be ascribed to other causes, and particularly to the
                    handlings and frictions practised by the operators, to the influence of
                    imagination, and to the principle of instinctive imitation or sympathy. Μ.
                    Jussieu, whilst he allowed that a large portion of the phenomena that were
                    observed in the course of the investigation ought to be accounted for upon these
                    principles, conceived that in a small number of instances the phenomena could
                    not be so explained, and that, for the explanation of these, some other
                    principle must be had recourse to. Of such instances he has mentioned only four,
                    the two most specious of which we shall now lay before our readers, to enable
                    them to judge of the character of the facts that made Jussieu conceive it
                    necessary to admit the agency of a principle different from those which his
                    brother commissioners w ere disposed to recognise, as producing the
                    extraordinary phenomena that presented themselves during the so-called magnetic
                    processes. We may here remark, however, that Jussieu did not think it necessary
                    to admit, with Mesmer, the existence or agency of the magnetic, or, as he terms
                    it, an undemonstrated universal fluid; but that he attributed the influence
                    which, from the facts alluded to, he supposed one individual to be capable of
                    exerting over another, to the animal heat existing in bodies, which, he says,
                    emanates from them continually, is conveyed to a considerable distance, and may
                    pass from one body to another.</p>
                <p>“Having placed myself,” says Μ. Jussieu, “on one side of the bucket, opposite to
                    a woman whose blindness, occasioned by two very thick specks, had been a month
                    before ascertained by the commissioners, I saw her during a whole quarter of an
                    hour very tranquil, appearing more occupied with the iron rod of the bucket
                    directed upon her eyes thanΛvith the conversation of the other patients. At a
                    time when the noise of voices was suflicient to put her hearing at fault, I
                    directed, at the distance of six feet, a rod upon her stomach, which I knew to
                    be very sensitive. At the end of three minutes she appeared restless and
                    agitated; she turned about on her chair, and declared that some one placed
                    behind or alongside of her was magnetising her, though I had previously taken
                    the precaution to remove all persons who might have rendered the experiment
                    doubtful. Her restlessness ceased almost immediately after my movements were
                    discontinued, and she became tranquil as before, particularly when she was
                    assured that there was neither patient nor medical man behind her. Fifteen
                    minutes afterwards, taking advantage of the same circumstances, I renewed the
                    trial, which afforded exactly the same result.”</p>
                <p>“The crisis of another female patient was a general spasm, accompanied with a
                    transient loss of the senses, without any violent motion. The head was carried
                    forwards, the eyes were shut, the arms thrown backwards and extended along the
                    sides, the hands open, the fingers much separated. When my finger was placed
                    upon her forehead, between the eyes, it appeared to soothe her a little. If I
                    drew it gently away, the head, though no longer in contact, followed it
                    mechanically in all sorts of directions, till it came again to rest upon it. If,
                    after having thus directed lier head to one side, I presented my other hand at
                    the distance of an inch from her opposite hand, she drew it back precipitately,
                    with marks of a smart impression. These movements have been repeated three or
                    four times in ten minutes; but at the end of this time the spasm diminishing,
                    the sensibility to the impression of the finger was no longer the same. When she
                    recovered from this state, the patient was ignorant of what had taken place. I
                    have made this <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200082" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0082-0020"
                    />trial a single time. Its completeness was owing to my having observed the same
                    phenomena a month before, in watching the same crisis produced by another
                    physician. It is proper to add, that this patient had returned to the treatment
                    that same day, after having been in the country for three weeks, during which
                    she said she had experienced no crisis.”</p>
                <p>It is impossible, we conceive, to read these narratives of Μ. Jussieu, without
                    feeling that the consideration to which they arc entitled is most materially
                    diminished by the circumstance of no mention being made of any persons by whom
                    the experiments were witnessed. If the other commissioners were present when
                    these experiments were performed, it must be inferred, from their silence
                    respecting them, that they were not satisfied of their accuracy. If, again, they
                    were made in the absence of his colleagues in the commission, and rest solely
                    upon Μ. Jussieu’s authority, then, with perfect confidence in his veracity, and
                    every disposition to give him credit for sagacity and accuracy of observation,
                    it is obvious that the very nomination of a commission implies the importance of
                    several persons being present at an investigation of this kind, to secure
                    against deception on the one hand, or mistake upon the other. The perusal of the
                    cases suggests, too, the observation, that it is not on the credibility of Μ.
                    Jussieu, but on that of the subjects of his experiments, that their value
                    depends; for Μ. Jussieu seems to have taken the good faith of these persons for
                    granted, without enforcing those prudent precautions which, as is well observed
                    in the report of the joint commissioners, “in an experiment that ought to be
                    authentic, are indispensable without being offensive.”</p>
                <p>In regard to the first of the cases we have quoted, Μ. Jussieu states, in general
                    terms, that none of the precautions possible on such an occasion had been
                    neglected; that he was satisfied that the patient had derived no other advantage
                    from the treatment she had undergone, than an obscure and confused perception of
                    certain objects at a distance of three or four inches; that the light fell
                    laterally upon her and upon himself; that he could not suspect collusion on the
                    part either of the patients, who were occupied with some totally different
                    object, or of the medical men recently admitted to follow the treatment, and who
                    sought only to see the effects; and, lastly, that one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chefs de la salle</hi> was present, but always by his side, observing silence,
                    and allowing him to operate at his pleasure. Now, it must be apparent to every
                    one that these were not all the precautions possible or desirable in a matter of
                    this kind. If the specks allowed of a slight degree of vision at a distance of
                    three or four inches, we know no reason why they should prevent such a degree of
                    vision at the distance of six feet, as would advertise her of the presence of Μ.
                    Jussieu and his magnetic rod. It would have been satisfactory, therefore, that
                    the eyes of this woman had been covered with a bandage, as was done by the joint
                    commissioners in experimenting upon a woman who had specks upon her eyes. 1 his
                    suggests the inquiry whether the same person was the subject of the experiments
                    of the commissioners and of Μ. Jussieu. The woman operated on by the
                    commissioners afforded ample proof how much she was under the influence of the
                    imagination, and how necessary was the precaution of the application of the
                    bandage. It is to be regretted, too, that Μ. Jussieu had not taken the
                    precaution to remove all bystanders whose services he did not require, and in
                    whom he could not place unlimited confidence.</p>
                <p>In the second case, also, those precautions seem to have been omitted which would
                    have been essential to the validity of the experiment. Μ. Jussieu assumed that
                    the patient did not perceive the motions of his hand, because there was
                    transient loss of the senses, and her eyes were shut; and because, on recovering
                    from the state of insensibility, she declared that she was ignorant of what had
                    taken place. Μ. Bertrand conceives that all the difficulties of this case are
                    got rid of by assuming that the patient was in a state bordering upon
                    somnambulism. To us, we confess, the symptoms of the crisis during which Μ.
                    Jussieu’s experiments were performed, seem to bear a striking resemblance to
                    those which are frequently observed in a paroxysm of ordinary hysteria, in the
                    course of which the patient, though presenting the appearance of insensibility,
                    is often quite aware of the conversation and actions of those by whom∙ she is
                    surrounded. Μ. Jussieu does not attempt to determine whether the motions of the
                    head in this case are to be attributed to a physical attraction exerted over it
                    by the magnetising finger, or to an instinctive motion of the muscles,
                    calculated, if not intended, to retain to the head that soothing influence which
                    it seemed to experience from the finger being brought into contact with it. Nor
                    does he seem to have endeavoured to ascertain whether any other part of the
                    body, besides the head, as the hand or foot, for example, would have undergone
                    similar motions in similar circumstances. In mentioning, indeed, that painful
                    and diseased organs not unfrequentlŷ experience a smart impression, or even a
                    burning heat, from the contact of the finger or rod, Μ. Jussieu adds, that
                    sometimes the tumour, when thus heated, advances and rolls under the finger, and
                    appears for an instant to increase in size. These two effects, he says, he had
                    several times produced. Similar effects, it may be remarked, are alluded to by
                    Thourct, as having occurred in his experiments with artificial magnets. But to
                    establish the reality of such a phenomenon would require a kind of evidence more
                    extensive and precise than that by which this extraordinary fact has hitherto
                    been attested. This fact, however, of the movement of parts of the body to which
                    magnets or magnetic rods are applied, towards these substances, must either be
                    admitted to be true, or be regarded, as we suspect it well may, as a fallacy
                    engendered in the imagination of the observers.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, then, we cannot but concur with Μ. Bertrand, in the judgments
                    which he has pronounced both with regard to the particular facts on which Μ.
                    Jussieu has grounded his difference of opinion from his colleagues, and on the
                    general tendency of his report. Of the first, Bertrand remarks, that “these
                    facts, which would be so important if they were established in a way to leave no
                    doubt, are unquestionably too few in number to produce conviction.” “It is very
                    unfortunate that Μ. Jussieu, in the course of five months, during which he
                    attended very assiduously at the public treatments, has not been able, out of a
                    very great number of patients, to collect more than this small number of facts
                    in favour of the hypothesis of a particular agent.” Respecting the general
                    tendency of Μ. Jussieu’s report, Μ. Bertrand observes, that it “contains all
                    that a judicious, well-informed, and impartial observer, aided besides with all
                    imaginable facilities for the examination of animal magnetism, could find in the
                    way of arguments in its favour. Yet this report, made in such friendly
                    intentions, but made by a man who placed the interest of truth before everything
                    else, was much more opposed than favourable to the pretensions of the
                    magnetisers.”</p>
                <p>VII. With regard to the consideration of the curative influence of animal
                    magnetism, the two commissions proceeded differently, each, however, pursuing
                    the mode of investigation best suited to his habits of study and experience. The
                    joint commissioners remark, that “there are two different ways in which the
                    action of magnetism upon animated bodies may be observed; <hi rend="italic"
                    >fi</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">sl,</hi> by its curative
                    effects, when pursued for a length of time, in the treatment of diseases; or,
                    <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> by its more speedy effects <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200095" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0095-0021"/>upon the animal economy, and
                    the observable changes which it produces upon that economy.” Μ. d’Eslon insisted
                    that the first of these methods sìioiild be principally and almost exclusively
                    followed in their examination; but this the joint commissioners declined, from
                    the consideration of the uncertainty that in all cases exists, even when
                    recovery takes place during the use of particular remedies, how much of the cure
                    is attributable to the efforts of nature, and how much to the action of the
                    remedies employed. “The treatment of diseases,” they observe, “can furnish only
                    results that are always uncertain and often deceptive; nor could this
                    uncertainty be dissipated, and every cause of fallacy obviated, but by an
                    infinity of cures, and perhaps by the experience of several ages. The object and
                    the importance of the commission require prompter means of decision. The
                    commissioners felt it incumbent upon them, therefore, to confine themselves to
                    proofs purely physical, that is to say, to the instantaneous effects of the
                    fluid upon the animal body, excluding from these effects all the fallacies that
                    might mix with them, and satisfying themselves that they could proceed from no
                    other cause than animal magnetism.”</p>
                <p>But whilst the joint commissioners confined their observations to the immediate
                    effects produced on those who are magnetised, the commissioners of the Society
                    of Medicine, agreeably with their instructions, extended their observations to
                    the employment and effects of magnetism in the treatment of diseases. In
                    communicating the results of their observations as to the effects of magnetism
                    considered as a therapeutic agent, they divide the classes of cases in which
                    they saw it employed, under three heads: Isř, Patients whose affections were
                    evident, and had a known cause; <hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hdly,</hi> those whose slight ailments consisted in indefinite
                    affections, without any determinate cause; and, <hi rend="italic">Qdly,</hi>
                    melancholics. Of the patients of the first class, those whose affections were
                    evident and had a known cause, they state that they had seen none cured or
                    manifestly relieved, though they had followed the magnetical treatment of them
                    during four months, and learned that some of them had been under treatment for
                    more than a year. They remark, however, that even though there had been, as they
                    were assured, some patients of that class cured before the appointment of the
                    commission, no conclusion should be deduced from this, because the examples that
                    could be cited must be few in number, and because, of a multitude of patients
                    brought together at hazard, nature cures some, and that often in a shorter space
                    of time than is employed in the treatment by animal magnetism. As to the
                    patients of the second class, those having slight and indefinite ailments, the
                    commissioners state that they have seen several who assured them that they felt
                    their health improved, that they had more appetite and better digestion, &amp;c.
                    These patients, the commissioners observe, are not of the number of those who
                    experience convulsions; whether that no attempt is made to produce those in
                    them, or that by their constitution or the state of their health they are not
                    disposed to undergo them. The commissioners point out various circumstances
                    which may have operated in producing the improvement in the health of this class
                    of patients. “As to the third class of patients, the melancholics, it is well
                    known,” they remark, “how easy it is to afflict such persons, to console them,
                    to suspend for some time their sufferings, to occupy them, to distract them,
                    and, in short, how little we must depend on their testimonies, on their cure,
                    and on the success obtained in the treatment of their diseases.”</p>
                <p>Μ. Jussieu, after giving a short account of the therapeutical effects which
                    seemed to result from the magnetical treatment, and of the diseases in which it
                    appeared to prove beneficial, proceeds, in conformity to his general doctrine,
                    to endeavour to prove that these effects are referrible to the transmission of
                    animal heat. “The facts quoted,” says ’ he, “prove in general the tonic action
                    of the remedy <hi rend="italic">(moyen)</hi> employed. I have not been <hi
                    rend="subscript"> x</hi> able to attribute to other causes the improved health
                    which I observed in some of the patients. Undoubtedly the imagination, the
                    exercise necessary for going to the place of treatment, the abstinence from
                    every other remedy which might fatigue the body, the relaxation of mind
                    resulting from the assemblage of several persons, the pleasure which music
                    excites, and the habitual use of the cream of tartar administered in this
                    treatment, are means which sometimes add much to the action of the principal
                    remedy; but it would be unnatural to suppose them sufficient in all cases. In
                    reflecting on all these effects,” he continues, “it is easy to perceive that
                    they are determined by a physical cause, which is animal heat, and that this
                    heat forms the basis of the magnetical treatment.”</p>
                <p>VIII. The commissioners pointed out two kinds of dangers as liable to result from
                    the practice of animal magnetism, in the mode in which they saw it conducted,
                    one affecting the health, and the other the morals, of the persons operated
                    upon. The dangers which the joint commissioners apprehended might result to the
                    health of those who were subjected to the magnetical operations, were of two
                    kinds; <hi rend="italic">ist,</hi> the immediate injury liable to result in many
                    cases from the violence of the crises, as they were called, or the convulsions,
                    &amp;c. into which the patients were thrown; and, 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi>
                    the liability of a habit of experiencing such convulsions being established in
                    the economy. “The imagination of sick persons,” they remark, “has
                    unquestionably, in many instances, great influence in the cure of their
                    diseases. Its effect is known only by a general experience, and has not been
                    determined by positive experiments; but it does not seem to admit of doubt. It
                    is a well known adage, that in medicine men are saved by faith; this faith is
                    the product of the imagination; in this case the imagination acts only by mild
                    means.” “But when the imagination produces convulsions, it acts by violent
                    means, and these means arc almost always injurious. There are a very few cases
                    in which they may be useful; there are desperate cases in which <hi
                    rend="italic">il faut</hi><hi rend="italic">tout</hi><hi rend="italic">troubler
                    pour ordonner tout de nouveau.</hi> These dangerous shocks are to be had
                    recourse to in medicine in the same way as poisons. They must be required by
                    imperious necessity, and employed with the greatest reserve. The need for them
                    is momentary; the shock ought to be single. Far from repeating it, the wise
                    physician occupies himself with the means of repairing the necessary evil which
                    it has produced. But in the public practice of magnetism, the crises are
                    repeated every day, they are long-continued, and severe in degree.” And again,
                    “Who will assure us that this state of crises, at first voluntarily induced,
                    shall not become habitual? And if this habit, thus contracted, frequently
                    reproduces the same symptoms, in spite of the will, and almost without the
                    assistance of the imagination, what would be the fate of an individual subjected
                    to these violent crises, tormented physically and morally by their unfortunate
                    impression, whose days are divided between apprehension and pain, and whose life
                    is only an uninterrupted punishment? These diseases of the nerves, when
                    occurring naturally, are the opprobrium of medicine; how little ought it to be
                    the object of art to produce them.”</p>
                <p>Into the consideration of the moral dangers with which the commissioners
                    conceived the practice of animal magnetism to be attended, we shall not enter
                    here. They formed the subject of the secret report already alluded to as having
                    been submitted to the king by the joint commis-sionersofthe Faculty of Medicine
                    and Academy of Sciences; a report equally remarkable for the elegance of its
                    composition and the delicacy of its sentiments. That the hints which it
                    contained were proper and necessary, may <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200108"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-0108-0022"/>be presumed from the attention they met with at
                    the time, and also from the regulations which have since been adopted in other
                    countries where the practice of magnetism has received the sanction of
                    government; as well as from the rules laid down by various practical physicians,
                    who, in recommending magnetism as a means of cure, show how much they were aware
                    of the aþuses to which its unrestrained practice is liable. The reader who has
                    any curiosity upon this subject, may consult the observations of Hufeland, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Journal der</hi><hi rend="italic">Practischen
                    Arzneykunde</hi> for 1815 and 1820; and of Kieser, <hi rend="italic">System des

                <p>A feeble attempt was made on the part of Mesmer and his admirers to persuade the
                    public that, however applicable the conclusions of the commissioners might be to
                    the magnetic proceedings of his pupils, which alone they had had an opportunity
                    of witnessing, they could not fairly be extended to the doctrines and practice
                    of the master. “Happily for Μ. Mesmer,” it was said, “there are in his system
                    things which it is not easy to transmit, which are not even as yet developed,
                    and which, hitherto made more to be felt than expressed, will not be easily
                    stripped from him.” Against this objection the commissioners had carefully
                    guarded themselves, by stating very fully the grounds they had for believing
                    that the system and practice of D’Eslon did not materially differ from those of
                    Mesmer himself. “It is easy to prove,” say they, “that the essential practices
                    of magnetism are known to Μ. d’Eslon. Μ. d’Eslon has been for many years the
                    pupil of Μ. Mesmer. He has seen constantly, during that period, the practices of
                    animal magnetism employed, and the means of exciting and directing it. Μ.
                    d’Eslon has himself treated patients in presence of Μ. Mesmer; at a distance
                    from him he has produced the same effects as at Μ. Mesmer’s house. Again, when
                    together, they have combined their patients, and have treated them
                    indiscriminately, and consequently in following the same processes. The method
                    which Μ. d’Eslon at present follows cannot, therefore, be different from that of
                    Μ. Mesmer. The effects, likewise, correspond. There are crises as violent, as
                    numerous, and accompanied by similar phenomena, at the house of Μ. d’Eslon as at
                    that of Μ. Mesmer; these effects, therefore, are not dependent on a particular
                    practice, but on the practice of magnetism in general.” Μ. Foissac says <hi
                    rend="italic">{Rapports</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Discussions,</hi> p. 223), in reference to the commissioners having carried on
                    their investigations at D’Eslon’s instead of at Mesmer’s institution, that
                    “Mesmer in vain addressed the most urgent remonstrances to Franklin and Μ. le
                    Baron de Breteuil: it was in vain that he protested against everything that
                    should be done elsewhere than in his own house; they did not listen to him, they
                    did not deign to honour him with the smallest answer.” Mesmer himself says, in a
                    work subsequently published, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">A</hi>
                    minister of the past reign abused all his power to destroy the growing opinion.
                    After having ordered, notwithstanding my protestations, the formation of a
                    commission to judge of my doctrine, and to condemn it in the practice made of it
                    by a person whom I disavowed, he made his triumph be celebrated at the Academy
                    of Sciences, where he was applauded to the skies for having preserved them, as
                    they said, from a great error, which constituted the disgrace of the age. He
                    inundated the whole of Europe with a report made by that commission, and ended
                    by giving up to public derision, upon the theatres, both my doctrine and my
                    method of cure.”</p>
                <p>A number of answers were published to the reports of the commissioners, to some
                    of which the names of the authors were attached, while others were anonymous. To
                    the former class belong the works of MM. d’Eslon, de Montjoye, Bonnefoy, and
                    Bergasse. To the latter class, the “Doutes d’un Provincial,” understood to be
                    the composition of Μ. Servan of Grenoble; the “Réflexions Impartiales,” &amp;c.;
                    the “Observations, &amp;c. par un Médecin de Province ;” and the “Supplement aux
                    Deux Rapports.” An analysis and refutation of most of these answers was
                    published by Μ. Devillers under the title of “Le Colosse aux Pieds d’Argile.” In
                    1785 there were published, by order of the king, extracts of the correspondence
                    of the Royal Society of Medicine, relative to animal magnetism drawn up by Μ.
                    Thouret. This again called forth seve- ’ ral replies, particularly from Μ. de la
                    Boissiere, physician at Bergerac, from Μ. Bonnefoy of Lyons, and from Μ
                    d’Eslon.</p>
                <p>The doubts of Μ. Jussieu, and the arguments of the more decided supporters of
                    animal magnetism, would probably have had little influence in saving it from the
                    general disrepute and oblivion to which the reports of the commissions
                    threatened to consign it, had not some of Mesmer’s pupils about this time
                    discovered that this agent is capable of producing a set of phenomena still more
                    wonderful than’ those which had engaged the attention of the commissioners. The
                    consideration of these phenomena, however, we must, as we have already
                    announced, postpone to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Somnambulism.</hi> All
                    that we can at present propose to ourselves, is to collect a few notices
                    respecting the subsequent history of Mesmer, and to point out some of the more
                    general conclusions that seem deducible from the review which we have taken of
                    his transactions.</p>
                <p>In the introduction to the English translation of the report of the joint
                    commission, already referred to, it is stated, that “Μ. Mesmer appealed from the
                    decision of the commissioners to the parliament of Paris ;” and in a postscript
                    there is given an extract of a letter, said to be from the best authority, from
                    Paris, and to have been received while the translation of the report was in the
                    press. “Mesmer has complained to the parliament of the report of the royal
                    commissioners, and requested that they would appoint a new commission, to
                    examine, not his theory and practice, but a <hi rend="italic">plan,</hi> which
                    shall exhibit the only possible means of infallibly demonstrating the existence
                    and utility of his discovery. The petition was printed: many thought the
                    parliament would do nothing in it. But they have laid hold of it to clinch
                    Mesmer, and oblige him to expose all directly; so that it must soon be seen
                    whether there is any difference between his method and D’Eslon’s. I give you
                    their arrêt of the 6th September 1784. ‘ The parliament ordains that Mesmer <hi
                    rend="italic">shall be obliged</hi> to expose, before four doctors of the
                    Faculty of Medicine, two surgeons, and two masters in pharmacy, the doctrine
                    which he professes to have discovered, and the methods which he pretends must be
                    adopted for the application of his principles. They likewise ordain that a
                    report of his communications shall then be delivered to the attorney-general, to
                    be laid before parliament for their sentence.’ ” Whether any proceedings took
                    place in consequence of this decree, and if so, of what nature they were, we are
                    unable to say; nor how far Mesmer’s departure from Paris about the end of 1784
                    is to be considered as having been influenced by it.</p>
                <p>Very little seems to be known of Mesmer’s proceedings subsequently to his leaving
                    Paris at this period. Μ. Deleuze mentions that Mesmer was desirous to teach his
                    doctrines in England as he had done in France. In a letter written by Mesmer to
                    Μ. Picher-Grandchamp of Lyons, dated Paris, 19th May 1787, he says, “I arrived
                    lately from England, where I had passed a month in amusing myself.” We find no
                    other mention of Mesmer’s ever having been in England, except that Gorton, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary,</hi> says he had lived there for
                    some time subsequently to 1784, under a feigned name. The translation of
                    Bailly’s report into the English language in 1785, and the impression which it
                    made upon the public mind, probably took from him all hope of a favourable
                    reception <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200121" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0121-0023"/>in
                    this country. He appears from time to time to have revisited Paris. Μ. Foissac
                    mentions (p. 226, note) that Dr Aubry, a particular friend of Mesmer’s, informed
                    him, that during the dismal events of 1793, Mesmer witnessed the frightful agony
                    and execution of Bailly in the Champ de Mars, whether as a compulsory or as a
                    voluntary spectator does not appear.</p>
                <p>In 1799, Mesmer published a new work under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de F. A. Mesmer</hi><hi rend="italic">sur ses
                    Découvertes.</hi> This work must be considered as belonging rather to the second
                    than to the first period of animal magnetism; for in it Mesmer has, with very
                    considerable art, endeavoured to assume to himself those new views of theory and
                    practice which had been opened up by his pupils subsequently to his development
                    of his system in 1784, particularly those relative to somnambulism and its
                    phenomena, which, though he seems to look upon them with no very favourable eye,
                    he represents as necessary consequences of his doctrines.</p>
                <p>Mesmer passed the latter years of his life at Frauen-feldt in Switzerland, near
                    to the Lake of Constance. He was visited there by Dr Egg of Zurich in 1808, and
                    by Dr Wolfart of Berlin in October 1812. To the latter, who had been engaged in
                    magnetical practice in Berlin since the year 1808, he confided his manuscripts,
                    out of which that physician drew up a system, which he published at Berlin in
                    1814, under the title of Mesmerism, or System of the Operations, Theory, and
                    Application, of Animal Magnetism, as the general Curative for the preservation
                    of Mankind. The manuscripts of this work seem to have been transmitted to Mesmer
                    for his revision, and to have received his warmest approbation. Mesmer died at
                    Mersburg, on the 15th of March 1815, at the age of eighty-one years. In the
                    course of the same year, λVol-fart, to whom he left his Harmonico as a legacy,
                    published Commentaries on the Aphorisms contained in his System.</p>
                <p>In reviewing the history of animal magnetism, such as we have endeavoured to
                    sketch it in the foregoing pages, the questions that present themselves for our
                    determination seem to be principally the following: 1st, Did Mesmer make a
                    discovery? 2d, If so, did his discovery consist in the observation of facts not
                    previously known, or in a more correct explanation of facts that had been
                    previously observed? 3¢7, If he made no discovery, either in matters of fact or
                    explanation, did he direct the attention of men of science, more strongly than
                    had previously been done, to facts already known, but not sufficiently
                    appreciated? and, 4√7z, Whatever may have been the nature of Mesmer’s services
                    to science, were they rendered in a way that entitles him to the gratitude of
                    mankind?</p>
                <p>To enable us to answer the first two of these questions, it is obviously
                    essential for us to determine in our own minds what are the general facts which
                    were brought to light or illustrated by the practices of the magnetisers, and
                    what are the general principles to which these facts ought to be referred. It
                    would be impossible, perhaps, to make a better arrangement of the facts of
                    animal magnetism than that adopted by the French commissioners, into two
                    classes; the first comprehending those more immediate effects which were
                    produced, in the operations of the magnetisers, upon the different functions of
                    the economy, particularly on the nervous and muscular systems, and on the organs
                    of secretion and excretion,—such as the production, removal, and migration of
                    painful sensations, the occurrence of convulsions, and of the various natural
                    discharges; and the second class comprehending the cures of diseases which
                    occurred in the progress of the magnetical treatment. Now, there has, we think,
                    been a good deal of inaccuracy in the manner in which some of those who have
                    been adverse to the pretensions of Mesmer have expressed themselves in regard to
                    these facts; and at the same time no small degree of misrepresentation in the
                    opinions, on this subject, which have been ascribed by his admirers to others of
                    his opponents, and particularly to the French commissioners. Of the effects
                    which Mesmer and his followers declare themselves to have produced, there can,
                    we conceive, be little doubt that a large portion actually occurred; and such,
                    we think, has been the general conviction of the opponents of animal magnetism.
                    The reports of the French commissioners furnish, indeed, the most authentic
                    record which we possess of the reality of the facts. It is therefore on the
                    principle on which these facts ought to be explained, that the difference of
                    opinion with regard to animal magnetism properly depends. Are they, or are they
                    not, attributable to those physical, vital, and mental agencies to which mankind
                    has been wont to refer the natural and daily observed phenomena of the animal
                    economy, and, in particular, to the handlings and frictions of various parts of
                    the body, to the impressions of awe and hope produced by the mysterious
                    ceremonies, and to the force of instinctive imitation; or, are these agencies
                    incapable of furnishing an explanation of the phenomena of animal magnetism, and
                    is it necessary, for this purpose, to admit the existence and agency of a new
                    and peculiar principle? Mesmer upon various occasions takes great credit to
                    himself for having discovered the existence of the principle of animal magnetism
                    by <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> reasoning. The absurdity of such a pretension
                    is now, however, universally admitted; and the only question, as it appears to
                    us, that remains for consideration, is this,— seeing that it is established
                    beyond all reasonable doubt that the phenomena attributed to animal magnetism
                    can be produced by other and familiar agencies, ought we, for the explanation of
                    the very few cases in which some difficulty may occur in tracing the
                    intervention of these agencies, to have recourse to one of an entirely new and
                    unknown character? Nothing, it is obvious, can in sound philosophy justify us in
                    recognising such a principle, but our finding its admission essential to the
                    explanation of the phenomena that present themselves to our observation.</p>
                <p>It would not be difficult to point out a variety of fallacies in the arguments of
                    those who have opposed the explanations of the effects observed in the practice
                    of animal magnetism, which were suggested by Μ. Berthollet, and concurred in by
                    the French commissioners. It has been argued, that, because the so-called
                    magnetic phenomena have manifested themselves in some cases where no handlings
                    or frictions have been practised, and in other cases in which the individuals
                    have been operated on singly, and consequently where there was no room for
                    imitation, we are not entitled to attribute to these powers any influence in the
                    production of the phenomena in question. But in attributing the magnetic
                    phenomena to several different principles, it was not meant to be implied,
                    either that in each individual case one only of these principles could be
                    supposed to operate, or that in each case all of them must be supposed to act in
                    combination. There can be no doubt, that more or fewer of these agencies will be
                    required to produce sensible effects, according to the constitutions and
                    dispositions of the individuals who are the subject of operation; and that, in
                    like manner, the space of time within which these effects can be induced, and
                    their intensity, must be the joint result of the number and force of the
                    impressions, and the susceptibilities of the persons operated on. Not the least
                    singular, certainly, of the fallacies to which we have adverted, is that of
                    supposing that persons of low station in society, and little cultivation of
                    mind, are less under the influence of imagination than persons of refined
                    manners and education. The whole history of witchcraft, of sorcery, of
                    demoniacal possession, and of spurious miracles, affords abundant proofs of the
                    absurdity of such an opinion.</p>
                <p>In admitting the reality of most of the effects which the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200134" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0134-0024"/>animal magnetisers professed
                    to produce, we find it necessary to guard against any misinterpretation of our
                    meaning, so far as regards their pretensions to the cure of diseases. That a
                    recovery took place in many cases in which animal magnetism was practised, might
                    be acknowledged, without admitting that these practices had any influence in
                    producing this recovery. If we examine the histories of those cases of cures by
                    the Mesmerian practices which have been recorded, it will be found that many of
                    them were slow processes, occupying months, and even years, for their
                    accomplishment. It would be no difficult task to collect accounts of cases in
                    which equally remarkable recoveries had occurred, sometimes under the supposed
                    influence of medical art, and often also when all remedial means had been
                    abandoned or dispensed with. But, admitting that the practices of animal
                    magnetism assisted in curing the diseases of some, and in ameliorating the
                    symptoms of others, —in doing which, we feel assured, they could act only on the
                    principles explained by the commissioners,—we are very far from being disposed
                    to allow that all those diseases were cured by these means, which the
                    magnetisers claim to have cured. There are two wide sources of fallacy in
                    judgments of this kind; the doubts that may be entertained, <hi rend="italic"
                    >first,</hi> as to the diseases having actually been of the nature alleged; and,
                    <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> as to these diseases having been actually
                    cured. But on these points we shall not enter more fully here. In the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine,</hi> an opportunity will occur for treating at
                    greater length of thpse numerous fallacies to which the public in general, and
                    even medical men, are exposed in judging of the curative influence of remedies
                    over diseases. We may remark, however, that medical men have been much
                    reproached for not availing themselves of that beneficial influence over the
                    imaginations of their patients, which the experiments of Mesmer and others show
                    that it is possible to exercise. We must confess, that we are not of those who
                    are willing to encourage medical men to have recourse to the practice of fraud
                    in the exercise of their profession; or to prefer that blind and spurious trust
                    which ignorance is ever ready to bestow upon mummery and mystery, to that
                    legitimate confidence which is inspired by a belief in the experience, sagacity,
                    and skill of the medical practitioner. <hi rend="italic">Licere medicum
                    mentiri</hi> may be a very good topic to exercise the talents of a disputant,
                    but it is a maxim which requires rather to be kept in check than to be
                    encouraged. The necessity may unquestionably arise for the practitioner to
                    deceive his patient for a time as to the means which he is employing for his
                    cure, but this should be only on rare occasions, and under very peculiar
                    circumstances. It is plain, indeed, that if it were once understood that medical
                    men were habitually wont to address their remedial measures to the imaginations
                    of their patients, a jealousy of their proceedings would be engendered in the
                    public mind, which would not only render these particular means of no avail, but
                    would involve the whole practice of the art in suspicion, so that, instead of
                    being assisted by this spurious confidence, the medical practitioner would have
                    to contend against distrust in circumstances in which it would never otherwise
                    have arisen.</p>
                <p>As to our third question, relative to the originality of Mesmer’s observations,
                    it would be easy to show, from the history of the wonder-workers and great
                    curers of all ages, —and it is in fact partly apparent from the slight review of
                    the employment of the mineral and artificial magnets, prefixed to this
                    article,—that, neither as regards the immediate sensible effects which he
                    induced, nor the ultimate cure of diseases, did Mesmer add more to what had been
                    accomplished on innumerable occasions before his time, than merely the invention
                    of a new apparatus. By connecting his practices with a branch of science of
                    great obscurity and interest, and which was then exciting in the highest degree,
                    as it still continues to do, the attention of men of science, he no doubt
                    secured for the phenomena which he professed to produce, a greater degree of
                    attention than they, in all probability, would otherwise have received; and in
                    this manner his name must remain associated, to a greater degree perhaps than it
                    is justly entitled, with a class of phenomena which, so long as ignorance and
                    credulity furnish elements for their production, can never cease to excite the
                    astonishment of the vulgar.</p>
                <p>With regard to the last topic to which we have adverted, Mesmer’s claims to the
                    gratitude of mankind, we must acknowledge that we are not able to concur in what
                    has been said on this subject by his eulogists. Notwithstanding all his
                    professions of disinterestedness and high mindedness, of his zeal for truth, and
                    his desire to court investigation, of his anxiety for the benefit of his
                    species, and of the patriotic feelings he entertained in spite of the
                    ingratitude of his country, we confess we can find no evidence in his conduct to
                    justify us in believing that these were actually the feelings by which his mind
                    was swayed. The proceedings of a man inspired, not by a desire for immediate
                    celebrity or immediate gain, but by a pure and sincere love of truth; indulging
                    possibly a hope, that when the justness of his views should come by the force of
                    conviction to be acknowledged, his own claim to admiration and gratitude, or
                    even to more substantial rewards, should not be overlooked; but chiefly urgent
                    in forcing his discovery on the attention of mankind, from the conviction that
                    it materially affected their happiness and welfare; would not have evinced those
                    marks of concealment and mystery, and those pretensions to infallibility, which
                    form so prominent and so constantly recurring a feature in the history of
                    Mesmer. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. f. f. f.)</hi></p>
