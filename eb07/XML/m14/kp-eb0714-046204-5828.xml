                <p><label type="entry">MECKLENBURG-STRELITZ</label>, a grand duchy in the north of
                    Germany. It is composed of two portions of the old duchy of Strelitz and the
                    principality of Ratzeburg, and has some territory intermixed with that of other
                    states. It extends over 796 square miles, and comprehends nine cities and towns,
                    219 villages, 245 princely domains, and 10,805 houses, with 45,500 inhabitants,
                    chiefly employed in cultivation, who all adhere to the Lutheran church, with the
                    exception of about fifty catholics and 750 Jews. The income of the state amounts
                    to £50,000 annually, chiefly arising from the ducal domains. The public debt is
                    so interwoven with that of Mecklenburg-Schwerin that its exact amount is not
                    known, but by the operation of a sinking fund it is decreasing. The regular
                    forces consists of a battalion of infantry and a division of husars, numbering
                    together 772 individuals. The courts of law for both Mecklenburgs are united.
                    King George III. having married a princess of the house, has connected it with
                    the royal family of England. The capital is the city of Strelitz, with 5350
                    inhabitants. There are in the duchy mines yielding silver, lead, and iron; the
                    last of these is worked into the various articles for which it is adapted at the
                    several manufactories of the duchy. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205841"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5841-0463"/><hi rend="smallcaps">Medal</hi> denotes a piece of
                    metal in the form of a coin, such as was either current money amongst the
                    ancients, or had been struck upon any particular occasion, in order to preserve
                    to posterity the portrait of some great person, or the memory of some
                    illustrious action. Scaliger derives the word <hi rend="italic">medal</hi> from
                    the Arabic <hi rend="italic">methalia,</hi> a sort of coin having on it a human
                    head. But the generally received opinion is that of Vossius, viz. that it comes
                    from <hi rend="italic">metallum,</hi> metal, of which substance medals are
                    commonly made.</p>
                <p>I.— <hi rend="italic">Utility of Medals in History and other Sciences.</hi></p>
                <p>There are few studies of more importance to history than that of medals; the sole
                    evidence we can have of the veracity of a historian being only such collateral
                    documents as are evident to every body, and cannot be falsified. In modern times
                    these are found in public memoirs, instructions to ambassadors, and state papers
                    of various kinds. Such memorials, however, are subject to various accidents,
                    and, besides, commonly remain in the countries where they are first published,
                    and cannot therefore give to the world at large that perfect and entire
                    satisfaction which ought to be derived from genuine history; and hence more
                    durable and widely diffused monuments are still to be wished for. Such are
                    public buildings, inscriptions, and statues; but these, excepting a few
                    instances of the two last, are always confined to particular countries; and
                    medals alone remain as infallible documents of truth, capable of being diffused
                    throughout all/countries in the world, and of remaining to the latest ages.</p>
                <p>The first who showed the importance of medals in ascertaining the dates and
                    arranging the order of events in ancient history, was Vaillant, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Kings of Syria,</hi> printed at Paris in 1681. By
                    means of medals alone he has been enabled to fix the chronology and important
                    events in the history of the three most ancient kingdoms of the world; namely,
                    Egypt, Syria, and Parthia. Since his time there have been discovered many coins
                    which confirm the accounts he has given. He was followed in this method by
                    Father Hardouin, though with much less success. Hardouin’s best work is his <hi
                    rend="italic">Herodiades,</hi> or series of successors to Herod king of Judaea.
                    The same plan was pursued by Noris in his Treatise on the Syro-Macedonian
                    princes, and by Bayer in his History of Osrhoene, as well as by Froelich in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Annales Regum et Rerum</hi><hi rend="italic">Syriae,</hi>
                    Vienna, 1754, and Kevenhuller’s <hi rend="italic">Regum veterum

                    Corsini and Cary likewise published works of a similar nature; that of the
                    former appeared in 1744, under the title of <hi rend="italic">De Minni-</hi><hi

                <p>The study of the Greek coins does not show the dates of events, though it
                    illustrates the chronology of reigns. This defect, however, is abundantly
                    supplied by those of Rome, which commonly mark the date of the prince’s
                    consulship, and the year of his tribunician power; giving also, upon the
                    reverse, the representation or poetical symbol of some grand event. The year of
                    the tribunician power is sometimes imagined by antiquaries to be synonymous with
                    that of the emperor’s reign; but this is not the case; and Mr Pinkerton is at
                    some pains to. set them right in this respect. He finds fault with Julius
                    Caesar, when he assumed the sovereign authority, for taking upon him the title
                    of Perpetual Dictator, as being synonymous with that of king or absolute
                    governor, which the Romans abhorred. “He ought,” says our author, “under the
                    disguise of some supreme magistracy of annual election, to have lulled the
                    people with a dream that they might terminate his power when they pleased, or
                    that he himself would resign it when the necessities of state, which had
                    required his temporary elevation, had subsided.” To this error Mr Pinkerton
                    ascribes the assassination of the dictator, and commends the policy of Augustus,
                    who, with far inferior abilities, continued in possession of the most absolute
                    authority as long as he lived. The tribuneship was an office of annual election,
                    and, if put into the hands of any others than plebeians, must have been the
                    supreme power of the state, as it belonged to that office to put a negative upon
                    every public measure whatsoever. Augustus, being of senatorial rank, could not
                    assume this office; but he invested himself with the tribunician power, which
                    had the advantages of appearing to be only a temporary supremacy, though in
                    truth it was continued during his whole lifetime. Towards the end of his reign,
                    he frequently assumed his intended successor, Tiberius, as his colleague, though
                    in the beginning he had enjoyed it alone. This, with the artifice of resigning
                    his power every ten years, and re-assuming it at the desire, as was pretended,
                    of the senate, secured his sovereignty as long as he lived. His example was
                    followed by his successors; so that most of them have the inscription <hi
                    rend="italic">Tribunicia</hi><hi rend="italic">Potestate</hi> upon their medals,
                    with the date affixed to it; thus, <hi rend="italic">Tr. Pot.</hi> VII. Yet
                    though this date generally implies the year of the emperor’s reign, it sometimes
                    happens that the emperor, by special favour from a former prince, had been
                    endowed with this title before he came to the throne, as being the successor to
                    that prince; of which we have already given an instance in Tiberius. Besides the
                    tribunician power, the emperors very frequently enjoyed that of the consuls; and
                    the date of their consulship is frequently expressed in their coins.</p>
                <p>The office of Pontifex Maximus was likewise assumed by the Roman emperors, in
                    order to secure themselves in their authority; an artifice which, Mr Pinkerton
                    observes, was one of the most efficacious they could have fallen upon. “In the
                    Greek heroic times,” says he, “king and priest were carefully united in one
                    person; and when sovereigns arose in Denmark and Sweden, the same plan was
                    followed, as appears from Snorro and other writers. Nothing could lend more
                    security to the person of the monarch than an office of supreme sanctity, which
                    also confirmed his power by all the terrors of superstition. Even the Christian
                    system was afterwards debased by a mock alliance with government, though it be
                    clear from the whole New Testament that such an alliance is subversive of its
                    genuine institution, and the greatest of all its corruptions. But the Roman
                    Catholic clergy, in the dark ages, were the authors of ‘ no church, no king,’
                    for their own interest; whilst the Roman emperors only sought to strengthen
                    their power by the mystic awe of supérstition. The title of Pontifex Maximus was
                    so important, that it was retained even by the Christian emperors till the time
                    of Gratian. Its influence in the state was indeed prodigious. Cicero observes,
                    that to this office were subject temples, altars, penates, gods, houses, wealth,
                    and the fortune of the people.” That of augur is also borne by many emperors;
                    and its authority was such that, by the law of the twelve tables, no public
                    business could be transacted without a declaration from the augur concerning its
                    event. The proconsular power was also given to Augustus and the other emperors.
                    It conferred a direct authority over all the provinces, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205854" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5854-0464"/>implied that the emperor was
                    chief proconsul or governor of each and of all. Another special power assigned
                    to the emperors, but not occurring on coins, was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jus</hi><hi rend="italic">Relationis</hi><hi rend="italic">Tertiae,
                    Quartae,</hi> &amp;c. or the right of making three or four motions in the senate
                    on the same day, whilst the senators could only propose one.</p>
                <p>Hence it has been inferred that medals afford the most authentic documents of the
                    Roman history, in particular, that could have been invented by man. The
                    histories of Nerva and Trajan are much better elucidated by medals than by
                    authors; for the history of Suetonius ends with Domitian, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Historiae Augustae</hi><hi rend="italic">Scriptores</hi> begin
                    with Hadrian; so that the reigns of the two emperors just mentioned are almost
                    unknown, and Mr Pinkerton is surprised that none of the learned have attempted
                    to supply the defect. “Capitolinus,” says he, “in his life of Maximinus Junior,
                    is quite puzzled to know if Maximus and Pupicnus were two emperors, or two names
                    for the same. Fl ad he happened to consult any of those coins which bear Μ. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cl. Pupienus Maximus Aug.</hi> he would have seen at once that
                    Maximus was only another name for Pupienus.”</p>
                <p>Medals are useful in other sciences besides history. In geography, we find the
                    situation of towns determined by their vicinity to some noted river, mountain,
                    or other physical object. Thus, ΜΑΓΝΗΤΩΝ 2IΠTΛ0T shows that Magnesia is situated
                    under Mount Sipylus. In like manner, it is shown from a medal that Ephesus stood
                    on the river Cayster; and there is extant a medal bearing an inscription which
                    signifies Alexandria on the Scamander, a name given to Troy by Alexander the
                    Great. The reverse has upon it the famous Apollo Smintheus of Homer. In natural
                    history, also, medals are useful chiefly from the coins struck on the
                    celebration of the secular games, in which the figures of various animals are
                    preserved; and thus it may very often be determined whether any animal was known
                    to the ancients or not. On many of the Greek medals are several uncommon plants
                    and animals. Thus, on most of the medals of Cyrene is the figure of the
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Sy-phium</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and on those
                    of Tyre, the shell-fish from which the famous Tyrian purple was procured. By
                    means of medals, also, the exact delineations of many noble edifices are
                    preserved, though not even a vestige of their ruins be now in existence; so that
                    the uses of them to the architect are very considerable. To the connoisseur they
                    arc absolutely necessary; because by them alone he is enabled to ascribe
                    ancients busts and statues to their proper persons, with multitudes of other
                    points of knowledge which cannot be otherwise determined. 'The elucidations of
                    obscure passages in ancient authors, by means of medals, are so numerous and
                    well known that it is needless to insist upon them.</p>
                <p>Mr Addison has treated the connection between medals and poetry at considerable
                    length; but Mr Pinkerton finds fault with him for preferring the Latin to the
                    Greek poets. He observes, also, that the knowledge of Greek medals is most
                    necessary for a sculptor, and perhaps an architect; but an acquaintance with
                    Latin ones is preferable for a poet, or perhaps a painter. The reason of this
                    difference is, that the former generally have on the obverse the head of some
                    king, god, or goddess, of exquisite relief and workmanship; but the reverse
                    seldom exhibits much fancy of symbol in the early Greek coins, and in the
                    imperial Greek coins is chiefly impressed with the temples of their deities. To
                    a person of poetical imagination, however, the Roman coins afford the greatest
                    entertainment, from the fine personifications and symbols to be found on their
                    reverses. Of this the following are instances.</p>
                <p>Happiness has sometimes the caduceus or wand of Mercury, which, Cicero tells us,
                    was thought to procure every wish. She has, in a gold coin of Severus, heads of
                    poppy, <hi rend="superscript"> 4sλ</hi> *&gt;xoress that our prime happiness
                    consists in the oblivion of misfortune. Hope is represented as a sprightly girl,
                    walking quickly, and looking straight forward. With her left hand she gathers up
                    her garments, that they may not impede the rapidity of her pace; whilst in her
                    right hand she holds forth the bud of a flower, an emblem infinitely finer and
                    more poetical than the trite one of an anchor, which is the symbol of Patience,
                    and not of Hope. This personification, with some others, must have been very
                    familiar to the ancients; for often in this, and in a few more instances, no
                    name, as <hi rend="smallcaps">Spes Aug.</hi> or the like, is inserted in the
                    legend. Abundance is imagined as a sedate matron, with a cornuCopiae in her
                    hands, of which she scatters the fruits, and does not hold up her cornucopiae
                    and keep the contents to herself, as many modern poets and painters make her
                    do.</p>
                <p>The Emperor Titus having occasion to import a great supply of corn during a
                    scarcity at Rome, that supply, or the <hi rend="italic">Annona,</hi> is finely
                    represented as a sedate lady, with a filled cornucopiae in her left hand, which
                    she holdsupright, to indicate that sb.e does not, however, mean to scatter it,
                    as Abundance has a title to do, but to give it to Equity to deal out. This last
                    particular is shown by her holding a little image of Equity, who is known by her
                    scales, and <hi rend="italic">kasta pura,</hi> or pointless spear, in her right
                    hand, over a basket filled with wheat. Behind the <hi rend="italic">Annona</hi>
                    is the prow of a ship decked with flowers, to imply that the corn was brought by
                    sea (from Africa), and that the ships had had a prosperous voyage. The best poet
                    in the world could scarcely have given us a finer train of imagery; and the best
                    painter might have been puzzled to express so much matter in so small a
                    compass.</p>
                <p>Security stands leaning upon a pillar, indicative of her being free from all
                    designs and pursuits; and the posture itself corresponds to her name. Horace, in
                    describing the wise man, mentions his being <hi rend="italic">teres</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">atque rotundus,</hi> round and polished, against all the rules of
                    chance; an idea seemingly derived from the column upon which this ideal lady
                    reclines. The emblems of Piety, Modesty, and the like, arc equally apposite and
                    poetical.</p>
                <p>The happiness of the state is pictured by a ship sailing before a prosperous
                    breeze; an image than which the exquisite genius of Gray could find none more
                    appropriate, and he has accordingly used it in his principal production, The
                    Bard, with due success.</p>
                <p>The different countries of the then known world are also delineated with great
                    poetical imagery. It affords patriotic satisfaction, in particular, to a Briton,
                    to see his native island often represented upon the earliest imperial coins,
                    sitting on a globe, with a symbol of military power, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >labarum,</hi> in her hand, and the ocean rolling under her feet; an emblem
                    almost prophetic of the vast power which she was destined afterwards to obtain
                    by establishing her dominion over the sea.</p>
                <p>Coins also present us with Achaia, Africa, Alamannia, Alexandria, Arabia,
                    Armenia, Asia, Bithynia, Cappadocia, Dacia, Dardania, Egypt, Gallia, Hispania,
                    Italia, Judaea, Macedon, Mauritania, Pannonia, Parthia, Phrygia, Sarmatia.
                    Sicily, Scythia, Syria, and the rivers Danube, Nile, Rhine, Tiber. This
                    personification of provinces seems to have arisen from the figures of provinces
                    carried in triumphs; as the personification of our old poets sprung from the
                    ideal persons actually represented in the myste-rial plays. There is one
                    colonial medal, rudely executed, of Augustus and Agrippa, which has a high claim
                    to merit in displaying the ancient poetical imagery. It is inscribed <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Imp.</hi> and Dwi. F.; and on the reverse the conquest of Egypt
                    is represented by the metaphor of a crocodile, an animal almost peculiar to that
                    country, and at that period esteemed altogether so, which is chained to a palm
                    tree, at once a native of the country and a symbol of victory.</p>
                <p>As the reverses are so useful for knowledge of personification, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205867" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5867-0465"/>symbols of countries and
                    actions, and the like, so the portraits to be seen on old coins are no less
                    important to a painter, the high merit of a great number of them, in every
                    character, justly entitling them to be regarded as the best studies in the
                    world; not to mention that, to an historical painter, the science of ancient
                    medals is absolutely necessary, that he may delineate his personages with the
                    featureswhich they really bore whilst inexistence. This can only be attained in
                    the way here mentioned, or from statues and busts, any one of which will cost as
                    much as hundreds of medals; and indeed a collection of such is only attainable
                    by princes.</p>
                <p>The same circumstances which render the study of medals important to a painter,
                    do still more so to á sculptor; and, in this particular, the study of the Greek
                    coins is remarkably useful. The skill of the Greeks in the art of sculpture has
                    always been admired throughout the world; and on their coins the heads of
                    several deities are represented in the most exquisite <hi rend="italic">alto
                    relievo.</hi> Pinkerton, therefore, thinks it strange that the Grecian coins
                    should have hitherto been so little attended to by men of learning and taste.
                    They may have been looked upon, he supposes, as belonging only to the province
                    of the antiquary; but he assures us that the Greek medals will afford
                    satisfaction to the persons who value them only as pieces of workmanship. In
                    most respects they greatly excel those of Rome, even in its best times, which is
                    usually supposed to have been from the days of Augustus to Hadrian. In the days
                    of Hadrian, in particular, the Roman mint seems to have been the very seat of
                    art and genius; witness the vast number of exquisite personifications, engraved
                    with equal workmanship, which swarm on the medals of that prince. Yet from his
                    time down to Posthumus, coins of admirable workmanship are to be found. Those of
                    the Faustinas and Lucilla deserve particular mention. There is one, and not an
                    uncommon one, of the latter, in great brass, which yields to nothing of the
                    kind. The reverse is a Venus, with the name around her. The portrait of the
                    obverse seems to spring from the field of the coin; it looks and breathes, nay
                    talks, if you trust your eyes. The coins of Tarsus are, as Froelich observes,
                    extremely remarkable for a kind of perspective in the figures. On others are
                    found triumphal arches, temples, fountains, aqueducts, amphitheatres, circuses,
                    hippodromes, palaces, basilicas, columns and obelisks, baths, sea-ports,
                    pharoses, and the like. These furnish much pleasure and instruction to the
                    architect, and serve to form his taste to the ancient manner; that manner which
                    unites perfect simplicity with sublimity and grace, and which every age admires,
                    in proportion as it has genius to imitate.</p>
                <p>II.— <hi rend="italic">Entertainment arising from the Study of Medals.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the purposes which the study of medals answers in the useful arts, a
                    great variety of sources of entertainment are to be found in it. Mr Pinkerton
                    observes, thst the most barbarous nations are more pleased with the rudest
                    efforts of art than with the most admirable works of nature; and that in
                    proportion as the powers of the mind are large and various, such are also the
                    pleasures which it receives from those superlative productions of art, which can
                    only be the offspring of great genius. Hence works of art are agreeable both to
                    the enlightened and to the ignorant. The chief amusement, therefore, which
                    attends the study of medals, originates from the strength and spirit, the finish
                    and beauty, which the engraver has displayed in the execution of them. It
                    besides gives a kind of personal acquaintance with the individuals ofwhom they
                    are the representations. Portraits have always been highly entertaining to
                    mankind; and Pinkerton is of opinion that the love of them gave rise both to
                    painting and sculp ture. They are nowhere to be found so ancient, so numerous,
                    and so well preserved, as in medals. Amusement is also derived even from the
                    representations of ideal heads and persons; nay, even from the minutest symbols.
                    Thus the Greek coins of cities present us with heads of deities of exquisite
                    workmanship, apparently copied from statues or paintings; so that we may even
                    guess at the works of Apelles and Praxiteles from some of the Greek medals.
                    Their reverses exhibit still greater variety, there being scarcely an object
                    either in art or nature which is not represented upon some of them; and to the
                    satisfaction arising from a view of these we may likewise add that of beholding,
                    in a lively manner, the dresses, manners and customs, religious and civil
                    ceremonies, of the ancients; so that from medals we may obtain an interesting
                    history of manners, which, though but lately cultivated, may perhaps become the
                    most useful and entertaining of all the provinces of history.</p>
                <p>There is a very considerable difference between the study of medals and that of a
                    mere antiquary. The latter seems frequently to take delight in coins merely in
                    proportion to their rust and deformity; so that it is often a recommendation of
                    some of their pieces that neither portrait, reverse, nor legend can be
                    discovered, at least in such a manner as may be intelligibly explained. “The
                    delight of the antiquarist,” says'Mr Pinkerton, “may be called a depraved
                    appetite of the mind, which feeds on trash, and fills itselfwith emptiness. It
                    is perhaps a mere childish curiosity mingled with caprice and hypochondri-cism.
                    Against this character the ridicule of Severus is particularly shot, but with
                    little effect; for our antiquists exceed in visions and nonsense. I say <hi
                    rend="italic">antiquists,</hi> for the name of antiquary is sacred. By <hi
                    rend="italic">antiquary,</hi> in foreign countries, is implied a man who
                    illustrates their ancient laws, manners, poetry, but especially their ancient
                    history. There, men of the most elevated minds are antiquaries; as Muratori,
                    Leibnitz, Montesquieu, Dubos. Here, men of talents will not stoop, forsooth, to
                    studies the most important to their country, but leave its antiquities to
                    chance. Every thing is important but our history; and we are profound in every
                    ancient matter that is superficial, and superficial in what is profound. Even
                    England cannot boast of one general historian, but trusts to the inaccuracy of
                    Rapin and the ignorant neatness of Hume. It is therefore no wonder that the
                    study of antiquity is here ridiculous, though most important in other countries;
                    none requiring greater talents, learning, or industry. But the historic
                    antiquary has the pleasure of benefiting society, and enlightening whole
                    nations, while the medallic has only an innocent amusement. This amusement,
                    considered merely as arising from antiquarian objects, has not been explained,
                    though felt by most people, and more by the learned. It seems analogical with
                    that which we derive from an extensive prospect; for as the mind delights to
                    expand itself into distant places, so also into distant times. We connect
                    ourselves with these times, and feel as it were a double existence. The passions
                    are singularly affected by minute circumstances, though mute to generalities;
                    and the relics of antiquity impress us more than its general history.”</p>
                <p>HI.— <hi rend="italic">History of Medals.</hi></p>
                <p>The study of medals is not of very ancient date. None of the classical writers
                    gives any account of collections of them, though indeed many little particulars
                    are passed without notice by them. In the times of the Greeks, a collection of
                    such coins as then existed must have been but little regarded, as consisting
                    only of those struck by the numerous little states which at that time used the
                    Greek characters and language. Hence they would have <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205880" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5880-0466"/>had an air of domestic
                    coinage, and no attention would have been paid to them, however exquisite their
                    workmanship might have been. The little intercourse at that time carried on
                    between the different provinces, also, greatly impeded any communication of
                    knowledge to those who wrote histories; so that it is no wonder to find any
                    small collections which might then have existed altogether unnoticed by
                    them.</p>
                <p>Almost as soon as any communication was opened between the Greeks and Romans, the
                    latter treated the arts of the Greeks with all due respect and applause. Their
                    coins were imitated by the Romans, and preserved in cabinets by the senators
                    amongst their choicest treasures. Suetonius informs us, that on solemn occasions
                    Augustus was accustomed to present his friends with medals of foreign states and
                    princes, along with other valuable testimonies of his friendship. In a more
                    advanced period of the Roman empire, however, individuals would undoubtedly form
                    collections of coins peculiar to their own state; for Dr Stukeley, in his
                    Medallic History of Carausius, informs us that a complete series of silver coins
                    was lately found in Britain, containing all the emperors down to Carausius
                    inclusively. From Banduri we also learn that certain Greek coins were specially
                    preserved by the Romans; and it appears from their code, that ancient gold and
                    silver coins were made use of instead of gems, to which distinction those of
                    Sicily were particularly entitled. From the decline of the Roman empire until
                    towards the end of the fifth century, almost all branches of literature were
                    involved in darkness, and the science of medals amongst the rest. Whilst the
                    Christian dominion of Constantinople lasted, indeed, almost all the arts and
                    sciences may be said to have been confined within its boundaries, though the
                    Arabs and eastern nations had some arts and sciences of their own; but after the
                    destruction of the imperial city by the Turks, the Greeks were once more
                    compelled to become the fathers of European science. Even before this time,
                    indeed, some vestiges of a revival of literature had appeared in Italy; and so
                    intimate and necessary a connection has now the study of medals with that of
                    ancient erudition, that on the earliest appearance of a revival of the latter,
                    the former was also cultivated.</p>
                <p>The first amongst the moderns who began to study the science of medals was
                    Petrarch. Being desired by the emperor Charles IV. to compose a book containing
                    the lives of eminent men, and to place him in the list, he replied that he would
                    do so whenever the emperor’s life and conduct deserved it. In consequence of
                    this conversation, he afterwards sent the emperor a collection of gold and
                    silver coins bearing the representations of eminent men, with an address
                    suitable to his former declaration. A collection of coins was made in the next
                    age by Alphonse king of Aragon; but though this monarch collected all that could
                    be found throughout Italy, we know that there could not have been very many, as
                    the whole were contained in an ivory cabinet, and carried always about with him.
                    A very considerable collection was made by Anthony Cardinal St Mark, nephew to
                    Eugene IV. who ascended the pontifical chair in 14 <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>
                    31∙, and soon afterwards the grand museum at Florence was begun by Cosmo de’
                    Medici, where a collection of ancient coinsand medals had a place amongst other
                    curiosities. Corvinus king of Hungary about the same time formed a noble
                    collection of coins, along with ancient manuscripts and other valuable relics of
                    antiquity.</p>
                <p>Mr Pinkerton considers Agnolo Poliziano, more commonly known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Angélus</hi><hi rend="italic">Politianus,</hi> as the first writer
                    who produced medals as vouchers of ancient orthography and customs. He cites
                    different coins of the Medicean collection in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Miscellanea,</hi> written about the year 1490. By means of a cabinet of medals
                    which had been formed by Maximilian I. emperor of Germany, Joannes Hut-tichius
                    was enabled to publish a book of the lives of the emperors, enriched with their
                    portraits delineated from ancient coins. It is generally supposed that this
                    book, which appeared in 1525, was the first work of this kind; but Labbe, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic">Nummaria,</hi> mentions
                    another named <hi rend="italic">Illustrium</hi><hi rend="italic">Imagines,</hi>
                    by one Andreas Fulvius, printed in 1517, in which most of the portraits seem to
                    be from medals. About the year 1512, also, Guillaume Bude, a French author, had
                    written his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Asse,</hi>
                    though it was not printed till many years afterwards. Μ. Grollier, treasurer of
                    the French armies in Italy, during part of the sixteenth century, had a great
                    collection of coins of different kinds of metals. After his death his brass
                    medals were sent to Provence, and were about to be conveyed to Italy, when the
                    king of France, having got information of the transaction, gave orders to stop
                    them, and purchased the whole at a very high price, for his own cabinet of
                    antiquities. Μ, Grollier had an assortment of gold and silver as well as of
                    brass medals; but the cabinet in which they were contained fell, two centuries
                    afterwards, into the hands of Μ. l’Abbé de Bothelin, and was known to have been
                    that of Grollier, from some slips of paper, on which was his usual inscription
                    for his books, <hi rend="italic">Joannis Grollierii</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    amicoum.</hi> There are few countries, Italy excepted, in which a greater number
                    of coins have been found than in Britain; though we are by no means well
                    acquainted with the time when the study of them commenced. Mr Pinkerton suspects
                    that Camden was one of the first, if not the very first British author, who
                    produced medals in his works, and who must have had a small collection. Speed’s
                    Chronicle, published in the seventeenth century, was illustrated by means of
                    coins from Sir Robert Cotton’s cabinet.</p>
                <p>IV.— <hi rend="italic">Materials of which Medals are constructed.</hi></p>
                <p>Medals are formed of gold, silver, and the various modifications of copper. The
                    gold usually made use of in coinage is about the fineness of twenty-two carats;
                    and as the art of purifying this metal was very imperfectly known in former
                    times, the most ancient medals are for this reason much more impure than the
                    modern coins. Gold is never found in its native state above twenty-two carats
                    fine; and the very ancient medals are much under that standard. Many of them are
                    composed of a mixture of gold and silver, called by the ancients <hi
                    rend="italic">electrum.</hi> The gold medals were made of much finer metal after
                    Philip of Macedonia became possessed of the gold mines of Philippi in Thrace;
                    and the medals of his son Alexander the Great are equally fine, as well as those
                    of some other princes of that age. Those of the Egyptian Ptolemies are of the
                    fineness of twenty-three carats three grains, with only one grain of alloy. The
                    Roman coins are very pure even from the earliest times; the art of refining gold
                    having been well known before any was coined ∙at Rome. Some authors are of
                    opinion that the Roman coins begin to fall short of their purity after the time
                    of Titus; but Mr Pinkerton denies that any thing of this kind took place till
                    the time of the emperor Severus, and even then only in a very few instances.
                    Most of the Roman gold was brought from Dalmatia and Dacia, where that metal is
                    still to be met with.</p>
                <p>Pliny informs us, and indeed it is generally known, that gold and silver are
                    found mixed together in the earth. Where the silver amounted to one fifth part
                    of the gold, the metal was called <hi rend="italic">electrum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but sometimes the proportion of silver was added
                    artificially. The gold was in those days, as well as at present, refined by
                    means of mercury; and the ancient artists had certainly attained to great
                    perfection in this branch of metallurgy, as Bodin tells us that the goldsmiths
                    of Paris, upon melting one of Vespasian’s gold coins, found only <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> 11</hi> th part of alloy.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205893" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5893-0467"/>
                <p>Most of the ancient silver, particularly that of Greece, is less pure than that
                    of succeeding times; even the Roman silver is rather inferior to the present
                    standard, and that from the very beginning; but in the time of Severus the
                    silver appears to have been very bad, and it continued so until the tjme of
                    Diocletian. Many writers upon this subject have mistaken the <hi rend="italic"
                    >denarii acrei,</hi> coins of brass washed with silver, for silver currency.
                    Silver coins are extremely scarce from the time of Claudius Gothicus to that of
                    Diocletian, or from the year 270 to 284, in which short space not fewer than
                    eight emperors reigned. Silver at that time was found mostly in Spain, and the
                    commerce with that country was disturbed by the usurpers who arose in Gaul; and
                    such were the troubles of the times, that not only the silver, but also the gold
                    coins, of those emperors, are extremely scarce. There is still, however, some
                    silver extant of those eight emperors; and it is certain that copper washed was
                    never used as silver currency, but was entirely a distinct coinage. Occasional
                    depravations of silver had taken place long before, as Pliny tells us that Mark
                    Antony mixed iron with his silver denarii; and Mr Pinkerton informs us that he
                    had seen a denarius of Antony which was attracted by a magnet.</p>
                <p>The ancient brass coins consist of two kinds; the red or Cyprian, which indeed is
                    no other than copper; and the common yellow brass. Our author observes that, in
                    the Roman coinage, brass was of double the value of copper, and he is of opinion
                    that it was the same amongst the Greeks; but the latter is the metal most
                    commonly made use of in the Greek coinage. The Roman sertertii were always of
                    brass, the middling-sized kind are partly copper and partly brass; the former
                    being double the value of the latter, which are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >asses.</hi></p>
                <p>Mr Pinkerton next proceeds to give an account of the mixed metals used amongst
                    the Romans. In Britain, all kinds of coins made of mixed metal are without
                    hesitation alleged to be forgeries; although it is certain that the variety of
                    mixed metals used in coinage was very considerable. The most valuable mixture
                    was that of gold and silver, already mentioned under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">electrum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the silver commonly
                    amounting to one fifth part of the gold made use of, or perhaps more. Of this
                    mixture are many of the early coins of Lydia, and some other Asiatic states;
                    also those of the kings of the Bosphorus Cimmerius during the imperial ages of
                    Rome. Next to the electrum were the coins of Corinthian brass; but Mr Pinkerton
                    informs us that not a single coin was ever struck of this metal by the ancients,
                    it having been constantly employed only in the fabrication of vases or toys. It
                    was in use, at any rate, only for a very short time, being altogether unknown in
                    the days of Pliny the Elder. This author therefore ridicules those who pretend
                    not only to find out imperial coins of this metal, but to discover three kinds
                    of it, viz. one in which the gold predominates, another in which the silver
                    prevails, and a third where the brass is most conspicuous. He gives Aeneas Vico
                    one of the most ancient writers on medals, as the author of this idea, but whose
                    opinions were confuted by one Savot, a writer in the seventeenth century.
                    Vicomentions a coin of this kind struck under Augustus, another of Livia, and a
                    third of Claudius. The mistake, he is of opinion, arose from the circumstance of
                    the first propagator not being able to account for the various mixtures and
                    modifications of brass observable in ancient coins of the large size, and which
                    in so common a metal appear very odd to the moderns. Besides the authority of
                    Pliny and other antiquaries of a more modern date, who all declare that they
                    never saw a single medal of Corinthian brass, or of that metal mixed with silver
                    and gold, Pinkerton produces another evidence, which he looks upon as superior
                    to either, viz. that those who have given in to this supposition imagine that
                    the large pieces called <hi rend="italic">sertertii,</hi> and others called <hi
                    rend="italic">dupondiarii,</hi> worth about twopence or a penny, are said to
                    have been composed of this precious metal. But it is unreasonable to think that
                    any portion of gold or silver could have been made use of in these. The coins
                    said to have been struck upon Corinthian brass are only done upon a modification
                    of common brass, in regard to which we know, that in proportion to the quantity
                    of zinc made use of in conjunction with the copper, the metal assumes a variety
                    of hues. On the authority of Pliny, he informs us that the coins mistaken for
                    Corinthian brass were no other than prince’s metal.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian silver coins struck under the Roman emperors are at first of
                    tolerably pure silver, but afterwards degenerate into a mixture of copper and
                    tin with a little silver. They are very thick, but many of them are elegantly
                    struck, with uncommon reverses. There are likewise three sets of brass coins
                    belonging to this country from the earliest times of the Roman emperors. Some of
                    these are of bellmetal or pot-metal; but after the time of Gallienus and
                    Valerian, the coinage of brass with a small addition of silver became authorized
                    by the state, the coins struck upon it being called <hi rend="italic">denarii
                    acrei.</hi> Those of lead or copper plated with silver have been fabricated by
                    Roman forgers. Some coins of lead, however, have been met with of undoubted
                    antiquity; and an ancient writer informs us that tin money was coined by
                    Dionysius; but none has been found. The lead coins of Tigranes, king of Armenia,
                    mentioned as genuine by Jobert, are accounted forgeries by Mr Pinkerton and
                    other modern medallists. Plautus, however, makes mention of leaden coins, and
                    several of them have been found; but Pinkerton looks upon them as having been
                    chiefly essay pieces, struck in order to let the artist judge of the progress of
                    the die. Others are the plated kind already mentioned, fabricated by ancient
                    forgers, but having the plating worn off. A great number of leaden coins are
                    mentioned by Fricoini, in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Piombi Antichi,</hi>
                    in which he supposes them to have served as tickets for guests; and coins of the
                    same kind are also mentioned by Passeri. In the work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notitia</hi><hi rend="italic">Imperii Fomani,</hi> there is mention made of
                    coins of leather; but none of them has ever been found.</p>
                <p>V.— <hi rend="italic">Of Ancient Money.</hi></p>
                <p>In considering the different sizes, values, &amp;c. of the Greek and Roman coins,
                    Mr Pinkerton treats of the medals as money; a knowledge of which, he says, is
                    essentially necessary to every reader of the classics, insomuch that it may
                    almost dispute the preference with the studies of ancient geography and
                    chronology. Notwithstanding all that has been written upon the subject, however,
                    the same writer is of opinion that the science is still in its infancy, in as
                    far as it relates to the real money of the ancients. “The ideal,” says he,
                    “which is indeed the most important province of discussion, has been pretty
                    clearly ascertained; and we are almost as well acquainted with the Attic <hi
                    rend="italic">mna</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mina,</hi> and the perplexing
                    progress of the Roman <hi rend="italic">sestertia,</hi> as with our own <hi
                    rend="italic">pounds.</hi> But with the actual coin of the ancients the case is
                    different; and the ignorance of the learned even in this point is
                    wonderful.”</p>
                <p>He then proceeds, with very great asperity of language, to particularize the
                    ignorant manner in which modern authors have treated the subject of medals.
                    “Arbuthnot and Clarke,” says he, “are, if possible, more ignorant of medals than
                    Budaeus, the very first. The latter professes his love of medals, but quotes a
                    consular coin with the head of Cicero; and looks upon one of the thirty pieces
                    of silver, the reward of the treachery of Judas, and which was said to be
                    preserved among some relics at Paris, to be worthy of reference and
                    commemoration. Arbuthnot, if we may judge from his book, had never seen any
                    ancient coins; <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205906" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5906-0468"
                    />and Clarke, it is well known, was quite ignorant of them. The latter, with all
                    his labour, seems even to have known nothing of the theoretic part of the real
                    ancient money. Indeed, Dr Mead’s catalogue seems to have been almost the only
                    book on medals which had undergone his perusal. On the other hand, the ignorance
                    of medallists on this score is no less profound. To this day they look upon the
                    <hi rend="italic">didrachms</hi> of Aegina, so celebrated in antiquity, as <hi
                    rend="italic">tridrachms</hi> of Aegium; and upon the early obolus as a brass
                    coin. In the Roman class the large brass is esteemed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >as,</hi> while it shall be proved that it is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sestertius,</hi> and worth four <hi rend="italic">asses.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">denarius</hi> is reckoned at ten asses, even in the imperial
                    times, whereas it only went at that rate for the first ninety years after the
                    coinage of silver at Rome. The denarius acreus is taken for silver currency;
                    with' other mistakes, which evince that medallists are as ignorant of the theory
                    as the others are of the practice.”</p>
                <p>In his account of the ancient Greek money, Mr Pinkerton observes, that the light
                    of science, like that of the sun, has proceeded from the east to the west. “It
                    is most probable,” says he, “that the first invention of money arose like the
                    other arts and sciences, and spread from thence into the western parts of the
                    world. In its first shape it appeared as mere pieces of metal, without any
                    stated form or impression, in lieu of which it was regulated by weight. Even
                    down to the Saxon government in England, large sums were regulated by weight;
                    and in our own times every single piece is weighed in gold; though with regard
                    to silver this nicety is not minded, nor indeed does it seem practicable.
                    Amongst the ancients, whose commercial transactions were less important and
                    extensive than those of the moderns, silver was weighed as well as gold; nay
                    even brass in some cases.”</p>
                <p>In Greece, small sums were determined by <hi rend="italic">mnae</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">minae,</hi> and large sums by <hi rend="italic">talents.</hi> In
                    every country the mina is supposed to have contained a hundred drachmae or small
                    silver coins of that country, and the talent sixty minae. The mina is supposed
                    to be a pound weight of the country to which it belonged. The Attic pound,
                    according to Dr Arbuthnot, contained sixteen ounces, equal to our avoirdupois
                    pound; but Mr Pinkerton looks upon this as a very absurd opinion, and accuses
                    the doctor of having adopted it merely that he might explain a passage in Livy.
                    He is of opinion that the Attic pound is very nearly the same with the pound
                    Troy. The mina of Athens had at first only seventy-three drachms; but by Solon
                    it was fixed at a hundred. The ancient drachm weighed the same which it does at
                    present in medical weight, viz. the eighth part of an ounce. The mina or pound
                    of twelve ounces had consequently ninety-six of these drachms; but four of them
                    were given to the round sum to supply defects in the alloy, in consequence of a
                    practice common in all ages and in all countries, of giving some addition to a
                    large weight. Thus the pound in weight had but ninety-six drachmae in fact,
                    whilst the pound in tale had a hundred; as the Roman libra in weight had but
                    eighty-four denarii, in tale a hundred and eight; and as our pound in tale, by
                    an inverse progress, is not a third of our pound in common weight.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the severe criticism on Dr Arbuthnot just mentioned, however, we
                    find Pinkerton adopting his account of the <hi rend="italic">talents</hi> used
                    in coinage in several countries. Thus, according to the doctor,</p>
                <p>The Syrian talent contained 15 Attic minae.</p>
                <p>Ptolemaic</p>
                <p>Antiochian GO</p>
                <p>Euboean</p>
                <p>Babylonian 70</p>
                <p>Larger Attic 80</p>
                <p>Tyrian 80</p>
                <p>Egyptian 80</p>
                <p>The Aeginean 100 Attic minae.</p>
                <p>Rhodian 100</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the concession made here by Mr Pinkerton to the doctor, he tells
                    us that he very much questions this list of talents, and that many ancient
                    writers are little to be relied upon. Writers on this subject confess that the
                    numbers in all ancient manuscripts are the parts most subject to error, as being
                    almost always contracted. They ought to allow that the authors themselves must
                    often be liable to wrong information.</p>
                <p>“Herodotus mentions that King Darius ordered gold to be paid into his treasury by
                    the Euboic talent, and silver by the Babylonian. The Euboic is esteemed the same
                    with that called afterwards the Attic; and as we estimate gold by carats, so it
                    is natural to suppose that the most precious metal would be regulated by the
                    most minute weight. But I confess I take the Babylonie talent to be the same
                    with that of Aegina. Mr Raper has proved the first coins of Macedon to be upon
                    the standard of Aegina. Now the early Persian coins are upon that very scale,
                    the largest tetradrachms weighing from 430 to 440 grains. Hence it follows that
                    the Persian silver coins were of the Aeginean standard, and the payment was
                    certainly to be made according to the standard of the money. The larger Attic
                    talent was of 80 lesser minae, because the larger Attic mina was of 16 ounces.
                    The Alexandrian talent, according to Festus, consisted of 12,000 denarii, being
                    the same with that used by the Egyptian kings in their coins; and it is shown by
                    Mr Raper to have been the same with the talent of Aegina. Perhaps the whole of
                    the ancient coins of Asia, Africa, Greece, Magna Graecia, and Sicily, are
                    reducible to three talents or standards: 1. That of Aegina, used in most of the
                    more ancient silver coinages, as would seem in even the later of Egypt,
                    Carthage, Cyrene, &amp;c.; 2. the Attic (being the Asiatic gold standard,
                    afterwards used by Phidon king of Argos in estimating gold, and called Euboic
                    from Euboea, one of the quarters of the city of Argos), used in Athens and the
                    greater part of the world as the standard both of gold and silver; 3. the Doric
                    or Sicilian talent of twenty-four nummi, each worth an obolus and a half, whence
                    the talent is estimated at six Attic drachms, or three darics. These weights
                    continued to be the standard of money after it began to be distinguished by
                    impression; nay, until the fall of Greece and prevalence of the Roman empire.”
                    Thus far Mr Pinkerton.</p>
                <p>Coinage, according to Herodotus, was first invented by the Lydians, from whom the
                    Greeks quickly received it. The former could not have received it from the
                    Persians, whose empire did not begin till 570 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>,
                    though our author supposes that it might have proceeded from the Syrians, who
                    carried on commerce in very ancient times. The most ancient Greek coins of
                    silver have an indented mark upon one side, and a tortoise upon the other; and
                    those of the greatest antiquity have no letters upon them. Those of later date
                    have AIΓI marked upon them, which medallists interpret of Aegium in Achaia;
                    being led into that supposition by the tortoise, which they look upon as a sure
                    mark of the Peloponnesus. But though Pinkerton agrees that the tortoise was so,
                    he thinks that they are otherwise very far wrong in their conclusions. Aegium in
                    Achaia was a place of no consequence till the times of Aratus and the Achaean
                    league; but there are eleven of these coins in Dr Hunter’s cabinet which show
                    that they must have been struck in times of the most remote antiquity, and that
                    the place where they were struck was rich and flourishing at the time. The coins
                    we speak of are not common; but those which have the name AIΓEI∩N at full
                    length, and which may perhaps belong to Aegium in Achaia, are extremely scarce;
                    insomuch that in all Dr Hunter’s vast collection there are not above one or two.
                    They are likewise constructed upon a scale quite different <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205919" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5919-0469"/>from all other Grecian money,
                    being of 8,13, 15½, 90, and about 186 grains. The Grecian drachma at an average
                    is 66 grains; and Mr Pinkerton thinks it would have been strange if pieces had
                    been struck of eight tenths of an obolus, of an obolus and a half, or of a
                    drachma and a half. Aegium being originally an obscure village, could not be the
                    first which coined money; so that Mr Pinkerton supposes the name AIΓI to have
                    stood for Aegialus, the ancient name of Sicyon, a wealthy and powerful city; or
                    rather Aegina, the mint of which was much celebrated, and perhaps the most
                    ancient in Greece.</p>
                <p>Other arguments in favour of these coins being derived from Aegina, are drawn
                    from their weight as well as their workmanship, which are quite different from
                    those bearing the name of Aegium at full length. The coinage of Aegina is known
                    to have been different from that of the rest of Greece; insomuch that its
                    drachma was worth ten Attic oboli, whilst the Attic drachma was valued only at
                    six. Hence the drachmas of Aegina were named by the Greeks <hi rend="italic"
                    >πακsιαι,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">thick</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a name
                    very applicable to the coins in question. From these observations, Pinkerton is
                    of opinion that we may even distinguish the precise weight of the ancient coins
                    of Aegina. According to the exact proportion, the drachma of this place should
                    weigh exactly a hundred grains; and one of them very much rubbed weighed above
                    ninety. The others of larger size, which seem to be didrachms of Aegina, weigh
                    from a hundred and eighty-one to a hundred and ninety-four grains; but the
                    latter being the only one he could meet with in good preservation, it was
                    impossible to form any just medium. Even in those which are best preserved, he
                    thinks that ten grains maybe allowed for a waste of the metal in so long a time
                    as 2400 years, which would bring the drachma of Aegina near its proper standard.
                    The obolus of Aegina was in proportion to its drachma of six oboli. It is the
                    piece of fifteen and a half grains, and thirteen when very much rubbed. The
                    hemiobolion is that of eight, but when rubbed it falls short of this weight.</p>
                <p>The general denomination of the Greek money is the drachma, or eighth part of an
                    ounce, which to this day is retained in the medical weights; the Grecian coins
                    receiving the names they bore from their weights, though in some instances the
                    weights received their appellations from the coins. The silver drachma,
                    according to Mr Pinkerton, was about ninepeuce sterling; and he finds fault with
                    those who make the drachma and denarius both equal to one another, the latter
                    being no more than cightpence. The didrachm of silver, according to the same
                    calculation, was worth 18d.; but the tridrachm occurs very rarely, and Mr
                    Pinkerton is even of opinion that medallists give this name to the didrachm of
                    Aegina. The largest of all the Grecian coins is the tetradrachm, which on the
                    Aeginean standard is worth five shillings, but in those of the other states only
                    four. There arc, however, many subdivisions in the silver drachma, the highest
                    of which is the tetraobolion or coin of four oboli; being in proportion to the
                    drachma as our groat to a sixpence, weighing about forty-four grains, and being
                    in value about sixpence. The hemidrachm or triobolion comes next in value,
                    weighing about thirty-three grains, and worth fourpence halfpenny. The silver
                    dioholion, or third of the drachma, weighs about twenty-two grains, and is worth
                    threepence. The obolus of silver weighs about eleven grains, and is worth only
                    three halfpence. There is likewise a hemiobolion in silver, or half the obolus,
                    of five grains and a half, value three farthings; and another called <hi
                    rend="italic">tetraobolicm dichalcos,</hi> or quarter obolus, which is the most
                    minute coin yet met with, and, by. reason of its extreme smallness, weighing
                    only two grains and a quarter, is now very scarce. There is one of these in the
                    cabinet of Dr Hunter, and some more were brought from Athens by Mr Stuart.
                    Several have been occasionally met with at Tarentum. It would appear, however,
                    that there were some still smaller, and of value only three fourths of a
                    farthing. None of these have been met with; and the smallness of the size
                    renders it improbable that any will ever be met with, as the peasants, who
                    commonly discover coins, would probably either not observe them at all, or, if
                    they did, would neglect them as things of no value.</p>
                <p>Many different names have been imposed on the coins belonging to the different
                    states of Greece. Thus <hi rend="italic">κοgη, the maiden,</hi> was a name often
                    applied to the tetradrachm, and which would seem to apply to those ofAthens;
                    though there are coins of other cities with the head of Proserpine, and the word
                    <hi rend="italic">κο%η,</hi> to which it would appear more applicable in our
                    author’s opinion. <hi rend="italic">Xtaωνη, the shell,</hi> was the name of
                    another coin, from its type. A Sicilian coin was named <hi rend="italic"
                    >δεμαoετιον,</hi> from Gelon’s wife. A tetradrachm was named <hi rend="italic"
                    >κζαπαταγους,</hi> and had eight <hi rend="italic">ευ0ειας</hi> or hemidrachms.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Υζοισηνιον,</hi> so called from its country Troizene, had
                    Pallas on one side and a trident on the reverse. The hemiobolion was the <hi
                    rend="italic">τtεKανοζ</hi> of Lacedaemon; and the κoλλuCoς is supposed to have
                    been equal to the Roman sestertius or quarter drachma. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >cystophori</hi> were coins with the mystic chest or hamper of Bacchus upon
                    them, out of which a serpent rises; they were much celebrated in antiquity. We
                    are told by Livy, that Marcus Acilius, in his triumph over Antiochus and the
                    Aetolians,carried off 248,000 of them; that Cneius Manlius Vulso, in that over
                    Gallo-Graecia, had 250,000; and that Lucius Emilius Regillus, in his naval
                    triumph over the fleets of Antiochus, had 131,300. Cicero likewise mentions his
                    being possessed of a vast sum in them. The most probable opinion concerning them
                    seems to be, that they were all silver tetradrachms, such as belonged to the
                    cities of Apamea and Laodicea in Phrygia, Pergamus in Mysia, Sardis and Tralles
                    in Lydia, and Ephesus; but it is a mistake to ascribe any to Crete. Mr Pinkerton
                    thinks it absurd to imagine that Crete, a small island, should strike such vast
                    numbers of coins, though Cicero mentions his being in possession of an immense
                    treasure in them at the time when he was governor of Asia Minor. “It is most
                    likely,” says Mr Pinkerton, “chat his wealth should be in the coin of the
                    country to which he belonged. What had these triumphs of Cicero’s government
                    to’do with Cretan money? But indeed the coins themselves, as above noticed,
                    establish the fact.”</p>
                <p>Another set of coins famous in antiquity were those of Cyzicus in Mysia, which
                    were of gold; but they have now almost entirely vanished, by being recoined in
                    other forms. The <hi rend="italic">'A,^ιανδικον νομισμα,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">money of Aryandes,</hi> who was made governor of Egypt by
                    Cambyses, is mentioned by Hesychius; but none of them, as far as is known, have
                    reached our times. They must have been marked wnth Persian characters, if with
                    any. The coin of Queen Phi-listis is mentioned by the same writer, and many of
                    these pieces are still extant; but we know not where this queen reigned, nor
                    does there seem to be any method of finding it out. Mr Pinkerton inclines to
                    believe that she presided over Sicily; and, as a confirmation of that
                    supposition, mentions some inscriptions of ΒΑΣΙΛΙΣΣΑΣ ΦIΛIΣTIΔOΣ on the <hi
                    rend="italic">gradini</hi> of the thqatre at Syracuse, but which appear not
                    older than the Roman times. Some authors are of opinion that she reigned in
                    Cossara or Malta, and this is considered as much more improbable.</p>
                <p>The most particular attention with regard to the names and standard of coins is
                    due to those of Athens, and it is remarkable that most of them which have
                    reached us are of a very late period, with the names of magistrates inscribed
                    upon them. Some of these bear the name of Mithridates, and few are older than
                    the era of that prince, who, it is well known, took the city of Athens in his
                    war with the Romans. “I suspect,” says Mr Pinkerton, “that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205932" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5932-0470"/>no Athenian coins of silver
                    are posterior to Sylla’s infamous destruction of that city; an event the more
                    remarkable, as Sallust tell us that Sylla was learned in Greek.” Indeed
                    Caligula, Nero, and most of the pests of society, were learned men, in spite of
                    a well-known axiom of Ovid. It is still more remarkable that the fabric of
                    Athenian coins is almost universally very rude; a singular circumstance, if we
                    reflect how much the arts flourished there. It can only be accounted for from
                    the excellence of their artists being such as to occasion all the good ones to
                    be called into other countries, and none but the bad left at home. In like
                    manner, the coins struck at Rome in the imperial times are excellent, as being
                    done by the best Greek artists; whilst those of Greece, though famous at that
                    time for producing unrivalled artists, are during that period commonly of very
                    mean execution. The opulence of Athens in her days of glory was very great,
                    owing in an eminent degree to her rich commerce with the kingdoms on the Euxine
                    Sea, carried on chiefly from Delos, which belonged to Athens, and was the grand
                    centre of that trade. Hence it has become matter of surprise to Neumann, that
                    when there are so many coins of Mycene, an island even proverbially poor, there
                    should be none of Delos. But Mr Pinkerton accounts for this from Mycene being a
                    free state, and Delos subject to Athens. “It may be well supposed,” says he,
                    “that Athens had a mint at Delos; and such Athenian coins as have symbols of
                    Apollo, Diana, or Latona, were struck in this island.”</p>
                <p>The copper money of the Greeks is next in antiquity to the silver. Mr Pinkerton
                    is of opinion that it was not used at Athens till the 26th year of the
                    Peloponnesian war; about 404 years before Christ, and 300 after silver was first
                    coined there. The first copper coins were those of Gelo of Syracuse, about 490
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> The chalcos of brass, of which eight went to the
                    silver obolus, seems to have been the first kind of Greek coin. At first it was
                    looked upon as of so little consequence, that it became proverbial; and to say
                    that a thing was not worth a <hi rend="italic">chalcos,</hi> was equivalent to
                    saying that it was worth nothing. As the Greeks became poor, however, even this
                    diminutive coin was subdivided into two, four, nay eight λππτα or small coins;
                    but Pinkerton censures very severely those who have given an account of those
                    divisions. “Pollux, and Suidas copying from him,” says he, “tell us that there
                    were seven lepta to one chalcos; a number the most unlikely that can be, from
                    its indivisibility and incapacity of proportion. Pollux lived in the time of
                    Commodus, so was too late to be of the smallest authority; Suidas is four or
                    five centuries later, and out of the question. Pliny tells us that there were
                    ten chalci to the obolus, Diodorus and Cleopatra that there were six, Isidorus
                    says there were four; and if such writers differ about the larger denomination,
                    we may well imagine that the smaller equally varied in different states; an idea
                    supported by these undeniable witnesses, the coins which remain. Most of the
                    Greek copper coin which has reached our times consists of chaici, the lepta
                    being so small as to be much more liable to be lost.” In Dr Hunter’s cabinet,
                    however, there are several of the dilepta of Athens, and, from being stamped
                    with the representation of two owls, seem to be the same with the silver
                    diobolus; “a circumstance,” says Mr Pinkerton, “of itself sufficient to confute
                    Pollux; for a dilepton can form no part of seven, a number indeed which never
                    appeared in any coinage of the same metals, and is contradictory to common
                    sense. It may be observed, that the whole brass coins of Athens published by Dr
                    Combe are reducible to four sizes, which may be the <hi rend="italic">lepton,
                    dilepton, tetralepton</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hemichalcos,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">chalcos.</hi> The first is not above the size of one of King James
                    I.’s farthing tokens, the last about that of our common farthing.” The lepta was
                    also called ϰ <hi rend="italic">ε</hi><hi rend="italic">ϑ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >μα,</hi> as being change for the poor. The ϰ <hi rend="italic">ιδαφος,</hi>
                    perhaps so called from the figure of a wolf upon it, was the coin of a
                    particular state, and, if of brass, must have weighed three chalci. The other
                    names of the copper coins of Greece are but little known. Lycurgus ordered iron
                    money to be coined at Sparta; but so perishable is this metal that none of that
                    kind of money has reached our times.</p>
                <p>After the conquest of Greece by the Romans, most of the coins of that country
                    diminished very much in their value, the gold coinage being totally
                    discontinued, though some of the barbarous kings who used the Greek character
                    were permitted to coin gold; but they used the Roman model; and the standard
                    used by the few cities in Asia who spoke the Greek language in the times of the
                    emperors is entirely unknown. Copper seems to have been the only metal coined at
                    that time by the Greeks themselves; and that was done upon the Roman standard,
                    then universal through the empire, that there might be no impediment to the
                    circulation of currency. They retained, however, some of their own terms, using
                    them along with those of the Romans. The <hi rend="italic">assarion</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">assarium</hi> of Rome, the name of the diminished <hi
                    rend="italic">as,</hi> being sixteen to the drachma or denarius, the obolus was
                    so much diminished in value as to be struck in brass not much larger than the
                    old chalcos, and valued at between two and three assaria, which was indeed its
                    ahcientrate as to the drachma. This appears from the copper coins of Chios,
                    which have their names marked upon them. The brass obo!us, at first equal in
                    size to the Roman sestertius or large brass, lessens by degrees to about the
                    size of a silver drachma. From the badness of the imperial coinage in Greece,
                    also, it appears that brass was very scarce in that country, as well as in all
                    the cities using the Greek characters, being found mostly in the western
                    countries of the Roman empire. The time of this declension in size of the Greek
                    coins is by Mr Pinkerton supposed to have been from Augustus down to Gallienus.
                    He is of opinion, however, that the copper obolus, at first above the size of
                    large brass, was used in Greece about the time of its first subjection to Rome;
                    and that the lepta ceasing, the chalci came in their stead, with the dichalcus
                    and the hemiobolion of brass.</p>
                <p>With respect to the gold coins of the Greeks, Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that
                    none of that metal were coined before the time of Philip of Macedon, as none
                    have reached our times prior to the reign of that monarch. From a passage in
                    Thucydides, our author concludes that, in the beginning of the Peloponnesian
                    war, the Athenians had no gold coin. Speaking of the treasure in the Acropolis
                    or citadel of Athens, at the commencement of that war, the historian mentions
                    silver coin, and gold and silver in bullion; and had any of the gold been in
                    coin, he would certainly have mentioned it. Philip began his reign about
                    sixty-eight years after the beginning of the Peloponnesian war; and we can
                    scarcely suppose that any city would have preceded the elegant and wealthy
                    Athens in coining gold.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding, however, this deficiency of gold coin amongst the Greeks, it is
                    certain that the coinage of gold had taken place in Sicily long before; as we
                    have gold coins of Gelo about 491 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> of Hiero I.
                    478, and of Dionysius I. in 404, all using the Greek characters, though not to
                    be ranked amongst the gold coins of Greece, as Philip caused his to be. Gold
                    coins of Syracuse even appear of the third class of antiquity, or with an
                    indented square, and a small figure in one of its segments. Gold coins were used
                    in the cities of Brettium, Tarentum, and throughout Magna Graecia; also in
                    Panticapaea in Thrace, and likewise Cosa in that country; but not in Tuscany, as
                    is commonly believed, though Neumann proves that they were struck by Brutus, and
                    are unquestionably as ancient as the Greek coins. The Thebans and Athenians
                    probably coined the first gold after Philip had set them the example, and when
                    they were attempting to resist the projects<pb break="no" facs="nls:194205945"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5945-0471"/> of that enterprising monarch. The Aetolians
                    probably coined their gold during the time of their greatest power, about a
                    century after Philip, and when they were combating the power of Aratus and the
                    Achaean league. There is only one <hi rend="italic">ημιχουσος</hi> of Thebes,
                    much worn, in Dr Hunter’s cabinet, and weighing fifty-nine grains; and perhaps
                    not above two or three <hi rend="italic">χζpσοι</hi> or gold didrachms of Athens
                    in the world, one of which is also in the collection of Dr Hunter, and weighs
                    132⅜ grains. It appears to be more modern than the reign of Philip. That monarch
                    having got possession of the mines of Philippi in Thrace, improved them so much
                    that they produced him annually above a thousand talents of gold, or L.2,880,000
                    of our money. From this gold were struck the first coins, named from the
                    monarch, <hi rend="italic">Philippi.</hi> They were marked with his portrait,
                    and for many ages afterwards were so numerous that they were common in the Roman
                    empire; whence the name <hi rend="italic">Philippi</hi> became at length common
                    to gold, silver, and at last even to brass coins of their size. In the time of
                    Philip, gold was very scarce in Greece; but after the Phocians had plundered the
                    temple of Delphi, this precious metal, which had been valued as gems, and
                    consecrated only to the decoration of the temples of the gods, began to be known
                    amongst the Greeks. The comparative value of gold and silver, however, seems to
                    have been at that time very different from what it is now. Herodotus values gold
                    at thirteen times its weight in silver; Plato, in his Hipparchus, at twelve; and
                    even the low value of ten to one seems to have been the stated estimation in
                    Greece, though in Rome the plenty of silver from the Spanish mines made the
                    value of gold to be much higher; and there is no reason to think that it was
                    ever valued in that city at less than twelve times its weight in silver. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Philippus,</hi><hi rend="italic">χξυσoς,</hi> gold piece, or <hi
                    rend="italic">stater,</hi> is a didrachm, and is the most common of all the
                    ancient coins. Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that it went for twenty silver drachms
                    on its first appearance, but in later times for twenty-five Greek drachmae or
                    Roman denarii. There are proofs of the Philippi being didrachms, both from the
                    writings of ancient authors and from numbers of the coins themselves, which
                    remain to this day; and that the <hi rend="italic">χξpσος,</hi> or principal
                    gold coin of Greece, was of the same weight, is also evident from ancient
                    writings. It was anciently worth about 15s.; but, valuing gold now at the medium
                    price of L.4 per ounce, it is worth about 20s. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >ημιχζμσος,</hi> or half the former coin, scarcely occurs of the coinage of
                    Philip and Alexander, though it does of Hiero I. of Syracuse and of King
                    Pyrrhus. It passed for ten silver drachmas, and was valued only at 7s. 6d.
                    though now worth 10s. Another division of this kind might be worth about 5s.
                    There were besides some lesser divisions of gold coins, which could not be worth
                    above two drachmas. These were coined in Cyrene; and there were besides several
                    old gold coins of Asia Minor, the value of which is now unknown. Mr Pinkerton
                    supposes that they were coined not with relation to their weight as parts of the
                    drachma, but merely to make them correspond with as many silver pieces as were
                    necessary. There are also larger coins than the <hi rend="italic">χζoσος,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">διχζυσος</hi> of Alexander and Lysimachus being double its
                    value. Some others are met with of Lysimachus, Antiochus III. and some of the
                    Egyptian monarchs, weighing four times the <hi rend="italic">χξpσος,</hi> and
                    now worth about L.4 sterling. Some weigh even more; but this is supposed to be
                    owing to a difference in the purity of the gold.</p>
                <p>In Rome, as well a <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> s in Greece, the money was at
                    first estimated by weight; and the first metal coined by that people was copper,
                    silver being long unknown in Rome; nor is it certainly known that any silver has
                    ever been found in the Italian mines. In Rome the first valuation of money was
                    by the <hi rend="italic">libra gravis aeris,</hi> or pound of heavy brass; and
                    in the progress of their conquests, the little sil ver and gold that came in
                    their way was regulated by the same standard, as appears from the story of
                    Brennus. The weights made use of were the same with those which continue to this
                    day. The pound consisted of twelve ounces, of 458 grains each; but the pound by
                    which the money was weighed appears to have consisted only of 420 grains to the
                    ounce, or to have contained in all 5040 grains. This became the standard of
                    copper; and when silver came to be coined, seven denarii went to the ounce, as
                    eight drachms did in Greece. Gold was regulated by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scriptulum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">scrupulum,</hi> the third part of a
                    denarius, and by the larger weights just mentioned. The number ten was at first
                    used by the Romans in counting their money; but finding afterwards that a
                    smaller number was more convenient, they divided it into quarters; and as the
                    quarter of ten is two and a half, they for this reason bestowed upon it the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">sestertius,</hi> or “half the third,” to express that it
                    was two of any weights, measures, &amp;c. and half a third; whence the
                    sestertius came at last to be the grand estimate of Roman money. The <hi
                    rend="italic">as</hi> being at first the largest, and indeed the only Roman
                    coin, the word <hi rend="italic">sestertius</hi> means <hi rend="italic"
                    >sestertius as,</hi> or “two asses and a half.” On the first coining of silver,
                    the denarius of ten asses was struck in the most common and convenient denary
                    division of money, or that by tens, the sestertius being of course two asses and
                    a half. But the denarius being afterwards estimated at sixteen asses, the name
                    sestertius was still applied to a quarter of the denarius, though it now
                    contained four asses. The term <hi rend="italic">sestertius</hi> was applied to
                    all sums not exceeding 1000 sestertii, or L.8.6s. 8d.; but for greater sums the
                    mode of the sestertius was likewise altered, though not to exclude the former.
                    Very large sums of money were estimated by the hundredweight of brass; for the
                    Romans were at first unacquainted with the talent. The hundredweight, by way of
                    eminence, was distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">pondus,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">sestertium pondus</hi> became a phrase for two hundredweight
                    and a half. Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that we may value the <hi rend="italic"
                    >as</hi><hi rend="italic">libralis</hi> of ancient Rome at about eightpence
                    English. Estimating the <hi rend="italic">as,</hi> therefore, at a pound weight,
                    the <hi rend="italic">sestertium pondus</hi> was equal to one thousand <hi
                    rend="italic">sestertii,</hi> or L.8. 6s. 8d.; and by a coincidence, which our
                    author supposes to have been the effect of design, as soon as the silver coinage
                    appeared, the <hi rend="italic">sestertium</hi><hi rend="italic">centum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">denariorum</hi> was always equal to L.8. 6s. 8d. also. The word
                    <hi rend="italic">sestertium</hi> itself, however, seems to have been unknown
                    prior to the coinage of silver money at Rome; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pondera</hi><hi rend="italic">gravis aeris</hi> being sufficient before that
                    time for all the purposes of a state in which money was so scarce. But, however
                    this may be, the <hi rend="italic">pondus</hi> or hundredweight of brass was
                    precisely worth a hundred denarii, or a pound of silver. As the great sestertium
                    was always valued at a thousand of the smaller, or L.8. 6s. 8d., we never find
                    one sestertium mentioned in authors, but two, three, or more; ten thousand of
                    them being equal to L.83,333. 6s. 8d.</p>
                <p>The states from which the Romans may be supposed first to have derived their
                    coinage were the Etruscans and the Greek colonies in Magna Graecia and Sicily.
                    Joseph Scaliger, Gronovius, and others, contend that it was from the Sicilians
                    that the Romans first derived their knowledge of money; but Mr Pinkerton argues
                    that it was from the Etruscans. In confirmation of his opinion, he appeals to
                    the state of the Roman territories in the time of Servius Tullius, who is looked
                    upon as having been the first who coined money at Rome. At that time the whole
                    Roman dominion did not extend beyond ten miles round the city, and was entirely
                    surrounded by the Etruscan and Latin states; Cumae, the next Greek colony which
                    was of any consequence, being situated in the neighbourhood of Naples, at about
                    the distance of 150 miles. Mr Pinkerton asks if it is reasonable to think that
                    the Romans <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205958" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5958-0472"
                    />received the use of money from the Etruscans and Latins, who were their
                    neighbours, or from the Greeks, who were at a distance, and at that time, as far
                    as appears from their history, absolutely unknown to them. “If this ar gument,
                    “adds he,” is strong with regard to the nearest Grecian colonies, what must it
                    be with respect to Sicily, an island 300 miles distant from Rome, where it was
                    not known, at that time, if a boat went by land or water ?” Arguments, however,
                    for this opinion have been derived from the similarity between the Sicilian and
                    Roman coins, which Mr Pinkerton next proceeds to examine. The Greek pound in
                    Sicily was called <hi rend="italic">λ∕τgα,</hi> and consisted, like the Roman,
                    of twelve <hi rend="italic">oυγκιαι or</hi> ounces; and Mr Pinkerton grants that
                    the Roman <hi rend="italic">libra</hi> was derived from the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">^λιτgα,</hi> but denies that the <hi rend="italic">as,</hi> or
                    libra, a coin, was from a Sicilian model. The Sicilians had indeed a coin named
                    λ∕rga, but it was of silver, and of equal value to the Aeginean standard, ten of
                    which went to the Sicilian <hi rend="italic">δεκαkιτgχ.</hi> He differs from
                    Gronovius, that the standard of Aegina was used at Corinth, and of course at
                    Syracuse; and it appears from Aristotle, that the Sicilians had a talent or
                    standard of their own. The Sicilian obolus or <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ιτgα</hi> contained also twelve ounces or <hi rend="italic"
                    >chalci,</hi> so named at first because they weighed an ounce weight; but the
                    <hi rend="italic">ουγκιαι</hi> of Hiero weighed more than a troy ounce; and the
                    brass coins of Agrigentum are marked with ciphers as far as six, the largest
                    weighing only 186 grains, or about one third of the primitive ounce. Pinkerton
                    denies that even the Roman denarΛιs took its rise from the Sicilian <hi
                    rend="italic">δεκα</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">ιτgον,</hi> as
                    many authors assert. Were this the case, it would have weighed 180 grains;
                    whereas the Roman denarii are not above the third part of the quantity.</p>
                <p>From all these considerations, Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that the Sicilians
                    borrowed the division of their <hi rend="italic">^Kιτgα</hi> from the Etruscans,
                    or possibly from the Romans themselves; which, he seems to think, is more
                    probable than that the Romans had it from Sicily. The strongest argument,
                    however, against the Roman coinage being borrowed from the Sicilian is, that
                    though great numbers of Sicilian coins are to be found in the cabinets of
                    medallists, yet none of them resembles in any degree the <hi rend="italic"
                    >as</hi><hi rend="italic">libralis</hi> of the Romans. In most cabinets also
                    there are Etruscan coins upon the exact scale of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >as</hi><hi rend="italic">libralis,</hi> and several of its divisions; whence Mr
                    Pinkerton has concluded, that “these, and these alone, must have afforded a
                    pattern to the primitive Reman coinage.” The Etruscans were a colony from Lydia,
                    to which country Herodotus ascribes the first invention of coinage. “Those
                    colonists,” says Mr Pinkerton, “upon looking round their settlements, and
                    finding that <hi rend="italic">no</hi> silver was to be had, and <hi
                    rend="italic">much less</hi> gold,” supplied the mercantile medium with copper;
                    to which the case of Sweden is very similar, which, as late as the last century,
                    had copper coins of such magnitude that wheelbarrows were used to carry off a
                    sum not very considerable.”</p>
                <p>Some coins arc found which exceed the <hi rend="italic">as</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >libralis</hi> in weight, and these are supposed to be prior to the time of
                    Servius Tullius. Some of them are met with of thirty-four and fifty-three Roman
                    ounces, having upon one side the figure of a bull rudely impressed, and upon the
                    other the bones of a fish. They are most commonly found at Tudder, or Tudertum,
                    in Umbria; but they appear always broken at one end, and hence Mr Pinkerton is
                    of opinion that perhaps some might have been struck of the decussis form, or
                    weighing ten pounds. These pieces would seem to make it evident, that the Romans
                    derived their large brass coins from the Etruscans and neighbouring states; they
                    arc all cast in moulds, and the greater part of them appear much more ancient
                    than the Roman asses, even such as are of the greatest antiquity.</p>
                <p>Mr Pinkerton agrees with Sir Isaac Newton as to the time that Servius Tullius
                    reigned in Rome, which he supposes to be about 460 before Christ. His coinage
                    seems to have been confined to the as, or piece of brass having the impression
                    of Janus on the one side and the prow of a ship on the other, because Janus
                    arrived in Italy by sea. Varro, however, informs us, that the very first coins
                    of Tullius had the figure of a bull or other cattle upon them, like the Etruscan
                    coins, of which they were imitations. Those with the figure of Janus and the
                    prow of a ship upon them may be supposed to have first appeared about 400 before
                    Christ; but in a short time various subdivisions of the as were coined <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">semis,</hi> or half, is
                    commonly stamped with the head of Jupiter laureated; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >triens,</hi> or third, having four ciphers, as being originally of four ounces
                    weight, has the head of Minerva; the <hi rend="italic">quadrans,</hi> or
                    quarter, marked with three ciphers, has the head of Hercules wrapt in the lion’s
                    skin; the <hi rend="italic">sextans,</hi> or sixth, having only two ciphers, is
                    marked with the head of Mercury, with a cap and wings; whilst the <hi
                    rend="italic">uncia,</hi> having only one cipher, is marked with the head of
                    Rome. All these coins appear to have been cast in moulds, by a considerable
                    number at a time; and in the British Museum there are four of them all united
                    together as taken out of the mould, in which perhaps dozens were cast together.
                    In process of time, however, the smaller divisions were struck instead of being
                    cast; but the larger still continued to be cast until the as fell to two ounces.
                    Even after this time it was still called <hi rend="italic">libra,</hi> and
                    accounted a pound of copper, though there were now larger denominations of it
                    coined, such as the <hi rend="italic">bissas</hi> or double as; <hi
                    rend="italic">tressis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quadrιιssis,</hi> of three and
                    four asses; nay, as far as <hi rend="italic">decussis</hi> or ten asses, marked
                    X. Olivieri mentions one in his own cabinetweighing upwards of twenty-five
                    ounces, and cast when the as was about three ounces weight. There is likewise in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Museum</hi><hi rend="italic">Etruscum</hi> a decussis of
                    forty Roman ounces, cast when the as was at four ounces. There was likewise a
                    curious decussis in the Jesuits’ Library at Rome, for which an English medallist
                    offered L.20, but it was seized by the Pope, along with every other thing
                    belonging to the society.</p>
                <p>Mr Pinkerton contests the opinion of Pliny, that the as continued of a pound
                    weight till the end of the first Punic war. This opinion, he says, is confuted
                    by the coins which still remain, and it appears probable to him that the as
                    decreased gradually in weight; and from one or two of the pieces which still
                    exist, he seems to think that the decrease was slow, as from a pound to eleven
                    ounces, then to ten, nine, &amp;c.; but neither the as nor its parts were ever
                    correctly sized. During the time of the second Punic war, when the Romans were
                    sorely pressed by Hannibal, the as was reduced to a single ounce. This is said
                    to have taken place in the 215th year before our era, being about thirty-six
                    years after the former change. The <hi rend="italic">as</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >libralis,</hi> with the faces of Janus upon it, is the form most commonly met
                    with previously to its being reduced to two ounces. Mr Pinkerton supposes that
                    the <hi rend="italic">as</hi><hi rend="italic">libralis</hi> continued for at
                    least a century and a half after this coinage of Tullius, down to 300 before
                    Christ, about the year of Rome 452, between which and the 502d year of Rome a
                    gradual diminution of the as to two ounces must have taken place. The following
                    table of the dates of the Roman coinage is given by Mr Pinkerton. The <hi
                    rend="italic">as</hi><hi rend="italic">libralis,</hi> coined by Tullius, with
                    the figures of oxen, &amp;c. about 167 years after the building of Rome,
                    according to Sir Isaac Newton, or about the year before Christ 460</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">As</hi><hi rend="italic">libralis</hi> with Janus and the prow
                    of a ship 400</p>
                <p>As of ten ounces 300</p>
                <p>Eight 290</p>
                <p>Six 280</p>
                <p>Four 270</p>
                <p>Three 260</p>
                <p>Two, according to Pliny 250</p>
                <p>One, according to the same author 214 <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205971"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5971-0473"/>!. About 175 before Christ, also, we are informed
                    by Pliny -^that the as was, by the Papyrian law, reduced to half an ounce, at
                    which it continued till the time of Pliny himself, and long after.</p>
                <p>After the Romans began to maintain an intercourse with Greece, a variety of
                    elegant figures appear upon the parts of the as, though not on the as itself
                    till after the time of Sylla-Towards the latter end of the republic, also, <hi
                    rend="italic">dupondii,</hi> or double asses, were coined, together with the <hi
                    rend="italic">sestertii acrei,</hi> which came in place of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >quadrusses,</hi> when the denarius began to be reckoned at sixteen asses,
                    probably at the time the latter was reduced to half an ounce. In some instances,
                    it is to be observed that the Romans accommodated their coins to the country
                    where their army was stationed; whence we have many coins marked as Roman, which
                    had been coined in Magna Graecia and Sicily, and arc evidently upon the Greek
                    and not the Roman scale. In the latter part of the republican times, also, the
                    types begin to vary; so that we have a brass coin supposed to be struck by
                    Sextus Pompeius in Sicily, having upon it a double head of that warrior,
                    representing a Janus. Mr Pinkerton supposes it to have been a dupondius, which
                    indeed appears to be the case, from the double head. This coin is of copper, and
                    still weighs an ounce, notwithstanding its antiquity.</p>
                <p>The largest imperial copper coin was the sestertius, a piece worth about twopence
                    of our money. Mr Pinkerton censures severely the opinion of other medallists,
                    all of whom allege that the sestertius was of silver. “In fact,” says he, “it
                    would be as rational in any antiquary, a thousand years hence, to contend that
                    the halfpenny and farthing are of silver, because they were so in the reign of
                    Henry VIII.” In confirmation of his own opinion, he quotes the following passage
                    from Pliny: “The greatest glory of brass is now-due to the Marian, called also
                    that of Cordova. This, after the Livian, most absorbs the lapis calaminaris, and
                    imitates the goodness of native orichalcum in our sestertii and dupondiarii, the
                    asses being contented with their own copper.” Gronovius confessed that he did
                    not know what to make of this passage, and that it caused him to hesitate in his
                    opinion. The <hi rend="italic">Liman</hi> mine here mentioned by Pliny is
                    supposed to have got its name from <hi rend="italic">Livia,</hi> the wife of
                    Augustus; and it is probable that the pieces marked with her portraits, entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Justitia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Salus, Virtus,</hi> were
                    dupondii from this very mine, the metal being exceedingly fine, and of the kind
                    named <hi rend="italic">Corinthian brass</hi> by the ancient medallists. Perhaps
                    the mine received its name from the circumstance of her coins being struck in
                    the metal obtained from it.</p>
                <p>No change took place in the Roman coinage, from the time that the as fell to half
                    an ounce, to the days of Pliny; but Mr Pinkerton observes, that before the time
                    of Julius Caesar, yellow brass began to be used, and was always looked upon as
                    being double the value of Cyprian or red copper. There are but few coins in
                    large brass immediately before Julius Caesar, or even belonging to that emperor;
                    but from the time of Augustus downward, the large coins are all found of brass,
                    and not one of them of copper. The largest of what are called the middle size
                    are all of yellow brass; and the next size, which is the as, and weighs half an
                    ounce, is universally copper. What the ancients named <hi rend="italic"
                    >orichalcum,</hi> or what we call <hi rend="italic">brass,</hi> was always
                    looked upon as greatly superior in value to the <hi rend="italic">aes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cyprium.</hi> Procopius, speaking of a statue of Justinian, tells
                    us that brass inferior in colour to gold is almost equal in,value to silver. The
                    mines of native brass were very few in number, and were owing entirely to the
                    singular combination of copper and lapis calaminaris in the bowels of the earth,
                    which very seldom occurs; and the ancients were very far from being well
                    acquainted with the method of combining these two bodies artificially, so that
                    yellow brass was always esteemed at double the value of copper; and hence, in
                    the ancient coinages, the brass and copper pieces were kept as distinct as those
                    of gold and silver.</p>
                <p>Mr Pinkerton lays claim to the discovery that the imperial sestertius was of
                    brass, and is at considerable pains to bring proofs of it. Besides the testimony
                    of Pliny^ which of itself would be decisive, this is supported by the strongest
                    collateral evidence of other authors. From a passage in Julius Africanus, who
                    wrote the Tαrg∕κα, or <hi rend="italic">Treatise on. Medicine,</hi> it appears
                    that the nummus, or sestertius, weighed an ounce, and of consequence that it
                    could not be silver, but brass; and all the large imperial Roman coins weigh an
                    ounce. We know not the age in which Julius Africanus lived; and as he makes the
                    denarius to contain sixteen asses, he must have been before the age of
                    Gallienus, when it had sixty. Gronovius supposes him to have been the same
                    mentioned by Eusebius. This author speaks of a Julius Africanus who lived in the
                    time of Heliogabalus, and whom Mr Pinkerton supposes to have been the same with
                    the person above mentioned.</p>
                <p>The sestertius underwent no change till the time of Alexander Severus, when it
                    was diminished by one third of its weight. Trajanus Decius was the first who
                    coined double sestertii, or quinarii, of brass; but from the time of Trebonianus
                    Gallus to that of Gallienus, when the first brass ceases, the sestertius does
                    not weigh above the third part of an ounce. The larger coins are accounted
                    double sestertii; and after the time of Gallienus it totally vanishes. In the
                    times of Valerian and Gallienus we find a new kind of coinage, mentioned by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">denarii aeris,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Philippi
                    acrei.</hi> Two sizes of denarii began to be used in the time of Caracalla; the
                    larger of six sestertii, or twenty-four assaria; the smaller of four sestertii,
                    or sixteen assaria, as usual. In the time of Pupienus, the latter was reduced to
                    such a small size as not to weigh more than thirty-six grains, though in
                    Caracalla’s time it weighed fifty-six. After the time of Gcrdian III. the
                    smaller coin fell into disuse, as breeding confusion. The larger denarius, of
                    six sestertii, though diminished at last to the size of the early denarius,
                    still retained its value of six sestertii, or twenty-four assaria. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Philippus</hi><hi rend="italic">aersus</hi> came at length in
                    place of the sestertius. It was also called <hi rend="italic">denarius,</hi>
                    from which we may learn not only their size, but that they were in value ten
                    assaria, as the first denarius. In the reign of Diocletian, the place of the
                    sestertius was supplied by the <hi rend="italic">follis,</hi> that emperor
                    having restored the silver coin to its purity, and likewise given this form to
                    the copper; but it would seem that this restoration of the coinage only took
                    place towards the end of his reign; for which reason we have but few of his
                    silver coins, and still fewer of <hi rend="italic">Úiefollis,</hi> though the
                    <hi rend="italic">denarii acrei</hi> continue quite common down to the time of
                    Constantine. The follis of Diocletian seems to have weighed above half an ounce;
                    and Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that Diocletian designed this coin to supply the
                    place of the denarius acreus, which of course was worth ten assaria, and six of
                    them went to the silver denarius. From this time the assarium diminishes to the
                    size of thirty grains; and soon after the follis appeared, the denarius acreus
                    was entirely dropped, the former having gradually supplied its place. Some mints
                    appear to have retained the use of the denarius longer than others; and in
                    several the change was preceded, and gradually brought in, by washing the follis
                    with silver or tin, as the denarius had formerly been. Pieces of this kind occur
                    in the times of Diocletian, Maximian I. and II. and Constantius I.; that is, for
                    about ten years after the follis made its appearance. Some countries, however,
                    retained the denarius acreus, others the follis, and some had a medium between
                    the two, or the follis washed in imitation of the denarius.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the reign of Constantine I. a new coinage was introduced
                    throughout the whole empire. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205984"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5984-0474"/>follis coined by this prince was of half an ounce
                    weight; twenty-four of them going to the milliarensis, or larger silver coin.
                    The word <hi rend="italic">follis</hi> signifies also a purse, in which sense we
                    sometimes find it mentioned in the Byzantine history. The common follis of
                    silver, when it occurs by itself, means a purse of 250 milliarensis, as the
                    sestertium was 250 denarii; and by a law of Constantine I. every man paid to the
                    state a follis or purse according to his income. The method of counting by
                    purses continues in Turkey to this day.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">dupondius</hi> was only half the value of the sestertius,
                    or about one penny sterling; and before the yellow brass appeared it seems to
                    have been struck upon copper, and double the size of the as. There are some of
                    this coin, struck in the time of Julius Caesar, in yellow brass, weighing half
                    an ounce, with a head of Venus Victrix upon one side; on the reverse, a female
                    figure, with serpents at her feet; whilst others have a Victory on the reverse,
                    with Q. Oppius Pr. After the time of Augustus, the dupondius was struck in
                    yellow brass; which Pliny tells us was also the case in his time. The word
                    dupondiarius seems to have been used by Pliny, and adopted, not to express that
                    the coin was <hi rend="italic">dupondius,</hi> but that it was of dupondiary
                    value. Neither was the former word confined to signify double weight, but was
                    used also for double length or measure, as in the instance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >dupondius</hi><hi rend="italic">ρes,</hi> or two feet, &amp;c. In the imperial
                    times, therefore, <hi rend="italic">dupondius</hi> was used, not to signify a
                    coin of double the weight of the as, but of double the value. It was one of the
                    most ordinary of the Roman coins, and seems to have been very common even in
                    Constantinople. In the time of Justinian, it appears there was a custom of
                    nicknaming young students of the law <hi rend="italic">dupondii,</hi> against
                    which the emperor made a law; but it is not known what gave rise to the name.
                    The dupondius, though of the same size with the as, is commonly of finer
                    workmanship, the metal being greatly superior in value. It continues to be of
                    yellow brass, as well as the sestertius, till the time of Gallienus; but the as
                    is always in copper.</p>
                <p>The imperial as, or <hi rend="italic">assarium,</hi> was worth only a halfpenny.
                    At first it weighed half an ounce, and was always of copper till the time of
                    Gallienus, when it was made of brass, and weighed only the eighth part of an
                    ounce. From the time of Gallienus to that of Diocletian, it continued to
                    diminish still more, the size being then twenty to an ounce. This was the same
                    with the lepta, or smallest coins except the <hi rend="italic">νουμια,</hi>
                    which weighed only ten grains.</p>
                <p>The parts of the as occur but seldom, which may indeed be expected, considering
                    the low value of it; though there still occur some of those called semis,
                    triens, quadrans, sextans, and uncia, coined in the times of Nero and Domitian.
                    There is no small brass from the time of Pertinax to that of Gallienus,
                    excepting that of Trajanus Decius; but in the time of Gallienus it becomes
                    extremely common, and the coins of small brass, as well as the larger, are
                    always marked S. C., such as want it being universally accounted forgeries; they
                    were plated with silver, though the plating be now worn off. The small pieces
                    struck for slaves during the time of the saturnalia, must also be distinguished
                    from the parts of the as. The S. C. upon these most probably signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">Saturni Consulto,</hi> and were struck in ridicule of the true
                    coins, as the slaves on that occasion had every privilege of irony.</p>
                <p>The sestertius diminishes from Pertinax to Gallienus so fast that no parts of the
                    as are struck, itself being so small. Trajanus Decius, indeed, coined some small
                    pieces, which went for the semis of the time. The small brass coins under
                    Gallienus were called assaria, sixty of which went to the silver denarius. They
                    are about the size of the denarius, and some of them occur of the coinage of
                    Gallus and his family, of half that size, which appear to have been struck
                    during the latter part of his reign, when the assarium was diminished to a still
                    smaller size. It is probable, however, that some of these very small coins had
                    been struck in all ages of the empire, in order to scatter amongst the people on
                    solemn occasions. Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that they are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >missilia,</hi> though most other medallists think that they are medallions.
                    “But if so,” says he, “they were certainly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >missilia</hi><hi rend="italic">a non</hi><hi rend="italic">mittendo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for it would be odd if fine medallions were scattered among
                    the mob. It is a common custom just now to strike counters to scatter among the
                    populace on such occasions, while medals are given to peers of the kingdom; and
                    we may very justly reason from analogy on this occasion.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">assarion</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lepton</hi> of the
                    Constan tinopolitan empire was, as we have already observed, one of the smallest
                    coins known in antiquity, weighing no more than twenty grains; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">nowmia</hi> were the very smallest which have reached our times,
                    being only one half of the former. By reason of their extreme smallness, they
                    are very scarce; but Mr Pinkerton had in his possession a fine one of Theodosius
                    II. which had on it the emperor’s head in profile: Theodosius P. F. AV.; on the
                    reverse a wreath, having in the centre voτ. xx.: <hi rend="smallcaps">mult.</hi>
                    xxx.</p>
                <p>The principal coin of the lower empire was the follis, which was divided into an
                    half and quarter, named <hi rend="italic">ημισο-φο</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∖</hi><hi rend="italic">εος</hi> and <hi rend="italic">τεταξτον;</hi> the
                    latter of which isshownbyDuCange to have been a small brass coin, as the other
                    is supposed to have been by Mr Pinkerton. Besides these, the follis was divided
                    into eight oboli, sixteen assaria or lepta, and thirty-two noumia, though in
                    common computation it contained forty of these last. This coin, notwithstanding
                    so many divisions, was of no more value than a halfpenny.</p>
                <p>Mr Pinkerton controverts an opinion, common amongst medallists, that the largest
                    brass coin or follis of the lower empire had forty small coins, expressed by the
                    letter Μ upon it; that the next had thirty, expressed by the letter A; that the
                    half was marked by the letter K, and the quarter by I, which contained only ten.
                    Mr Pinkerton informs us that he had three coins of Anastasius, all marked Μ in
                    large; one of them weighed more than half an ounce; the second forty grains
                    less; and the third of 160 grains, or one third of an ounce; but the size was so
                    very unequal, that the last, which was very thick, did not appear above half the
                    size of the first. There are pieces of Justinian which weigh a whole ounce; but
                    the size of copper was increased as the silver became scarcer, and the value of
                    the coinage cannot be deduced from the weight of the coins, as it is plain that
                    our own coinage is not of half the value with regard to the metal. A great
                    number of medallions were struck by Constantius II.; but there is no other
                    copper larger than the half ounce, excepting that of Anastasius, when the follis
                    began to be struck larger. All medallists allow the others to be medallions.</p>
                <p>The metal employed in these very small coins, though at first of brass, was
                    always of a base and refuse kind; but copper is generally made use of in the
                    parts of the as from the earliest times to the latest; and if brass be sometimes
                    employed, it is never such as appears in the sestertii and dupondiarii, which is
                    very fine and beautiful, but only the refuse. “Yellow brass of the right sort,”
                    says Pinkerton, “seems totally to have ceased in the Roman coinage with the
                    sestertius, under Gallienus, though a few small coins of very bad metal appear
                    under that hue as late as Julian II.”</p>
                <p>Silver was coined in Rome only as late as the 485th year of the city, or 266
                    before Christ. Varro indeed speaks of silver having been coined by Servius
                    Tullius, and of the libella having been once in silver;’but Pliny’s authority
                    must be accounted of more weight than that of this author, as he mistakes the
                    <hi rend="italic">λ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">τgα of</hi>
                    Sicily for Roman coins, having been current at Rome during the time of the first
                    Punic war. Even Pliny, according to our author, very <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205997" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5997-0475"/>frequently mistakes with
                    regard to matters much antecedent to his own time; and amongst the moderns he
                    criticises severely Erasmus and Hume. “Erasmus,” says he, “who had been in
                    England for some time, talks of leaden money being used here.” Not even a leaden
                    token was struck in the reign of Henry VIII.; yet his authority has been
                    followed with due deference to so great a name; fori how could Erasmus, who must
                    have seen the matter with his own eyes, assert a direct falsehood? To give a
                    later instance in a writer of reputation, Mr Hume, in the sixth volume of his
                    history, has these words, in treating of the reign of James I. “It appears that
                    copper halfpence and farthings began to be coined in this reign. Tradesmen had
                    commonly carried on their retail business by leaden tokens. The small silver
                    penny was soon lost, and at this time was nowhere to be found.” Copper halfpence
                    and farthings were not struck till Charles 1I., 1672. There were small tokens
                    for farthings struck in copper by James L, but not one for the halfpenny. The
                    silver farthings had ceased with Edward VI., but the silver halfpence continued
                    the sole coins till Edward II. It was by copper tokens that small business was
                    carried’on. “The silver penny was much used till the end of the reign of George
                    I.; and, so far from being nowhere to be found, was superabundant in every reign
                    since that period, not excepting even the reign of George III. From these
                    instances the reader may judge how strangely writers of all ages blunder when
                    treating of a subject of which they arc entirely ignorant.”</p>
                <p>The first silver denarii coined at Rome are supposed by Pinkerton to have been
                    those which are impressed with the <hi rend="smallcaps">Roma</hi>; and he
                    inclines to account those the most ancient that have a double female head on the
                    one side, and on the reverse Jupiter in a car, with Victory holding the reins,
                    and the word <hi rend="smallcaps">Roma</hi> indented in a rude and singular
                    manner. The double female head seems to denote Rome, in imitation of that of
                    Janus upon the as. There are fifteen of these in the cabinet of Dr Hunter; one
                    of the largest weighs ninety-eight grains and a quarter, and the rest, which
                    seem to be of the greatest antiquity, are of various weights between that and
                    eighty-four; the smaller and more modern weigh fifty-eight or fifty-nine grains;
                    but Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that the large ones were of the very first Roman
                    coinage, and struck during that interval of time between the coinage of the
                    first silver denarius and the as of two ounces. He takes the indentation of the
                    word <hi rend="smallcaps">Roma</hi> to be a mark of great antiquity; such a mode
                    being scarcely known anywhere else, excepting in Caulonia, Crotona, and other
                    towns of Italy. All of them are allowed to have been struck at least 400 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c. As</hi> these coins are not double denarii, they must
                    have been struck prior to the small ones; and Neumann has given an account of
                    one of them recoined by Trajan, in which the indentation of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Roma</hi> is carefully preserved. The first denarius was in value ten asses
                    when the as weighed three ounces; and, allowing ninety grains at a medium for
                    one of these large denarii, the proportion of copper to silver must have been as
                    one to a hundred and sixty; but when the as fell to one ounce, the proportion
                    was as one to eighty; when it fell to half an ounce, so that sixteen asses went
                    to the denarius, the proportion was as one to sixty-four, at which it remained.
                    Copper with us, in coinage, is to silver as one to forty, but in actual value as
                    one to seventy-two.</p>
                <p>At Rome the denarius was worth 8d.; the quinarius 4d.; and the sestertius,
                    whether silver or brass, 2d. The denarius is the coin from which our penny is
                    derived, and was the chief silver coin in Rome for 600 years. According to
                    Celsus, seven denarii went to the Roman ounce, which in metals did not exceed
                    430 grains; but as all the denarii hitherto met with weigh at a medium only
                    sixty grains, this would seem to make the Roman ounce only 420 grains; though
                    perhaps this deficiency may be accounted for from the unavoidable waste of
                    metal, even in the best preserved of these coins. According to this proportion,
                    the Roman pound contained eighty-four denarii; but in tale there was a very
                    considerable excess, for no fewer than 100 denarii went to the Roman pound. The
                    Greek ounce appears to have been considerably larger than that of Rome,
                    containing about 528 grains; yet notwithstanding this apparently great odds, the
                    difference in the coins was so small that the Greek money went current in Rome,
                    and the Roman in Greece. The denarius at first went for ten asses, and was
                    marked X; it was afterwards raised to sixteen, which Mr Pinkerton supposes to
                    have been about 175 years before Christ. Some are met with bearing the number
                    XVI., nay, with every number up to CCCCLXXVI. These large numbers are supposed
                    to have been mint-marks of some kind or other. After being raised to sixteen
                    asses, it continued at the same value till the time of Gallienus; so that till
                    that time we are to look upon its constituent parts to be sixteen asses or
                    assaria, eight dupondii, four brass sestertii, and two silver quinarii. Under
                    the Emperor Severus, however, or his successor Caracalla, denarii were struck of
                    two sizes, one of them a third heavier than the common, and which we must of
                    consequence suppose to have borne a third more value. This large piece obtained
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">argentus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">argenteus
                    Philippus,</hi> or the “silver Philip;” the name of Philip having become common
                    to almost every coin. The common denarii now began to be termed <hi
                    rend="italic">minuti</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ατgenti Philippi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">minutuli,</hi> &amp;c. to express their being smaller than the
                    rest. Some have imagined that the large denarii were of the same^value with the
                    small, and only of worse metal; but Mr Pinkerton observes, that amongst the few
                    which have any difference of metal, the smallest are always the worst. The first
                    mention of the <hi rend="italic">minuti</hi> is in the time of Alexander
                    Severus, who reduced the price of pork from eight minuti at Rome to two and to
                    one. The <hi rend="italic">minutus argenteus</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> that
                    age was about 40 grains; and, from the badness of the metal, was not worth above
                    4d. of our money. Thus, the price of meat was by this prince reduced first to
                    8d. and then to 4d.</p>
                <p>According to Zozimus and other writers, the purity of the Roman coin was restored
                    by Aurelian; but Mr Pinkerton controverts this opinion, thinking it more
                    probable that he only made the attempt without success, or that this reformation
                    might be entirely confined to gold, on which there is an evident change after
                    the time of this emperor. His successor Tacitus is said to have allowed no brass
                    to be upon any account mixed with silver; yet the few coins of this emperor are
                    very much alloyed. We are certain, however, that the emperor Diocletian restored
                    the silver to its ancient purity; the denarii struck in his reign being very
                    small indeed, but of as fine silver as the most ancient coins of the empire.
                    After Gordian III. the small denarius entirely vanished, whilst the large one
                    was so diminished that it resembled the <hi rend="italic">minutus,</hi> or small
                    one of Caracalla, in size. Gallienus introduced the <hi rend="italic">denarii
                    acrei</hi> instead of the <hi rend="italic">sestertii.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">argenteus,</hi> though reduced more than one third in size,
                    contained six denarii acrei, the old standard of sestertii. According to the
                    writers of this period, and some time afterwards, the denarius or argenteus
                    contained sixty assaria; whence it follows that each denarius acreus had ten,
                    and from this it probably had its name. The assaria are of the size of the
                    argentei already mentioned, and show the copper to have retained nearly its old
                    proportion of value to the silver, that is, one’to sixty.</p>
                <p>A larger silver coin was introduced by Constantine I. who accommodated the new
                    money to the pound of gold, in such a manner that a thousand of the former in
                    tale were equal to the latter in value; so that this new piece from thence
                    obtained the name of the <hi rend="italic">milliarensis</hi> or “thousander.”
                    Its weight at a medium was seventy grains, or seventy to the pound of silver;
                    but Mr Pinkerton is of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194206010"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-6010-0476"/>opinion that it might have contained seventy-two
                    grains, of which two have now perished by the softness of the silver; that the
                    pound contained seventy-two; or that two of the number might be allowed for
                    coinage, whilst the alloy alone would pay for coining gold. The code says that
                    sixty went to the pound, but the numbers of this are quite corrupt. The <hi
                    rend="italic">milliarensis</hi> was worth about a shilling sterling. The
                    argentei or denarii, however, were still the most common currency; and having
                    been originally rated at a hundred to the pound of silver in tale, they thence
                    began to be denominated <hi rend="italic">centenionales,</hi> or “hundreders.”
                    Those of Constantine I. and II., Constans, and Constantius, weigh from fifty
                    grains down to forty; those of Julian and Jovian from forty to thirty; and those
                    of the succeeding emperors from that time to Justinian, from thirty to twenty.
                    Under Heraclius they ceased entirely; and, from Justinian to their total
                    abolition, had been brought down from fifteen to ten grains. A similar decrease
                    of weight took place in the milliarensis, those of Constantine and Constans
                    being above seventy grains in weight, those of Arcadius not above sixty, and the
                    milliarensis of Justinian not above thirty grains; but, from the weight of those
                    in Dr Hunter’s cabinet, Mr Pinkerton deduces the medium to have been exactly
                    seventy grains and eight seventeenths. These coins were also called <hi
                    rend="italic">majorinae.</hi></p>
                <p>The smaller silver coins of Rome were, I. The <hi rend="italic">quinarius,</hi>
                    at first called <hi rend="italic">victoriatus,</hi> from the image of Victory on
                    its reverse, which it continued to bear from first to last. Its original value
                    was five asses, but it was afterwards raised to eight, when the value of the
                    denarius increased to sixteen. According to Pliny, it was first coined in
                    consequence of the <hi rend="italic">lex Clodia,</hi> about the 525th year of
                    Rome. Some are of opinion that it was called <hi rend="italic">κεgατιον</hi>
                    under the Constantinopolitan empire, because it was worth a <hi rend="italic"
                    >κεgατιον</hi> of gold, 144 of which went to the ounce; but this is denied by Mr
                    Pinkerton, because at the time that the word <hi rend="italic">κεgατιον</hi>
                    first appears in history, the denarius did not weigh above thirty grains; and,
                    consequently, as twenty-five must have gone to the gold solidus, of which there
                    were six in the ounce, 130 denarii must have gone to the ounce of gold. He is
                    therefore of opinion that the word <hi rend="italic">κεgατιον</hi> was only
                    another name for the denarius when much reduced in size, probably owing to the
                    great scarcity of silver in Constantinople; though in the same city there was
                    plenty of gold, and consequently the gold solidus was never diminished; for
                    Montesquieu has well observed, that gold must be common where silver is rare.
                    Hence gold was the common regulation of accounts in the eastern empire. The δ
                    <hi rend="italic">ικ</hi><hi rend="italic">ε</hi><hi rend="italic">gατιov</hi>
                    met with in ancient authors was, according to Mr Pinkerton, merely an improper
                    name for the <hi rend="italic">milliarensis,</hi> when, on account of the
                    scarcity of silver, the denarius was reduced, and no milliarenses coined; so
                    that the current milliarensis of former reigns happened to be double to the
                    denarius or centenionalis. The quinarius diminishes in size along with the other
                    coins; those of Augustus weighing thirty grains, those of Severus twenty-five,
                    those of Constantine 1. twenty, those of Justinian twelve, and those of
                    Heraclius only five. A new silver coinage seems to have taken place after the
                    days of this emperor, as the little we then meet with, which in the best
                    cabinets scarcely exceeds a dozen of coins, consists entirely of large unshapely
                    pieces of coarse metal.</p>
                <p>The consular denarius had also four silver sestertii, till the as fell· to half
                    an ounce, when it was thought proper to coin the sestertius in brass, as it
                    continued to be ever afterwards. lhe very last silver sestertius which appears
                    is one with a head of Mercury, and H. S.; on the reverse a caduccus p. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">sepvllivs,</hi> who appears to be the <hi rend="smallcaps">p.
                    sepvllivs</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">macer</hi> of the denarii of Julius Caesar.
                    If so, as is most probable, the sestertius was coined in silver down to
                    Augustus; and it is of course not to be expected that any of brass can appear
                    till Augustus, under whom they were in fact quite common. We have indeed seen no
                    coin which could be a consular brass sestertius; and though we have certainly
                    brass dupondii of Caesar, yet it is reasonable to infer that the brass
                    sestertius was first coined by Augustus. Not one silver sestertius appears
                    during the whole imperial period; yet we know that the sestertius was the most
                    common of all silver coins. The consular sestertii of silver, marked H. S. are
                    not uncommon, nor the quinarii; but the latter are very scarce of all the
                    emperors, if we except one instance, the <hi rend="smallcaps">asia</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">recepta</hi> of Augustus.</p>
                <p>The Roman gold coinage was still later than that of silver. Pliny tells us, that
                    “gold was coined sixty-two years after silver; and the scruple went for sixty
                    sesterces. It was afterwards thought proper to coin forty pieces out of the
                    pound of gold. And our princes have by degrees diminished their weight to
                    forty-five in the pound.” This account is confirmed by the pieces which still
                    remain; for we have that very coin weighing a scruple which went for twenty
                    sesterces. On one side is the head of Mars, and on the other an eagle; and it is
                    marked xx. We have another coin of the same kind, but double, marked xxxx; and
                    its triple, marked ∙ψx or 60; the ∙ψ being the old numeral character for 50. Mr
                    Pinkerton, the discoverer of this, treats other medallists, as usual, with great
                    asperity. Savot and Hardouin are mentioned by name; the latter, he says, is
                    “ignorant of common sense;” and neither he nor Savot could explain it but by
                    reading backwards, putting the√ψ for the Roman V, and thus making it xv. Other
                    readings have been given by various medallists, but none have hit upon the true
                    one excepting our author, though the coin itself led to it, being just three
                    times the weight of that marked xx. We have likewise half the largest coin,
                    which is marked xxx, and which weighs twenty-six grains; the smallest is only
                    seventeen and a half, and the xxxx weighs thirty-four, and the ιx or drachma
                    fifty-three. There is also the didrachm of this coinage, of a hundred and six
                    grains.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">aurei,</hi> or Roman gold coins, were at first forty-eight
                    in the pound; but they were afterwards diminished in number to forty, owing to
                    an augmentation in the weight of each coin. In the time of Sylla, the aureus
                    weighed no less than from a hundred and sixty-four to a hundred and sixty-eight
                    grains, and there were only thirty in the pound; but such confusion in the
                    coinage was introduced by that conqueror, that no person could know exactly what
                    he was worth. Till this time the aureus seems to have continued of the value of
                    thirty silver denarii, about one pound sterling; for about that time it was
                    enlarged a whole third, that it might still be equivalent to the full number of
                    denarii. But after Sylla had taken Athens, and the arts and manners of Greece
                    became objects of imitation to the Romans, the aureus fell to forty in the
                    pound, probably when Sylla had abdicated his dictatorship. Thus, being reduced
                    near to the scale of the Greek <hi rend="italic">χ^ισος,</hi> it passed for
                    twenty denarii, as the latter did for as many drachmas, being in currency 13s.
                    4d. sterling. “This,” says Pinkerton, “is the more probable, because we know
                    from Suetonius, that the great Caesar brought from Gaul so much gold that it
                    sold for nine times its weight of silver; but the Gallic gold was of a very base
                    sort.”</p>
                <p>In the time of Claudius, the aureus was valued at a hundred sesterii, or
                    twenty-five silver denarii, at which it continued till the time of Heliogabalus,
                    when it fell to about ninety-two grains at a medium, or rose in number to
                    fifty-five in the pound. In the reign of Philip, during which the city completed
                    its thousandth year, the aureus was coined of two or three sizes. These are
                    impressed with a head of Rome on one side, and various figures on the other; but
                    the workmanship is so rude that they are supposed to have been struck in some of
                    the more uncivilized provin-ccs<pb break="no" facs="nls:194206023"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-6023-0477"/> of the empire. The practice of having different
                    gold coins, however, continued under Valerian, Gallienus, and his successors. In
                    the time of Gallienus, they were of thirty, sixty-five, and from eighty-six to
                    ninety-three grains, the double aurei being from 172 to 183½ grains; but the
                    arcus properly so called was from eighty-six to ninety-three, those of thirty
                    and thirty two being the <hi rend="italic">trientes aurei</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >of the,//istoriae Augustae</hi><hi rend="italic">Scriptores</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> whilst the larger, from sixty-two to sixty-five, are to be
                    accounted double trientes, and were perhaps called <hi rend="italic"
                    >minuti</hi><hi rend="italic">aureu</hi> The value of these different sizes of
                    aurei is not known.</p>
                <p>That Aurelian made some alteration in the coin is certain; but Pinkerton supposes
                    it to have been only in the gold, because under him and his successor Probus the
                    common aureus was of a hundred grains, a size confined to those emperors. There
                    are likewise halves of about fifty grains, and double aurei, commonly of very
                    fine workmanship, and upwards of two hundred grains. In the time of Gallienus,
                    the precious metal was so common that this emperor vied in magnificence with
                    Nero and Heliogabalus. Aurelian, who plundered the rich city of Palmyra, and
                    thus became master of the treasures of the East, obtained such a profusion of
                    gold, that he looked upon it as being produced by nature in greater plenty than
                    silver. It is remarkable, that during this emperor’s reign, there was a
                    rebellion amongst the money coiners, that could not be quelled but by the
                    destruction of several thousands; which Mr Pinkerton ascribes to his having
                    ordered the gold to be restored to its former size, but to go for no more silver
                    than it formerly did. “So very little silver,” says he, “occurs of this period,
                    that it is plain no alteration in the silver produced the war with the moneyers;
                    and in the brass he made no change; or if he had, it were strange that such
                    commotions should arise about so trifling a metal. But if, as appears from the
                    coins, he ordered the aureus, which had fallen to eighty grains, to be raised to
                    about a hundred, it is no wonder that the contractors should be in an uproar;
                    for a whole quarter of their coinage, amounting, as would seem, to all their
                    profits, was lost. Aurelian judged, that when he found gold so common in the
                    East, it was equally so in the west, and that the moneyers must have made a most
                    exorbitant profit; but his ideas on this subject were partial and unjust: and
                    after his short reign, which did not exceed five months after the alteration,
                    the gold returned to its former course, though a few pieces occur of Aurelian’s
                    standard, struck, as would seem, in the commencement of the reign of Probus his
                    successor.</p>
                <p>From this time to that of Constantine I. the aureus weighed between seventy and
                    eighty grains; but in his reign it was changed for the solidus, of which six
                    went to the ounce of gold, which passed for fourteen <hi rend="italic"
                    >milliarenses,</hi> and twenty-five denarii, as before; the value of silver
                    being now to gold as fourteen to one. This new coin continued of the same value
                    till the final downfall of the Constantinopolitan empire, gold being always very
                    plentiful in that city, though silver became more and more scarce. The solidus
                    was worth 12s. sterling. Here again Mr Pinkerton severely criticises Mr Clarke
                    and Mr Raper. The former, he says, with respect to the value of gold in the time
                    of Constantine “has left all his senses behind him. In page 267, he absurdly
                    asserts that twenty denarii went to the solidus in the time of Theodosius I.,
                    and proceeds with this deplorable error to the end of his work. He then tells us
                    that only fourteen denarii went to the solidus under Constantine I.” To Mr
                    Raper, however, he is a little more merciful, owning that, “though he has
                    strangely confounded the milliarcnsis with the denarius, he has yet kept common
                    sense for his guide.” Mr Pinkerton, indeed, argues with great probability, “that
                    had any change in the coinage taken place between the time of Constantine and
                    Theodosius I. that is, in less than fifty years, the laws of that period, which
                    are all in the Ιheodosian code, must have noticed it.” To this and other
                    arguments upon the subject Mr Pinkerton adds the following observation upon the
                    value of gold and silver: “As a state advances to its height, gold increases in
                    value; and as a state declines, it decreases, providing the metals are kept on a
                    par as to purity. Hence we may argue, that gold decreased in its relation to
                    silver perhaps four or five centuries, furnished most European kingdoms with
                    gold in coin, which otherwise would, from their want of arts and of intercourse
                    with the East, then the grand seminary of that metal, have been almost
                    altogether ignorant of gold. These gold chins were called Bezants in Europe,
                    because sent from Byzantium or Constantinople, and were <hi rend="italic"
                    >solidi</hi> of the old scale, six to the ounce. In the Byzantine writers, the
                    solidus is also called <hi rend="italic">nomisma,</hi> or the coin; <hi
                    rend="italic">crysinos,</hi> because of gold; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >liyperperos,</hi> from its being refined with fire, or from its being of bright
                    gold flaming like fire. The <hi rend="italic">solidi</hi> also, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">aurei</hi> formerly, received names from the princes whose
                    portraits they bore; as <hi rend="italic">Michelati, Manuelati. Solidus</hi> is
                    a term likewise used for the aureus by Apuleius, who lived in the time of
                    Antoninus the Philosopher; nay, as early as the praetorian edicts of the time of
                    Trajan. It was then a distinction from the semissis or half. In the time of
                    Valerian, when aurei of different sizes had been introduced, it became necessary
                    to distinguish the particular aurei meant. Hence, in the imperial rescripts
                    published by the <hi rend="italic">Historiae Augustae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Scriptores,</hi> Valerian uses the term <hi rend="italic">Philippi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nostri vultus</hi> for the common aurei. Aurelian uses the same
                    term <hi rend="italic">aurei Philippei</hi> for the aurei, which he had restored
                    to their size in some degree. Gallienus uses <hi rend="italic">aurei
                    Valeriani</hi> for his father’s coins. <hi rend="italic">Aurei</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Antoniniani</hi> are likewise put by Valerian for coins of the
                    early Antonini, of superior standard to any then used.</p>
                <p>In the first gold coinage at Rome the aureus was divided into four parts: the
                    semissis of sixty sestertii; the tremissis or third, of forty; the fourth, the
                    name of which is not mentioned, of thirty; and the scrupulum of twenty. But in a
                    short time all of these fell into disuse, except the semissis or half, which is
                    extremely scarce; so that it is probable that few have been struck. It is an
                    erroneous opinion (according to Mr Pinkerton) that the semissis was called a <hi
                    rend="italic">denarius aureus.</hi> The aureus itself indeed had this name; but
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">quiìiarius</hi> is applied to the semissis with
                    greater propriety than the former. Trientes or tremisses of gold are found of
                    Valerian and his son Gallienus, and weigh about thirty grains. Those of
                    Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, weigh thirty-three grains. Under the
                    Constantinopolitan empire, tremisses again made their appearance; and from the
                    time of Valentinian downwards, the thirds are the most common kinds of gold,
                    being worth about 4s. sterling. The semissis is likewise mentioned, but none
                    occurs earlier than the time of Basiliscus. The gold tremissis was the pattern
                    of the French and Spanish gold coins; as the silver denarius, in its diminished
                    state, was of the Gothic and Saxon penny.</p>
                <p>We shall close this account of the Roman money with some remarks concerning the
                    mint and method of coinage. This at first seems to have been under the direction
                    of the quaestor. About the time that silver was first coined in Rome, viz. about
                    266 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> the <hi rend="italic">triumviri</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">monetales</hi> were created. They were at first of senatorial
                    rank, but were by Augustus chosen from amongst the equestrian order; and the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">triumviri</hi> was continued till after the time of
                    Caracalla; but under Aurelian there was probably but one master of the mint,
                    called <hi rend="italic">rationalis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Pinkerton
                    is of opinion that the change took place under Gallienus. He seems also to have
                    permitted the provincial cities to coin gold and silver, as well as to have
                    altered the form of the mints in the capital, and to have ordered them all to
                    strike money with Latin legends, and of the same forms; as in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194206036" xml:id="kp-eb0714-6036-0478"/>his time we first meet with
                    coins with mint marks of cities and offices. The violent insurrection which took
                    place in his reign has already been mentioned, as well as its probable cause;
                    and Mr Gibbon has shown, that the concealed enemies of Aurelian took such
                    advantage of this insurrection, that it cost 7000 of his best troops before it
                    could be quelled. About this time the <hi rend="italic">procurator monetae</hi>
                    seems to have succeeded the <hi rend="italic">rationalis</hi> as director of the
                    mint. In the colonies, the direction of the mint seems to have been given to the
                    decemviri, whose names frequently occur in colonial coins, which, though
                    generally of rude invention and ruder execution, are yet often interesting and
                    important.</p>
                <p>The engraving of the ancient dies used in coinage was a work of much genius and
                    labour, and at Rome Greek artists were generally employed in it; but it has been
                    thought a matter of great surprise that scarce any two ancient coins are to be
                    found exactly the same. Hence some antiquaries have imagined that only a single
                    coin was thrown off from each die. Beauvais informs us that the only two Roman
                    imperial coins of the first times which he had seen perfectly alike were those
                    of the Emperor Galba. It is, however, the opinion of the best judges, that a
                    perfect similarity between two medals is a very great reason for supposing one
                    of them to be forged. “It must also be observed,” says Mr Pinkerton, “that the
                    differences in coins apparently from the same die are often so minute as to
                    escape an eye not used to microscopic observations of this sort. But it would be
                    surprising if any two ancient coins were now found struck with the same die;
                    for, out of each million issued, not above one has reached us. Dies soon gave
                    way by the violence of the work, and the ancients had no puncheons or matrices,
                    but were forced to engrave many dies for the same coin. Even in our mint, upon
                    sending for a shilling’s worth of new halfpence, it will appear that three or
                    four dies have been used. Sometimes the obverse of the die gives way, sometimes
                    the reverse; but among us it is renewed by puncheons, though with variations in
                    the lettering or other minute strokes; while the ancients were forced to recur
                    to another die differently engraven. The engravers of the die were called <hi
                    rend="italic">caelatores</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> other officers employed in
                    the mint were the <hi rend="italic">spectatores,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >expectatores,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nummularii.</hi> The melters were
                    styled <hi rend="italic">fu-sarii, flatuarii,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >flaturarii</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> those who adjusted the weight were
                    called <hi rend="italic">acquatores</hi><hi rend="italic">monetarum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> those who put the pieces into the die, <hi rend="italic"
                    >supposi tores</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and those who struck them, <hi
                    rend="italic">malleatores.</hi> At the head of each office was an officer named
                    <hi rend="italic">primicerius,</hi> and the foreman was named <hi rend="italic"
                    >optio</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">exactor?</hi></p>
                <p>In order to assist the high relief on the coins, the metal, after being melted
                    and refined, was cast into bullets, as appears from the ancient coins not being
                    cut or filed on the edges, but often cracked, and always rough and unequal.
                    These bullets were then put into the die, and received the impression by
                    repeated strokes of the hammer, though sometimes a machine appears to have been
                    used for this purpose; for Boiterue informs us, that there was a picture of the
                    Roman mintage in a grotto near Baiae, where a machine was represented holding up
                    a large stone, as if to let it fall suddenly, and strike the coin at once. None
                    of the ancient money was cast in moulds, excepting the most ancient and very
                    large Roman brass, commonly called <hi rend="italic">weights,</hi> and other
                    Italian pieces of that sort; all the rest being mere forgeries of ancient and
                    modern times. Some Roman moulds which have been found are a proof of this; and
                    from these certain medallists have erroneously imagined that the ancients first
                    cast their money in moulds, and then stamped it in order to make the impression
                    more clear and sharp.</p>
                <p>The ancients had some knowledge of the method of cre-nating the edges of their
                    coins, which they did by cutting out regular notches upon them; and of this kind
                    we find some of the Syrian and ancient consular coins, with a few others. The
                    former were cast in this shape, and then struck; but the latter were crenated by
                    incision, to prevent forgery, by showing the inside of the metal. But the
                    ancient forgers also found out a method of imitating this; for Pinkerton informs
                    us that he had a Roman consular coin, of which the incisions, like the rest,
                    were plated with silver over the copper.</p>
                <p>VI.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Preservation of Medals.</hi></p>
                <p>We now come to consider what it is that distinguishes one medal from another, and
                    why some are so highly prized in comparison of others. This, in general, besides
                    its genuineness, consists in the high degree of preservation in which it exists.
                    This is called by Pinkerton the <hi rend="italic">conservation</hi> of medals,
                    and is by him regarded as <hi rend="italic">good</hi> and as <hi rend="italic"
                    >perfect.</hi> In this he says that a true judge is so nice, that he will reject
                    even the rarest coins if in the least defaced either in the figures or legend.
                    Some, however, are obliged to content themselves with those which are a little
                    rubbed, whilst those of superior taste and abilities have in their cabinets only
                    such as are in the very state in which they came from the mint; and such, he
                    says, are the cabinets of Sir Robert Austin, and Horace Walpole, of Roman
                    silver, at Strawberryhill. It is absolutely necessary, however, that a coin be
                    in what is called <hi rend="italic">good</hi> preservation; which in the Greek
                    or Roman emperors, and the colonial coins, is supposed to be when the legends
                    can be read with some difficulty; but when the conservation is perfect, and the
                    coin just as it came from the mint, even the most common coins are valuable.</p>
                <p>The fine rust, like varnish, which covers the surface of brass and copper coins,
                    is found to be the best preserver of them, and is brought on by lying in a
                    certain kind of soil. Gold cannot be contaminated but by iron mould, which
                    happens when the coin lies in a soil impregnated with iron; but silver is
                    susceptible of various kinds.of rust, principally green and red, both of which
                    yield to vinegar. In gold and silver coins the rust must be removed, as being
                    prejudicial; but in brass and copper it is preservative and ornamental, a
                    circumstance taken notice of by the ancients. “This fine rust,” says Mr
                    Pinkerton, “which is indeed a natural varnish not imitable by the art of man, is
                    sometimes of a delicate blue, like that of a turquoise; sometimes of a bronze
                    brown, equal to that observable in ancient statues of bronze, and so highly
                    prized; and sometimes of an exquisite green, a little on the azure hue, which
                    last is the most beautiful of all. It is also found of a fine purple, of olive,
                    and of a cream colour or pale yellow; which last is exquisite, and shows the
                    impression to as much advantage as paper of cream colour, used in all great
                    foreign presses, does copperplates and printing. The Neapolitan patina (the rust
                    in question) is of a light green; and, when free from excrescence or blemish, is
                    very beautiful. Sometimes the purple patina gleams through an upper coat of
                    another colour, with as fine effect as a variegated silk or gem. In a few
                    instances a rust of a deeper green is found; and it is sometimes spotted with
                    the red or bronze shade, which gives it quite the appearance of the East Indian
                    stone called the <hi rend="italic">blood-stone.</hi> These rusts are all, when
                    the real product of time, as bardas the metal itself, and preserve it much
                    better than any artificial varnish could have done; concealing at the same time
                    not the most minute particle of the impression of the coin.”</p>
                <p>The value of medals is lowered when any of the letters of the legend are
                    misplaced; as a suspicion of forgery is thus induced. Such is the case with many
                    of those of Claudius Gothicus. The same, or even greater, diminution in value
                    takes place in such coins as have not been well fixed in the die, which has
                    occasioned their slipping <pb break="no" facs="nls:194206049"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-6049-0479"/>under the strokes of the hammer, and thus made a
                    double or triple image. Many coins of this kind are found, in which the one side
                    is perfectly well formed, but the other blundered in the manner just mentioned.
                    Another blemish, but of smaller moment, and which to some may be rather a
                    recommendation, is when the workmen through inattention have put another coin
                    into the die without taking out the former. Thus the coin is convex on one side,
                    and concave on the other, having the same figure upon both its sides.</p>
                <p>The medals said by the judges in this science to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >countermarked</hi> are very rare, and highly valued. They have a small stamp
                    impressed upon them; in some a head, in others a few letters, such as <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Aug</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">:</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">n.
                    probus, &amp;c.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi> which marks are supposed to
                    imply an alteration in the value of the coin, as was the case with the
                    countermarked coins of Henry VIII. and Queen Mary of Scotland. Some have a small
                    hole through them; sometimes with a little ring fastened in it, having been used
                    as ornaments; but this makes no alteration in their value. Neither is it any
                    diminution in the value of a coin that it is split at the edges; for coins of
                    undoubted antiquity have often been found in this state, the cause of which has
                    been already explained. On the contrary, this cracking is generally considered
                    as a great merit; but Mr Pinkerton suspects that one of these cracked coins has
                    given rise to an error with respect to the wife of Carausius, who reigned for
                    some time in Britain. The inscription is read <hi rend="smallcaps">ohiuna
                    Aug;</hi> and there is a crack in the medal just before the O of ori-una.
                    Without this crack Mr Pinkerton supposes that it would have been read <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fortuna Aug.</hi></p>
                <p>Some particular soils have the property of giving silver a yellow colour, as if
                    it had been gilt. It naturally acquires a black colour through time,Wiich any
                    sulphureous vapour will bring on in a few minutes. From its being so susceptible
                    of injuries, it was always mixed by the ancients with much alloy, in order to
                    harden it. Hence the impressions of the ancient silver coins remain perfect to
                    this day, whilst those of modern coins are obliterated in a few years. On this
                    account Pinkerton expresses a wish that modern states would allow a much greater
                    proportion of alloy in their silver coin than they usually do. As gold admits of
                    no rust except that from iron above mentioned, the coins of this metal are
                    generally in perfect conservation, and fresh as from the mint. ∙</p>
                <p>To cleanse gold coins from this rust, it is best to steep them in aquafortis,
                    which, though a very powerful solvent of other metals, has no effect upon gold.
                    Silver may be cleansed by steeping for a day or two in vinegar, but more
                    effectually by boiling in water with three parts of tartar and one of sea-salt;
                    on both these metals, however, the rust is always in spots, and never forms an
                    entire incrustation, as on brass or copper. The coins of these two metals must
                    never be cleansed, as they would thus be rendered full of small holes eaten by
                    the rust. Sometimes, however, they are found so totally obscured with rust, that
                    nothing can be discovered upon them; in which case it is best to clear them with
                    a graver; but it may also be done by boiling them for twenty-four hours in water
                    with three parts of tartar and one of alum; not sea-salt, as in silver
                    coins.</p>
                <p>The high state of preservation in which ancient coins are usually found is thus
                    accounted for by Mr Hancarville. He observes, that the chief reason is the
                    custom of the ancients always to bury one or more coins with their dead, in
                    order to pay for their passage over the river Styx. “From Phidon of Argos,” says
                    he, “to Constantine I. are thirty-six generations; and from Magna Graecia to the
                    Euphrates, from Cyrene to the Euxine Sea, Grecian arts prevailed, and the
                    inhabitants amounted to above 30,000,000. There died, therefore, in that time
                    and region, not less than ten thousand millions of people, all of whom had coins
                    of one sort or other buried with them. The tombs were sacred and untouched; and
                    afterwards neglected, till modern curiosity or chance began to disclose them.
                    The urn of Flavia Valentina, in Mr Towley’s capital collection, contained seven
                    brass coins of Antoninus Pius and Heliogabalus. Such are generally black, from
                    being burnt with the dead. The best and freshest coins were used on these
                    occasions from respect to the dead; and hence their fine conservation. At
                    Syracuse a skeleton was found in a tomb, with a beautiful gold coin in its
                    mouth; and innumerable other instances might be given, for hardly is a funeral
                    urn found without coins. Other incidents also conspire to furnish us with
                    numbers of ancient coins, though the above-recited circumstance be the chief
                    cause of perfect conservation. In Sicily, the silver coins with the head of
                    Proserpine were found in such numbers as to weigh 600 French livres or pounds.
                    In the sixteenth century, 60,000 Roman coins were found at Modena, thought to be
                    a military chest hid after the battle of Bedriacum, when Otho was defeated by
                    Vitellius. Near Brest, in the year 1760, between 20,000 and 30,000 Roman coins
                    were found. A treasure of gold coins of Lysimachus was found at Deva on the
                    Marus; and Strabo (lib. vii.) and Pausanias (in <hi rend="italic">Attic.)</hi>
                    tell that he was defeated by the Getae, at which time this treasure seems to
                    have fallen into their hands.</p>
                <p>Thus far Mr Pinkerton, proceeding on the authority of Mr Hancarville and others.
                    But considering these vast numbers of coins found in various places, it seems
                    surprising how so few should now remain in the cabinets of the curious, as the
                    same author informs us that the whole of the different ancient coins known to us
                    amount only to about 80,000, though he owns that the calculation cannot be
                    esteemed accurate.</p>
                <p>VII.— <hi rend="italic">How to distinguish true Medals from
                    Counterfeits.</hi></p>
                <p>The most difficult and the most important thing in the whole science of medals is
                    the method of distinguishing the true from the counterfeit. The value put upon
                    ancient coins made the forgery of them almost coeval with the science itself;
                    and as no laws inflict a punishment upon such forgers, men of great genius and
                    abilities have undertaken the trade: but whether to the real detriment of the
                    science or not, is a matter of some doubt; for if only exact copies of genuine
                    medals are sold for the originals, the imposition may be deemed trifling. But
                    the case must be accounted very different, if people take it upon them to forge
                    medals which never existed. At first the forgeries were extremely gross; and
                    medals were forged of Priam, of Aristotle, Artemisia, Hannibal, and most of the
                    other illustrious personages of antiquity. Most of these were done in such a
                    manner, that the fraud could easily be discovered; but others have imposed even
                    upon very learned men. Pinkerton mentions a remarkable medal of the Emperor
                    Heraclius, representing him in a chariot on the reverse, with Greek and Latin
                    inscriptions, which Joseph Scaliger and Lipsius imagined to have been struck in
                    his own time, but which was certainly issued in Italy in the fifteenth century.
                    “Other learned men;” says he, “have been strangely misled, when speaking of
                    coins; for to be learned in one subject excludes not gross ignorance in others.
                    Budaeus <hi rend="italic">(de</hi><hi rend="italic">Asse)</hi> quotes a denarius
                    of Cicero, <hi rend="smallcaps">μ. Tull.</hi> Erasmus, in one of his Epistles,
                    tells us with great gravity, that the gold coin ofBrutus struck in Thrace,
                    KOΣ∩N, bears the patriarch Noah coming out of the ark with his two sons, and
                    takes the Roman eagle for the dove with the olive branch. Winkelman, in his
                    letters, informs us that the small brass piece with Virgil’s head, reverse EPO,
                    is undoubtedly ancient Roman; and adds, that no <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194206062" xml:id="kp-eb0714-6062-0480"/>knowledge of coins can be had
                    out of Rome; but Winkelman, so conversant in statues, knew nothing of coins. It
                    is from other artists and other productions that any danger of deceit arises.
                    And there is no wonder that even the skilful are misled by such artists as have
                    used this trade; for among them appear the names of Victor Gambello, Giovani del
                    Cavino, called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Paduan,</hi> and his son Alessandro
                    Bassiano. likewise of Padua, Benvenuto Cellini, Alessandro Greco, Leo Aretino,
                    Jacobo da Frezzo, Federigo Bonzagna, and Giovani Jacopo, his brother; Sebastiano
                    Plumbo, Valerio de Vizenza, Gorlaeus, a German, Carteron of Holland, and others,
                    all or most of them of the 16th century; and Cavino the Paduan, who is the most
                    famous, lived in the middle of that century. The forgeries of Cavino are held in
                    no little esteem, being of wonderful execution. His and those of Carteron are
                    the most numerous, many of the other artists here mentioned not having forged
                    above two or three coins. Later forgers were Dervieu of Florence, who confined
                    himself to medallions, and Cogomier, who gave coins of the thirty tyrants in
                    small brass. The chief part of the forgeries of Greek medals which have come to
                    my knowledge are of the first mentioned, and a very gross kind, representing
                    persons who could never appear upon coin, such as Priam, ,‰neas, Plato,
                    Alcibiades, Artemisia, and others. The real Greek coins were very little known
                    or valued till the works of Goltzius appeared, which were happily posterior to
                    the era of the grand forgers. Why later forgers have seldom thought of
                    counterfeiting them cannot he easily accounted for, if it is not owing to the
                    masterly workmanship of the originals, which set all imitation at defiance.
                    Forgeries, however, of most ancient coins may be met with, and of the Greek
                    among the rest.”</p>
                <p>The forgeries are more conspicuous among the Roman medals than any other kind of
                    coins; but we are not to look upon all these as the work of modern artists. On
                    the contrary, we are assured that many of them were fabricated in the times of
                    the Romans themselves, some of them being even held in more estimation than the
                    genuine coins themselves, on account of their being plated, and otherwise
                    executed in a manner to which modern forgers could never attain. Even the
                    ancients held some of these counterfeits in such estimation, that Pliny informs
                    us there were frequently many true denarii given for one false one. Caracalla is
                    said to have coined money of copper and lead plated with silver; and plated
                    coins, the work of ancient forgers, occur of many Greek cities and princes; nay,
                    there are even forgeries of barbaric coins, “Some Roman coins,” says Mr
                    Pinkerton, “are found of iron or lead plated with brass, perhaps trials of the
                    skill of the forger. Iron is the most common; but one decursio of Nero is known
                    of lead plated with copper. Neumann justly observes, that no historic faith can
                    be put in plated coins, and that most faulty reverses, &amp;c. arise from plated
                    coins not being noticed as such. Even of the Roman consular coins not very many
                    have ever been forged. The celebrated silver denarius of Brutus, with the cap of
                    liberty and two daggers, is the chief instance of a consular coin of which a
                    counterfeit is known. But it is easily rejected by this mark: in the true coin
                    the cap of liberty is below the guard or hilt of the daggers; in the false, the
                    top of it rises above that hilt.</p>
                <p>The imperial series of medals is the grand object of modern medallic forgeries;
                    and the deception was at first extended to the most eminent writers upon the
                    subject. The counterfeits are by Mr Pinkerton divided into six classes.</p>
                <p>I. Such as are known to be imitations, but valued on account of the artists by
                    whom they are executed. In this class the medals of the Paduan rank highest; the
                    others being so numerous that a complete series of imperial medals of almost
                    every kind, nay, almost of every medallion, may be formed from among them. In
                    France, particularly, by far the greater part <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    cabinets are filled with counterfeits of this kind. They are distinguished from
                    such as are genuine by the following marks: 1. The counterfeits are almost
                    universally thinner. 2. They arc never worn or damaged. 3. The letters are
                    modern. 4. They are either destitute of varnish entirely, or have a false one,
                    which is easily known by its being black, shining, and greasy, and very easily
                    hurt by the touch of a needle, while the varnish of ancient medals is as hard as
                    the metal itself. Instead of the greasy black varnish above mentioned, indeed,
                    they have sometimes a light green one, spotted with a kind of iron marks, and
                    composed of sulphur, verdigris, and vinegar. It may frequently be distinguished
                    by the hairstrokes of the pencil with which it was laid on being visible upon
                    it. 5. The sides are either filed or too much smoothed by art, or bear the marks
                    of a small hammer. 6. The counterfeits are always exactly circular, which is not
                    the case with ancient medals, especially after the time of Trajan.</p>
                <p>The Paduan forgeries may be distinguished from those of inferior artists by the
                    following marks: 1. The former arc seldom thinner than the ancient: 2. They very
                    seldom appear as worn or damaged, but the others very frequently, especially in
                    the reverse, and legend of the reverse, which sometimes, as in forged Othos,
                    appear as half consumed by time: 3. The letters in moulds taken from the antique
                    coins have the rudeness of antiquity: 4. False varnish is commonly light green
                    or black, and shines too much or too little: 5. The sides of forged coins are
                    frequently quite smooth, and undistinguishable from the ancient, though to
                    accomplish this requires but little art: 6. Counterfeit medals are frequently as
                    irregular in their form as the genuine; but the Paduan are generally circular,
                    though false coins have often little pieces cutoff, in perfect imitation of the
                    genuine: 7. In cast coins, the letters do not go sharp down into the medal, and
                    have no fixed outline; their minute angles, as well as those of the drapery, are
                    commonly filled up, and have not the sharpness of the genuine kind. Where the
                    letters or figures are faint, the coin is greatly to be suspected.</p>
                <p>The letters form the great criterion of medals, the ancient being very rude, but
                    the modern otherwise; the reason of which, according to Cellini, is, that the
                    ancients engraved all their matrices with the graver or hurin, while the modern
                    forgers strike theirs with a punch.</p>
                <p>According to Vico the false patina is green, black, russet, brown, gray, and iron
                    colour. The green is made from verdigris, the black is the smoke of sulphur, the
                    gray is made of chalk steeped in urine, the coin being left for some days in the
                    mixture. The russet is next to the natural, by reason of its being a kind of
                    froth which the fire forces from ancient coins; but when false, it shines too
                    much. To make it, they frequently took the large brass coins of the Ptolemies,
                    which were often corroded, and made them red hot in the fire, put the coins upon
                    them, and a fine patina adhered. Sometimes they took an old defaced coin,
                    covered with real patina, and stamped it anew; but the patina is then too bright
                    in the cavities, and too dull in the protuberances. The trial of brass coins
                    with the tongue is not to be despised; for, if modern, the patina tastes bitter
                    or pungent, while, if ancient, it is quite tasteless.</p>
                <p>Mr Pinkerton informs us, that all medallions from Julius Caesar to Adrian are
                    much to be suspected <hi rend="italic">of</hi> forgery; the true medals of the
                    first fourteen emperors being exceedingly valuable, and to be found only in the
                    cabinets of princes.</p>
                <p>II. The second class of counterfeit medals contains those cast from moulds taken
                    from the Paduan forgeries, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194206075"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-6075-0481"/>others done by eminent masters. These are
                    sometimes more difficult to be discovered than the former, because in casting
                    them they can give any degree of thickness they please; and, filling the small
                    sandholes with mastic, they retouch the letters with a graver, and cover the
                    whole with varnish. The instructions already given for the former class,
                    however, are also useful for those of the second; with this addition, that
                    medals of this class are generally lighter than the genuine, because fire
                    rarefies the metal in some degree, whilst that which is struck is rather
                    condensed by the strokes. In gold and silver medals there cannot be any
                    deception of this kind, because these metals admit not of patina, and
                    consequently the varnish betrays the imposition. The marks of the file on the
                    margin of those of the second class are a certain sign of forgery, though these
                    do not always indicate the forgery to be of modern date, because the Romans
                    often filed the edges of coins to accommodate them to the purposes of ornament,
                    as quarter guineas are sometimes put into the bottoms of punch ladles. It is
                    common to imitate the holes of medals made by time, by means of aquafortis; but
                    this destroys the sides of a coin more effectually than if it had been naturally
                    corroded. The fraud, however, is not easily distinguished.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Medals cast in moulds from the antique.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> In this mode some forgers, as Beauvais informs us, have
                    been so very careful, that they would melt a common medal of the emperor whom
                    they meant to counterfeit, lest the quality of the metal should betray them.
                    “This,” says Pinkerton, “has been done in the silver Septimius Severus, with the
                    reverse of a triumphal arch, for which a common coin of the same prince has been
                    melted; and in other instances.” Putting medals in the fire or upon hot iron to
                    cleanse them, gives them an appearance of being cast; for some spots of the
                    metal, being softer than the rest, will run, which makes this one of the worst
                    methods of cleaning medals. The directions given for discovering the two former
                    deceptions hold good also in this.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Ancient medals retouched and altered.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> This is a class of counterfeits more difficult to be discovered than any
                    other. “The art,” says Pinkerton, “exerted in this class is astonishing; and a
                    connoisseur is the less apt to suspect it, because the coins themselves are in
                    fact ancient. The acute minds of the Italian artists exerted themselves in this
                    way when the other forgeries became common and known. With graving tools they
                    alter the portraits, the reverses, and the inscriptions themselves, in a
                    surprising manner. Of a Claudius struck at Antioch they make an Otho; of a
                    Faustina, a Titiana; of a Julia Severa, a Didia Clara; of a Macrinus, a
                    Pescennius, &amp;c. Give them a Marcus Aurelius, he starts up a Pertinax, by
                    thickening the beard a little, and enlarging the nose. In short, wherever there
                    is the least resemblance in persons, reverses, or legends, an artist may from a
                    trivial medal generate a most scarce and valuable one. This fraud is
                    distinguishable by the false varnish which sometimes masks it; but, above all,
                    by the letters of the legend, which are always altered. Though this be sometimes
                    done with an artifice almost miraculous, yet most commonly the characters
                    straggle, are disunited, and not in a line.”</p>
                <p>In counterfeits of this kind, sometimes the obverse is not touched, but the
                    reverse made hollow, and filled with mastic coloured like the coin, and engraved
                    with such device and legend as is most likely to bring a great price; others are
                    only retouched in some minute parts, by which, however, the value of the coin is
                    much diminished. Against all these arts severe scrutiny must be made by the
                    purchaser, upon the medal itself; and the investigation and opinion of eminent
                    antiquaries must be obtained as to its being altered, or genuine when issued
                    from the mint.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Medals impressed with new devices, or soldered.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> In the first article of this class the reverses have been
                    totally filed off, and new ones impressed with a die and hammer. This is done by
                    putting the face or obverse, whichever is not touched, upon different folds of
                    pasteboard, and then applying the die and striking it with a hammer. The forgery
                    in this class is very easily discovered, because the devices and inscriptions on
                    the counterfeits are known not to exist on true medals; as the Pons Aelius on
                    the reverse of Hadrian, the Expeditio Judaica of the same emperor, &amp;c. The
                    difference of fabrication in the face or reverse will be discovered at the first
                    glance by any person of skill. &gt;</p>
                <p>The soldered medals consist of two halves belonging to different medals, sawed
                    through the middle, and then joined with solder. This mode of counterfeiting is
                    common in silver and in brass coins. « They will take an Antoninus, for example,
                    and saw off the reverse, then solder to the obverse, which they have treated in
                    the same manner. This makes a medal which, from an unknowing purchaser, will
                    bring a hundred times the price of the two coins which compose it. When the
                    deceit is used in brass coins, they take care that the metals be of one hue,
                    though indeed some pretenders in this way sometimes solder copper and brass
                    together, which at once reveals the deceit. Medals which havé a portrait on each
                    side, and which are generally valuable, are the most liable to a suspicion of
                    this fraud. To a very nice eye the minute ring of solder is always visible; and
                    upon inserting a graver, the fabrication falls into halves.”</p>
                <p>In the same manner reverses are sometimes soldered to faces not originally
                    belonging to them; as one mentioned by Ptre Jobert, of Domitian with an
                    amphitheatre, with a reverse of Titus joined to it. Another art is sometimes
                    made use of in this kind of counterfeits, of which there is an instance in the
                    temple of Janus upon Nero’s medals, where the middle brass is taken off, and.
                    inserted in a cavity made in the middle of a large coin of that prince. In the
                    coins of the lower empire, however, the reverses of medals are sometimes so
                    connected with their obverses, that a suspicion of forgery sometimes occurs
                    without any foundation. They arc met with most commonly after the time of
                    Gallienus, when such a number of usurpers arose that it was difficult to obtain
                    an exact portrait of their features; the coiners, therefore, had not time to
                    strike a medal for these as they could have done for other emperors who reigned
                    longer. Hence, on the reverse of a medal of Marius, who reigned only three days,
                    there is <hi rend="smallcaps">pacator orbis,</hi> which shows that at that time
                    they had reverses ready fabricated, to be applied as occasion might require.</p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Plated medals, or those which have clefts.·</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> It has been already remarked, that many true medals are
                    cracked in the edges, owing to the repeated strokes of the hammer, and the
                    little degree of ductility which the metal possesses. This the forgers attempt
                    to imitate by a file; but it is easy to distinguish between the natural and
                    artificial cleft, by means of a small needle. The natural cleft is wide at the
                    extremity, and appears to have a kind of almost imperceptible filaments; the
                    edges of the crack corresponding with each other in a manner which no art can
                    imitate.</p>
                <p>The plated medals which have been forged in ancient times were long supposed to
                    be capable of resisting every effort of modern imitation; but latterly some
                    ingenious rogues thought of piercing false medals of silver with a red-hot
                    needle, which gave a blackness to the inside of the coin, and made it appear
                    plated to an injudicious eye. This fraud, however, is easily distinguished by
                    scraping the inside <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the metal. But it is nevertheless
                    very difficult to distinguish the forgeries of rude money when not cast; and Mr
                    Pinkerton gives no other direction than to consult a skilful medallist. Indeed,
                    notwithstanding all the directions<pb break="no" facs="nls:194206088"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-6088-0482"/> already given, this seems to be a resource which
                    cannot by any means with safety be neglected. A real and practical knowledge of
                    coins is only to be acquired by seeing a great number, and comparing the forged
                    with the genuine. It cannot, therefore, be too much recommended to the young
                    connoisseur, who wishes to acquire knowledge in this way, to visit all the sales
                    and cabinets he can, and to look upon all ancient medals with a very microscopic
                    eye. By these means only is to be acquired that ready knowledge which enables
                    one at the first glance to pronounce upon a forgery, however ingenious. Nor let
                    it be concluded from this that the science of medals is uncertain; for no
                    knowledge is more certain and immediate, when it is properly studied by
                    examination of the real objects. A man who buys coins, trusting merely to his
                    theoretic perusal of medallic books, will find himself wofully mistaken. He
                    ought first to study coins, where they can only be studied, in themselves. Nor
                    need it be matter of wonder, or held to imply caprice, that a medallist of skill
                    should at one perception pronounce upon the genuineness or spuriousness of a
                    medal; for the powers of the human eye, employed in certain lines of science,
                    are amazing. Hence a student can distinguish a book amongst a thousand similar
                    and quite alike to every other eye; and, in the same way, the medallist can say
                    in an instant, “This is a true coin, and this is a false,” though to other
                    people no distinction be perceptible.</p>
                <p>Forgeries of modern coins and medals, Mr Pinkerton observes, are almost
                    as-numerous as of the ancient. The satirical coin of Louis XII. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Perdam Babylonis</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">nomen,</hi> is a
                    remarkable instance; the false coin is larger than the true one, and bears the
                    date 1512. The rude coins of the middle ages are very easily forged, and
                    forgeries have accordingly become common. Forged coins of Alfred and other early
                    princes of England have appeared, some of which have been done with great art.
                    The two noted English pennies of Richard I. are of this stamp, and yet have
                    imposed upon Folkes and Snelling, who have published them as genuine in the two
                    best books upon English coins. But they were fabricated by a Mr White of Newgate
                    Street, a noted collector, who contaminated an otherwise fair character by such
                    practices. Such forgeries, though easy, require a skill in the history and
                    coinage of the times, which luckily can hardly fall to the lot of a common Jew
                    or mechanical forger. But the practice is detestable, were no gain proposed; and
                    they who stoop to it must suppose, that to embarrass the path of any science
                    with forgery and futility, implies no infamy. In forgeries of ancient coin, the
                    fiction is perhaps sufficiently atoned for by the vast skill required; and the
                    artist may plausibly allege that his intention was not to deceive, but to excite
                    his utmost powers, by an attempt to rival the ancient masters. But no possible
                    apology can be made for forging the rude money of more modern times. The crime
                    is certainly greater than that which leads the common coiner to the gallows;
                    inasmuch as it is committed with more ease, and the profit is incomparably
                    larger.</p>
                <p>VIII— <hi rend="italic">Of the Value of Medals.</hi></p>
                <p>All ancient coins and medals, though equally genuine, are not equally valuable.
                    In medals, as well as in everything else, the scarcity of a coin stamps a value
                    upon it which cannot otherwise be derived from its intrinsic worth. There arc
                    usually reckoned four or five degrees of rarity,∣the highest of which is called
                    <hi rend="italic">unique.</hi> The cause is generally ascribed to the fewness of
                    the number thrown off originally, or to their having been called in, and
                    recoined in another form. To the former cause Mr Pinkerton ascribes the scarcity
                    of the copper of Otho and the gold of Fescennius Niger; to the latter that of
                    the coinage of Caligula, though this last is not of singular rarity; which shows
                    that even the power of the Roman senate could not annihilate an established
                    money, and that the first cause of rarity, arising from the small quantity
                    originally struck, ought to be regarded as the principal.</p>
                <p>In the ancient cities Mr Pinkerton ascribes the scarcity of coin to the poverty
                    or the smallness of the state; but the scarcity of ancient regal and imperial
                    coins arises principally from the shortness of the reign, and sometimes from the
                    superabundance of money before, which rendered it almost unnecessary to coin any
                    money during the reign of the prince. An example of this we have in the scarcity
                    of the shillings of George III. which shows that shortness of reign does not
                    always occasion a scarcity of coin; and thus the coins of Harold II. who did not
                    reign a year, are very numerous, whilst those of Richard I. who reigned ten, are
                    almost unique.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the rarest coins lose their value, and become common. This our author
                    ascribes to the high price given for them, which tempts the possessors to bring
                    them to market; but chiefly to the discovering of hoards of them. The former
                    cause operated in regard to Queen Anne’s farthings, some of which formerly sold
                    at five guineas; nay, if we could believe the newspapers, one of them was some
                    years ago sold for L.960; the latter operated in respect to the coins of Canute
                    the Danish king of England, which were very rare till a hoard of them was
                    discovered in the Orkneys. As discoveries of this kind, however, produce a
                    temporary plenty, so, when they are dispersed, the former scarcity returns;
                    whilst, on the other hand, some of the common coins become rare through the mere
                    circumstance of neglect.</p>
                <p>As double the number of copper coins of Greek cities are to be met with that
                    there are of silver, the latter are of consequence much more esteemed; but the
                    reverse is the case with those of the Greek princes. All the Greek civic coins
                    of silver are very rare, excepting those of Athens, Corinth, Messana,
                    Dyrrhachium, Massilia, Syracuse, and some others. Of the Greek monarchic coins,
                    the most rare are the tetradrachms of the kings of Syria, the Ptolemies, the
                    sovereigns of Macedonia and Bithynia, excepting those of Alexander the Great and
                    Lysimachus. Those of the kings of Cappadocia are of a small size, and scarcely
                    to be met with. Of those of Numidia and Mauritania, the coins of Juba the father
                    are common; but those of the son, and nephew Ptolemy, are scarce. Coins of the
                    kings of Sicilv, Parthia, and Judaea, are rare; the last very much so. We meet
                    with no coins of the kings of Arabia and Comagene excepting in brass; those of
                    the kings of Bosphorus are in electrum, and a few in brass, but all of them
                    rare; as are likewise those of Philetenis king of Pergamus, and of the kings of
                    Pontus. In the year 1777, a coin of Mithridates sold for L.26. 5s. Didrachms of
                    all kings and cities are scarce, excepting those of Corinth and her colonies;
                    but the gold coins of Philip of Macedonia, Alexander the Great, and Lysimachus,
                    as has already been observed, are common. The silver tetradrachms of all kings
                    bear a very high price. The didrachm of Alexander the Great is one of the
                    scarcest of the smaller Greek silver coins; some of the other princes are not
                    uncommon.</p>
                <p>In most cases the copper money of the Greek monarchs is scarce; but that of Hiero
                    I. of Syracuse is uncommonly plentiful, as well as that of several of the
                    Ptolemies.</p>
                <p>The most rare of the consular Roman coins are those restored by Trajan; of the
                    others, the gold consular coins are the most rare, and the silver the most
                    common; excepting the coin of Brutus with the cap of liberty, already mentioned,
                    and some others. Some of the Roman imperial coins are very scarce, particularly
                    those of Otho in brass, nor indeed does he occur at all on any coin struck at
                    Rome; but the reason of this may with great probability<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194206101" xml:id="kp-eb0714-6101-0483"/> be supposed to have been the
                    shortness of his reign. His portrait upon the brass coins of Egypt and Antioch
                    is very bad, as well as almost all the other imperial coins of Greek cities. The
                    best likeness is on his gold and silver coins; the latter of which are very
                    common. The Greek and Egyptian coins are all of small and middling sizes, and
                    have reverses of various kinds; those of Antioch have Latin legends, as well as
                    most of the other imperial coins of Antioch. They have no other reverse but the
                    SC in a wreath, excepting in one instance or two of the large and middle brass,
                    where the inscriptions are in Greek. Latin coins of Otho in brass, with figures
                    on the reverse, are certainly false, though in the cabinet of D’Ennery at Paris
                    there was an Otho in middle brass restored by Titus, which was esteemed genuine
                    by connoisseurs.</p>
                <p>The leaden coins at Home are very scarce. Most of them are pieces struck or cast
                    upon occasion of the saturnalia; others are tickets for festivals and
                    exhibitions, both public and private. The common tickets for theatres were made
                    of lead, as were the <hi rend="italic">contomiati,</hi> perpetual tickets, like
                    the English silver tickets for the opera. Leaden medallions are also found below
                    the foundations of pillars and other public buildings, where they had been
                    placed to perpetuate the memory of the founders. From the time of Augustus also
                    we find that leaden seals were used. The work of Ticoini upon this subject,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Piombi</hi><hi rend="italic">Antiochi,</hi> is much
                    recommended by Mr Pinkerton.</p>
                <p>The Roman coins, which have been blundered in the manner formerly mentioned, are
                    very rare, and undeservedly valued by the connoisseurs. The blunders in the
                    legends of these coins, which in all probability are the mere effects of
                    accident, have been so far mistaken by some medallists, that they have given
                    rise to imaginary emperors who never existed. A coin of Faustina, which has on
                    the reverse sousτι. s. c. puzzled all the German antiquaries, till at last Klotz
                    gave it the following facetious interpretation: <hi rend="italic">Sine
                    omni</hi><hi rend="italic">utilitate sectamini tantas ineptias.</hi></p>
                <p>The hcptarchic coins of England are generally rare, except those called <hi
                    rend="italic">stycas,</hi> which are very common, as well as those of Burgred
                    king of Mercia. The coins of Alfred which bear his bust are scarce, and his
                    other money much more so. Those of Hardyknute are so rare that it was even
                    denied that they bad an existence; but Mr Pinkerton informs us that there are
                    three in the British Museum, upon all of which the name <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hartricanut</hi> is quite legible. No English coins of King John are to be met
                    with, though there are some Irish ones; and only French coins of Richard I. are
                    met with. “Leake,” says Pinkerton, “made a strange blunder, in ascribing coins
                    of different kings with two faces, and otherwise spoiled in the stamping, to
                    this"prince, in which, as usual, he has been followed by a misled number.”</p>
                <p>Coins of Alexander II. of Scotland are rather scarce, but those of Alexander III.
                    are more plentiful. Those of John Baliol are rare, and none of Edward Baliol are
                    now to be found.</p>
                <p>IX.— <hi rend="italic">Arrangement of Medals, with the Instruction to be derived
                    from them.</hi></p>
                <p>Having thus given a full account of every thing generally relating to medals, we
                    now proceed to give some particulars respecting their arrangement, and the
                    entertainment which a medallist may expect from the trouble and expense he
                    incurs in making a collection.</p>
                <p>It has already been observed, that one of the principal uses of medals is the
                    elucidation of ancient history. Hence the arrangement of his medals is the first
                    thing that must occur in the formation of a cabinet. The most ancient medals
                    with which we are acquainted are those of Alexander I. of Macedonia, who began
                    to reign about 501 years be fore Christ. The series ought consequently to
                    commence with him, and to be succeeded by the medalsof Sicily, Caria, Cyprus,
                    Heraclia, and Pontus. Then follow Egypt, Syria, the Cimmerian Bosphorus, Thrace,
                    Bithynia, Parthia, Armenia, Damascus, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, Pergamus,
                    Galatia, Cilicia, Sparta, Paeonia, Epirus, Illyricum, Gaul, and the Alps,
                    including the space of time from Alexander the Great to the birth of Christ, and
                    which is to be accounted the third medallic series of ancient monarchs. The last
                    series comes down to the fourth century, including some of the monarchs of
                    Thrace, Bosphorus, and Parthia, with those of Comagene, Edessa or Osrhoene,
                    Mauritania, and Judaea. A most distinct series is formed by the Roman emperors
                    from Julius Caesar to the destruction of Rome by the Goths; nay, for a much
                    longer period, were it not that towards the latter part of it the coins become
                    so barbarous as to destroy the beauty of the collection. Many series may be
                    formed of modern potentates.</p>
                <p>By means of medals we can with great certainty determine the various ornaments
                    worn by ancient princes as badges of distinction. The Grecian kings have
                    generally the diadem, without any other ornament; and though in general the side
                    of the face is presented to view, yet in some very ancient Greek and Roman
                    consular coins, full faces of excellent workmanship are met with. On several
                    coins also two or three faces are to be seen, and these are always accounted
                    very valuable.</p>
                <p>The diadem, which was.no more than a ribbon tied round the head with a floating
                    knot behind, adorns all the Grecian princes from first to last, and is almost an
                    infallible mark of sovereign power. In the Roman consular coins it is seen in
                    conjunction with Numa and Ancus, but never afterwards till the time of Licinius,
                    the colleague of Constantine. Diocletian, indeed, according to Mr Gibbon, first
                    wore the diadem; but his portrait upon coins is never adorned with it. So great
                    an aversion had the Romans to kingly power, that they rather allowed their
                    emperors to assume the radiated crown, the symbol of divinity, than to wear a
                    diadem; but after the time of Constantine it becomes common. The radiated crown
                    appears first op the posthumous coins of Augustus as a mark of deification, but
                    in somewhat more than a century it became common.</p>
                <p>The laurel crown, at first a badge of conquest, was afterwards permitted by the
                    senate to be worn by Julius Caesar, in order to hide the baldness of his head.
                    From him all the emperors appear with it on their medals, even to our own times.
                    In the lower empire the crown is sometimes held by a hand above the head, as a
                    mark of piety. Besides these, the naval, mural, and civic crowns appear on the
                    medals both of emperors and of other eminent men, being intended to denote their
                    great actions. The laurel crown is also sometimes worn by the Greek princes. The
                    Arsacidaeof Parthia wear a kind of sash round the head, with their hair in rows
                    of curls like a wig. The Armenian kings have the <hi rend="italic">tiara,</hi> a
                    kind of cap which was esteemed as the badge of imperial power in the East.
                    Conical caps are seen upon the medals of Xerxes, a petty prince of Armenia, and
                    those of Juba the father, the former having a diadem around it.</p>
                <p>The impious vanity of Alexander and his successors, in assuming divine honours,
                    is manifest on their medals, where various symbols of divinity are met with.
                    Some of them have the horn behind their ear, either to denote their strength, or
                    that they were the successors of Alexander, to whom this badge might be applied
                    as the son of Jupiter Ammon. This, however, Mr Pinkerton observes, is the only
                    one of those symbols which certainly denote an earthly sovereign, it being
                    doubtful whether the rest are not all figures of gods. According to Eckhet, even
                    the horn and diadem belong to Bacchus, who invented the latter to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194206114" xml:id="kp-eb0714-6114-0484"/>cure his <hi rend="subscript"
                    > v</hi> headache; and, according to the same author, the only monarch who
                    appears on coins with the horn is Lysimachus. We are informed, however, by
                    Plutarch, that Pyrrhus had a crest of goats’ horns to his helmet; and the goat,
                    we know, was a symbol of Macedonia. Perhaps the successors of Alexander wore
                    this badge of the horn in consequence. The helmet likewise frequently appears on
                    the heads of sovereigns, and Constantine I. has helmets of various forms
                    curiously ornamented.</p>
                <p>The diadem is worn by most of the Greek queens, as by Orodaltis, daughter of
                    Lycomedes, king of Bithynia; and although the Roman empresses never appear with
                    it, yet this is more than compensated by the variety of their headdresses.
                    Sometimes the bust of an empress is supported by a crescent, to imply that she
                    was the moon, as her husband was the sun of the state. The toga or veil drawn
                    over the face, at first implied that the person was invested with the pontifical
                    office; and accordingly we find it on the busts of Julius Caesar, while pontifex
                    maximus. It likewise implies the augurship, the augurs having a particular kind
                    of gown called <hi rend="italic">lana,</hi> with which they covered their heads
                    when observing an omen. In latter times this implies only consecration, and is
                    common in coins of empresses. It is first met with on the coins of Claudius
                    Gothicus as the mark of the consecration of an emperor. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >nimbus</hi> or glory, now appropriated to saints, has been already mentioned.
                    It is as ancient as Augustus, but is not to be met with upon many of the
                    imperial medals, even after it began to be appropriated to them. There is a
                    curious coin, which has upon the reverse of the common piece, with the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> β</hi> head of Rome, <hi rend="smallcaps">Urbs Roma,</hi> in
                    large brass; Constantine L sitting amidst Victories and Genii, with a triple
                    crown upon his head for Europe, Asia, and Africa, with the legend <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Securitas Romae.</hi></p>
                <p>In general only the bust is given upon medals, though sometimes half the body or
                    more, in which latter case the hands often appear with ensigns of majesty in
                    them, such as the globe, said to have been introduced by Augustus as a symbol of
                    universal dominion; the sceptre, sometimes confounded with the consular staff; a
                    roll of parchment, the symbol of legislative power; and an handkerchief,
                    expressive of the power over the public games, where the emperor gave the
                    signal. Some princes hold a thunderbolt, showing that their power on earth was
                    equal to that of Jupiter in heaven, while others hold an image of Victory.</p>
                <p>Medals likewise afford a good number of portraits of illustrious men; but they
                    cannot easily be arranged in chronological order, so that a series of them is
                    not to be expected. It is likewise vain to attempt the formation of a series of
                    gods and goddesses as found upon ancient coins. Mr Pinkerton thinks it much
                    better to arrange them under the several cities or kings whose names they bear.
                    A collection of the portraits of illustrious men may likewise be formed from
                    medals of modern date.</p>
                <p>The reverses of ancient Greek and Roman coins afford an infinite variety of
                    instruction and amusement. They contain figures of deities at full length, with
                    their attributes and symbols, public symbols and diversions, plants, animals,
                    &amp;c.; and in short almost every object of nature or art. Some have the
                    portrait of the queen, son, or daughter of the prince whose image appears on the
                    face obverse; and these are esteemed highly by antiquaries, not only because
                    every coin stamped with portraits on both sides is accounted valuable, but
                    because they render it certain that the person represented on the reverse was
                    the wife, son, or daughter of him who appears on the obverse; by which means
                    they assist greatly in the adjustment of a series. Some, however, with two
                    portraits are common, as Augustus, the reverse of Caligula; and Marcus Aurelius,
                    the reverse of Antoninus Pius.</p>
                <p>We find more art and more design in the reverses of the Roman medals than in
                    those of the Greek; but, on the other hand, the latter exhibit more exquisite
                    relief and workmanship. The very ancient coins have no reverses, excepting a
                    rude mark struck into the metal, resembling that of an instrument with four
                    blunt points upon which the coin was struck, and this was owing to its having
                    been fixed by such an instrument on that side to receive the impression upon the
                    other. To this succeeds the image of a dolphin, or some small animal, in one of
                    the departments of the rude mark, or in a hollow square; and this again is
                    succeeded by a more perfect image, without any mark of the hollow square. Some
                    of the Greek coins are hollow in the reverse, as those of Caulonia, Crotona,
                    Metapontum, and some other ancient cities of Magna Graecia. About 500 before
                    Christ perfect reverses appear on the Greek coins, of exquisite relief and
                    workmanship. “The very muscles of men and animals,” says Pinkerton, “are seen,
                    and will bear inspection with the largest magnifier as ancient gems. The
                    ancients certainly had not eyes different from ours, and it is clear that they
                    must have magnified objects. A drop of water forms a microscope, and it is
                    probable this was the only one of the ancients. To Greek artists we are indebted
                    for the beauty of the Roman imperial coins, and these are so highly finished,
                    that on some reverses, as on that of Nero’s de-cursion, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >adventus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">progressio</hi> of various emperors, the
                    <hi rend="italic">fundator pacis</hi> of Severus, the features of the emperor,
                    riding or walking, are as exact as upon the obverse. But though the best Grèek
                    artists were called to Rome, yet the Greek coins under the Roman emperors are
                    sometimes well executed, and always full of variety and curiosity. No Roman or
                    Etruscan coins have been found of the globular form, or indented on the reverse
                    like the early Greek. The first Greek are small pieces of silver, whilst the
                    Roman are large masses of copper. The former are struck, the latter cast in
                    moulds. The reverses of the Roman coins are very uniform, the prow of a ship, a
                    car, or the like, till about the year 100 before Christ, when various reverses
                    appear on their consular coins in all metals. The variety and beauty of the
                    Roman imperial reverses are well known. The medallist values much those which
                    have a number of figures, as the <hi rend="italic">Puellae Faustinianae</hi> of
                    Faustina, a gold coin no larger than a sixpence, which has twelve figures; that
                    of Trajan, <hi rend="italic">regna assignata,</hi> has four; the <hi
                    rend="italic">congiarium</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> Nerva five; the
                    allocution of Trajan seven; that of Hadrian ten; and that of Probus twelve. Some
                    Roman medals have small figures on both sides, as the <hi rend="italic">Apollini
                    sancto</hi> of Julian II. But these have not received any peculiar name amongst
                    the medallists. Others have only a reverse, as the noted <hi rend="italic"
                    >spintriati,</hi> which have numerals I., II., &amp;c. on the obverse.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">names</hi> of the deities represented on the reverses of
                    Greek coins are never expressed; perhaps, as Mr Pinkerton supposes, out of
                    piety, a symbolical representation of their attributes being all that they
                    thought proper to delineate; but the Roman coins always express the name,
                    frequently with an adjunct, as <hi rend="smallcaps">Veneri Victrici.</hi> In
                    others, the name of the emperor or empress is added; as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pudici-tiae Augustae,</hi> round an image of modesty, and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Virtus Augusti,</hi> a legend for an image of virtue. The principal symbols of
                    the divine attributes to be met with upon the Greek medals are as follow:</p>
                <p>1. Jupiter is known on the coins of Alexander the Great by his eagle and
                    thunderbolts; but when the figure occurs only on the obverses of coins, he is
                    distinguished by a laurel crown, and placid bearded countenance. Jupiter Ammon
                    is known by the ram’s horn twisting round his ear; a symbol of power and
                    strength assumed by some of the successors of Alexander the Great, particularly
                    by Lysimachus. 2. Neptune is known by his trident, his dolphin, or his being
                    drawn by sea-horses; but he is seldom met with on the Grecian coins. 3. Apollo
                    is distinguished by a harp, a branch of laurel, or a tripod, and sometimes by a
                    bow and arrows. In the character of the sun his head is surrounded<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194206127" xml:id="kp-eb0714-6127-0485"/> with rays; but when the bust
                    only occurs, he has a fair young face, and is crowned with laurel. He is
                    frequently found on the coins of the Syrian princes. 4. Mars is distinguished by
                    his armour, and sometimes by a trophy on his shoulders. His head is armed with a
                    helmet, and he has a ferocious countenance. 5. Mercury is represented as ayouth,
                    with a small cap on his head, and wings behind his ears and on his feet. He is
                    known by the cap, which resembles a small hat, and the wings. He appears also
                    with the caduceus, or wand twined with serpents, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >marsupium</hi> or purse, which he holds in his hand. 6. Aesculapius is known by
                    his bushy beard, and his leaning on a club with a serpent twisted round it. He
                    sometimes occurs with his wifeHygeia or Health, and their son <hi rend="italic"
                    >Telesphorus</hi> or Convalescence between them. 7. Bacchus is known by his
                    crown of ivy or vine, his diadem and horn, with a tiger and satyrs around him.
                    8. The figure of Hercules is common on the coins of Alexander the Great, and has
                    frequently been mistaken for that of the prince himself. He appears sometimes as
                    a youth, and sometimes with a beard. He is known by the club, the lion’s skin,
                    and remarkable apparent strength; sometimes he has a cup in his hand; and a
                    poplar tree, as a symbol of vigour, is sometimes added to the portrait. 9. The
                    Egyptian Serapis is known by his bushy beard, and a measure upon his head. 10.
                    Apis is delineated in the form of a bull, with a flower of the lotus, the
                    water-lily of the Nile, supposed by Macrobius to be a symbol of creation; and
                    Jamblichus tells us, that Osiris was thought to have his throne in it. 11.
                    Harpocrates, the god of silence, appears with his finger on his mouth; sometimes
                    with the systrum in his left hand, a symbol common to most of the Egyptian
                    deities. 12. Canopus, another Egyptian deity, appears in the shape of a human
                    head placed on a kind of pitcher. “This deified pitcher,” says Mr Pinkerton,
                    “seems to refer to an anecdote of ancient superstition, which, I believe, is
                    recorded by Plutarch. It seems some Persian and Egyptian priests had a contest
                    which of their deities had the superiority. The Egyptian said, that a single
                    vase, sacred to Serapis, would extinguish the whole power of the Persian deity
                    of fire. The experiment was tried; and the wily Egyptian, boring holes in the
                    vase and stopping them with wax, afterwards filled the vase with water, which,
                    gushing through the holes as the wax melted, extinguished the Persian deity.
                    Hence the vase was deified.” 13. The <hi rend="italic">Holy Senate</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Holy People</hi> appear frequently on the Greek imperial coins,
                    sometimes represented as old men with beards, at others as youths.</p>
                <p>The goddesses represented on medals are the following. 1. Juno, represented by a
                    beautiful young woman, sometimes with a diadem, sometimes without any badge,
                    which is reckoned a sufficient distinction, as the other goddesses all wear
                    badges. Sometimes she appears as the goddess of marriage, and is then veiled to
                    the middle, and sometimes to the toes. She is known by the peacock, a bird
                    sacred to her, from the fable of Argus. 2. Minerva is very common upon the coins
                    of Alexander the Great, and her bust has been mistaken by the celebrated painter
                    Le Brun for the hero himself. She is very easily distinguished by the helmet.
                    Her symbols are, her armour; the spear in her right hand, the aegis, with‘a
                    Medusa’s head, in her left, and an owl commonly standing by her. 3. Diana of
                    Ephesus is commonly represented on the Greek imperial coins, and appears with a
                    great number of breasts, supposed to denote universal nature. She is supported
                    by two deer, <hi rend="subscript"> ¼</hi> and carries a pannier of fruit upon
                    her head. The bust of this goddess is known by the crescent upon her brow, and
                    sometimes by the bow and quiver at her side. 4. Venus is known by an apple, the
                    prize of beauty, in her hand. Sometimes she is distinguished only by her total
                    want of dress; but she is always to be known by her extraordinary beauty, and is
                    sometimes adorned with pearls about the neck. 5. Cupid is sometimes met with on
                    the Syrian coins, and is known by his infancy and wings. 6. Cybele is known by a
                    turreted crown and lion, or is seen in a chariot drawn by lions. 7. Ceres is
                    known by her garland of wheat, and is common on the Sicilian coins, that island
                    being remarkable for its fertility. Sometimes she has two serpents by her, and
                    sometimes she is drawn by them in a chariot. She carries in her hands the
                    torches with which she is fabled to have gone in search of her daughter
                    Proserpine. 8. Proserpine herself is sometimes met with upon coins, with the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">κοgη,</hi> or the girl. 9. The Egyptian Isis has a bud
                    or flower on her head, a symbol of the perpetual bloom of the inhabitants of
                    heaven. She carries also a systrum in her hand. 10. The Sidonian Astarte appears
                    on a globe supported on a chariot with two wheels, drawn by two horses.</p>
                <p>These are the deities most commonly represented on the Greek coins. The more
                    uncommon are, Saturn with his scythe, or with a hook on the Heraclian coins; and
                    Vulean with his tongs, on the reverse of a coin of Thyatira,· represented at
                    work in the presence of Minerva. Adranus, a Sicilian god, is sometimes
                    represented on coins with a dog. Anubis, an Egyptian deity, has a dog’s head.
                    Atis is known by his Phrygian bonnet; Castor and Pollux by a star upon the head
                    of each; Dis, by his old face, dishevelled hair and beard, and a hook; Flora by
                    her crown of flowers; Nemesis by her wheel; and Pan by his horns and ears
                    belonging to some kind of beast.</p>
                <p>There are likewise to be found on medals many different symbols by themselves,

                            preserver of Byzantium.” The reason of this was, that when Philip of
                            Macedonia besieged the city, and was about to storm it in a cloudy
                            night, the moon shone out on a sudden and discovered him; by which means
                            the inhabitants had time to collect their forces and repulse him. The
                            Turks, on entering Constantinople, found this badge in many places; and
                            suspecting some magical power in it, assumed the symbol and its power to
                            themselves, so that the crescent is now the chief Turkish

                <p>The legends impressed upon medals are designed as explanations of them; but as
                    the compass of even the largest coins does not admit of any great length of
                    inscription, ithas always been found necessary to use abbreviations; and in
                    readily deciphering these consists a considerable part of the difficulty of the
                    science. This, however, is greater in the Roman than in the Greek medals; for
                    the Greeks commonly insert as much of the word as is sufficient to enable us
                    easily to understand its meaning; but it is common for those who attempt to
                    explain letters which do not often occur, to fall into very ridiculous errors.
                    Of this Mr Pinkerton gives a most remarkable instance in Fortunius Licetus, a
                    learned man, who finding upon a coin of Hadrian the letters A∙ IΔ, signifying
                    the 14th year of that emperor’s reign, imagined that they signified <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucernas invenit</hi><hi rend="italic">Delta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> “Delta invented lanthorns;” and thence ascribed the origin of lanthorns
                    to the Egyptians. Tables explaining the meaning of the abbreviations found upon
                    medals have been published by Patin, Ursatus, and others.</p>
                <p>X.— <hi rend="italic">Of Medallions, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the ordinary coins of the ancients, which passed in common circulation
                    through the country, there were others of a larger size, which are now termed
                    <hi rend="italic">medallions.</hi> These were struck on the commencement of the
                    reign of a new emperor, and on other solemn occasions; and frequently also, by
                    the Greeks in particular, as monuments of gratitude or of flattery. Sometimes
                    they were mere trial or pattern, pieces; and, after the time of Maximian, these
                    abound, with the words <hi rend="italic">Tres Monetae</hi> on the reverse. The
                    common opinion is, that all the Roman pieces of gold exceeding the denarius
                    aureus, all in silver exceeding the denarius, and all in brass exceeding the
                    sestertius, went under the denomination <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> qï</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">medallions</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but Mr Pinkerton thinks
                    that many of these large pieces passed in circulation, though not very commonly,
                    as our five and two guineapieces, silver crowns, &amp;c. do or did in this
                    country. The finest medallions were presented by the mint-masters to the
                    emperor, and by the emperor to his friends, as specimens of elegant workmanship.
                    The best we have at present are of brass, and many of them composed of two sorts
                    of metal, the centre being copper, with a ring of brass around it, or the
                    contrary; and the inscription is sometimes confined to one of the metals,
                    sometimes not. There is a remarkable difference between the Greek and Roman
                    medallions in point of thickness; the latter being frequently three or four
                    lines thick, whilst the former seldom exceed one. Very few medallions, however,
                    were struck by the Greeks before the time of the Roman emperors; but the Greek
                    medallions of the emperors are more numerous than those of the Romans
                    themselves. All these pieces, however, are of such high price that very few
                    private individuals are able to purchase them. In the last century Christina
                    queen of Sweden procured about 300. In the king of France’s collection there are
                    1200, a number formerly supposed not to exist; and Dr Hunter’s collection
                    contains about 400, exclusive of the Egyptian. Besides these large pieces, there
                    are smaller ones, of a size somewhat larger than our half-crowns; which by
                    Italian medallists are called <hi rend="italic">medaglioncini,</hi> or small
                    medallions. They are still scarcer than the large kind.</p>
                <p>There is still a third kind, which have almost escaped the notice of medallists,
                    viz. the small coins or <hi rend="italic">missilia</hi> scattered amongst the
                    people on solemn occasions; such as those struck for the slaves on account of
                    the saturnalia, counters for gaming, tickets for baths and feasts, and tokens in
                    copper and in lead. These are distinguished by Mr Pinkerton by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">medalets.</hi> Many, or perhaps almost all, of those struck for
                    the saturnalia were satirical, as the slaves had then a license to ridicule not
                    only their masters, but any person whatsoever. Mr Pinkerton mentions one of the
                    most common pieces of this kind, which has on the obverse the head of an old
                    woman veiled, with a laurel crown; the 'reverse contains only SC within a
                    wreath. Baudelot is of opinion that it is the head of Acca Laurentia, the nurse
                    of Romulus, to whom a festival was ordained. “Perhaps,” says Pinkerton, “it was
                    struck in ridicule of Julius Caesar; for the manner of the laurel crown, and its
                    high appearance over the head, perfectly resemble that of Julius on his coins.”
                    Some have a ship upon one side; on the reverse, T, or a cross, which was the
                    image of Priapus, and occasioned many false invectives against the first
                    Christians, who paid profound respect to the cross. Soine pieces have the heads
                    of the emperors upon one side; on the reverse only numerals, III. IV. V.
                    &amp;c.,and the noted <hi rend="italic">spintriati</hi> of Tacitus. Both these
                    kinds appear to have been tickets for the baths, as the number seems to denote
                    the particular bath. Some have the head of a girl with a vessel used at the
                    baths in her hand. The spintriati are so immodest that few of them will bear
                    mention. But some are merely ludicrous; as one which has an ass with a bell
                    about his neck, and a soldier riding him; and another with two figures hoisting
                    a woman in a basket into the air. Of those that will just bear mention, is a man
                    with titles around him, as chief of the games, and a woman in ridicule of the
                    modest bath-girl above mentioned. There is also one marked XIX, on which appears
                    an imperator triumphing in a car, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194206153"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-6153-0487"/>which is placed on the back of a camel; and behind
                    the imperator is a monkey mimicking him.</p>
                <p>A fourth class of medals are called <hi rend="italic">contomiati,</hi> from the
                    Italian <hi rend="italic">contomiatο,</hi> encircled; because of the hollow
                    circle which commonly runs around them. They are distinguished from medallions
                    by their thinness, faint relief, reverses sometimes in relief, sometimes hollow,
                    and in general by the inferiority in their workmanship. The opinions of
                    medallists concerning these pieces are very various. Some suppose them to have
                    been struck by Gallienus, to the memory of illustrious men and celebrated <hi
                    rend="italic">athletae,</hi> at the time when he caused all the consecration
                    coins of his predecessors to be restored; and others ascribe their invention to
                    Greece, &amp;c.; but Mr Pinkerton is of opinion that they were only tickets for
                    places at public games. Many of them, notwithstanding their inferior
                    workmanship, are very valuable on account of their preserving the portraits of
                    some illustrious authors of antiquity, which are nowhere else to be found. Much
                    dependence, however, cannot be put on the portraits of Greek authors and eminent
                    men found upon some of them; for although we know that the busts of Sallust,
                    Horace, &amp;c. must have been struck when their persons were fresh in the
                    memory of the artists, yet it was otherwise with Homer, Solon, Pythagoras,
                    &amp;c. who are to be <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> found upon some of them.
                    Even these, however, arc valuable, as being ancient and perhaps traditional
                    portraits of these great men. The last whose portraits are supposed to have been
                    delineated in this way are Apollonius Tyaneus who flourished in the time of
                    Domitian, and Apuleius in that of Marcus Antoninus. Mr Pinkerton thinks it a
                    confirmation of his opinion concerning these medals, that the reverses always
                    contain some device alluding to public games, as that of a charioteer driving a
                    chariot, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>XI.— <hi rend="italic">Directions for forming Cabinets.</hi></p>
                <p>We must now proceed to the last part of our subject, viz. that of giving
                    directions for the formation of cabinets. As we have already seen that the
                    formation of any one must be attended with very considerable expense, it is
                    necessary for every one who attempts this to proportion the cabinet to his own
                    circumstances. There are, properly speaking, three kinds of cabinets. 1. Those
                    meant to contain a coin of every sort that has been issued from the mint in
                    every age and country; but this, which may be called the large and complete
                    cabinet, is not to be purchased by private persons. That of Dr Hunter, now in
                    the possession of the university of Glasgow, is perhaps one of the best private
                    cabinets ever known. 2. The smaller cabinet may be supposed to consist only of
                    middle and small Roman brass, English pennies, groats, &amp;c., with a few
                    medals of the more valuable kind. 3. The smallest kind is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">casket</hi> of medals, and does not consist of above 1000 at most
                    of various kinds; and consequently the expense must depend upon the pleasure of
                    the proprietor.</p>
                <p>In the formation of the grand cabinet, it must be observed that the Greek medals
                    of every denomination do not admit of any arrangement by the metals like the
                    Roman; no regular series of this description being met with even in the most
                    opulent cabinets. Hence in all collections the civic coins are ranged according
                    to an alphabetical, and the monarchic in a chronological order. The same rule is
                    to be observed in the Roman consular medals; they arc ranged, like the coins of
                    the Greek cities, in an alphabetical series of the families. The Roman imperial
                    coins are those only which are capable of being arranged according to sizes and
                    metals. Even from this must be excepted the minimi, or the very smallest coins,
                    which are so scarce that the only regular series of them in the world is that
                    belonging to the king of Spain, which was formed by a most skilful French
                    medallist, and consists of all the metals· The arrangement of a grand cabinet,
                    according to Mr Pinkerton, is as follows. 1. The coins of cities and of free
                    states in alphabetical order, whether using Greek, Roman, Punic, Etruscan, or
                    Spanish characters. 2. Kings' in chronological series, both as to foundation of
                    empire and seniority of reign. 3. Heroes, heroines, founders of empires, and
                    cities. 4. Other illustrious persons. 5. Roman asses. 6. Coins of families,
                    commonly called consular. 7. Imperial medallions. 8. Imperial gold. 9. Imperial
                    <hi rend="italic">minimi</hi> of all metals. 10. Imperial silver. 11. Imperial
                    first brass. 12. Second brass. 13. Third brass. 14. Colonial coins, which are
                    all of brass. 15. Greek cities under the emperors, of all metals and sizes. In a
                    smaller cabinet they may be put with the Roman, according to their metal and
                    size. Those without the emperor’s head go to class 1, though struck in Roman
                    times. 16. Egyptian coins struck under the Roman emperors, of all metals and
                    sizes. They are mostly of a base metal called by the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >patin;</hi> it is a kind of pot-metal or brittle brass. 17. Contomiati, or
                    ticket medals. 18. Coins of Gothic princes, &amp;c. inscribed with Roman
                    characters. 19. Coins of southern nations using uncommon alphabets; as the
                    Persian, Punic, Etruscan, and Spanish. 20. Coins of northern nations using
                    uncommon characters; as the Runic and German.</p>
                <p>In the modern part no series can be formed of copper that will reach backwards
                    above two centuries; but sequences (chronological series) of gold and silver may
                    be arranged of all the different empires, kingdoms, and states, as far as their
                    several coinages will allow. Those of England and France will be the most
                    perfect. Modern silver is commonly arranged in three sequences; the dollar, the
                    groat, and the penny sizes. The medals of each modern country ought of course to
                    be separated; though it is best to arrange each set in chronological order, let
                    their size of metal be what it may. It may be remarked here, that our modern
                    medals of the size of a tea-saucer are only so many monuments of barbarism. The
                    ancient medallions are almost universally but little larger than our crownpiece,
                    though three or four of them may extend to about two inches diameter, but very
                    many modem medals to four inches and more. A large medal always indicates an
                    ignorant prince or an ignorant artist. Into the size of a crown-piece the
                    ancients threw more miracles in this way than will ever be found in such
                    monstrous productions.</p>
                <p>These directions will likewise apply to the formation of a cabinet of the second
                    kind; but if the collector means to form a series of large Roman brass, he will
                    find the coins of four or five emperors so scarce as not to be attainable in
                    that series, at any price. He must therefore supply their places with middle
                    brass, as is allowed with regard to Otho, even in the best cabinets; there not
                    being above three coins of that emperor in large brass known in the world,
                    whereas of the middle brass two or three hundred are still extant. For this
                    reason Mr Pinkerton concludes, that in cabinets of the second class, the
                    collector may mingle the large and second^ brass together as he thinks proper,
                    in order to save expense; though it would not do so well to unite such
                    disproportionate sizes as the large and small. “In the small sequence, however,”
                    says he, “there can be no harm in his mixing gold, silver, and brass, as chance
                    or curiosity may lead him to purchase any of these metals. And though your
                    starched bigoted medallists may sneer because such a sequence would controvert
                    his formal and narrow way of thinking, common sense will authorize us to laugh
                    at the pedant in our turn, and to pronounce such a series more various, rich,
                    and interesting, than if the collector had arranged only one metal, and rejected
                    a curious article because he did not collect gold, or-silver. In like manner,
                    if, in the modern part of the smaller cabinet, any coin of a series is of high
                    price, or of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194206166" xml:id="kp-eb0714-6166-0488"
                    />bad impression, there can be no impropriety in puttinθ∙ another of the same
                    reign, which is cheaper or better executed, though of a different denomination
                    or of a little larger size. In short, the collector has no rules but in the
                    Greek cities and Roman families, and to observe alphabetical order and
                    chronology in every thing else.</p>
