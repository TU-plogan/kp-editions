                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    minister and last counsel to Louis XVI., was descended of an illustrious family,
                    which had occupied the highest offices in the magistracy, being the grandson of
                    the celebrated advocate-general Lamoignon (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lamoignon),</hi> and born at Parison the 6th of December 1721. He was son of
                    the chancellor of France, William de Lamoignon, who was descended of an
                    illustrious family. His early education he received at the Jesuits’ College, and
                    afterwards applied himself with great assiduity to the study of the law, as well
                    as of history and political economy. He was chosen a counsellor of the
                    parliament of Paris at the age of twenty-four, and succeeded his father as
                    president of the court of aids in the year 1750. Alongst with the presidentship
                    of the court of aids, he received the superintendence of the press, and in his
                    hands it became the means of promoting liberty to a degree beyond all former
                    example in that country. As he firmly believed that despotism alone had reason
                    to dread the liberty of the press, he was anxious to give it every extension
                    consistent with sound policy and the state of public opinion. Through his favour
                    the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie,</hi> the works of Rousseau, and many other
                    free speculations, issued from the press, in defiance of the terrific anathemas
                    of the Sorbonne. This had no doubt its weight in paving the way for the
                    revolution, which Malesherbes did not probably foresee; yet it had also the
                    effect of freeing the minds of men from the fetters of slavery and superstition,
                    and of enlightening thèm respecting their rights and duties in society. The
                    superintendence of the press having been taken from him, and conferred upon
                    Maupeou, he was only the more intent on fulfilling the duties of his
                    presidentship, and opposing arbitrary power. When the proceedings of the court
                    of aids were to be prohibited, on account of the spirited conduct of Malesherbes
                    in the case of Monnerat, who had been unjustly treated by the farmers of the
                    revenue, he presented a remonstrance to the king, containing a free protest
                    against the enormous abuses of <hi rend="italic">lettres</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de cachet,</hi> by which every man’s liberty was rendered precarious, and
                    concluding with these memorable words: “No one is great enough to be secure from
                    the hatred of a minister, nor little enough not to merit that of a clerk.” Soon
                    after this he was banished to his country-seat by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >lettre</hi><hi rend="italic">de cachet,</hi> and the Duke de Richelieu, at the
                    head of an armed force, abolished the tribunal. In this state of retirement he
                    committed to paper a number of observations on the political and judicial state
                    of France, as well as on agriculture and natural history, all which perished in
                    the wreck of the revolution. On the accession of Louis XVI. to the throne in
                    1774, he received an order to appear at the place where the court of aids had
                    sat, and to resume the presidentship of the tribunal thus restored. He laid
                    before the new sovereign an ample detail of the calamitous state of the kingdom,
                    with a free exposure of the faults by which it had been produced. His sentiments
                    so fully accorded with those of the young king, that he was chosen minister of
                    state in the year 1775. In this elevated station he was only ambitious to extend
                    the sphere of his usefulness. His first care was to visit the prisons, and to
                    restore to liberty the innocent victims of the former reign. His administration
                    was also distinguished by the encouragement of commerce and agriculture,
                    being-supported in his laudable endeavours by the able and virtuous Turgot, at
                    that time comptroller-general of the revenue. But having failed in his
                    benevolent endeavours to ameliorate the condition of Protestants respecting the
                    solemnization of marriage and the legitimation of their children, he resigned
                    his office in the month of May 1776.</p>
                <p>Being fond of travelling, and resolved to mix freely with people of every
                    description, in order to acquire an accurate knowledge of human nature, he
                    assumed the humble title of Μ. Guillaume, and commenced his journey in a simple,
                    frugal manner. He travelled through France, Switzerland, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200550" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0550-0056"/>and Holland, frequently
                    journeying on foot, and lodging in villages, in order to have a nearer insight
                    of the state of the country. He made memoranda of whatever he conceived to be
                    worthy of observation respecting the productions of nature and the operations of
                    industry; and, after an absence of some years, he returned to his favourite
                    mansion, fraught with such a stock of valuable knowledge as his age and
                    experience qualified him to appreciate. Finding on his return that his native
                    country was far advanced in philosophical principles, he drew up two elaborate
                    memoirs addressed to the king; one of them on the condition of the Protestants,
                    and the other on civil liberty and toleration in general. The difficulties with
                    which ministers now found themselves surrounded induced the king to call him to
                    his councils, being a man who stood high in the esteem of the whole nation; but
                    he received no appointment to any particular office. In the critical state in
                    which he clearly saw that the king stood, he made an effort to open his eyes, by
                    means of two spirited and energetic memoirs, on the calamities of France, and
                    the means of repairing them; but, as the queen’s party carried everything before
                    it, he was not even permitted to read them, and was also denied a private
                    interview with the ill-fated monarch, in consequence of which he took his final
                    leave of the court.</p>
                <p>When, by a decree of the National Convention, Louis was to be tried for his life,
                    Malesherbes, nobly forgetting the manner in which he had been banished from his
                    councils, generously offered to plead his cause. On the 13th of December 1792,
                    he wrote to the president of the Convention, “J’ai été appelé deux fois au
                    conseil de celui qui fut mon maitre, dans le temps où cette fonction était
                    ambitionnée par tout le monde; je lui dois le même service, lorsque c’est une
                    fonction que bien des gens trouvent dangereuse.” He was the person who announced
                    to the unfortunate monarch his cruel fate, and one of the last who took leave of
                    him when taken out to suffer. After this eventful period, he withdrew to his
                    retreat with a wounded heart, and refused to hear anything more of what was
                    passing on the bloody theatre of Paris.</p>
                <p>Occupied with agriculture and the duties of charity, he was vainly seeking to
                    console himself for the evils of his country, when, in the first days of
                    December 1793, three members of a revolutionary committee of Paris, followed by
                    a numerous escort, came to arrest his eldest daughter, and his son-in-law Μ. de
                    Rosambo. He remained alone with his grandchildren, and for a moment it was
                    believed that his age and his virtues would be respected; but next day new
                    emissaries appeared, and carried him off with his children, notwithstanding the
                    tears and protestations of the inhabitants of Malesherbes, who all offered to
                    guarantee his virtues and his innocence. He then requested to be sent to the
                    same prison with his family; but even this consolation was denied him, and he
                    was incarcerated in the Madelonettes with one of his grandsons, Μ. Louis de
                    Rosambo, whilst his other children remained dispersed in different prisons. When
                    brought before the revolutionary tribunal, he was asked if he had counsel; he
                    replied by a smile of contempt, and one Duchâteau was appointed <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio</hi> his defender. This tribunal of blood would
                    scarcely deign to hear him who had been so long the oracle of justice, and by
                    whom so many victims had been saved from death. He was, indeed, convinced of the
                    uselessness of any defence; and when they handed him the act of accusation (or
                    indictment), in which he was charged with having conspired against “the unity of
                    the republic,” he rejected it with disdain, saying, “Encore si cela avait le
                    sens commun.” In the same charge were included thirty persons of all ages and
                    both sexes. Malesherbes heard his sentence without emotion, and marched to death
                    with undisturbed serenity. At this terrible moment, that mild yet lively gaiety
                    which had formed the charm of his life did not forsake him. Happening to strike
                    his foot against a stone, as he crossed the court-yard of the palace, with his
                    hands tied at his back, he observed to the person next him. “Voilà qui est d’un
                    fâcheux augure; à ma place un Romain serait rentré.” Madame de Rosambo was not
                    less calm nor less resigned. When, on quitting her prison, she embraced
                    Mademoiselle de Sombreuil, who had displayed so great courage during the
                    massacres of September, “Mademoiselle,” said she, “you have had the honour to
                    save your father; I am going to have that of dying with mine.” Malesherbes had
                    the unspeakable grief of seeing immolated before him that daughter whom he loved
                    so tenderly, and who herself witnessed the butchery of her children before she
                    was called on to suffer. He perished the last of all, at the age of seventy-two,
                    on the 22d of April 1794.</p>
                <p>Grave errors may be laid to the charge of Malesherbes, but all of these had their
                    source in that love of good which in him was as much a passion as a principle;
                    and, besides, they were not only expiated by a glorious death, but confessed and
                    bitterly deplored with that noble frankness which belonged to his character.
                    Besides the works already alluded to, Malcsherbes left a number of manuscripts,
                    which were dispersed by the vandalism of the revolution, particularly, 1.
