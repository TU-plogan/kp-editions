                <p><label type="entry">MARSEILLES</label>, a city of the south of France, on the
                    Mediterranean Sea, the capital of the department of the Bouches du Rhone, 102
                    posts or 500 miles from Paris. It is asserted to be the most ancient city of
                    Europe, having been founded by a colony of Greek Phocians 560 years before the
                    Christian era, at which time it bore the name of Massilia. After some struggles
                    with the scattered tribes which before inhabited the country, the city was
                    formed into an independent commercial republic. In process of time, from
                    commerce having increased its wealth, it became a warlike naval power in
                    confederacy with Rome, before that city had established a fleet. In this state
                    it made war with the Carthaginians, and so successfully, that, according to
                    Strabo, the citadel and the temple of Diana in Massilia were encumbered with the
                    booty captured by their fleet. Whilst the Gauls under Brennus were besieging
                    Rome, the Massilians were enabled to send to their allies large sums of money,
                    which were returned after Camillus had saved the city. The prosperity of
                    Massilia then rapidly advanced, and was displayed by the erection of several
                    other cities in the vicinity, such as Nice, Antibes, Olbia, Tauroentum,
                    Cythariste(now Ciotat), Agatha (now Agde), Stomaline, and several others on the
                    shores of Spain. Besides these cities on the coast, they established many in the
                    interior of the country, such as Gla-num (now St Remo), Pertuis, Tarascon,
                    Avignon, Valson, and several others, where markets were held for the disposal of
                    the products of the country, as well as for those foreign commodities which the
                    commerce of Massilia brought to its haven. This advance of prosperity was
                    continued by the effect it produced on the agriculture of the country
                    surrounding the newly-planted cities, and led to the construction of roads, and
                    of improved means of navigating through the various mouths of the Rhone.
                    After<pb break="no" facs="nls:194203215" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3215-0261"/> the
                    capture and destruction of Tyre by Alexander the Great, Marseilles for a time
                    divided with Carthage the commerce which had previously centred in that depot;
                    and when afterwards Alexandria shared in that trade, the Massilians extended
                    their commercial expeditions through the pillars of Hercules, to the western
                    coast of Africa, where they procured slaves; they found their way to the
                    Cassiterides, or Cornwall, where they procured tin, and even to the Baltic Sea,
                    where they were attracted by the hope of procuring amber.</p>
                <p>Marseilles with its establishments constituted a rich republic, and in its
                    alliance with Rome partook of the victories gained by the imperial city on the
                    territory of Carthage, till the ultimate conquest of the great capital of
                    Northern Africa; but, in the security derived from its union with Rome, it
                    suffered its naval and land forces to decline, and sunk in consequence of those
                    indulgences in luxury which its great wealth had enabled it to enjoy. In this
                    state, when the civil wars between Pompey and Caesar broke out, Marseilles,
                    having adhered to the senate, of which Pompey was the head, was exposed to the
                    hostilities of Caesar, who, after a long defence, made himself master of the
                    city; and though he left it in possession of some of its privileges, yet, taking
                    from it all power over the various colonies it had formed, its commerce decayed,
                    and its wealth gradually diminished. In these circumstances the nominal
                    independence of the city was preserved, and under the tranquillity thus
                    maintained it became a rival in learning and science with the schools of Athens.
                    The youth of Rome repaired thither to study eloquence and the dialectic arts,
                    and it was long celebrated as the most distinguished place for the acquisition
                    of medical knowledge.</p>
                <p>With the gradual fall of the Roman empire, Marseilles only felt the effect in a
                    slight degree. The Christian religion was introduced in the fourth century, but
                    the inhabitants, being still Greeks, adhered to that division of the church,
                    till in the next century they embraced the Roman church, and about the year 420
                    yielded obedience to Pope Boniface.</p>
                <p>When Gaul was overrun by the Goths, this city shared in the common fate. It was a
                    municipality under Theodoric, and so continued till the time of Charles Martel,
                    when it was assailed by the Saracens, invited by a general named Mauronte, who
                    had been appointed governor or duke by Charles, but who aspired to independence,
                    and hoped to maintain it by the aid of the Mahommedans. This attempt was however
                    frustrated, and at length the Saracens were repelled and tranquillity
                    restored.</p>
                <p>Under the princes of the Carlovingian race, Marseilles became distinguished as
                    the place at which the several embassies, such as those of Constantine
                    Copronymus, and the popes Stephen and Adrian in the reign of Pepin, and of the
                    caliphs of Bagdad and Cordova in the reign of Charlemagne, were landed in
                    France. Under the government of the latter prince the commerce and industry of
                    this place revived; but its chief commerce was then restricted to the
                    intercourse with Catalonia, with Italy, and the Levant. This gleam of
                    prosperity, however, was transient, for under Louis le Débonnaire, when all the
                    springs of the government were relaxed, and anarchy tore in pieces the cities
                    and towns, clouds of pirates swarmed on the coasts, captured the vessels, and
                    frequently landed on the shores of Provence, destroying with fire and sword
                    whatever they encountered.</p>
                <p>Through the many changes that have since taken place, it is not necessary to
                    distinguish the history of this city from that of France in general, except to
                    remark, that during the revolution it was much distinguished by its adherence to
                    the most violent of the parties of the republican class, and that its
                    representatives in the national convention were as remarkable for their
                    eloquence as for the fate which attended them.</p>
                <p>Having thus described the ancient history of this interesting city, we arrive at
                    the notice of its present state. As the first mercantile city of France, it owes
                    much of its importance to its local position. It is situated in a bay of the
                    same name, which is formed by the two points of Cape Couronne and Cape
                    Croisette, which are distant from each other fifteen miles, the extreme of the
                    former being high land, and of the latter very low. On the east side of the bay
                    are several rocky islands, which are dangerous without an experienced pilot.
                    Within the bay are ports for anchoring till the winds serve for entering the
                    harbour; and there are also some small havens, viz. Port Miou, two leagues east
                    of Cape Croisette; Cassio, a large village, from whence fruits and wine are
                    exported; and Ciotat, a considerable place, in a cove, with an island before it,
                    and a pier haven for small craft. It is celebrated for the excellence of its
                    Muscat wine, and is a place where many small vessels are constructed.</p>
                <p>The port of Marseilles has in front of its entrance the island of Chateau d’If,
                    which is fortified on all sides, on the north-west of which is the passage. This
                    is defended by the citadel called St Nicholas, which has four bastions, and a
                    fort on an eminence, called Nôtre Dame de la Garde. The harbour lies in the
                    centre of the town, and is esteemed one of the safest and most convenient in the
                    Mediterranean. It is covered from the sea by a point of land, and chains are
                    fastened to pillars at two forts, which effectually secure the entrance. At this
                    entrance there is a depth of water of from sixteen to twenty feet, and
                    everywhere within not less than sixteen. On the outside of the chain there are
                    from four to fivefathoms, where ships may anchor if prevented from getting in,
                    which only occurs when the wind is easterly. This harbour forms a basin 525
                    fathoms in length and 150 in breadth, on the east side of which are docks for
                    the galleys, whilst in every part there are commodious quays, and storehouses
                    for goods. It is capable of conveniently receiving 900 vessels, which are not
                    visible from the sea. The water within is not sufficiently deep for the larger
                    ships of war, and such must consequently anchor without the entrance.</p>
                <p>The city, which surrounds this capacious haven, was protected by walls and
                    ditches; but these have been destroyed, and the sites converted into pleasing
                    promenades bordered by elegant dwellings. It is in the form of a square, and is
                    divided into the old and the new town. The former is situated on an eminence,
                    and consists of narrow, crooked streets, with mean houses, but is the most
                    populous part. The latter is on the south and the east side of the harbour, has
                    broad, straight, well-paved streets, and contains many very handsome houses. The
                    pavement is good, and in most parts small streams of water run, by which the
                    streets and the dwellings are kept in a cleanly condition. An ancient aqueduct
                    supplies water to a reservoir, and to several fountains; but it is said to be
                    decaying, and other establishments are in contemplation for improving or
                    renewing it.</p>
                <p>The public edifices are numerous, and some of them magnificent. The cathedral is
                    one of them, although Marseilles has ceased to be an episcopal city, having been
                    since 1801 comprehended in the diocese of Aix. Besides it there are several
                    other Catholic churches, also one, lately built, for Protestants, two for
                    Greeks, and a synagogue for the Jews. The most remarkable civil buildings are
                    the townhall, called the Prefecture, a vast pile, and connected with others, in
                    which are preserved all the ancient archives of the city. The palace of justice,
                    an irregular . but large building. The prison at the Port d’Aix, much improved
                    in 1823; joined to which, forming on the whole a large square, are the barracks.
                    The customhouse and the tri- <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203228"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3228-0262"/>; bunaľof commerce, formerly the Jesuits’ College.
                    The establishments of a sanitary nature are highly appropriate. The lazaretto is
                    an extensive and commodious building, with good apartments for the different
                    classes of persons received into it, and extensive storehouses for goods, which
                    are highly necessary where the quarantine laws must be enforced. In the year
                    1825 a new access was formed to the building, so as to bring it in connection
                    with the harbour by means of a canal without any contact with the habitations;
                    and it has been finished by a new magnificent gate called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dieu-donné.</hi> Whilst preventive measures have been thus provided for, due
                    establishments for the cure of diseases have not been neglected. The hospitals
                    are very numerous for the reception of the sufferers under various maladies. The
                    Hotel-Dieu receives all poor persons, except those who have venereal, chronic,
                    or incurable complaints. The number relieved in the year is about 2500, besides
                    which, food and lodging during three days is afforded to all distressed persons
                    who come with passports of indigence or of disease. <hi rend="italic">La
                    Charité</hi> is of a more general nature, and commonly contains 850 persons
                    under cure. <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Maternité</hi> receives
                    females in the seventh month of their pregnancy, and supports them till their
                    delivery. This is a new establishment, commenced in 1823, and has usually about
                    130 mothers. There are other hospitals, one for foundlings with about 600,
                    another for insane persons with 150 patients, and several smaller ones, all
                    regulated by a board of commissioners nominated by the government. There are
                    also several voluntary associations for visiting and relieving those who are
                    sick or otherwise distressed, and also a <hi rend="italic">Mont de Pieté</hi>
                    and savings bank.</p>
                <p>The literary societies of this city are the Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and
                    Architecture, founded in 1725, which has published seventeen volumes of its
                    proceedings, and now annually distributes two prizes for the best composition on
                    these subjects; another is the <hi rend="italic">Musée</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Tableaux,</hi> which has a good collection of paintings, some of the French
                    school, but more the work of Flemish or Italian painters. It has also a
                    collection of ancient marbles, some valuable engravings, and a most extensive
                    collection of rare medals, comprising series of those of the Greek cities, of
                    the Roman consuls, of the emperors, and of the sovereigns of Provence. The
                    library belonging to this institution is very large, said to contain 90,000
                    volumes and 2000 manuscripts. The botanic garden is connected with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Musée,</hi> and serves as a winter promenade. It contains between
                    three and four thousand exotic and indigenous plants. A part enclosed is
                    reserved for those plants which are not yet familiarized to the climate.</p>
                <p>The Jesuits founded an astronomical observatory, but, by the circumstances which
                    have occurred since the expulsion of that society, it has been frequently
                    destitute of a director. It was closed in 1822, but projects are on foot for the
                    re-establishment and activity of the institution.</p>
                <p>The institutions for the higher branches of knowledge are the Royal College for
                    the study of <hi rend="italic">belles</hi><hi rend="italic">lettres</hi> and the
                    ancient languages, two seminaries for ecclesiastical learning, a school of
                    commerce, one of navigation, and one of surgery and medicine. There are several
                    boarding schools, convents for females, and numerous, but not suffi-cently
                    numerous, schools for the first elements of instruction.</p>
                <p>Marseilles is, next to Paris, the most <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> populous
                    city of France. According to the official report of May 1832, of the population
                    of the kingdom in the previous year, the arrondissement of Marseilles contained
                    145,115 inhabitants; but it was found at prior periods that one fiftieth part of
                    the population was without the city in small villages. Deducting, then, that
                    proportion, the whole of the inhabitants in 1831 must have been about 116,110,
                    and may now, in 1836, be 120,000.</p>
                <p>According to an account given by the magistracy a few years since, there were
                    then 27,370 families, who were thus classed:</p>

                <p>Not to give too long a table of figures, we select a year in the middle of a
                    period of twenty to show the movement of the population. At that time the births
                    were 1777 males, and 1645 females, thus together 3422; the deaths of both sexes
                    3504, and the marriages 970. Of the children born, 647 were illegitimate; of
                    these, 109 were acknowledged, and 538 abandoned.</p>
                <p>Though the higher classes of the population speak the French language, the great
                    mass make use of the <hi rend="italic">Provençal,</hi> and understand no other.
                    It is a compound of Greek, Latin, Catalan, and French, with many words,
                    especially those relating to fishing and other naval things, and to agriculture,
                    which cannot be traced to either of those tongues, but are supposed to be
                    derived from some more ancient and original language. The commerce of this city
                    has undergone great changes, and has suffered much by the revolution. Before
                    1791 there was a great trade with the colonies, with the Levant, with India, and
                    America, to which it then exported cloths, soap, leather, and salt fish. The
                    chief trade, however, then as well as now, was with Italy. At present many
                    persons are occupied in manufactories, the chief of which are the following.
                    There are more than a hundred makers of soap, with 400 furnaces, who employ
                    nearly 2400 persons. The component parts, consisting of Provence oil and of
                    soda, are produced within the department. The tanners are forty, and employ
                    upwards of 400 workmen. They use the hides brought from Buenos Ayres, as well as
                    those of the neighbourhood, and obtain the skins of sheep, goats, and kids,
                    either from the department, or from Corsica and Sardinia. The greater part of
                    the leather is exported to Italy. The making of hats employs about 600 workmen,
                    who usually produce to the number of 20,000, which supplies the inhabitants of
                    the city, and the remainder are shipped, some to Spain and others to the
                    colonies. The spinning of cotton by machinery has been recently introduced.
                    Formerly the cotton thread was imported from the Levant, but now some is sent
                    there from Marseilles, with hopes of an increased demand. This branch of
                    industry has upwards of twenty establishments, and employs between five and six
                    thousand workmen. The manufactures of soda and of sulphuric acid, some other
                    chemical, and some perfumery articles, employ more than a thousand hands. The
                    making of caps for the use of the Africans, distinguished by the name otTunisan
                    caps, occupies the labour of 7500 persons, of whom 1500 work in the shops, and
                    6000 in their own houses. There is a coral fishery on the coast, and much of
                    that substance is found on the shores of Spain, of Sardinia, and at Calle in
                    Africa. It is prepared in this city for ornamental purposes, and Paris is
                    supplied from hence, as well as the more distant foreign markets. Nearly a
                    thousand persons <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203241"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3241-0263"/>are engaged in these operations. There are, upon a
                    small scale, sugar refineries, paper-mills, glass-houses, and some other
                    manufacturing establishments, which might be noticed. The fishery, and the
                    preserving of fish by salting or by smoking, is an abundant source of
                    occupation; to which must be added the building and equipping of vessels of all
                    sizes, and supplying them with sailors.</p>
                <p>As it appears desirable to account for so large a population existing in one
                    spot, more attention has in this case been given to the means of procuring
                    subsistence than has been devoted to other cities of the same rank; more
                    especially as in Marseilles the number of deaths appears in a series of twenty
                    years to have exceeded the number of births by more than ten per cent.; a fact
                    which scarcely appears in any other large city of Europe.</p>
