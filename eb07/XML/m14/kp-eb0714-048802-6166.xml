                <p><label type="entry">MEDEA</label>, in fabulous history, a celebrated sorceress,
                    daughter of Aeetes king of Colchis. Her mother’s name, according to the more
                    received opinion of Hesiod and Hyginus, was Idyia, or, according to others,
                    Ephyre, Hecate, Asterodia, Antiope, and Neaera. She was the niece of Circe. When
                    Jason came to Colchis in quest of the golden fleece, Medea became enamoured of
                    him, and it was to her well-directed labours that the Argonauts owed their
                    preservation. Medea had an interview with her lover in the temple <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> Hecate, where they bound themselves by the most solemn
                    oaths to eternal fidelity. No sooner had Jason overcome all the difficulties
                    which Aeetes had placed in his way, than Medea embarked with the conquerors for
                    Greece. To stop the pursuit of her father, she tore to pieces her brother
                    Absyrtus, and left his mangled limbs in the way through which Aeetes was to
                    pass. This act of barbarity some have attributed to Jason, and not to her. When
                    Jason reached ĭolchos, his native country, the return and victories of the
                    Argonauts were celebrated with universal rejoicings; but Aeson the father of
                    Jason was unable to assist at the solemnity, on account of the infirmities of
                    his age. Medea, at her husband’s request, removed the weakness of Aeson; and by
                    drawing blood from his veins, and filling them again with the juice of certain
                    herbs, she restored him to the vigour and sprightliness of youth. This sudden
                    change in Aeson astonished the inhabitants <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Iolchos;
                    and the daughters of Pelias were also desirous to see their father restored by
                    the same power to the vigour of youth. Medea, willing to revenge the injuries
                    which her husband’s family had suffered from Pelias, increased their curiosity,
                    and betrayed them into the murder of their father as preparatory to his
                    rejuvenescence, which she afterwards refused to accomplish. This action greatly
                    irritated the people of Iolchos, and Medea with her husband fled to Corinth to
                    avoid their resentment. Here they lived for ten years with mutual attachment,
                    when the love of Jason for Glauce the king’s daughter interrupted their harmony,
                    and Medea was divorced. Medea revenged the infidelity of Jason by causing the
                    death of Glauce, and the destruction of her family. She also killed two of her
                    children in their father’s presence; and when Jason attempted to punish the
                    barbarity of the mother, she fled through the air upon a chariot drawn.by winged
                    dragons. From Corinth Medea went to Athens, where, after she had undergone the
                    necessary purification of her murder, she married King Aegeus, or (according to
                    others) lived in an adulterous manner with him. From her conduct with Aegeus,
                    Medea had a son who was called <hi rend="italic">Medus.</hi> Soon afterwards,
                    when Theseus wished to make himself known to his father, Medea, jealous of his
                    fame and fearful of his power, attempted to poison him at a feast which had been
                    prepared for his entertainment. Her attempts however failed of success, and the
                    sight of the sword which Theseus wore by his side convinced Aegeus that the
                    stranger against whose life he had so basely conspired was his own son. The
                    father and the son were reconciled; and Medea, to avoid the punishment which her
                    wickedness deserved, mounted her fiery chariot and disappeared through the air.
                    Her aerial voyage terminated at Colchis, where, according to some, she was
                    reconciled to Jason, who had sought her in her native country after her sudden
                    departure from Corinth. She died at Colchis, as Justin mentions, when she had
                    been restored to the confidence of her family. After death she married Achilles
                    in the Elysian fields, according to the tradition mentioned by Simonides. The
                    murder of Mermerus and Pheres, the youngest of Jason’s children by Medea, is not
                    to be attri-. buted to the mother, according to Aelian, but to the Corinthians,
                    who assassinated them in the templc of Juno Acraea. To avoid the resentment of
                    the gods, and to deliver themselves from the pestilence which had visited their
                    country after so horrid a massacre, they engaged the poet Euripides for five
                    talents to write a tragedy, which cleared them of the murder, and represented
                    Medea as the cruel assassin <hi rend="italic">of</hi> her own children. And,
                    besides, that this opinion might be the better credited, festivals were
                    appointed, in which the mother was represented with all the barbarity of a fury,
                    murdering her own sons.</p>
