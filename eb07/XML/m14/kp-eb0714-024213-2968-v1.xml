                    of the most celebrated Roman generals, the principal events of whose life <pb

                    included between <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 222 and 208. His valour and
                    military science made him feared by the enemies of his country, whilst the
                    mildness and gentleness of his deportment won their respect and esteem. Rome was
                    at this period engaged in war with the Cisalpine Gauls, and had appointed
                    Flaminius, the consul, to the command of a large army in the north of Italy.
                    This election was found to be invalid (see C. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Flaminius),</hi> and Marcellus was raised to the consulship, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 222. He joined the army without delay; and though
                    the Insubres offered terms of accommodation, he prevailed on the people to
                    reject them. He laid siege to Acerrae, now <hi rend="italic">Gerrha,</hi> on the
                    banks of the Po; and wheι&gt;the Gauls attempted to make a diversion by
                    attacking Clastidium, Marcellus left his colleague before Acerrae, marched
                    against them, and in the battle which ensued the Gauls were defeated, and their
                    king Virido-marus was slain by the hands of Marcellus himself. This was the
                    third time that a Roman general had presented the <hi rend="italic">spolia
                    opima</hi> to Jupiter Feretrius. Marcellus obtained the honours of a triumph,
                    which is said to have been one of the most magnificent ever witnessed in Rome,
                    whether we consider the richness of the spoils that were displayed in it, or the
                    prodigious size of the captive. At the commencement of the second Punic war <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 218), Marcellus was appointed as praetor to the
                    command of the troops in Sicily; but he was recalled after the defeat at Cannae
                    (2d August <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 216), and sent to Apulia to collect
                    the scattered remains of the Roman army. This he effected with much prudence;
                    and the severe check which Hannibal received from him before Nola tended greatly
                    to reanimate the drooping spirits of his countrymen. Hannibal used to say, that
                    he feared Fabius as his schoolmaster, and Marcellus as his enemy. Marcellus was
                    again named consul, <hi rend="smallcaps">iî.</hi> c. 215; but he immediately
                    abdicated, on account of some flaw in the election, and proceeded to Nola in the
                    capacity of proconsul. The following year he was raised a third time to the
                    consulship <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 214), and proceeded to the command
                    of the war in Sicily. Here he laid siege to Syracuse, thinking that the conquest
                    of this place would immediately be followed by the full possession of the
                    island. Syracuse was defended by the skill of the celebrated Archimedes, and it
                    was not till after <hi rend="italic">a</hi> blockade of three years that
                    Marcellus was able to take the city, when Archimedes was killed <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 212), though positive orders had been issued that
                    his life should be spared. Marcellus exerted himself to save the city from the
                    plunder of the soldiers, but failed to preserve it from this calamitous fate.
                    When he returned to Rome, he received the honour of an <hi rend="italic"
                    >ovation,</hi> or lesser triumph, as the war was still unfinished in Sicily. He
                    brought to Rome many beautiful statues and paintings which had adorned Syracuse,
                    and was the first to teach the Romans to appreciate the exquisite works of
                    Greece, which had hitherto been unknown to them. He was named for the fourth
                    time consul, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 210, and the command of the war in
                    Sicily fell to him by lot; but he exchanged it for Italy with his colleague
                    Laevinus. Marcellus recovered several cities of the Samnites from Hannibal, who
                    carefully shunned any regular battle with his opponent. He was appointed consul
                    the fifth time, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. 208, when he fell into an ambush
                    which had been laid for him by Hannibal, and was killed. Thus fell Marcellus,
                    who was called the <hi rend="italic">sward</hi> of Rome, whilst Fabius was
                    regarded as its <hi rend="italic">buclιler.</hi> His life has been written by
                    Plutarch, and many facts respecting him may be gathered from Livy
                    (xxii.-xxvii.).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Marcellus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ. Claudius,</hi> was of
                    the same family as the conqueror of Syracuse, and lived at a period when the
                    designs of Caesar against the liberties of his country began to be apparent.
                    Marcellus was named consul <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.</hi> c. 51), along with
                    Sulpicius Rufus; and he proposed that Caesar should be deprived of the command
                    of the armies of Gaul; but this advice was not attended to. (Cic. <hi
                    rend="italic">Alt.</hi> vii. 1.) The civil war broke out <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(b. c.</hi> 49), when Marcellus joined the party of Pompey; but on the death of
                    the latter <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 48), he ceased to take part in the
                    political affairs of his country, and retired to Mitylene, that he might not
                    witness the overthrow of the republic. Here he was found by Brutus as he was
                    returning from Asia. (Senec. <hi rend="italic">ad Helv.c.</hi> 9.) His friends
                    at Rome, however, were anxious that he should return, and they did not find it
                    difficult to prevail on Caesar to forget the part he had taken against him. His
                    pardon, indeed, seems to have been more readily granted by Caesar than accepted
                    by Marcellus. He was unwilling to leave his retreat at Mitylene, if we may judge
                    from the letters of Cicero addressed to him. They are the seventh, eighth,
                    ninth, and tenth of the fourth book <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Familiares.</hi> The eleventh is from Marcellus to Cicero. Marcellus, however,
                    at last yielded, and had reached Athens on his way homewards, when he was
                    murdered by P. Magius, one of his companions in exile, in despair at his
                    departure, B. c. 46. His old colleague Sulpicius happened to be at Athens at
                    this time, and took care that his funeral rites should be properly attended to.
                    (Cic. <hi rend="italic">ad Div.</hi> iv. 12.) When Caesar granted the pardon of
                    Marcellus, Cicero returned thanks in a most eloquent speech, which is still
                    preserved <hi rend="italic">{Pro Marcello).</hi> This was the first time he had
                    spoken in the senate after the downfall of the republic, and his speech is
                    supposed to be the model on which Pliny the younger formed his Panegyric on
                    Trajan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Marcellus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ. Claudius,</hi> son of C.
                    Marcellus, and of Octavia, sister to Augustus, seems to have been endowed by
                    nature with all those qualities which unite to form a great character. Capable
                    of the closest application to study, gentle in his manners, and temperate in his
                    habits, he was regarded by the Romans with feelings of the strongest affection.
                    He was first betrothed to Pompeia, the daughter of Sextus Pompey, so early as
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 37, when she was only six years of age (Dion
                    Cass, xlviii. 38); but he subsequently married Julia, the daughter of Augustus,
                    when he had reached his seventeenth year, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. 26
                    (liii. 27, Suet. Aug. 63). He was raised to the curule edileship by the senate;
                    but he died very suddenly, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 23, owing, it is
                    said, to the injudicious use of the cold bath prescribed by Antonius Musa, the
                    physician of Augustus. (Dion Cass, liii. 30.) The Romans were overwhelmed with
                    grief at his death, and suspected the Empress Livia of having poisoned him, that
                    her own son Tiberius might be the successor of Augustus. His mother Octavia is
                    said to have shut herself up in her room for many months, and to have refused
                    all consolation. (Sen. <hi rend="italic">ad Mare,</hi> ii.) In the life of
                    Virgil, commonly ascribed to Donatus, we are told that the poet recited to her
                    part of the AEneid, and when he came to the words</p>
                <p>Heu! miserande puer, si quid fata aspera rumpas, Tu Marcellus eris, alluding to
                    his ancestor the great Marcellus, she fainted away. When she recovered, she
                    ordered the poet to be rewarded with a large sum of money. Marcellus was buried
                    in the Campus Martius, in the mausoleum of Augustus, and the emperor built a
                    theatre, calling it after his name, <hi rend="italic">Theatrum. Marcelli.</hi>
                    (Tacit. <hi rend="italic">Ann,</hi> iii. 64.)</p>
