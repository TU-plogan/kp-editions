                <p><label type="entry">MASSACHUSETTS</label>, oneofthe United StatesofNorth America,
                    is bounded on the north by New Hampshire and Vermont, on the south by
                    Connecticut and Rhode Island, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west
                    by the state of New York. It extends from long. 69. 50. to 73. 10. and from lat.
                    41. 23. to 43. 52. being 180 miles in length from east to west, and ninety-six
                    miles in breadth from north to south. The mean width is about fifty miles, and
                    the area about 7500 square miles. This state presents a surface pleasantly
                    undulated with hills and valleys, and is naturally divided into three distinct
                    zones. The first, stretching along the sea-shore, and extending twenty miles
                    into the interior, is a belt of marine alluvium, little elevated above the
                    ocean, and naturally fertile only at intervals. This plain is succeeded by a
                    fine hilly tract, which crosses the state from north to south, and from which
                    rivers are poured in every direction. The second or middle zone includes part of
                    the beautiful valley of Connecticut, and is followed by the mountainous but
                    highly fertile county of Berkshire, which comprises the whole western part of
                    the state. The soil of Massachusetts is exceedingly various, comprising every
                    description, from the most sterile to the most productive. In the eastern and
                    south-eastern parts it is in general light and sandy, interspersed, however,
                    with numerous fertile tracts. Towards the sea-coast ôn the north it is of better
                    quality, though not distinguished for fertility. By careful cultivation,
                    however, both this and other parts of the state have been rendered highly
                    productive. The middle and western regions have for the most part a strong, rich
                    soil, excellent for grazing, and suited to most other agricultural purposes.
                    Viewed at a glance, the surface of this state swells from the Atlantic Ocean to
                    the hills, then sinks into the richly decorated valley of Connecticut, and again
                    rises into the mountainous region of Berkshire. The principal mountains are a
                    part of the Green Mountain range, which stretches from north to south through
                    the western part of the state. The most elevated summits of this ridge are
                    Saddle Mountain, near the north-western angle of the state, and Tahconick on the
                    western border. These mountains present a great variety of beautiful and
                    impressive scenery, noble elevations alternating with dark green forests and
                    pleasant well-sheltered valleys. Mount Tom and Mount Holyoke, near the
                    Connecticut River, are remarkable elevations, which from their summits afford a
                    beautiful prospect of the surrounding country. A second ridge passes through the
                    state near its centre. The greatest elevation of this ridge is that of Wachuset,
                    in the town of Princeton. The state abounds in small lakes, which are generally
                    called <hi rend="italic">ponds.</hi> The largest of these are the Assa-wapset
                    and Long Ponds in Middleburgh, Podunk and Quabang Ponds in Brookfield, and the
                    Naukeag Ponds in Ashburnham. The last named are situated more than 1100 feet
                    above the level of the sea, and several other ponds in the western part of the
                    state have a still higher elevation. Massachusetts has no very large rivers
                    wholly within its bounds. The Connecticut traverses it from north to south, and
                    is navigable by steam-boats of small draught. The Merrimac passes out of New
                    Hampshire into the northern division of the state, and empties itself into the
                    sea at Newburyport. The Housatonic, Charles, Ipswich, Concord, Blackstone,
                    Miller’s, Chickopee, Deerfield, Westfield, Neponset, and Taunton, though they
                    have short courses, are pleasant streams. Indeed no country is better provided
                    with rivers and streams which flow in all directions, and afford abundance of
                    water for every necessary purpose. The rivers abound in falls, admirably adapted
                    for mill-sites appropriated to manufacturing operations.</p>
                <p>Every product which the northern states furnish, and much that is not indigenous
                    to the soil and climate, have been naturalized in Massachusetts by skill and
                    careful cultivation. The principal productions are Indian corn, rye, wheat,
                    oats, barley, peas, beans, buck-wheat, potatoes, hops, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194203761" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3761-0303"/>flax, and hemp. Beef, pork,
                    butter, and cheese, are abundant in most parts of the state, and of excellent
                    quality; the county of Berkshire in particular is distinguished for its
                    extensive dairies. This state is particularly celebrated for its orchards, where
                    the finest fruits are produced in abundance. Those principally cultivated are
                    apples, peaches, pears, quinces, plums, cherries, and currants. Great quantities
                    of cider are annually made, and this constitutes the common beverage of the
                    inhabitants. There are several valuable mines in Massachusetts. Bog-iron ore is
                    found in several parts, and there are numerous establishments for working it.
                    There is a lead mine in Southampton county, to which a subterranean passage of
                    one thousand feet has been opened, chiefly through solid rock; but the cheapness
                    of lead from Missouri and Illinois has suspended operations in this mine. There
                    are inexhaustible quarries of marble and limestone, and an abundance of granite
                    of the best description for building. Soapstone, slate, ochre, and other mineral
                    productions, are also to be met with in various parts.</p>
                <p>There are a greater number of individuals engaged in commerce in this than in any
                    other state in the Union. It shares in the greater proportion of the bank and
                    whale fisheries of the United States. This pursuit employs many thousands of
                    men, furnishes one of the most important items in these parts of the states, and
                    trains vast numbers of intrepid and experienced mariners. The shipping is more
                    extensive than that of any other state; and, in the extent of its foreign
                    commerce, Massachusetts is second only to New York. The principal articles of
                    export are fish, beef, pork, lumber, ardent spirits, flax-seed, whale oil,
                    spermaceti, and various manufactures. The latter are numerous, the principal
                    being those of cotton cloths, boots and shoes, ardent spirits, leather, cordage,
                    wrought and cast iron, nails, woollens, straw bonnets, hats, cabinet-work,
                    paper, oil, and muskets There is an extensive national establishment for the
                    manufacture of arms at Springfield.</p>
                <p>There being no large rivers in Massachusetts to facilitate intercourse with the
                    interior country, a number of artificial channels of communication have been
                    constructed The Middlesex Canal leaves the Merrimac Canal above its lower falls,
                    and terminates at Charlestown, opposite Boston, being about twenty-seven miles
                    in length. Concord River crosses the line of the canal on the summit-level,
                    twenty-two miles from Charlestown, and five from the junction of the canal with
                    the Merrimac, thus affording an ample supply of water and lockage in both
                    directions. Round the falls in Connecticut River, at South Hadley, there is a
                    canal cut through the solid rock, more than forty feet deep, and three hundred
                    feet long. There are other falls on the Connecticut, above and below South
                    Hadley, which have been overcome by canals, dams, and <hi rend="subscript">
                    ι</hi> other improvements, so that the river is now navigable for boats through
                    the whole of its course in this state, and as high as Bath in New Hampshire. The
                    Blackstone Canal is about forty-five miles in length, extending from Provi-lence
                    to Worcester, and has been in operation for several /ears. The Farmington Canal
                    extends from the city of Newhaven to the south line of Massachusetts, where it s
                    connected with the Hampshire and Hampden Canal, vhich goes to Northampton on the
                    Connecticut River, a ’ listance of about thirty-five miles. A great number of
                    umpike roads have been constructed by companies incor- ∙orated by the
                    legislature of the state. These public works ntersect the country in every
                    direction, and have greatly xcilitated the trade of the state, without, however,
                    being productive of much emolument to the proprietors. A railroad of three miles
                    in length has been constructed at Quincy, for the purpose of transmitting the
                    valuable granite of that town to the navigable port of Boston Harbour. Three
                    railroads have been very recently constructed from Boston, one to the town of
                    Lowell, a distance of about twenty-five miles; another to Worcester, forty miles
                    long; and a third to Providence, about the same length. From Providence a
                    railroad was commenced in 1833 to Stovington in Connecticut, a distance of about
                    forty-eight miles. Amongst the public improvements of various kinds which have
                    been made, may be mentioned the numerous bridges over the Connecticut and other
                    rivers, and over the arms of Boston Harbour.</p>
                <p>The principal literary institution is Harvard University, at Cambridge, three
                    miles west by north of Boston. It is the most wealthy as well as the most
                    ancient institution of the kind in the United States, having been founded in
                    1638, less than twenty years after the settlement of New England. It has a
                    president, eight professors, and six tutors and other teachers, besides four
                    professors of the medical school and two of the law school. It has a library
                    containing above 36,000 volumes of choice books, a large and valuable cabinet of
                    minerals, an excellent anatomical museum, a complete set of philosophical
                    apparatus, a botanic garden, and other necessary adjuncts of a university.
                    William’s College in William’s Town, in the north-west corner of the state, was
                    incorporated in 1793; and Amherst College in Hampshire county in 1825. They have
                    each a president, and several professors and tutors. At Andover there is a
                    richly endowed and flourishing theological seminary; and also an academy, the
                    best endowed and most distinguished in the state. There are, besides, a great
                    number of other academies throughout Massachusetts, and common schools are
                    universally established at the public expense. The laws require that every town
                    or district containing fifty families shall be provided with a school or schools
                    equivalent in time to six months for one school in a year, one containing a
                    hundred families twelve months, and so on; and the several towns in the state
                    are authorized and directed to raise such sums of money as are necessary for the
                    support of the schools, and to assess and collect the money in the same manner
                    as other town taxes. Each town is also required to choose annually a school
                    committee of three, five, or seven persons, to take the general charge and
                    superintendence of the public schools. The charitable and other establishments
                    are too numerous to be particularly specified. In respect to education, there is
                    no country in which it is more strictly attended to, or more universally
                    diffused. Religious sects are of course numerous in Massachusetts. The
                    Congregationalists have 491 churches, and 423 ordained ministers, of whom 118
                    are Unitarians; the Baptists have 129 churches, the Methodists seventy-one
                    preachers, the Universalists forty-six societies, the Episcopalians thirty-one
                    ministers, the New Jerusalem church eight societies, the Presbyterians nine
                    ministers, the Roman Catholics four churches, and the Shakers four
                    societies.</p>
                <p>There are now no slaves in this state, nor was their number ever very
                    considerable. Previously to the declaration of independence, public opinion was
                    strongly expressed against slavery. The first article in the declaration of
                    rights contained in the general constitution is, that “all men are born free and
                    equal and this was decided by the supreme court of Massachusetts, in 1783, to be
                    equivalent to an abolition of slavery, which was accordingly carried into
                    effect.</p>

                    Counties and County Towns.For a description of Boston, the capital of
                    Massachusetts, and of Charlestown, which is connected with it by a bridge over
                    Charles River, see the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Boston</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Charlestown</hi> in this work. In the vicinity of Boston there
                    are a great number of beautiful villages, some of them large enough to be
                    classed in the rank of towns. Amongst these may be mentioned Roxbury,
                    Dorchester, Milton, Cambridge, Waterton, Medford, Chelsea, and Lynn. Salem,
                    situated thirteen miles north-east of Boston, is built on a projection of land
                    formed by two arms of the sea called North and South Rivers. Over the former is
                    a bridge more than fifteen hundred feet in length, connecting Salem with the
                    populous town of Beverley. The South River forms the harbour, which has good
                    anchorage, but contains only about twelve feet of water. The situation of the
                    town is low, but healthy. It is ŵell built, partly of brick, and many of the
                    houses are large and elegant, with gardens attached to them. Salem contains a
                    court-house, jail, alms-house, market-house, East India marine museum, and a
                    lyceum. It has eight banks, five insurance companies, one mutual insurance
                    company, and an institution for savings. There are two libraries, an athenaeum
                    containing 6000 volumes, and a mechanics’ library. Three halfweekly and two
                    weekly papers are published. There are two white-lead factories, sixteen
                    tanneries, eleven rope and twine factories, and a chemical laboratory. There are
                    a number of places of worship for various religious· sects, and great attention
                    is paid to the education of youth. In 1801 a society was incorporated, composed
                    of such persons as had sailed from this port round the Cape of Good Hope or Cape
                    Horn in the capacity of masters or supercargoes of vessels. This East India
                    Marine Society is designed to afford relief to indigent members or their
                    families, and to promote the knowledge of navigation and trade to the East
                    Indies, upon which Salem principally depends, and in which it has a large amount
                    of capital embarked. This town is the second in Massachusetts in point of
                    population, and probably also in respect of wealth; but New Bedford now
                    surpasses it in its amount of shipping, and Lowell and some other towns greatly
                    exceed it in manufactures.</p>
                <p>Lowell, the chief seat of the cotton manufacture in the United States, is
                    situated twenty-five miles north-west from Boston, at the confluence of the
                    rivers Merrimac and Concord. It was formerly a section of the town of
                    Chelmsford, and derives its name from Francis Lowell, who introduced the
                    manufacture of cotton into the state. It contains a number of churches and
                    public buildings, and has had a very rapid growth, having risen into
                    manufacturing importance only of late years. The source of its riches and power
                    is the water of the Merrimac, which is conducted to the town by a canal one mile
                    and a half in length, eight feet deep, and sixty wide, distributed by lateral
                    branches, and again discharged either into the Merrimac or Concord, the fall
                    being thirty-two feet. Lowell communicates with Boston by a canal and a railway.
                    The manufactures comprehend those of cotton and woollen of various kinds,
                    gunpowder, and other articles. The chief manufacturing establishment is that of
                    the Merrimac Company, which, in 1832, employed four hundred males and nine
                    hundred females, and had one thousand looms and twenty-six thousand spindles at
                    work. In 1833 there were in Lowell altogether 3494 looms and 97,400 spindles,
                    which gave employment to 1155 males and 4595 females. The number of bales
                    manufactured per annum was 32,607, or 36,044,000 yards. Of the thirty-six
                    millions of yards of cloth made, eight millions were printed. Including the
                    printed goods, which sell at twenty and twenty-eight cents, the whole may be
                    calculated at ten cents per yard, making about three and a half millions of
                    dollars per annum. Lowell is connected with the village Belvedere by a bridge
                    over the river Concord, the water of which is also employed in giving motion to
                    machinery. Seven newspapers are published, one of which is a daily print. There
                    are no less than forty religious and benevolent societies, an unusually large
                    number for the population of the place, but probably arising from the zeal of
                    the religious sects to cutvie each other in good deeds. By the census of 1832,
                    the population amounted to 10,254.</p>
                <p>Marblehead is situated on a peninsula extending more than three miles into
                    Massachusetts Bay, and varying in breadth from one to two miles. It is four
                    miles and a half <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203787"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3787-0305"/>south-east of Salem, and sixteen north-east of
                    Boston, ir latitude 42. 32. north, longitude 70. 51. west. The town is compactly
                    built, but the streets are crooked and irregular It contains five places of
                    public worship, and a customhouse. The harbour, which is a mile long and half a
                    mile wide, is very safe, except when storms from the north-east prevail. This
                    town was settled very soon after Salem, by a number of fishermen, and the
                    inhabitants have* been principally devoted to the Bank fisheries. In this
                    business Marblehead has greatly excelled all the other American towns.
                    Previously to the revolution it was in a very flourishing state, but during that
                    struggle, and also during the last war, it suffered severely. In 1830 it
                    contained a population of 5150. Beverley is a wealthy mercantile town, and, like
                    the preceding, largely engaged in the fisheries. It has a population of between
                    four and five thousand. Newbury port, a post-town and port of entry, is situated
                    on the south bank of the Merrimac, three miles from its mouth, twenty-four miles
                    north of Salem, and thirty-two north-north-east of Boston, in latitude 42. 49.
                    north, and longitude 70. 52. west. This town is very pleasantly situated, and
                    handsomely built. The streets are regular, and cross each other nearly at right
                    angles. The dwellinghouses are uncommonly good, and the public buildings are
                    constructed in a very handsome style. It contains a courthouse, a jail, a
                    market, a town-hall, several school-houses, and seven churches. There are
                    several distilleries, a brewery, and manufactures of carriages, shoes, hats,
                    cordage, morocco leather, and gold and silver plate. It has a respectable amount
                    of shipping and foreign commerce, and is largely engaged in the fisheries.
                    Ship-building is carried on to a considerable extent; and although the town is
                    scarcely in so flourishing a condition as it was formerly, it is still
                    interesting and important, and is improving. Gloucester is situated on the
                    peninsula of Cape Ann, sixteen miles north-east of Salem. It is one of the most
                    considerable fishing towns in the commonwealth, containing six churches, with
                    several public buildings, and between six and seven thousand inhabitants.</p>
                <p>New Bedford, a post-town and port of entry, is situated fifty-two miles south of
                    Boston, in latitude 4L 38. north, longitude 70. 56. west. It stands on an arm of
                    Buzzard’s Bay, aed is laid out upon ground sloping to the water, in streets
                    intersecting each other at right angles. This town has rapidly increased in
                    trade and population, and the inhabitants possess great enterprise, and are very
                    wealthy. The whale fishery constitutes their principal business, and in it they
                    have engaged about 150 ships and fifteen brigs. The fishing of cod on the grand
                    banks is also carried on; and the people are extensively engaged in many other
                    branches of commerce. New Bedford contains a courthouse, a jail, an alms-house,
                    three banks, two insurance offices, an academy, a flourishing lyceum, four
                    printing offices (one of which issues a daily, and the others weekly
                    newspapers), eleven churches, and a chapel for seamen. Plymouth, a post-town and
                    port of entry, is situated thirty-six miles south-south-east of Boston. It is
                    remarkable is the place where the first settlers of New England landed, on the
                    22d of December 1620. The harbour is spacious, but shallow. The town has
                    considerable commerce, ιnd valuable manufactures of iron. An elegant hall has
                    3een erected for the use of the pilgrim society; and there .s a court-house,
                    which stands in latitude 41. 57. north, and longitude 70. 42. 30. west. A part
                    of the rock on which the puritan emigrants landed on their arrival from England,
                    has been conveyed to the centre of the town. Worcester is an inland town,
                    situated forty miles west by south of Boston. It is a neat and flourishing
                    place, with considerable trade and manufactures. Amongst the pubic buildings are
                    a court-house, jail, county penitentiary, lunatic hospital, town-hall, and four
                    places of public worship. There are three printing offices, from which four
                    newspapers are issued weekly. The American Antiquarian Society has here a
                    handsome hall, a valuable cabinet, and a library containing about 8000 volumes,
                    amongst which are many ancient and rare works on American history. The town was
                    incorporated in the year 1722, and, on the erection of Worcester county, in
                    1732, became the capital. Springfield, a town of some size, is situated on the
                    east side of Connecticut River, ninety-seven miles southwest of Boston. The
                    houses are well built, and the town has an appearance of great industry and
                    wealth. There are many new and elegant erections, including several places of
                    public worship, and the county buildings. On Mill River, which flows into the
                    Connecticut, there are very extensive mills and factories of various kinds. In
                    the town is a very extensive government establishment for the manufacture of
                    arms. The arsenal is situated on an elevated plain, about half a mile from the
                    town. Springfield is connected with West Springfield by an elegant bridge.
                    Northampton, a post-town, is situated on the west bank of Connecticut River,
                    ninety-five miles west of Boston. It is well built, and chiefly consists of two
                    streets proceeding like radii from a circle, though with many irregularities. It
                    contains several handsome public buildings, and a number of respectable
                    seminaries of education, A stream passes near the centre of the town, on which
                    are erected numerous mills and manufactories, and amongst these are two for
                    making woollen stuffs. A bridge above 1000 feet in length, connecting this town
                    with Hadley, was built in 1826. In the vicinity of Northampton there is a noted
                    mine, which is visited by strangers as a curiosity.</p>
                <p>Waltham, a post-town, is situated on the north side of Charles River, ten miles
                    west of Boston. It contains three cotton manufactories, which are amongst the
                    most extensive and best conducted establishments of the kind in the country. The
                    quantity of cotton annually used amounts to about 700,000 pounds, and the cloth
                    made to 2,000,000 yards. There are also bleaching works, at which two tons of
                    goods are daily bleached, calendered, and packed. In 1830 the population of this
                    place was 1859. Cambridge, a post-town, is situated on the north side of Charles
                    River, at the distance of three miles from Boston. It consists of three
                    principal parts or divisions, namely, Old Cambridge, which contains the
                    university already noticed, a state arsenal, and several places of public
                    worship; Cambridge-Port, which is a considerable trading village, containing
                    four places of public worship, and is connected with the capital of the state by
                    West Boston Bridge; and East Cambridge, which is a flourishing manufacturing
                    village, situated on Lechmere Point, and connected with Boston by means of
                    Craigie’s or Canal Bridge. It contains a court-house, a jail, a large glass
                    manufactory, and three places of public worship. Concord, a post-town, is
                    pleasantly situated upon the western bank of the river Merrimac, sixty-three
                    miles north-north-west of Boston. It contains a state-house and state-prison,
                    both built of stone, a court-house, three places of public worship, and about
                    two hundred dwelling-houses. Much of the trade of the upper country centres
                    here; and the importance of the place is increased by the boat navigation which
                    is opened between this place and Boston, by means of the Merrimac River and
                    Middlesex Canal. There are two bridges in Concord across the Merrimac, one in
                    the north part, the other connecting the town with Pembroke. Taunton is situated
                    at the junction of Canoe, Rumford, and Taunton Rivers, thirty-two miles south of
                    Boston. It is a handsome and flourishing place, containing the county buildings,
                    a bank, an academy, and seven meeting-houses. It has the command of excellent
                    water power, and there are <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203800"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3800-0306"/>here several factories for cotton, paper, nails,
                    and various kinds of iron work. Lynn, a post-town, is situated nine miles
                    north-north-east of Boston. It is noted for the manufacture of shoes, about
                    1,500,000 pairs of women’s shoes being made here annually. There is a medicinal
                    spring in this place, near which is a house for the accommodation of visitors.
                    In 1830 the population was 6138. Andover, a post-toavnship, is situated on the
                    south-east side of the Merrimac, twenty miles north of Boston. It is a pleasant
                    and flourishing place, containing three parishes, in each of which there is a
                    congregational meeting-house. Andover has some manufactures, but it is chiefly
                    celebrated for its literary institutions, particularly the theological seminary
                    already noticed. The population is about 4000. Amongst the manufacturing towns
                    not already described are Fitchburg and Milbury in the county of Worcester,
                    Bridgewater and Middleborough, noted for their manufactures of iron, Leominster,
                    Mendon, Troy, Leicester, and various other places too numerous to mention.</p>
                <p>Nantucket is an island of Massachusetts, situated to the south of the peninsula
                    of Cape Cod, at the distance of 120 miles south-south-east of Boston. It is
                    fifteen miles in length, and at its widest part eleven miles in breadth, being
                    situated in long. 69. 56. to 70. 13. west, lat. 4L 13. to 41. 22. north. The
                    island, town, and county of Nantucket have the same limits; but the county of
                    Dukes is associated with it for several political purposes. A great proportion
                    of the inhabitants are Quakers, and the land is held in common; but it is sandy
                    and unproductive. Little attention is paid to agriculture, and the sheep and
                    cows of all the inhabitants feed on one extensive common. The right of the
                    island was originally granted by William earl of Stirling, to Thomas Mayhew, and
                    conveyed by him to nine proprietors, who divided it into twenty-seven shares in
                    1659. It is mostly a joint property to this day, but the number of shares has
                    been increased to several thousands. The inhabitants are chiefly engaged in the
                    whale-fishery, and the seamen are celebrated for their skill and daring. Their
                    trade suffered severely during the late war, and also by the war of the
                    revolution, but it is now flourishing; and several very extensive spermaceti
                    works are in full operation.</p>
                <p>The port of Nantucket is situated upon the north-west side of the island, and has
                    a very good harbour. It contains two banks, two insurance offices, and seven
                    houses of public worship. Education is well attended to, and the habits of the
                    people are generally moral and industrious. For many years the island has been
                    destitute of indigenous trees, and few are cultivated. In 1820 the amount of
                    shipping was 28,512 tons. To the west of Nantucket is another island called
                    Martha’s Vineyard, but it is of comparatively little importance.</p>
                <p>In the year 1831 there were in Massachusetts 8981 mills and 339,777 spindles at
                    work. At the same time, 69,880 spindles were in the course of being erected.
                    There were sold of yarn during that year 807,366 pounds, and of cloth 79,231,000
                    yards. Woollen goods are also manufactured to a very considerable extent, and
                    there are several glasshouses, and paper and other manufactories. In 1833 two
                    lead manufactories existed in Salem, and made the following quantities, viz.
                    white lead 2,081,894 pounds, red lead 42,236 pounds, and acetate of lead 20,586
                    pounds; the value of the whole being 195,000 dollars. The making of braid or
                    straav bonnets, and palm-leaf hats, is a branch of industry carried on to a
                    considerable extent; and in 1830 common salt was manufactured in this state to
                    the amount of 567,239 bushels. The preparing of flax and hemp, the making of
                    combs and buttons, also constitute considerable branches of domestic industry.
                    The following are returns for the year 1830 of the quantity of shipping
                    belonging to Massachusetts:</p>
                <p>Of registered vessels, 402 ships, 433 brigs, 141 schooners, and three sloops; of
                    enrolled and licensed vessels, 55 brigs, 1546 schooners, 472 sloops, and eight
                    steam-boats; of licensed vessels under twenty tons, 54 schooners, and 47 sloops.
                    The total number of vessels was 3161, manned by 23,270 mariners. Massachusetts
                    monopolizes nearly the whole of the North American whale-fishery. By returns for
                    the winter of 1834, above 434 vessels were engaged in this trade, of which 286
                    belonged to the state of Massachusetts. The number of vessels employed in the
                    sperm fishing in New Bedford and Nantucket during the same year was 181, and
                    there were a few more from other ports of Massachusetts. The following is a
                    statement of the commerce of the state for the year ending September 1833.
                    Imported in American vessels 19,447,267; in foreign vessels 493,644; total

                <p>The first English settlement made in New England was formed by 101 persons, who
                    fled from religious persecution in England, landed at Plymouth on the 22d of
                    December 1620, and laid the foundation of Plymouth colony. The settlement of the
                    colony of Massachusetts Bay was commenced at Salem in 1628, and in 1630 Boston
                    was settled. For many years the colonies styled the Plymouth colony and the
                    colony of Massachusetts continued separate, each electing its own governor and
                    managing its own affairs independently of the other. In 1685-86, however, they,
                    with the rest of the New England states, were deprived of their charters, and
                    placed under the government, first of Joseph Dudley, and afterwards of Sir
                    Edmond Andros. In 1692 they were united into one colony under a new charter, and
                    the governors were afterwards appointed by the king. The constitution was formed
                    in the year1780, and amended in 1821. The legislative power is vested in a
                    senate and House of Representatives, which together are styled the General Court
                    of Massachusetts. The members of the House of Representatives are elected
                    annually, and consist in all of between 500 and 600 individuals. Every corporate
                    town having 150 rateable polls may elect one representative, and another for
                    every additional 225 rateable polls. The senate consists of forty members, who
                    are chosen by districts annually. The governor or supreme executive magistrate
                    is also elected annually, and is assisted in his office by a council of nine
                    members, who are chosen, by the joint ballot of the senators and
                    representatives, from amongst the senators. The general court meets at Boston on
                    the first Wednesday of January. The right of suffrage is granted to every male
                    citizen twenty-one years of age (excepting paupers and persons under
                    guardianship) who has resided within the commonwealth one year, and within the
                    town or district in which he may claim a right to vote, six calendar months
                    immediately preceding any election, and who has paid a state or county tax
                    assessed upon him within two years preceding such election; and also every
                    citizen who may be by law exempted<pb break="no" facs="nls:194203813"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3813-0307"/> from taxation, and who may be in all other
                    respects qualified as above mentioned. The judiciary power is vested in a
                    supreme court and a court of common pleas, consisting of four members each,
                    besides such other courts as the legislature may establish. The judges are
                    appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the council,
                    and they hold their offices during good behaviour. Justices of the peace have
                    original and exclusive jurisdiction in all civil cases in which the debt or
                    damages demanded do not exceed twenty dollars, except where the title to real
                    property comes in question. They have concurrent criminal jurisdiction as to
                    breaches of the peace not aggravated in their nature, and in cases of larceny
                    where the goods stolen do not exceed the value of five dollars. The court of
                    common pleas has an appellate jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases tried
                    originally before a justice of the peace. It has original and exclusive
                    jurisdiction in all civil commonlaw cases, where the damage or debt demanded
                    exceeds the sum of twenty dollars; and final jurisdiction where the damages
                    demanded do not exceed one hundred dollars. Its criminal jurisdiction depends
                    generally upon particular statutes. In relation to offences at common law, its
                    jurisdiction includes everything where the punishment does not extend to life,
                    demembration, or banishment, except where the punishment is by statute to be
                    administered by the supreme court. In cases of mortgages, and of forfeitures
                    annexed to contracts, this court has a concurrent chancery jurisdiction. The
                    supreme judicial court has appellate jurisdiction in all cases where the debt or
                    damage exceeds one hundred dollars, and in all criminal cases originally tried
                    in the court of common pleas or the municipal court of the city of Boston. It
                    has concurrent jurisdiction in all criminal cases cognisable by the inferior
                    courts, and original and exclusive jurisdiction in all capital cases. It has
                    also original and exclusive jurisdiction in all cases of alimony and divorce;
                    and chancery powers in cases of trusts, specific performance of contracts in
                    writing, mortgages, settlement of partnership accounts,waste, nuisance, and
                    forfeitures annexed to contracts. It is the supreme court of probate, entertains
                    appeals from the probate courts of the counties, and has a general
                    superintending power over all inferior tribunals by writ of error, certiorari,
                    quo warranto, &amp;c. The probate courts, of which there is one in each county,
                    consisting of a single judge, have original and exclusive jurisdiction in the
                    probate of wills, settlement of estates, and guardianship of minors, idiots,
                    lunatics, and others. There is in Boston a police court, consisting of three
                    justices; a justices’ court for the county of Suffolk; and a municipal court,
                    consisting of one judge who takes cognizance of all crimes not capital committed
                    within the county of Suffolk, and appellate jurisdiction in all criminal cases
                    tried before the police court. (κ. <hi rend="smallcaps">r. r.)</hi></p>
