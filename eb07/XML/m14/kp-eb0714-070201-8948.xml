                    rend="smallcaps">Buonaventura,</hi> one of the great masters of modern Italian
                    poetry, was born at Rome on the 3d of January 1698. Though the son of a poor
                    artisan named Trapassi, he had nevertheless for his godfather the Cardinal
                    Pietro Ottoboni, who gave to the infant his own Christian name. The young
                    Trapassi had scarcely attained the age of ten, when his poetical talent
                    displayed itself by his surprising improvisations. One day when a crowd of
                    persons had assembled around him in the Campus Martius, the celebrated
                    jurisconsult Gravina approached, and having listened to his performance,
                    bestowed on it some just commendations; after which he offered the boy a piece
                    of money, which the latter nobly refused. Gravina, not less delighted with his
                    spirit than charmed with his genius, went immediately to the father of the boy,
                    and without much difficulty persuaded him to abandon all concern about the
                    education of his son, whom he undertook to instruct; and, in point of fact, the
                    generous jurisconsult taught him the elements of Greek, Latin, and Italian
                    literature. By a singular caprice, the young man changed his name of Trapassi
                    into that of <hi rend="italic">Metastasio,</hi> which, in Greek, has the same
                    signification; and, according to the Roman usage, he prefixed to it the title of
                    Abbate. Gravina, though chiefly devoted to the study of legislation, was also
                    addicted to poetry, in the cultivation of which he sought rclief from graver and
                    more laborious pursuits. Being particularly attached to the Greek drama, he
                    aspired to the glory of reviving it in Italy; and he had already published five
                    tragedies, on the ancient model, when he became convinced that his pupil was
                    much better qualified than himself for the execution of this grand project. At
                    his instigation, accordingly, Metastasio, though as yet only fourteen years of
                    age, composed his <hi rend="italic">Giustino,</hi> the great defect of which is
                    too servile an imitation of the ancients; and at the same time, for his own
                    satisfaction, he amused himself in translating portions of the Iliad into
                    Italian verse. Nevertheless, Gravina, concerned about the fortune of his pupil,
                    wished that with the cultivation of letters Metastasio should combine the study
                    ofjurisprudence. To this austere occupation the young poet sacrificed with
                    regret the time which he was forced to take from the muses; but Gravina died
                    suddenly, leaving the greater part of his property to his adopted son; and
                    Metastasio, though not yet twenty years of age, thus found himself master of a
                    considerable fortune. In an elegy entitled <hi rend="italic">La Strada della
                    Gloria,</hi> he bewailed the death of his benefactor, for whose memory he
                    cherished the most ardent and sincere regard; but the numerous acquaintance whom
                    his talents and fortune procured him soon distracted his attention, whilst they
                    consumed his time; and so inconsiderately did the youth abandon himself to this
                    agitated life, that, at the end of two years, he found he had made more
                    creditors than friends, the bequest of his patron being by this time nearly
                    exhausted.</p>
                <p>In these circumstances, he took the resolution of quitting Rome; and, in 1721,
                    went to establish himself at Naples, in which city he began to devote himself
                    entirely to the theatre. Here a distinguished actress, called La Romanina,
                    contributed so much to the success of his first attempts in the drama, that his
                    gratitude for her exertions soon assumed the character of attachment. Apostolo
                    Zeno, Corneille, and Racine, now became the objects of his continual study. This
                    is attested by several of his Italian biographers, particularly by Mauro Boni,
                    who has written with great care the literary life of the poet; and hence it is
                    not easy to discover upon what authority Schlegel has alleged that Metastasin,
                    in order to preserve his originality pure, boasted of having carefully avoided
                    consulting the masterpieces of the French stage. It was also at Naples, and for
                    La Romanina, that the young poet composed his famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didone</hi><hi rend="italic">abbandonata,</hi> which was represented for the
                    first time in the year 1724. The success of this production is inconceivable.
                    All the great cities of Italy vied with one another in the pomp and splendour of
                    the representations; and the country was deserted by its population, which
                    rushed in a body to witness the performance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didone.</hi> Being now in a condition to satisfy his creditors, Metastasio lost
                    no time in returning to Rome. In the eternal city he had no other residence than
                    that of La Romanina, who repeated and sung his verses as soon as he composed
                    them.</p>
                <p>His reputation having now become general, the Emperor Charles VI. in the year
                    1729 offered him the title of <hi rend="italic">Poeta Cesareo,</hi> or imperial
                    lauréat, with an annual allowance of three thousand florins. In this situation
                    he had the honour to succeed Apostolo Zeno, who himself declared that a better
                    choice could not be made. Before adopting a new country, Metastasio did not
                    neglect the comforts of his family, having secured an asylum for the declining
                    years of his father, and made a provision for each of his sisters. To them also
                    he made over all his income in Italy, and he constantly assisted with his
                    counsel and with his means a younger brother, who followed the profession of
                    advocate at Rome. At length it became necessary to quit La Ro∙ manina, and this
                    separation cost him a severe struggle. Having arrived at Vienna in the spring of
                    the year 1730, he had immediately the honour of being presented to the emperor
                    at the castle of Luxemburg. At the particular request of the master of
                    ceremonies to the apostolic nuncio, Niccolo de Martinez, he took up his abode in
                    the residence of that functionary; and it was in this same house that, some
                    years afterwards, fortune brought together, in two chambers situated the one
                    above the other, two men who have filled Europe with their renown, Metastasio
                    and Haydn. But the only benefits which the great musician, then young and poor,
                    derived from this fortuitous conjunction, were a knowledge of the Italian
                    language, and some counsels as to the best mode of attaining the truly beautiful
                    in art.</p>
                <p>The Italian friends of the new imperial lauréat had predicted to him, when he
                    quitted Rome, that the cloudy atmosphere of Germany would freeze his
                    imagination; but so far was this from being the case, that it never showed
                    itself more ardent or more prolific. Indeed, one cannot help, even now, feeling
                    some surprise in running over the list of the various works which he composed
                    during the first years of his residence at Vienna, and amongst which may be
                    found several of those that have contributed most to extend his reputation. Such
                    are the <hi rend="italic">Giuseppe Ricoosciutο,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Demofonte,</hi> and also the <hi rend="italic">Olimpiade,</hi> which all Italy
                    agreed to surname the divine. A severe affliction, however, served to temper the
                    exultation of success. His faithful friend La Romanina, the ministering angel of
                    his genius, had sunk into a premature grave. But even in this sorrowful
                    occurrence he found an occasion for exemplifying the innate excellence of his
                    character. That celebrated cantatrice had, by her will, left him a legacy of
                    twenty-five thousand Roman crowns, a bequest which lie generously renounced in
                    favour of poor Bulgurelli, the almost forgotten husband of La Romanina.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Whether Metastasiq’s
                    connexion with the Romanina was purely platonic,” says Dr Burney, “or of a less
                    seraphic kind, I shall not pretend to determine; but the husband residing in the
                    same house with them, both at Naples and at Rome, and the friendly manner in
                    which the poet always mentioned him in his letters to the wife, with the open
                    manner in which he expressed his affliction to him after her death, would, in
                    England, be thought indications favourable to conjugal fidelity·” We do not know
                    why they should not be thought so in Italy as well as in England. “But a chaste
                    actress and opera singer,” he adds, “is a still more uncommon phenomenon in
                    Italy than in Britain.” The truth of this alleged fact may, however, be doubted;
                    and, at all events, we have not met with a vestige of evidence to justify the
                    insinuation which it is here employed to convey.</p></note><hi

                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8961-0703"/>Metastasio was engaged upon a new piece, <hi
                    rend="italic">Attilio</hi><hi rend="italic">Elegolo,</hi> when the unexpected
                    death of his august protector disconcerted all his hopes. The Emperor Charles
                    VI. had scarcely been consigned to the tomb when his inheritance was disputed by
                    several powers. His daughter, Maria-Theresa, a fugitive, had no longer a court,
                    and still less a theatre. Metastasio, however, took no steps to employ his
                    talents otherwise, and even celebrated by an ingenious production, <hi
                    rend="italic">Amor Prigionero,</hi> the birth of the prince who afterwards
                    became Joseph 11. It was at this period that Metastasio, though not yet more
                    than forty-three, felt the first symptoms of that nervous malady of which he
                    complained until the close of his career. He soon experienced the most acute
                    pains, and, to aggravate his sufferings, malevolence and calumny tracked his
                    steps. He wished to return to Italy, but could not accomplish his purpose.
                    Having no longer occasion to labour for the theatre, which was shut in
                    consequence of the Seven Years’ War, he amused himself with composing a number
                    of cantatas in honour of the young archduchesses; produced <hi rend="italic">La
                    Contessa de Numi,</hi> in which, whilst celebrating the birth of the son of the
                    Dauphin, he contrives to pay some graceful and flattering compliments to the
                    French nation; and also translated several satires of Juvenal and Horace. In
                    1760, his muse roused herself to celebrate the marriage of Joseph II. His opera
                    of <hi rend="italic">Alcide</hi><hi rend="italic">in bwio</hi> delighted the
                    whole court, which fancied in this production it discovered frequent allusions
                    to the character of the young prince.</p>
                <p>Being already affluent, and loaded with the honourable marks of regard which had
                    been bestowed upon him, Metastasio no longer stood in need of ordinary favours;
                    but he was nevertheless very sensible of the distinction now conferred upon him
                    by Maria-Theresa, who addressed to him several notes which were written with her
                    own hand, and filled with expressions of kindness and good will. A few of these
                    flattering billets have been preserved. They are written in French; and in one
                    of them this great princess says to the poet, “Mon ancien maitre fait la gloire
                    de notre siècle, et plus encore de ceux à qui il s’est voué.” By degrees,
                    Metastasio withdrew entirely from the world, and discontinued publication; but
                    he by no means abandoned the cultivation of letters. He occupied himself with
                    learned analyses of the Poetics of Aristotle and of Horace; and embodied in
                    notes his luminous observations on Aeschylus, ’ Euripides, Sophocles, and
                    Aristophanes. One of the enjoyments of his old age was the publication of the
                    magnificent edition of his works, which was printed at Paris in 1780, under the
                    direction of the learned Pezzana. Several celebrated pieces in that beautiful
                    collection, particularly the <hi rend="italic">Didone,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Adriano,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Semiramide,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alessandro,</hi> were re-touched with extreme care by their
                    illustrious author. He had, in his library, more than forty editions of his
                    works, published at different periods in the first cities of Italy; but he
                    called that of Paris the glory and the crown of his old age.</p>
                <p>These literary distinctions were to him the suitable reward of his long-continued
                    labours. He never aspired to any of those dignities which form the ordinary
                    objects of vulgar ambition. The Emperor Charles VI. several times wished to
                    confer upon him the titles of baron and aulic councillor; but he always replied
                    that his best title was that of poet to his imperial majesty. The empress also
                    offered him the cross of St Stephen; but he declined the honour, excusing
                    himself by saying, that he had no time to perform the duties of knighthood. When
                    Corīlla was crowned in the Capitol, Maria-Theresa expressed a desire to see
                    admitted to the same honour the man who for sixty years had delighted Europe
                    with his harmonious verses; and Pope Clement XIV. warmly responded to the wish
                    of the empress. But the poet was inflexible; he replied that he was too old to
                    ascend the Capitol. Nevertheless the most celebrated writers of the age rendered
                    him homage. Voltaire compared certain scenes of Metastasio to the most sublime
                    productions of Greece; he judged them “worthy of Corneille when he is not a
                    deciaimer, and of Racine when he is not feeble.” Rousseau, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouvelle</hi><hi rend="italic">Heloise,</hi> declared that
                    Metastasio was “the only poet of the heart, the only genius formed to excite
                    emotion by the charm of poetical and musical harmony.” This great writer merited
                    a still higher encomium; he never replied with the least bitterness, even to the
                    most unjust criticisms; and he was always the first to encourage talent wherever
                    he discovered it. Entertaining a deep conviction of the truths of religion,
                    Metastasio observed its precepts without ostentation; and in his old age, this
                    sincere and unaffected piety enabled him to support his sufferings with greater
                    patience and resignation. In the month of February 1780, he believed that his
                    end was approaching, and wishing to consecrate to God the last efforts of his
                    poetical genius, he traced with a trembling hand, but a devout heart, the
                    touching verses beginning, <hi rend="italic">Eterno</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >genitor,</hi> &amp;c. His strength returned, however, and he had the grief to
                    survive his august benefactress, who died in the month of November the same
                    year. He was so sincerely attached to her, that, on several occasions, he was
                    heard to exclaim, “Why have I not descended to the tomb with my excellent
                    mistress ?” But a great consolation was reserved for him in his last days,
                    inasmuch as he lived to witness the arrival of Pope Pius VI. at Vienna. The
                    sovereign pontiff honoured him with many proofs of his esteem, and, as a last
                    token of regard, caused the nuncio Gerampi to convey to him, upon the day of his
                    death, the apostolical benediction. Metastasio expired on the 2d of April 1782,
                    having attained the advanced age of eighty-four years and three months. He was
                    interred in the church of St Michael; and, notwithstanding the formal request
                    expressed in his will, his obsequies were magnificent. Μ. de Martinez, his heir,
                    immediately caused to be struck in memory of his illustrious friend a medal,
                    with this legend, <hi rend="italic">Sophocli Italo.</hi> Of all the portraits of
                    him extant, none is so like the original as that of Heiner, engraved by
                    Mansfield, except it be the bust executed at Vienna by Vinnazar. Metastasio
                    possessed an imposing figure; he was tall and well-proportioned; and his dark
                    eyes had a striking expression. Fortune, indeed, appears to have taken a
                    pleasure in loading him with her favours. Independently of a sumptuous
                    establishment, and a superb library, his succession realized a capital of more
                    than three hundred thousand francs, or above L.12,000 sterling.</p>
                <p>The poetical works of Metastasio consist of sixty-three lyrical tragedies and
                    operas of various kinds; twelve oratorios; forty-eight cantatas or lyric scenes;
                    a vast number of elegies, idylls, canzonette, sonnets, and such like
                    compositions; and, lastly, translations in verse from Latin authors, including
                    one of Horace’s <hi rend="italic">Art of Poetry.</hi> Amongst his works in
                    prose, besides those already mentioned, may be reckoned a very extensive,
                    interesting, and instructive correspondence. Metastasio has found in France
                    several imitators, who have profited by his dramatic conceptions, particularly
                    Belloy and Delrieu; and Labouisse has likewise imitated in French verse his
                    cantatas, which, in as far as respects their ordinary subject, may as well be
                    classed amongst the pastorals as referred to the head of lyric compositions.
                    From the year 1733 to the present time, there have been innumerable editions of
                    the works of Metastasio, many of them exceedingly defective and incomplete. The
                    mopt esteemed are the following, viz. 1. Paris, 1755, in twelve vols. 8vo, under
                    the direction of Calzabigi, and dedicated to Madame de Pompadour; 2. Turin,
                    1757, in fourteen vols. 4to, printed at the royal press, from the preceding
                    edition; 3. Paris, 1780, in twelve vols. large 8vo, under the direction of
                    Pezzana, who accented the prosody <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208974"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8974-0704"/>for the benefit of French readers; 4. Genoa, 1802,
                    in six thick vols. 8vo, small character, an edition superintended by the poet
                    Massuccio, who enriched it with the posthumous works and unedited pieces
                    published at Vienna in 1795, by Count Ajala, but omitted the correspondence; 5.
                    Padua, 1810. There appeared at Paris in 1761 a French translation of the
                    operatic tragedies by Richelet, in twelve vols. 12mo∙</p>
                <p>The Italians have almost deified Metastasio; but, excepting on one point, where
                    ¼they have a sort of privative jurisdiction, we may be permitted to question the
                    propriety of this idolatry. In relation to his style, they are the natural,
                    perhaps the only competent judges; and this style they regard as a model of
                    purity, elegance, and harmony. “The style of Metastasio,” says an Italian
                    critic, “never fails to please those who give way to their own emotions, more
                    than persons of profound meditation; and I would rather be accused of partiality
                    to him whom I venerate and love, than ranked with cold philosophers and deep
                    thinkers, whom I may respect, but cannot admire.” It is in his pieces borrowed
                    from Sacred Scripture that Metastasio has most strikingly exemplified the great
                    beauties of his style. As to the other attributes of his genius, they have been
                    variously estimated by critics. “I know not amongst the moderns,” says Laharpe
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Cσurs de</hi><hi rend="italic">Littérature, “</hi> a
                    writer more precise than Metastasio. A people who may boast of such a poet
                    cannot say that, if he has attached himself exclusively to music, it is because
                    the words are bad. A lively and intelligent people could never be insensible to
                    the genius of Metastasio, displayed in the interest of the situations, and in
                    the beauty of the dialogue and style. Nevertheless, it was at the court of
                    Vienna, and not in his own country, that this celebrated writer found recompense
                    and honour.” But a celebrated German critic, William Schlegel, in his Course of
                    Dramatic Literature, has evinced a much deeper insight into the dramatic system
                    of the Italian poet, and more judiciously discriminated the merits and defects
                    of his works. “The reputation of Metastasio,” says he, “has eclipsed that of
                    Apostolo Zeno, because, .in proposing to himself the same object, he had a much
                    more flexible talent, and knew better how to accommodate himself to the
                    convenience of the musician. Perfect purity of diction, united with sustained
                    grace and elegance, have caused Metastasio to be regarded by his countrymen as a
                    classical author, and, so to speak, as the Racine of Italy. He is pre-eminently
                    distinguished for exquisite sweetness in the verses which he intended to be
                    sung. Perhaps no poet ever possessed in the same degree the power of
                    concentrating, in a narrow compass, all the most touching traits of a pathetic
                    situation. The lyrical monologues at the end of the scenes are the harmonious
                    expression, at once just and concise, of a particular disposition of the soul.
                    It must be confessed, however, that Metastasio never paints the passions except
                    in very general colours; he does not amalgamate with the sentiments of the heart
                    any thing that appertains to the individual character, or is derived from
                    universal contemplation. Thus his pieces are not very powerfully conceived. When
                    you have read a few of them, you know them all. Yet we must not be too severe.
                    The heroes of Metastasio, it is true, are all gallants; in his heroines, too,
                    delicacy often degenerates into mawkish affectation; but perhaps this effeminate
                    poetry has been blamed from a want of proper attention to the nature of the
                    opera.” Justice also requires that, in the peculiar genius of the opera, we
                    should recognise the inevitable cause of that languor and incongruity which too
                    frequently disfigure the most beautiful productions of Metastasio. It is from
                    yielding to the exigencies of this particular species of composition that he has
                    so often violated the law of the unities, disfigured the characters of his
                    heroes, and broken the continuity of his style. He is less excusable in the
                    lavish use of antitheses; but this affectation is a general vice amongst the
                    poets of his country. The lyrical drama, in general, requires a fortunate
                    consummation or denouement; and how often, in order to obey this usage, and to
                    have a brilliant chorus, or a final divertissement, has the poet found himself
                    under the necessity of inverting the tragic action, and denaturalizing his
                    characters? It is painful to think that so many sacrifices to a frivolous
                    fashion have, from the immense development of the musical system which has since
                    taken place, been made altogether in vain.</p>
