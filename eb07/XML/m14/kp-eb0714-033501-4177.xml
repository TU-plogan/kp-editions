                <p><label type="entry">MAYER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Tobias</hi></label>, one of the
                    greatest astronomers of the eighteenth century, was born on the 17th of February
                    1723, at Marbach in the country of Wirtemberg. His father, who held the office
                    of inspector of waters at Essling, was much occupied with hydraulic
                    architecture, and early inspired him with a taste for the mathematical sciences
                    and that of design. The latter talent, which is sufficiently rare amongst
                    astronomers, proved useful to him upon more than one occasion, as may be seen by
                    inspecting the volume containing his posthumous works. After the death of his
                    father, young Mayer having no estate or fortune to depend upon, applied himself
                    to teach mathematics, which he had learned by himself from the first books on
                    the subject which fell into his hands. At the age of twenty, he studied the
                    principles of artillery with a view to enter the service. In 1745 he published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Curves for the Construction of Geometrical
                    Problems,</hi> and in the same year his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical
                    Atlas,</hi> where all the parts of the science are represented in sixty plates.
                    In 1746 he occupied himself with general geography; and having formed a
                    connection with the astronomers Franz and Lowitz, he, like them, contributed to
                    the establishment of the Cosmographical Society of Nuremberg, and inserted
                    several interesting memoirs in the volume which that society published in 1750,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Kosmo-graphische</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nachrichten und</hi><hi rend="italic">Samlungen.</hi> Amongst these we would
                    particularly notice his observations and calculations of the libration of the
                    moon, a translation of which has been given by Lalande in the twentieth book of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Astronomic.</hi> The instruments which Mayer employed were
                    very indifferent; but he conducted his observations with so much nicety and
                    address, that he was enabled to determine, more exactly than had ever been done
                    before, the elements which serve to indicate all the circumstances of that
                    singular phenomenon, particularly the inclination of the hmar equator, or the
                    position of the axis round which is operated the rotation of the moon. His
                    method for calculating these elements had not all the geometrical rigour which
                    he might have given to it, without rendering it either longer or more difficult;
                    nevertheless, it had all the preeision required. But this memoir, now so
                    curious, is distinguished by a still more important uovelty. It is the first
                    wherein, for a problem which appeared not to require nor even to admit of more
                    than three observations, there was imagined the method of <hi rend="italic"
                    >conditional equations,</hi> which, instead of three observations strictly
                    necessary, permits the employment of thousands, and conducts at once to the most
                    certain or the most probable conclusions resulting from the totality of the
                    observations; in fact, the errors which cannot be avoided, yet follow no certain
                    law, are found to act each time in a different manner, and to correct themselves
                    by mutual compensation. It is to this method that we are in a great measure
                    indebted for the precision of the most modern astronomical tables; although it
                    did not for some time attract the attention of astronomers, it is now generally
                    employed; and it is thus that have been constructed from hundreds and even
                    thousands of observations, the tables adopted by Lalande in the third edition of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Astronomie.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1757, Mayer went to establish himself at Göttingen, where he married, and was
                    appointed director of the observatory, to which the king of England had
                    presented a fine mural quadrant of six feet radius. This observatory was
                    constructed on a tower forming part of the ancient eneeinte of the walls of
                    Göttingen. During the war of the seven years, the French troops had established,
                    in the lower part of the tower, their powder magazine, the service of which was
                    performed with very little precaution. Every evening, Mayer, with his lanthorn,
                    crossed the lower story filled with powder, to ascend to his observatory. At the
                    other extremity of the city the Saxons had also established the depot of their
                    ammunition in a similar tower. One day a terrible explosion took place. It was
                    the Saxon magazine, which, having taken fire, blew up, and destroyed seventy
                    persons. But the astronomer of Göttingen, whose zeal for science rendered him
                    intrepid, like the geometer of Syracuse in the midst of the horrors of war,
                    remained unmoved by the shock, and calmly continued his observations. Mayer made
                    the best use of the observatory for verifying the fundamental points of
                    astronomy; namely, the refractions, the position of the stars, particularly of
                    those of the zodiac, with which the planets were daily compared, and lastly,
                    solar tables. His refractions differ but little from those of Bradley: his
                    formula, apparently rather awkward, is at bottom the same with that of Bradley
                    and Simpson, and only differs essentially in the manner of applying the
                    thermometrical correction. His zodiacal catalogue consists of 998 stars,
                    observed from four or five to twenty-five or twenty-six times; and these deserve
                    all confidence. Others of less importance have been served only once or twice;
                    and he himself states, that he does not answer for their accuracy within ten
                    seconds. In the discourse which precedes his solar tables, he makes a
                    declaration which does honour to his integrity. “In composing them,” says he, “I
                    had under my eyes those which the celebrated Lacaille had published in 1758, and
                    of which he had the goodness to send me a copy. I soon perceived that it would
                    be necessary to make very few changes, in order to accommodate them to the
                    observations which I have made since the year 1756. I have therefore no
                    intention of publishing what may be called new tables, but only in following the
                    footsteps of this great astronomer, of making such small corrections as my own
                    observations seemed to require.” These changes arc of two kinds. In the
                    arguments of the inequalities, he had substituted the milesimal division of the
                    circle for the sexagesimal; and this was an improvement convenient for
                    calculators. With regard to the inequalities themselves, he had calculated them
                    according to the theory. Laeaille had at first tried to deduce them from his
                    observations; but, perceiving that the numbers which they gave differed very
                    little from those which Clairaut had derived from his theory, he adopted the
                    numbers of that illustrious geometer, who was also his friend. The difference,
                    indeed, is small for the moon and for Jupiter; it is more sensible for Venus;
                    and recent researches have proved that the equation of Mayer is too limited. The
                    other change was much more considerable, and by no means fortunate. Mayer had
                    augmented by twenty-seven seconds the secular motion of the sun. But in 1792 and
                    1800, it was found necessary to adopt, almost without modification, the motion
                    as found by Lacaille. With regard to the inequality peculiar to the sun,
                    Lacaille had very well determined it, such as it was, about 1755; and Mayer made
                    no change therein.</p>
                <p>The tables of the moon, which Mayer published in the acts of the acadcmy of
                    Göttingen, in 1755, were the first in which the errors never exceeded two
                    minutes, whereas in the tables of New ton, Halley, and Cassini, they were from
                    eight to ten minutes. Nevertheless, he had been obliged to construct his tables
                    from about an hundred observations; so rare were observations at that period, or
                    so difficult was it to procure them. He had profited by the theory of Euler, in
                    which he made some fortunate changes; and he had sent these tables to London in
                    1755, in order to compete for the prize proposed by the Board of Longitude. They
                    were there submitted to the judgment of Bradley, who attested that, in two
                    hundred and thirty comparisons which he had made between them and as many
                    observations then <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204190"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-4190-0336"/>inedited, he had never found an error which
                    exceeded a minute and a half; and he admitted that a part of this error might be
                    attributed to the observations with which they were compared. He concluded that
                    these tables deserved the attention of the Board of Longitude; and he declared
                    that this error, already so small, might be further diminished, inasmuch as, in
                    eleven hundred observations newly calculated, it was reduced to less than a
                    minute. The author, on his part, laboured incessantly to improve them, and at
                    his death, in 1762, left a new copy, which his widow transmitted to London,
                    where the tables obtained a recompense of £3000. The publication was confided to
                    Maskelyne, and the impression had made considerable progress when a somewhat
                    more complete copy was received, containing several slight improvements. This
                    new copy was preceded by a memoir entitled <hi rend="italic">Methodus
                    Longitudinum Promota,</hi> in which Mayer recommended the distances of the moon
                    from the sun or the stars, of which Lacaille and Maskelyne had already pointed
                    out the advantages, and also gave a description of a new instrument for
                    measuring those distances. To make allowance for the flattening of the earth in
                    the calculations of the parallax, he had suppressed the corrections of the
                    geometers, which rendered the operation long and uncertain, and, by a very
                    simple and ingenious consideration, had reduced it to the same degree of
                    simplicity as if the earth, instead of a spheroid, had been a sphere; and this
                    method is now that generally adopted. Lastly, after an ample examination of the
                    whole doctrine of Mayer, the Board of Longitude decided that a sum of £2000
                    should be added to that which the widow of the astronomer had already received.
                    In the same memoir Mayer shewed how he had constructed his tables, and also how
                    they might be still further improved; and it is thus that, under the direction
                    of Maskelyne, they were rendered more precise by Mason, who availed himself of
                    twelve hundred observations made by Bradley. It is by the same means, with the
                    help of the new theoretical researches of Laplace, that these tables have been
                    successively improved by Bouvard, Burg, and Burckhardt. But whatever be the
                    merit of the labours successively undertaken, and of those which may be
                    attempted of new, it may always be said of the lunar tables what Mayer himself
                    said of his solar tables, and of those of Lacaille: These are not precisely new
                    tables, but the tables of Mayer, in which have been made certain small
                    corrections necessary to adjust them to the observations.</p>
                <p>The name of Mayer, so celebrated on account of his astronomical observations,
                    became more so for another reason, thirty years after his death, and for an idea
                    to which, in his lifetime, but little attention was paid. Whilst labouring to
                    rectify the geography of Germany, he was unknown, having nothing but his genius,
                    with very little money to procure an instrument with which he might measure the
                    triangles which are the necessary foundation of a good map. By the principle of
                    the indefinite multiplication of angles, and with only a board, a rule, a
                    compass, and a line of chords, such as are contained in an ordinary case of
                    mathematical instruments, he contrived to measure the angles with more precision
                    than he could have obtained by means of the graphometers then in use. Of this
                    invention he gave an account in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of Gottingen;</hi> but no one paid any attention thereto except
                    Montucla, who in his <hi rend="italic">Recreations</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mathématiques</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> speaks of it as an idea simply
                    ingenious, little foreseeing, however, all that might be derived from it. In
                    considering only the idea itself, one would at first suppose that the errors in
                    the observations might always be destroyed. There is something, however, to be
                    deducted from this precision in practice; but the invention is not on that
                    account the less remarkable and useful in all geodesical operations. Improved by
                    Borda, it has been employed in the operations from which were deduced the figure
                    of the earth, the mètre, ⅛nd the new system of F rench measures. May er had
                    given a primary application of his idea in the reflecting circle which he
                    proposed for all the operations of nautical astronomy; and this first
                    improvement was applauded, butas yet no one dreamed of rendering it really
                    useful. Borda, however, perceived that the instrument might be rendered at once
                    more accurate and more convenient; he employed it, and his example taught
                    mariners to appreciate its advantages. By one of those changes which are found
                    so easy when they have been effected, Borda discovered that the instrument might
                    be applied to the most delicate operations of astronomy; in measuring, by means
                    of a circle with a radius of a foot and a half, the height of a star, and that
                    too, with more precision than could be obtained with a quadrant of eight feet
                    radius. The repeating circle was applied to all the operations connected with
                    the measurement of degrees of the meridian. By means of this instrument the
                    celestial arc included between the parallels of Dunkirk and Barcelona, or of
                    Formentera, the most southern of the Balearic Isles, was accurately measured,
                    the new are of the polar circle determined, and every operation of the same kind
                    in Germany and Italy performed by the French engineers.</p>
                <p>Such is a view of what was accomplished by Mayer from the age of twenty-three to
                    that of thirty-nine. A malady, chiefly characterised by languor, gradually
                    undermined his strength, and consigned him to a premature grave. He died on the
                    20th February 1762, leaving two daughters and two sons, one of whom became a
                    celebrated professor of physic. An edition of his works had been promised, but
                    of these only one volume appeared in 1775, under the care of Lichtenberg, his
                    friend and associate. This volume contains, 1. A method for determining more
                    exactly the variations of the thermometer, with a formula for calculating the
                    mean degree of heat in every latitude, and the seasons of the year in which
                    occur the greatest heat and the greatest cold. 2. A memoir on the observations
                    which he made with his mural arc of six feet, and the verifications to which he
                    subjected that instrument. 3. An easy method for calculating eclipses of the
                    sun, being at bottom the method of Kepler, which Lacaille also reproduced in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Leçons</hi><hi rend="italic">d’ Astronomic.</hi> 4. A memoir
                    on the affinity of the colours, in which he recognised only three primary
                    colours, all the rest being obtained by different combinations of these. 5. His
                    new catalogue of the stars, the work of two years, during which he experienced
                    several interruptions, especially when, as already stated, his observatory was
                    converted by the French into a powder magazine. 6. A memoir, followed by a
                    catalogue of eighty stars, to which he assigned a peculiar motion, independently
                    of the general motion of precession. The volume is terminated by a very
                    beautiful map of the moon, designed according to the orthographic projection,
                    from a lunar globe on which Mayer had painted the most remarkable points of the
                    moon, with a list of a hundred and thirty-three spots, according to their
                    longitudes and their latitudes. The second volume, the speedy publication of
                    which was promised, has not yet appeared. The title of Mayer in the university
                    of Göttingen was that of professor of <hi rend="italic">economy,</hi> which is
                    no doubt an odd denomination for an astronomer; but this is not the only
                    instance in which learned bodies have sought to attach to them great men,
                    without troubling themselves as to the particular form or manner in which this
                    was effected. Mayer, however, did not give prelections on a science which he had
                    not studied. The professor of <hi rend="italic">economy gave</hi> lectures on
                    mathematics, and on civil and military architecture. His éloge, pronounced at
                    the academy byKacstner, (Göttingen, 1762, in 4to.), is followed by a list of his
                    works, which we shall here subjoin. 1. Description of a new Globe of the Moon;
                    2. Terrestrial Refractions; 3. Geographical Charts, including a Critical Chart
                    of Germany, and a Map of Switzerland; 4. Description of a new Micrometer; 5.
                    Observations on the Eclipse of the Sun in 1748; 6. Conjunctions of the Moon and
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204203" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4203-0337"/>Stare
                    observed in 1747 and 1748; 7. Proofs that the Moon has no atmosphere; 8. Motion
                    of the Earth explained by a change in the direction of gravity; 9. Latitude of
                    Nuremberg, and other Astronomical Observations; 10. Memoir on the Parallax of
                    the Moon and its distance from the Earth, deduced from the length of a pendulum
                    beating seconds; 11. On the Transmutation of rectilineal figures into triangles;
                    12. Invention of a Species of Painting of which the products may be multiplied;
                    13. Inclinations and Declinations of the Magnetic Needle, deduced from theory;
                    14. Inequalities of Jupiter. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
