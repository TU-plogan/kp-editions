                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MARACAYBO</label>, a province of South America, in what was
                    till 1835 the republic of Colombia, but which is now separated into three
                    independent states. Maracaybo is bounded on the west by Rio Hacha, on the east
                    by Venezuela, on the south by Pamplona, and on the north by the Carribean Sea.
                    Maracaybo may be described as a considerable tract of country surrounding a vast
                    sheet of water of the same name. The lake of Maracaybo is a little
                    Mediterranean, communicating with a gulf called after it, by a channel about two
                    leagues in breadth by eight in length. Depons describes the lake and gulf as
                    nearly of the form of a decanter, extending from south to north, the neck of
                    which communicates with the sea. It is about fifty leagues in length from the
                    bar to its most southern recess, its greatest breadth is about thirty leagues,
                    and its circumference upwards of one hundred and fifty leagues. Its waters are
                    sweet, unless the wind blows with violence from the sea, when salt water is
                    forced into it, thus communicating to them a brackish property. The lake,
                    however, is not subject to tempests; but occasionally the north wind produces a
                    short and broken swell. It is navigated with ease, and has depth of water
                    sufficient for the largest vessels. All goods intended for consumption or export
                    at Maracaybo are conveyed by the rivers which discharge themselves into the
                    lake. Of these there are above twenty, the most considerable being Sulia or
                    Pamplona River, the Motatan, Chama, Catumbo, Cuernos, To-rondoy, and Perija. All
                    the different species of fish found in the rivers of South America (Depons
                    says), abound in this lake; but the tortoise is not found here. There are <hi
                    rend="italic">monatis</hi> or sea-cows of enormous size. On one of the shores of
                    the lake there is an inexhaustible mine of mineral pitch. The bituminous vapours
                    which it exhales are so inflammable, that during the night phosphoric fires are
                    continually seen, which in their effect resemble lightning. They go by the name
                    of the “Lantern of Maracaybo,” because they serve for a lighthouse and compass
                    to both the Spaniards and the Indians, who without the assistance of either
                    navigate the lake. There are still several barbarous tribes of Indians in its
                    vicinity, but, from the sterility of the soil on the borders of the lake, and
                    the insalubrity of the atmosphere, they formerly preferred fixing their abodes
                    on the lake itself. These huts erected on the water amounted to a number of
                    villages, but they were all destroyed by the Spaniards, with the exception of
                    four. The inhabitants have a church, under the care of a curate; and they derive
                    their chief subsistence from fishing and hunting wild ducks. The soil on the
                    western shores of the lake is good, and this induced some Spaniards, regardless
                    of the insalubrity of the climate, to fix their residence there, for the purpose
                    of raising cocoa and provisions. The settlement, however, consists only of a few
                    scattered habitations. The southern extremity of the lake is uncultivated, and
                    destitute of inhabitants. The temperature of the whole province is very high;
                    that of the northern <pb break="no" facs="nls:194202942"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-2942-0240"/>part is no less so than the others, but it is
                    incomparably healthier.</p>

                    situated on the left bank of the lake, at the distance of six leagues from the
                    sea, was founded in 1571. It stands in the midst of a sandy plain, without any
                    stratum of vegetable earth, in latitude 10. 30. north, and longitude 74. 6. west
                    of Paris. The climate is intensely hot, and during July and August almost
                    insupportable; yet it is accounted healthy, because no endemic complaints
                    prevail. Violent storms are frequent, accompanied with thunder and lightning,
                    and occasionally prove very destructive. Most of the houses are covered with
                    reeds, but the town is fortified. The parish church is large and handsome, and
                    there are four monasteries, a convent, and an hospital. For upwards of twenty
                    leagues towards the <hi rend="italic">serrania</hi> (or mountain ridge) there is
                    no other water for even the cattle, but rain water, which is preserved in tanks.
                    Depons draws a favourable picture in some respects of the character of the
                    inhabitants. From the habit which they contract in infancy of sailing on the
                    lake, they imbibe at a very early period a taste for navigation; and this leads
                    many of them to repair to the seaports to obtain employment, “Those who resist
                    the attractions of the sea,” says that traveller, “raise herds of cattle, or
                    take care of those of their fathers. Nothing better evinces their aptitude for
                    this species of occupation, than the immense number of beasts with which the
                    savannas of Maracaybo are covered. The principal ones are those of Jobo, Ancon,
                    Palmares, and Cannades. I ought to mention, that there is more merit in raising
                    cattle in the savannas of Maracaybo than in any other place in these provinces;
                    because, having neither rivers nor ponds that never dry up, drought occasions
                    the death of many, in spite of the precautions they take, in cases of this sort,
                    to drive them towards those parts where they can with convenience water them.”
                    Education is in a very low state amongst the people, yet they show a partiality
                    for, and from their natural talents make no inconsiderable progress in
                    literature. Notwithstanding their activity, courage, and talent, the inhabitants
                    of Maracaybo are reproached with a want of regard for their word, and a habit of
                    thinking themselves not bound by their signature, until after they have in vain
                    endeavoured to release themselves from it by law. Depons places the character of
                    the women very high. Maracaybo contains many descendants of the early
                    conquerors, who now live in a state of affluence. Others of the inhabitants gain
                    wealth by traffic, and the whole are supposed to exceed 20,000 in number. The
                    slaves are said not to exceed 5000; and the freed blacks, by whom the trades are
                    carried on, are but few. Depons estimates the entire population of the province
                    at 100,000.</p>
