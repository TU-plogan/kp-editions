                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MARCELLUS</label>, Μ. <hi rend="smallcaps">Claudius,</hi> one
                    of the most celebrated Roman generals, the principal events of whose life <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194202981" xml:id="kp-eb0714-2981-0243"/> are included
                    between <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 222 and 208. His valour and military
                    science made him feared by the enemies of his country, whilst the mildness and
                    gentleness of his deportment won their respect and esteem. Rome was at this
                    period engaged in war with the Cisalpine Gauls, and had appointed Flaminius, the
                    consul, to the command of a large army in the north of Italy. This election was
                    found to be invalid (see C. <hi rend="smallcaps">Flaminius),</hi> and Marcellus
                    was raised to the consulship, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 222. He joined the
                    army without delay; and though the Insubres offered terms of accommodation, he
                    prevailed on the people to reject them. He laid siege to Acerrae, now <hi
                    rend="italic">Gerrha,</hi> on the banks of the Po; and wher&gt;the Gauls
                    attempted to make a diversion by attacking Clastidium, Marcellus left his
                    colleague before Acerrae, marched against them, and in the battle which ensued
                    the Gauls were defeated, and their king Virido-marus was slain by the hands of
                    Marcellus himself. This was the third time that a Roman general had presented
                    the <hi rend="italic">spolia opima</hi> to Jupiter Feretrius. Marcellus obtained
                    the honours of a triumph, which is said to have been one of the most magnificent
                    ever witnessed in Rome, whether we consider the richness of the spoils that were
                    displayed in it, or the prodigious size of the captive. At the commencement of
                    the second Punic war <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 218), Marcellus was
                    appointed as praetor to the command of the troops in Sicily; but he was recalled
                    after the defeat at Cannae (2d August <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 216), and
                    sent to Apulia to collect the scattered remains of the Roman army. This he
                    effected with much prudence; and the severe check which Hannibal received from
                    him before Nola tended greatly to reanimate the drooping spirits of his
                    countrymen. Hannibal used to say, that he feared Fabius as his schoolmaster, and
                    Marcellus as his enemy. Marcellus was again named consul, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >iî.</hi> c. 215; but he immediately abdicated, on account of some flaw in the
                    election, and proceeded to Nola in the capacity of proconsul. The following year
                    he was raised a third time to the consulship <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi>
                    214), and proceeded to the command of the war in Sicily. Here he laid siege to
                    Syracuse, thinking that the conquest of this place would immediately be followed
                    by the full possession of the island. Syracuse was defended by the skill of the
                    celebrated Archimedes, and it was not till after <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    blockade of three years that Marcellus was able to take the city, when
                    Archimedes was killed <hi rend="smallcaps">(b c.</hi> 212), though positive
                    orders had been issued that his life should be spared. Marcellus exerted himself
                    to save the city from the plunder of the soldiers, but failed to preserve it
                    from this calamitous fate. When he returned to Rome, he received the honour of
                    an <hi rend="italic">ovation,</hi> or lesser triumph, as the war was still
                    unfinished in Sicily. He brought to Rome many beautiful statues and paintings
                    which had adorned Syracuse, and was the first to teach the Romans to appreciate
                    the exquisite works of Greece, which had hitherto been unknown to them. He was
                    named for the fourth time consul, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 210, and the
                    command of the war in Sicily fell to him by lot; but he exchanged it for Italy
                    with his colleague Laevinus. Marcellus recovered several cities of the Samnites
                    from Hannibal, who carefully shunned any regular battle with his opponent. He
                    was appointed consul the fifth time, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 208, when
                    he fell into an ambush which had been laid for him by Hannibal, and was killed.
                    Thus fell Marcellus, who was called the <hi rend="italic">sward</hi> of Rome,
                    whilst Fabius was regarded as its <hi rend="italic">bucliler.</hi> His life has
                    been written by Plutarch, and many facts respecting him may be gathered from
                    Livy (xxii.-xxvii.).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Marcellus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ. Claudius,</hi> was of
                    the same family as the conqueror of Syracuse, and lived at a period when the
                    designs of Caesar against the liberties of his country began to be apparent.
                    Marcellus was named consul <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.</hi> c. 51), along with
                    Sulpicius Rufus; and he proposed that Caesar should be deprived of the command
                    of the armies of Gaul; but this advice was not attended to. (Cic. <hi
                    rend="italic">Alt.</hi> vii. 1.) The civil war broke out <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(b. c.</hi> 49), when Marcellus joined the party of Pompey; but on the death of
                    the latter <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 48), he ceased to take part in the
                    political affairs of his country, and retired to Mitylene, that he might not
                    witness the overthrow of the republic. Here he was found by Brutus as he was
                    returning from Asia. (Sence. <hi rend="italic">ad Helv c.</hi> 9.) His friends
                    at Rome, however, were anxious that he should return, and they did not find it
                    difficult to prevail on Caesar to forget the part he had taken against him. His
                    pardon, indeed, seems to have been more readily granted by Caesar than accepted
                    by Marcellus. He was unwilling to leave his retreat at Mitylene, if we may judge
                    from the letters of Cicero addressed to him. They are the seventh, eighth,
                    ninth, and tenth of the fourth book <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Familiares.</hi> The eleventh is from Marcellus to Cicero. Marcellus, however,
                    at last yielded, and had reached Athens on his way homewards, when he was
                    murdered by P. Magius, one of his companions in exile, in despair at his
                    departure, B. c. 46. His old colleague Sulpicius happened to be at Athens at
                    this time, and took care that his funeral rites should be properly attended to.
                    (Cic. <hi rend="italic">ad Div.</hi> iv. 12.) When Caesar granted the pardon of
                    Marcellus, Cicero returned thanks in a most eloquent speech, which is still
                    preserved <hi rend="italic">{Pro Marcello).</hi> This was the first time he had
                    spoken in the senate after the downfall of the republic, and his speech is
                    supposed to be the model on which Pliny the younger formed his Panegyric on
                    Trajan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Marcellus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ. Claudius,</hi> son of C.
                    Marcellus, and of Octavia, sister to Augustus, seems to have been endowed by
                    nature with all those qualities which unite to form a great character. Capable
                    of the closest application to study, gentle in his manners, and temperate in his
                    habits, he was regarded by the Romans with feelings of the strongest affection.
                    He was first betrothed to Pompeia, the daughter of Sextus Pompey, so early as
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 37, when she was only six years of age (Dion
                    Cass, xlviii. 38); but he subsequently married Julia, the daughter of Augustus,
                    when he had reached his seventeenth year, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 26
                    (liii. 27, Suet. Aug. 63). He was raised to the curule edileship by the senate;
                    but he died very suddenly, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 23, owing, it is
                    said, to the injudicious use of the cold bath prescribed by Antonius Musa, the
                    physician of Augustus. (Dion Cass, liii. 30.) The Romans were overwhelmed with
                    grief at his death, and suspected the Empress Livia of having poisoned him, that
                    her own son Tiberius might be the successor of Augustus. His mother Octavia is
                    said to have shut herself up in her room for many months, and to have refused
                    all consolation. (Sen. <hi rend="italic">ad Mare,</hi> ii.) In the life of
                    Virgil, commonly ascribed to Donatus, we are told that the poet recited to her
                    part of the Aeneid, and when he came to the words</p>
                <p>Heu! miserande puer, si quid fata aspera rumpas, Tu Marcellus eris, alluding to
                    his ancestor the great Marcellus, she fainted away. When she recovered, she
                    ordered the poet to be rewarded with a large sum of money. Marcellus was buried
                    in the Campus Martius, in the mausoleum of Augustus, and the emperor built a
                    theatre, calling it after his name, <hi rend="italic">Theatrum. Marcelli.</hi>
                    (Tacit. <hi rend="italic">Ann,</hi> iii. 64.)</p>
