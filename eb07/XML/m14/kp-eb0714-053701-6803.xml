                    the Palatinate, in 1495, was one of the wisest and most able men amongst the
                    reformers, though of a mild temper, and disposed to accommodate rather than to
                    inflame disputes. In his youth he made great progress in learning, and was
                    appointed professor of Greek at Wittenberg in 1509∙ Here his lectures upon Homer
                    and the Greek text of St. Paul’s epistle to Titus, drew to him a great number of
                    auditors, and entirely effaced the contempt to which his low stature and mean
                    appearance had exposed him. Melancthon reduced the sciences to system, and
                    acquired such reputation, that he had sometimes between two and three thousand
                    auditors. He soon formed an intimate friendship with Luther, who taught divinity
                    in the same university; and in 1519 they went together to Leipzig, to dispute
                    with Eccius. The following years he was continually engaged in various
                    employments; he composed several books; he taught divinity; he performed several
                    journeys, in order to found colleges and visit churches; and in 1530 he drew up
                    a confession of faith, which goes by the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confession of Augsburg,</hi> because it was presented to the emperor at the
                    diet held in that city. All Europe felt convinced that he was not, like Luther,
                    backward to accommodate the differences between the various sects of Christians.
                    He hated religious disputes, into which he was drawn only from necessity by the
                    part which he was called to act in the world; and he would therefore have
                    sacrificed many things to produce an union amongst the Protestants. For this
                    reason, Francis I. wrote to desire him to come and confer with the doctors of
                    the Sorbonne, in order to agree with them about putting an end to all
                    controversies; but although Luínér endeavoured to persuade the Elector of Saxony
                    to consent to that journey, and though Melancthon himself desired it, that
                    prince, whether distrusting Melancthon’s moderation, or afraid of quarrelling
                    with the Emperor Charles V., refused to grant his permission. The king of
                    England, Henry VIII., also desired to see him, but in vain. In 1529 Melancthon
                    assisted at the conferences of Spires; and in 1541 he was present at the famous
                    conferences at Ratisbon. In 1543 he went to meet the archbishop of Cologne, to
                    assist him in introducing the reformation into his diocese; but that project
                    came to nothing. In 1548 he assisted at seven conferences on the subject of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Interim</hi> of Charles V., and wrote a censure on that <hi
                    rend="italic">Interim,</hi> and all the writings presented at these conferences.
                    He was extremely affected at the dissensions excited by Flaccus Illyricus. His
                    last conference with those of the Roman Catholic communion tookplace at Worms,
                    in 1557. He died at Wittenberg in the year 1560, and was interred near Luther.
                    Some days before his death, he wrote upon a piece of paper the reasons which
                    induced him to look upon death as a happiness; the chief of which was, that it
                    would deliver him from theological persecutions. Nature had given Melancthon a
                    peaceable and moderate temper, which was but ill suited to the time in which he
                    lived. His moderation served only to increase his troubles. He was like a lamb
                    in the midst of wolves. Nobody liked his mildness; it appeared as if he was
                    lukewarm; and even Luther himself was sometimes exasperated against him.
                    Melancthon was a man in whom many good as well as great qualities were united.
                    He had parts and learning, sweetness of temper, moderation, contentedness, and
                    other virtues, which would have made him happy in any times but those in which
                    he lived. He never affected dignities, or honours, or riches, but was rather
                    negligent of all these things, indeed, too much so in the opinion of some,
                    considering he had a family; and his son-in-law Sabinus, who possessed a more
                    ambitious temper, was actually at variance with him upon this very account.
                    Learning was on many accounts infinitely obliged to him; but on none more than
                    this, that, as already observed, he reduced almost all the sciences which had
                    been previously taught in a vague irregular manner into system. Considering the
                    distractions of his life, and the infinity of disputes and tumults in which he
                    was engaged, it is astonishing how he found leisure to write so many books.
                    Their number was so great, that it was thought necessary to publish a
                    chronological catalogue of them in the year 1582. His works indeed are not
                    correct, and he himself owned it; but as he found them useful, he chose rather
                    to print a great number, than to finish only a few, “which, however,” as Bayle
                    observes, “was postponing his own glory to the advantage of others.” His
                    constitution was very weak, and required great tenderness and management; a
                    circumstance which made Luther, fiery and zealous as he was, blame him for
                    labouring too earnestly in the vineyard.</p>
