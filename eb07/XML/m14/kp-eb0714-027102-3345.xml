                <p><label type="entry">MARYLAND</label>, one of the United States of North America,
                    is bounded on the east by Delaware and a portion of the Atlantic Ocean, on the
                    south-west and west by Virginia, on the south by the confluence of Chesapeake
                    Bay with the Atlantic, and on the north by Pennsylvania. It extends from
                    longitude 75. 10. to 79. 20. west, and from latitude 38. 3. to 39. 42. north.
                    The area of Álaryland has generally been greatly overrated; an error which has
                    arisen partly from the irregularity of its form, and partly from Chesapeake Bay
                    having been included in the measurement; but having recently been carefully
                    surveyed by a gentleman, it has been found to be within an inconsiderable
                    fraction of 10,000 square miles. This state presents one very singular feature,
                    being completely though irregularly divided in its whole length from north to
                    south by Chesapeake Bay, perhaps the finest estuary in the world. These distinct
                    portions are called, according to their situation, the eastern and western
                    shores. These shores may be considered as recent alluvium; and the country is
                    low and level, permeated by tide-rivers and creeks. Above tidewater the land
                    becomes agreeably undulating, rising, though not very rapidly, into hills which
                    reach the foot of the Alleghany and the Blue Mountains. These ranges cross the
                    western part of the state, thus constituting a third or mountainous region. They
                    are in no place less than 2486 feet above the level of the sea, and in many
                    places they exceed 3000 feet. Each zone has portions of highly productive soil,
                    but in general the intermediate valleys of the mountainous part are the most
                    fertile. The counties of Frederick and Washington have limestone tracts, which
                    exhibit a fertility not to be surpassed by any in the United States. The hilly
                    zone is exceedingly variable, and within very narrow limits are found the
                    extremes of fertility and barrenness. All the uneven country abounds with
                    springs of excellent water. No part of the marine and river alluvial section is
                    so productive as the calcareous parts of the western region, but there is more
                    uniformity of soil than obtains in the middle zone. The country on the eastern
                    side of the Chesapeake, with the exception of a small part of the northern
                    extremity, is an extensive plain, low and sandy, much intersected by rivers and
                    creeks, possessing few springs, and abounding in stagnant water. The western
                    shore of the Chesapeake, below the falls, resembles the eastern; but it is far
                    from being a dead plain, though none of the hills are of any considerable
                    elevation. From the diversity of soil, as well as from the elevation of some
                    parts, the vegetable productions have been much varied, and the staples greatly
                    multiplied.</p>
                <p>Potomac, the largest river of the state, rises in the mountain chain which
                    traverses its western part, and in its whole length, which is between three and
                    four hundred miles, constitutes the boundary between Maryland and Virginia. At
                    Washington it is above a mile in breadth, and at about ninety miles below that
                    city it falls into Chesapeake Bay. The Susquehannah likewise falls into the same
                    estuary, but only a small portion of the northern extremity of Maryland is
                    traversed by that noble stream. Two considerable rivers, the Choptank and the
                    Nanticoe, rise in Delaware, and taking their course through the eastern part of
                    Maryland, fall into Chesapeake Bay. The western shore is traversed by a great
                    number of streams of various extent, but none of them are of any great
                    magnitude. With regard to climate, the higher parts of the state are esteemed
                    salubrious; as is also the middle zone; but the low-lying parts on either side
                    of Chesapeake Bay are unhealthy. The air in summer is moist, sultry, and
                    disagreeable; and the inhabitants are subject to agues and intermittent fevers,
                    whilst many of them have a wan and sickly aspect. The maritime belt of Maryland
                    may be said to belong rather to the southern than to the northern states.</p>
                <p>The soil is generally a red clay or loam, and much of it is of excellent quality.
                    The staple products of the state are wheat and tobacco; but maize, sweet
                    potatoes, hemp, flax, and some cotton for domestic use, are likewise raised. The
                    genuine white wheat, said to be peculiar to Maryland, is grown in some of the
                    counties on the eastern shore. The soil and climate are admirably adapted for
                    the cultivation of all the fruits of the temperate zone; and here accordingly
                    are fine orchards, in which apples, pears, peaches, plums, and cherries, are
                    abundant. Of peaches, the inhabitants make large quantities of peach brandy; and
                    of apples, apple brandy and cider. The forests abound in hickory trees, and also
                    in that production called <hi rend="italic">mast,</hi> a nutbearing tree, on
                    which great numbers of swine are fed. These animals are allowed to run wild, and
                    when fattened are killed, barrelled, and exported in great quantities. Sheep and
                    oxen are also plentiful. In the swamps the cypress is common, and the catalpa is
                    indigenous to the soil.</p>
                <p>Ί here are a number of long turnpikes in this state, particularly one which
                    connects Baltimore with Cumberland on the Potomac, a distance of 135 miles. This
                    constitutes the great thoroughfare to the western country. From Cumberland to
                    Brownsville on the Monongahela, in Pennsylvania, there has been completed by the
                    United States a free road of a most excellent construction. The distance <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194203358" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3358-0272"/> is seventy-two
                    miles, making the whole distance from Baltimore to Brownsville 207 miles.
                    Amongst other turnpike roads may be mentioned that which has been made from
                    Baltimore by York· and Pennsylvania to the Snsquehannah, by which large
                    quantities of the produce of Pennsylvania are brought to that city. There are
                    other roads, either in a state of forwardness, or which have recently been
                    completed. The most stupendous work ever undertaken by any government, or by
                    individuals, is the Baltimore and Ohio railroad. The length of this magnificent
                    road, when completed, will be three hundred and thirty miles, and the ground is,
                    besides, both high and difficult. When the project was made known, a company was
                    immediately formed, and capital to a large amount subscribed. The work commenced
                    in 1828, but was for a long time retarded in consequence of a litigation with
                    the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, as to prior right of location in certain
                    parts of the route. The dispute being settled, operations were resumed, and in
                    December 1834 eighty-two miles of the road were completed, at an expense of
                    three milliqns of dollars. The same company have opened a railroad to the city
                    of Washington, commencing eight miles from Baltimore; the length of this work is
                    thirty-two miles. Other railroads have also been undertaken, amongst which may
                    be mentioned one from York-Haven to the Susquehannah, a distance of sixty miles.
                    There are several canals in this state: one from Port Deposit on the east bank
                    of the Sus-quehannalι, proceeds along a line of rapids northward to the boundary
                    line of Maryland and Pennsylvania, a distance of ten miles. At Little or Lower
                    Falls, on the Potomac, three miles above Washington, is a canal two miles and a
                    half long; and at Great Falls, nine miles above, is another, scarcely, however,
                    a mile in length; but there is one in progress, which, if completed, will rival
                    the great railroad before mentioned. This is the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal,
                    which commences'at the Potomac in the federal city, and proceeds along the river
                    near the limits of Maryland and Virginia. It is laid out to pass through the
                    highlands, and over the Alleghanies, not far from the route of the great
                    national road, to meet the Ohio at or near Pittsburgh. The length of the two
                    great works will be nearly the same. To this undertaking the state of Maryland
                    subscribed five hundred thousand dollars. On the 1st of January 1834, about one
                    hundred and nine miles of this canal were completed, at an expense of 3,707,262
                    dollars.</p>
                <p>In 1696, the province appropriated funds for the support of a college and free
                    schools, the former of which had made considerable progress previously to 1776.
                    In 1782, Washington College was established at Chesterton. About two years
                    afterwards, St John’s College was established at Annapolis, and these two
                    uniting together, constituted one university. A fund which had been appropriated
                    for Washington College was withdrawn in 1804; but the state, as an equivalent,
                    allowed the university twelve thousand dollars per annum. In 1813, a tax was
                    laid on bank stock of twenty cents on every hundred dollars, which yields about
                    10,000 dollars annually. The whole of this is appropriated to the support of
                    free and charity schools, and it is equally divided amongst all the counties in
                    the state. There is likewise a school fund, consisting of a sum advanced by
                    Maryland during the late war, and paid by the national government, amounting to
                    75,000 dollars. A law in favour of primary schools was passed in 1825, and has
                    been partially carried into effect in two or three of the counties. In 1833, the
                    legislature of Maryland passed an act by which St John’s College at Annapolis
                    has 3000 dollars secured to it for ever, the money to be paid from the state
                    treasury. In 1834, a geologist was appointed for the state, with a salary of two
                    thousand dollars per annum; and he is instructed to make deposits of his
                    collections in the college cabinet. There are several academies which receive
                    eight hundred dollars yearly from the state treasury. In 1807 the legislature
                    founded in Baltimore a college for the instruction of students in medicine; and
                    a few years afterwards instruction was also given in divinity, law, the arts and
                    sciences; the whole institution being incorporated under the title of the
                    University of Maryland. It is governed by twenty-eight agents and a provost; and
                    efficient professors, with assistants, are appointed to preside over each
                    department of education. The philosophical apparatus is extensive; and the
                    museum contains a very valuable collection of anatomical preparations. The
                    mineralogical collection is also very extensive. The state, a few years ago,
                    granted 30,000 dollars to this rapidly growing institution. Baltimore College, a
                    chartered and respectable seminary, and St Mary’s College, which belongs to the
                    Roman Catholics, are both in a very flourishing state. In addition to the above,
                    there are extensive academies in various places; indeed the arrangements made
                    for the promotion of knowledge reflect the highest credit on the legislature and
                    inhabitants of Maryland. The religious bodies, as is usual throughout all the
                    American states, are numerous. The Roman Catholics have one archbishop, the
                    metropolitan of the United States, and between thirty and forty churches; the
                    Methodists are a numerous sect, the Episcopalians have seventy-five ministers,
                    the Presbyterians eleven, the Baptists twelve, the German Reformed nine, the
                    Unitarians and the New Jerusalem Church one each; there are also some
                    Mennonites, and the Friends are numerous.</p>

                <p>Baltimore, the commercial capital of Maryland, is the third city in the Union in
                    point of population and extent. It is situated on the north shore of the
                    Patapsco, fourteen miles above its entrance into Chesapeake Bay, one hundred and
                    ninety miles south-west of New York, one hundred miles south-west of
                    Philadelphia, and thirty-seven miles north-east of Washington, in latitude 39.
                    17. north, and longitude 76. 36. west. This city has increased in population,
                    and advanced in commercial importance, with almost unexampled rapidity. It i <hi
                    rend="subscript"> s</hi> admirably situated for trade, and it possesses most of
                    that of Maryland, about a half of that of Pennsylvania, and a portion of that of
                    the western states. It is the best market for tobacco in the Union, and the
                    greatest flour market in the world. The harbour is spacious, secure, and
                    commodious, and is defended by a fort. The principal part of the city is divided
                    from the portions styled Old Town and Fell’s Point, by a small river called
                    Jones’ Falls, over which are erected three elegant stone bridges and four wooden
                    ones. The area of the town is a square of four miles, and it is divided into
                    twelve wards. It contains twenty-five public buildings, and forty places of
                    public worship. The Roman Catholic cathedral is a spacious and magnificent
                    building, the largest, it is believed, in the United States. Several of the
                    other churches are also large and beautifully finished. The Exchange is a vast
                    building, and the Athenaeum is a spacious and beautiful structure. Several of
                    the other public buildings are of great size and elegant appearance. Amongst the
                    most conspicuous objects belonging to Baltimore are its monuments. The
                    Washington Monument is a marble column 175 feet in height. The pedestal is fifty
                    feet square and twenty feet in height, and the column fourteen feet in diameter
                    at the summit and twenty at the foot. There is also Battle Monument, raised in
                    memory of those who fell in defence of the city in the attack made upon it by
                    the British in 1814; and a shot tower 234 feet in height. The city, generally,
                    is well built, mostly of brick. Many of the houses, particularly those recently
                    erected, display much elegance and taste. The streets are well paved, and many
                    of them are spacious. Baltimore issues seven or eight gazettes, and has above
                    one hundred manufactories of various kinds, its vicinity affording ample command
                    of water-power for driving mills.</p>
                <p>In 1830, there were inspected 577,804 barrels of wheat flour, 4436 barrels of rye
                    flour, 558 hogsheads, and 5458 barrels of corn meal. Vessels of 500 or 600 tons
                    burden can lie in perfect safety at the wharfs on the point, but those of only
                    200 tons can come πp to the town.</p>
                <p>Annapolis, the political metropolis of Maryland, is situated on the western side
                    of the estuary of the Severn, twenty·eight miles south-east of Baltimore, and
                    forty north-east of Washington, in longitude 76.43. west, latitude 39.0. north.
                    It is a pleasant and healthy town, and contains a spacious and elegant
                    town-house, a market, two houses of public worship, and a theatre.
                    Fredericktown, on a branch of the Monococy, is a large and pleasant interior
                    town, forty-five miles west of Baltimore, and forty-three north-west of
                    Washington. It is pleasantly situated, regularly laid out, and well built, and
                    contains a court-house, a jail, a bank, a market-house, an academy, and seven
                    places of public worship for various denominations of Christians. Several of the
                    public buildings, and many of the private houses, are spacious and elegant. This
                    town is situated in the centre of a very pleasant and fertile country, and sends
                    great quantities of wheat and flour to Baltimore; also leather, shoes, saddles,
                    hats, and gloves. Several newspapers are published here. Hagerstown is a very
                    neat place, regularly laid out, on Antietam Creek, sixty-nine miles north-west
                    of Washington, and seventy-one west by north of Baltimore. It contains four
                    public buildings, and four churches, of which two are handsome structures. Being
                    situated in a fertile and well-cultivated tract of country, and one of the best
                    districts in the United States for raising wheat, it has a considerable trade,
                    and is altogether a very flourishing place. Cumberland is a considerable village
                    on the northern bank of the Potomac, at the commencement of the great national
                    road. It contains four public buildings and four churches. Great abundance of
                    stone coal is found in the vicinity. Hancock, on the most northern bend of the
                    Potomac, near the Pennsylvania line, is also, as well as the three
                    last-mentioned towns, on the national road, and is an important village. The
                    names of the other considerable villages in this state are, Elkton, Frenchtown,
                    Charlestown, Chestertown, Easton, Middleton, Salisbury, Princess Anne, and
                    Snowhill. These are on the eastern shore. On the western shore are,
                    Havre-de-Grace, Belle-Air, Harford, Bladensburgh, Port Tobacco, and
                    Leonardtown.</p>
                <p>The district of Columbia is a tract of country ten miles square, nearly equally
                    divided by the Potomac, and ceded by the states of Maryland and Virginia to the
                    general government. Its surface is uneven without being mountainous, and the
                    soil is very light and sandy. It comprehends two counties, Alexandria and
                    Washington, the latter containing the city of Washington, the seat of the
                    general government. Although of little moment in a commercial <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194203384" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3384-0274"/>point of view, yet its
                    political importance entitles it to a pretty full description.</p>
                <p>Washington, the metropolis of the United States, is situated on the Maryland side
                    of the Potomac, in latitude 38. 32. 54. north, and longitude 77. 1. 48. west
                    from Greenwich. It is 436 miles south-west of Boston, 226 from New York, 136
                    from Philadelphia, and 37 from Baltimore. Rock Creek divides it from Georgetown,
                    with which it is connected by four bridges; and the Potomac separates it from
                    Alexandria, with which it is connected by a bridge of more than a mile in
                    length. There are also several bridges over the Anacostia. This river has a
                    sufficient depth of water for frigates to ascend above the navy-yard, which is
                    situated upon it. Vessels drawing fourteen feet of water can come up to Potomac
                    Bridge, from which to the mouth of the Tiber there are nine feet of water at
                    ordinary flood tide. A spacious canal unites the Anacostia with the Potomac. The
                    space on which the city is built is high, airy, commanding, and salubrious, and,
                    as but a small part of it is as yet occupied by buildings, it has the aspect of
                    a succession of opulent villages in the midst of the country. Streets running
                    north and south are crossed by others running east and west, whilst those which
                    bear the name of avenues traverse these rectangular divisions diagonally, and
                    are so laid out as to afford the most direct communication between those places
                    deemed the most important, or which offer the most agreeable prospects. Where
                    the avenues form acute angles by their intersections with the streets, there are
                    reservations which are to remain open. The avenues are named after the states of
                    the Union, and the streets are designated numerically or alphabetically,
                    beginning at the Capitol. This magnificent edifice is situated in Capitol
                    Square, a lofty eminence at the head of Pennsylvania Avenue. It is of the
                    Corinthian order, being constructed of freestone, and composed of a centre and
                    two wings. The length of the whole is 350 feet, the depth of the wings 121 feet,
                    and the height to the top of the dome 120 feet. A Corinthian porticoextends
                    along the centre, which is occupied by the rotunda, about ninety-six feet in
                    diameter, and the same number of feet in height. It is ornamented with paintings
                    and relievos, designed to commemorate some of the prominent events in the early
                    history of the country. This magnificent apartment is of white marble, and
                    lighted from the dome, which is lofty and imposing. The chamber of the House of
                    Representatives is one of the richest and most splendid apartments of the kind
                    that has ever been constructed. It occupies the south wing, and is of a
                    semicircular form, ninety-five feet in length, and sixty in height. The dome is
                    supported by twenty-six columns and pilasters of breccia or Potomac marble. A
                    colossal statue of Liberty, and another of History, are the principal
                    embellishments of this hall. The senate-chamber, in the northern wing, is also a
                    semicircle of seventy-four feet in length by forty-two in height. Adjoining the
                    rotunda on the west is the Library of Congress. The hall, ninety-two feet in
                    length, thirty-four in width, and thirty-six in height, contains 16,000 volumes.
                    Immediately beneath the senate-chamber, and nearly of the same form and
                    dimensions, is the room in which the sessions of the supreme court are held. The
                    president’s house is an elegant mansion, 180 feet in length by eighty-five feet
                    in width, and two stories high. Four brick buildings of the same height, with
                    free-stone basements and Ionic portico, contain the offices of the principal
                    executive departments. The General Post-office is a large brick edifice,
                    situated nearly a mile north-west of the Capitol, in which are the chambers of
                    the post-office establishment, the general land-office, and the patent-office.
                    The navy-yard is situated on the eastern branch of the Potomac, and is provided
                    with all the appurtenances necessary for building ships of the largest size. To
                    the north of it are the marine barracks, an arsenal, public manufactories of
                    arms, military stores, and the like. The city-hall is ai large edifice, and
                    amongst the other public buildings, which are numerous, may be enumerated four
                    market-houses, twenty churches, an orphan asylum, an alms-house, and the
                    Columbian College, which is situated on elevated ground to the north of the
                    city. It is a lofty building, and has four instructors, and about fifty
                    students. There are also two Roman Catholic institutions under the care of the
                    Sisters of Charity. In August 1814, Washington was taken by the British under
                    General Ross, who set fire to the Capitol, the president’s house, and other
                    public offices. The Library of Congress was burned at this time, and that of Mr
                    Jefferson was subsequently purchased to replace it.</p>
                <p>Georgetown is situated on the north-eastern bank of the Potomac, three miles west
                    of the Capitol in Washington, in longitude 75. 5. west, and latitude 38. 55.
                    north. It is separated from Washington by a small river called Rock Creek, over
                    which are two bridges. Considerable trade is carried on here; but in consequence
                    of the difficulties of navigation, occasioned by a bar three miles below the
                    town, a great part of the produce is conveyed to Alexandria, and exported from
                    that place. Georgetown contains a market-house, a college, a Lancasterian
                    school, a public library, four banks, and several places of public worship.
                    Georgetown College is a Roman Catholic institution, under the direction of the
                    Catholic clergy of Maryland. It has two spacious edifices, containing a library
                    of 7000 volumes, and has an average number of 150 students.</p>
                <p>Alexandria, an incorporated city on the western bank of the river, is a place of
                    extensive business, and of fashionable resort during the sittings of congress.
                    The streets are regular, and intersect each other at right angles. This city
                    contains a number of public buildings, and eight places of worship. Amongst the
                    valuable articles deposited in the Museum, is the robe in which Washington was
                    baptized, and several other relics of the great patriot of the west. In the
                    district of Columbia the Baptists have eighteen churches, the Presbyterians nine
                    churches, the Methodists 1400 members, the Episcopalians five ministers, the
                    Catholics several churches, and the Unitarians one minister.</p>

                    Maryland thirty-five newspapers and other journals, amongst which were several
                    monthly and quarterly periodicals.</p>
                <p>In 1632, Maryland was granted by Charles I. of England to Sir George Calvert,
                    Lord Baltimore, a Roman Catholic, and an eminent statesman; but before the
                    patent was completed, Lord Baltimore died, and the patent, dated 20th June 1632,
                    was given to his eldest son Cecilius, who succeeded to his titles, and who for
                    upwards of forty years directed, as proprietor, the affairs of the colony.
                    Leonard Calvert, his brother, was appointed the first governor; and he, together
                    with about two hundred persons, commenced the settlement of the town of St
                    Mary’s in 1634. A free toleration in religious matters was allowed the settlers,
                    and a system of equity and humanity was practised with regard to the Indian
                    tribes. After the colony of Maryland had established its general assembly, even
                    to the time of the revolution, the right of appointing the governor, and of
                    approving or disapproving the acts of the assembly, was retained by the
                    Baltimore family. The constitution of this state was formed in 1776, but it
                    subsequently underwent many alterations. The following is an outline of it as it
                    now exists. The legislative power is vested in a senate consisting of fifteen
                    members, and a house of delegates consisting of eighty members. These two
                    branches united are styled the General Assembly of Maryland. The members of the
                    house of delegates, four from each county, and two from each of the cities of
                    Annapolis and Baltimore, are elected annually by the people; whilst the members
                    of the senate are elected every fifth year, at Annapolis, by electors who are
                    chosen by the people. These electors choose by ballot nine senators from the
                    western and six from the eastern shore. The executive power is vested in a
                    governor, who is elected annually by a joint ballot of both houses of the
                    general assembly. No one can hold the office of governor more than three years
                    successively, nor be eligible as governor until the expiration of four years
                    after he has been out of that office. The governor is assisted by a council “f
                    five members, who are chosen annually in the same manner as the governor. The
                    general assembly meets annually at Annapolis, on the last Monday in December.
                    The council of the governor is elected on the first Tuesday in January; the
                    governor nominates to office, and the council appoints. The constitution grants
                    the right of suffrage to every free white male citizen above twenty-one years of
                    age, who has resided twelve months within the state, and six months in the
                    county, or in the city of Annapolis or Baltimore, next preceding the election at
                    which he appears to vote. 1he chancellor and judges are nominated by the
                    governor and appointed by the council, and they hold their offices during good
                    behaviour. In appointing officers under the state, the governor has the right of
                    nomination, and the council the right of appointment. The governor does not
                    possess the power of a <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> on the acts of the general
                    assembly. <hi rend="smallcaps">r. r. r.</hi></p>
