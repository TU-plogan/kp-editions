                <p><label type="entry">MERCIA</label>, thenameof oneof the seven kingdoms founded in
                    England by the Saxons. Though the latest formed, it was the largest of them all,
                    and grew by degrees to be by far the most powerful. On the north it was bounded
                    by the Humber and the Mersey, which separated it from the kingdom of
                    Northumberland; on the east by the sea, and the territories of the East Angles
                    and Saxons; on the south by the river Thames; and on the west by the rivers
                    Severn and Dee. It comprehended nearly seventeen of our modern counties. Penda
                    is regarded as its first monarch; and the kingdom is thought to have derived its
                    name from the Saxon, word <hi rend="italic">mere,</hi> which signifies a march,
                    boundary, or limit, because the other kingdoms bordered upon it on every side,
                    and not from the river Mersey, as some would persuade us. Penda assumed the
                    regal title in 626, and was of the age of fifty at the time of his accession;
                    after which he reigned nearly thirty years. He was of a most furious and
                    turbulent temper, breaking at different times with almost all his neighbours,
                    calling in the Britons to his assistance, and shedding more Saxon blood than had
                    as yet been spilled in all their intestine quarrels. He killed two kings of
                    Northumberland, three of the East Angles, and compelled Ken-wall, king of the
                    West Saxons, to quit his dominions. He was at length slain, with most of the
                    princes of his family, and a multitude of his subjects, in a battle fought not
                    far from Leeds, by Oswy king of Northumberland. This battle, which the Saxon
                    chronicle tells us was fought at Win-widfield in 655, made a great change in the
                    Saxon affairs, which the unbridled fury of Penda had thrown into complete
                    confusion. He had the year before killed in battle Anna, the king of the East
                    Angles, whose brother Ethelred notwithstanding took part with Penda. On the
                    other hand, Penda, the eldest son of Penda, to whom his father had given the
                    ancient kingdom of the Mid Angles, had two years before married the natural
                    daughter of king Oswy, and had been baptised at his court. It should seem that
                    at that time Oswy and Penda were upon good terms; but after the latter had
                    conquered the East Angles, he resolved to turn his arms against the kingdom of
                    Northumberland. Oswy had not provoked this rupture; on the contrary Bede tells
                    us that he offered large sums of money, and jewels of great value, to purchase
                    peace; but these offers were rejected, and he was reduced to the necessity of
                    deciding the quarrel by the sword. The river near which the battle was fought
                    having overflowed, there were more drowned than killed. Amongst these, as the
                    Saxon chronicle says, there were thirty princes of the royal line, some of whom
                    bore the title of kings; and also Ethelred, king of the East Angles, who fought
                    on the side of Penda against his family and country.</p>
                <p>His son Penda, who married the daughter of that conqueror, became a Christian,
                    and was not long afterwards murdered, as is stated, by the malice of his mother.
                    His brother Wolfher becoming king of Mercia, embraced in process of time the
                    faith of the gospel, and proved a victorious and powerful monarch; be is
                    commonly styled king of the Anglo-Saxons, though neither he nor his immediate
                    successors are owned in that quality by the Saxon chronicle. But although
                    possibly none of them might enjoy this honour, they were undoubtedly puissant
                    princes, maintaining frequent wars, and obtaining many advantages over the
                    sovereigns of other Saxon states, more especially the East Angles, whom they
                    reduced. The extent of the Mercian territories was so ample as to admit, and so
                    situated as to require the appointment of subordinate rulers in several
                    provinces, to whom, especially if they were of the royal line, they gave the
                    title of kings. Besides establishing episcopal sees and convents, the Saxon
                    monarchs took other methods for improving and adorning their dominions; and as
                    Mercia was the largest, so these methods were most conspicuous in that kingdom.
                    Coventry, as being situated in the centre, was usually, but not always, the
                    royal residence. Penda, who being almost continually in a state of war, lived
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207518" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7518-0592"/>as his
                    military operations directed, in some town upon the frontiers. Wolf her built a
                    castle or fortified palace for his own residence, which bore his name. Offa kept
                    his court at Sutton Walls, near Hereford.</p>
                <p>In each of the provinces there resided a chief magistrate; and if he was of the
                    royal blood, he had usually the title of king. Penda, at the time he married
                    Oswy’s daughter, had the title of “king of Leicester.” Ethelred made his brother
                    Merowald king of Hereford, and the latter, dying without issue, bequeathed it to
                    his younger brother Mercelm. Similar honours were sometimes conferred upon the
                    princesses; and hence, in Mercia especially, we occasionally read of
                    “vice-queens.” By these means the laws were better executed, the obedience of
                    the subjects more effectually secured, and the splendour of the royal residences
                    constantly kept up and augmented.</p>
                <p>At length the crown devolving sometimes on minors and sometimes on weak princes,
                    intestine factions prevailed, and the force of this hitherto mighty kingdom
                    began sensibly to decline. Such being the state of matters in the days of
                    Egbert, the most prudent as well as the most potent monarch of the West Saxons,
                    he took advantage of these circumstances; and having encouraged the East Angles
                    to make an attempt for the recovery of their independence, he, at a favourable
                    conjuncture, broke with the Mercians, and after a short war obliged them to
                    submit. But this was not an absolute conquest, the kings of Mercia being allowed
                    by him and his successors to retain their titles and dominions, till the
                    invasion of the Danes put an end to their rule, after this kingdom had subsisted
                    above 250 years. When the Danes were afterwards expelled by the West Saxons, it
                    sunk into a province or rather was divided into many.</p>
