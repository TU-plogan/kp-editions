                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MELEAGER</label>, in fabulous history, a celebrated hero, the
                    son of Oeneus, king of Calydonia, by Althaea, daughter of Thestius. The Parcae
                    were present at the moment of his birth, and predicted his future greatness.
                    Clotho said that he would be brave and courageous; Lachesis foretold his
                    uncommon strength and valour; and Atropos declared that he should live as long
                    as that firebrand, which was on the fire, remained entire and unconsumed.
                    Althaea no sooner heard this, than she snatched the stick from the fire, and
                    kept it with the most jealous care, as the life of her son totally depended upon
                    its preservation. The fame of Meleager increased with his years. He signalized
                    himself in the Argonautic expedition, and afterwards delivered his country from
                    the neighbouring inhabitants, who made war against his father at the instigation
                    of Diana, whose altars Oeneus had neglected. But Diana punished the negligence
                    of Oeneus by a greater calamity. She sent a wild boar, which laid waste all the
                    country, and seemed invincible on account of its immense size. It soon became a
                    public concern; all the neighbouring princes assembled to destroy this terrible
                    animal; and nothing is more famous in mythological history, than the hunting of
                    the Calydonian boar. The princes and chiefs who assembled, were Meleager son of
                    Oeneus, Idas and Lynceus sons of Aphareus, Dryas son of Mars, Castor and Pollux
                    sons of Jupiter and Leda, Pirithous son of Ixion, Theseus son of Aegeus, Anceus
                    and Cepheus sons of Lycurgus, Admetus son of Pheres, Jason of Aeson, Peleus and
                    Telamon sons of Aeacus, Iphicles son of Amphitryon, Eurytrion son of Actor,
                    Atalanta daughter of Schoeneus, Iolas the friend of Hercules, the sons of
                    Thestius, Amphiaraus son of Oileus, Protheus, Cometes, the brothers of Althaea,
                    Hippothous son of Cercyon, Leucippus, Adrastus, Ceneus, Phileus, Echion, Lelex,
                    Phoenix son of Amyntor, Panopeus, Hyleus, Hippasus, Nestor, Mcnoctius the father
                    of Patroclus, Amphicides, Laertes the father of Ulysses, and the four sons of
                    Hippocoon. This troop of armed men attacked the boar, which was at last killed
                    by Meleager. The conqueror gave the skin and the head to Atalanta, who had first
                    wounded the animal. This irritated the rest, and particularly Toxcus and
                    Plexippus the brothers of Althaea, and they endeavoured to rob Atalanta of the
                    honourable present. Meleager defended her, and killed his uncles in the attempt.
                    Meantime the news of this celebrated conquest had already reached Calydon, and
                    Althaea went to the temple of the gods to return thanks for the victory which
                    her son had gained; but being informed that her brothers had been killed by
                    Meleager, she in a moment of resentment threw into the fire the fatal stick on
                    which her son’s life depended, and Meleager died as soon as it was consumed. As
                    Homer does not mention the firebrand, and some have hence imagined that this
                    fable is posterior to that poet’s age. But he informs us, that the death of <pb

                    Plexippus so irritated Althaea, that she uttered the most horrible curses and
                    imprecations upon her son’s head.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Meleager,</hi> a Greek poet, was the collector of the first
                    Anthologia that is known. Neither the place where he was born, nor the time at
                    which he flourished is known with any degree of precision. We think that Mr.
                    Clinton <hi rend="italic">{Fasti Hellenici,xi p.</hi> 541) proves that he is

                    flourished after Antipater Sidonius somewhere about 95 B.c. Meleager was the
                    editor of a collection of fugitive pieces of poetry, and the author of some
                    original poems. His collection Avas made from the works of forty-six authors,

                    disappeared, but we possess one hundred and thirty-one pieces which are said to
                    have been the production of this poet. They are written principally on amorous
                    subjects, and are remarkable for the elegance of their versification. The best
                    editions of Meleager are that of Manso, (Iena 1789,) ofMeinecke, (Lips. 1789,)
                    and of Graefe (Lips. 1811.) See Fabricius, <hi rend="italic">Biblioth.
