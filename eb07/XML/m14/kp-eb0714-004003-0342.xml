                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MAHRATTAS</label>. The Mahratta state comprehended a country
                    in Hindustan, very extensive, and of great natural strength, being interspersed
                    with mountains, defiles, and fortresses, and well adapted for defensive war. It
                    extended across the peninsula of India, and, generally speaking, was in
                    possession of the peishwa, Nagpoor Rajah, Scindia, Holkar, Guicowar, and other
                    inferior chiefs. The Mahrattas were not originally a military tribe like the
                    Rajpoots; nor do they possess the same grace and dignity of person, being of a
                    diminutive stature and badly made, and having more the character of freebooters
                    than of soldiers. Their original country is said to have included Khandesh,
                    Baglana, and part of Berar, and north-west as far as Gujeratand the Nerbuddah
                    River. Others again say that they are foreigners, who came into India from the
                    western parts of Persia about 1200 years ago. Little is known of the history of
                    the Mahratta people till about the middle of the seventeenth century, when they
                    possessed a narrow tract of country on the western side of the peninsula,
                    extending from the fifteenth to the twenty-first degree of north latitude. The
                    founder of the Mahratta state, or at least the first person who raised this
                    nation from obscurity, was Sevajee, who was born about the year 1626, and died
                    in 1680, and who claimed a descent, but upon very doubtful grounds, from the
                    ranahs of Odeypoor. The father of Sevajee, named Sahoo Bhosila or Bhoonsla, was
                    an officer in the service of the last Mahommedan king of Bejapoor or Visiapoor.
                    The Mahratta country was originally divided amongst a number of principalities,
                    ruled by independent chiefs, who were combined into one under Sevajee. He was
                    succeeded by his son Sambajee, who extended his conquests, but who was finally
                    taken prisoner by Aurungzebe in 1689, and put to death. Sahoo Rajah, who
                    succeeded him, extended his conquests from sea to sea, and obtained possession
                    of fortresses commanding a territory reaching from the province of Agra to Cape
                    Comorin. This great monarch was succeeded by his son Ram Rajah, whose power was
                    usurped by the two chief officers of the state, the peishwa or prime minister
                    Bajeerow, and the paymaster-general Ragojee, who divided the empire between
                    them. The former fixed his residence at Poonah; the latter founded a new kingdom
                    at Nagpoor, in the province of Gundwa<!--ignore-->neh. Bajeerow, the peishwa,
                    died in 1759, and was succeeded by his son Ballajeerow. In 1760 the Mahrattas
                    had extended their conquests as far as the city of Delhi, when a formidable
                    rival appeared in Ahmed Shah Abdalli, the sovereign of Afghanistan, to dispute
                    with them the empire of India. With the Afghans was fought, on the 7th of
                    January 1761, the great battle of Paniput, in which the Mahrattas were speedily
                    overthrown with the loss of a great number of their chiefs. From this period
                    their power began to decline. Ballajeerow died soon after the battle of Paniput,
                    and was succeeded by his son Madhoorow, who died in 1772, and was succeeded by
                    his son Narrainrow, who was murdered the following year by his uncle Ragobah,
                    who was opposed in his designs on the throne by a combination of twelve chiefs.
                    At the head of these was Balla-jee Pundit, who became dewan or prime minister to
                    the infant prince. Ragobah fled to Bombay, where he solicited and obtained, by
                    means of an advantageous treaty, the aid of the British government. But this aid
                    was ineffectual in seating the murderer upon the Mahratta throne. His crime had
                    brought upon him the general obloquy of the nation; and his appeal to foreign
                    aid united against him the whole confederate chiefs of the Mahratta empire. By
                    the interference of the Bengal government, a treaty was concluded; but in 1777
                    the Bombay government again espoused the cause of Ragobah, and a war ensued,
                    which was terminated by a disgraceful convention, and Ragobah abandoned. A
                    general war afterwards took place between the British and the Mahrattas, and was
                    terminated by a treaty in 1782, by which every conquest was restored except the
                    island of Salsette. At this period the Mahrattas commenced hostile operations
                    against all those independent states which lay between their territories and
                    those of the Company; and in the course of six or seven years they were all
                    subdued, by which the Mahratta frontier bordered with the British dominions. In
                    1785 they carried on an unsuccessful war with Tippoo, and were obliged to
                    purchase peace by the cession of several valuable provinces, all of which they
                    recovered by their alliance with the British in 1790. The posthumous and infant
                    son of Madhoorow, who succeeded to the peishwaship when hecame to maturity, died
                    in 1795, and the two sons of Ragobah contended for the office. The cause of the
                    eldest brother, named Bajeerow, was espoused by Scindia, by whose aid he was
                    fixed on the throne; but he was permitted to enjoy nothing of the sovereignty
                    but the name. In the year 1802 the united armies of the peishwa and Scindia were
                    defeated by Holkar; and the former having taken refuge in the territory of the
                    British, was, by their aid, reinstated on the throne, agreeing in return to a
                    treaty offensive and defensive, and to receive into his pay a force of six
                    thousand infantry, with the usual proportion of artillery attached, for the
                    payment of which he assessed districts in the southern quarter of the country.
                    From this period the pcishwa, murmuring under his degradation into a state of
                    dependence, cherished schemes of hostility against the British. The first overt
                    act of hostility was the murder of the Guicowar’s ambassador, through the agency
                    of his ambassador Trimbuckjee. But his intrigues and schemes being discovered,
                    he vowed the strictest fidelity in future; and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200355" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0355-0041"/>in 1815 he delivered up his
                    prime minister to the British. He soon contrived, however, to escape to the
                    court of Poonah; and the peishwa, no longer dissembling, joined the confederacy
                    which had at that time been formed amongst the native princes of India, namely,
                    Scindia, Ameer Khan, Holkar, and the Berar Rajah, for the destruction of the
                    British power. But this confederacy was signally overthrown; the peishwa’s
                    armies were entirely routed; and he, reduced to the character of a wandering
                    fugitive, at last surrendered himself a prisoner to Sir John Malcolm, on
                    condition of an allowance being assigned him. It was now resolved by the
                    Anglo-Indian government to abolish the authority and the name of the peishwa,
                    which had become a rallying point for the disaffected, and to occupy the whole
                    of the Poonah dominions for the British nation, with the reservation of certain
                    territories for the Satarah family. Thus was extinguished not only the political
                    influence, but the name and authority, of the Mahratta state.</p>
