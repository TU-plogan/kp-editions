                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MALWAH</label>, an extensive province of Hindustan, situated
                    principally between the 22d and 23d degrees of N. lat. On the north it is
                    bounded by the provinces of Ajmeer and Agra, on the cast by Allahabad and
                    Gundwanch, on the south by Khandesh and Berar, and on the west by Ajmeer and
                    Gujerat, being in length about 220 miles, and in average breadth 150. Malwah is
                    a central and mountainous region, but with a regular descent from the Vindhya
                    Mountains, which extend along the north side of the Nerbuddah. From these
                    mountains numerous streams descend in every direction, whence they flow nearly
                    due north until they join the Chumbul, and ultimately the Jumna and Ganges. The
                    principal of these are the Nerbuddah, the Chumbul, Betwa, Sinde, Sopra, and
                    Cane; also the Mahy, which has its source in the Vind-hyan Hills, and flows in
                    the opposite direction from the other rivers, namely, to the south-west, and
                    loses itself in the Gulf of Cambay. The land, notwithstanding its elevation, is
                    extremely fertile, the soil being in general a fine black mould, which produces
                    cotton, opium, sugar, indigo, tobacco, and grain, in large quantities, besides
                    furnishing pasture for numerous herds of cattle. The tobacco, particularly that
                    of the district of Bilsah, is highly esteemed, and carried to all parts of the
                    country. The opium is also much esteemed, and is cultivated to a great extent.
                    Barley is not cultivated, owing to the unfavourable soil; and rice only in a few
                    detached spots, which lie convenient for water. The chief towns are, Oojain,
                    Indore, Bopal, Bilsah, Seronge, Mundessor, Burseah, and Mundoo. The rivers are
                    not navigable; and being an inland province, the commerce is carried on by means
                    of land-carriage. The chief articles of export are cottons, coarse-stained and
                    printed cloths, which are sent in large quantities to Gųjerat, and to Mirzapoor
                    on the Ganges, and thence forwarded to Calcutta; the root of the <hi
                    rend="italic">morinda citrofolia,</hi> and opium, which last drug is exported to
                    the adjacent provinces, especially to Gujerat and Cattywar, whence it is
                    smuggled eastward. The province of Malwah was rendered tributary to the Patan
                    sovereigns of Delhi in the thirteenth century. During the fourteenth and
                    fifteenth centuries it was governed by independent sovereigns of the Patan or
                    Afghan race. Malwah was subdued, and continued to form a province of the Mogul
                    empire until the death of Aurungzebe in 1707, when it was invaded and overrun by
                    the Mahrattas, and separated from the Mogul dominions, about the year 1732. The
                    ancient landholders, however, still retained some forts, which they defended
                    against their invaders, until they conceded to them a portion of the rents of
                    the neighbouring villages. These people are called Grassias; and one of them
                    retained a mud fort within ten miles of Oojain in 1790. There were other petty
                    chiefs, who held hereditary possession of certain parts of the country, and who
                    possessed each one or more strongholds, which were frequently defended with
                    obstinacy against the rulers of the province. In the southern division of Malwah
                    the Bheels or savage tribe are found in considerable numbers, especially amongst
                    the mountains contiguous to the Nerbuddah and Tuptee Rivers. Malwah was the seat
                    of the Pindarrie power, whence they issued in predatory bands to pillage and
                    destroy the country. In 1818, after the war against them had been brought to a
                    successful conclusion, they took refuge in Malwah, their ancient haunt, and
                    still meditated new insurrections. But they were pursued with such activity by
                    the British troops under the orders of Sir John Malcolm, that they were driven
                    to the hills; and being pursued to their fortresses, they were in the end
                    entirely routed and dispersed. The great object of the British in penetrating
                    into these remote parts was to put down entirely the spirit of disorder and
                    rapine by which all ranks appeared to be animated, having been long inured to
                    the most unbounded license; and to restore peace in those regions of Central
                    India, which had long been the scene of anarchy. For this purpose, having
                    subdued the leaders of the Patan mercenaries and the Pindarries, he distributed
                    his troops over the country in such convenient positions as to awe the
                    disturbers of the public peace into submission, and to preclude all attempts at
                    violence by the disorderly bands who were still lingering in the country, and
                    ready for any violence. By a judicious combination of conciliation with
                    firmness, Sir John Malcolm succeeded in restoring order in the distracted
                    country. The result of his arrangements was the expulsion of the disorderly
                    bands by which the public peace was disturbed, the restoration to power and
                    security of the rulers of the different petty states, and the return to their
                    homes of peaceable and industrious classes, who during the reign of terror and
                    anarchy were forced to hide their heads in obscurity. The same talents and
                    statesman-like policy were displayed by Sir John Malcolm in his transactions
                    with the Grassia, Rajpoot, and Bheel freebooters, who were reclaimed from their
                    wild habits, and converted into trustworthy soldiers and industrious
                    cultivators.</p>
