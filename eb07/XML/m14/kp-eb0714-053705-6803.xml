                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    O⅛α, <hi rend="italic">rex justitiae),</hi> the name of an individual who
                    occupies an important place amongst the characters which appear in the Old
                    Testament history, as typical of Christ. Very little, however, is said in
                    Scripture regarding him personally; his name occurs only twice in the Old
                    Testament, (in Gen. xiv. 18, and in Ps. ex. 4); and the reference to him in the
                    New, (in Heb. vii. 20. and vii. 1.), has respect only to his typical character.
                    His name is mentioned for the first time in the sacred history, on the occasion
                    of the return of Abraham from the defeat of the four kings or sheikhs who had
                    invaded the district of Sodom, and carried captive his nephew Lot. In the valley
                    of Sha-veh, or “the king’s dale,” probably the same valley as that mentioned
                    under the same name in 2 Samuel (xviii. 18), the victor was met by Melchisedec,
                    who is described as “the king of Salem,” and who, with the generous readiness of

                    spoken of in Psalm lxxvi. 2, where it is plainly Jerusalem that is referred to,
                    but must have been some city, unknown to general history, which lay somewhere
                    between Damascus and Sodom, to which district the narrative of Moses fixes the
                    route of Abraham’s march.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    office: “he was priest of the most high God and in this capacity he pronounced a
                    benediction on Abraham. In return for his kindness, and especially from
                    reverence to his priestly office, the patriarch gave him a tithe of all the
                    spoil he had taken in that expedition, from which he was then returning.</p>
                <p>This is the sum of what Moses records respecting Melchisedec; and the only
                    addition that can be made to the recital from the other passages above referred
                    to is, that his priesthood was not derived from hereditary descent, but had been
                    conferred on him by the immediate appointment of God.<note anchored="true"

                    something in the character and position of the individual to whom it refers of
                    so singular a nature, as at once to excite curiosity and stimulate further
                    investigation. That in a land inhabited by the accursed race of Canaan, and at a
                    time when the knowledge of the true God was confined apparently to Abraham and
                    his dependents,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Josh,
                    xxiv. 2.</p></note> an individual descended from that race should have been
                    found, uniting in himself the two offices of priest and king, worshipping the
                    true God of heaven and of earth,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Gen. xiv. 19</p></note> and so eminent in dignity and piety,
                    that his blessing was gratefully received by Abraham, and the divinity of his
                    priesthood acknowledged on the part of the patriarch, by an offering to him of
                    tithes, is a circumstance which cannot fail to excite the surprise of every
                    reader of the sacred narrative. It is natural for him to ask, Who or what was
                    this extraordinary character? From what race did he spring? Whence did he derive
                    his knowledge of the true God? Or how came he to be “a king of righteousness,”
                    and “a king of peace,” as well as a priest of God, in the land of Canaan? To
                    these questions the narrative of Moses furnishes no reply, and what is said of
                    him in other parts of Scripture<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ¢</hi> Ps. ex 4. Heb. vi.

                    is there assigned to him, as a type of the Messiah. Our only resource in such a
                    case is probable conjecture, and to this it is not surprising that expositors of
                    the Scriptures, both in ancient and modern times, should have had recourse; nor
                    is it to be wondered at that the opinions which they have advocated on the
                    subject have been both numerous and discordant. To recapitulate the whole of
                    these would only be to occupy space which might be far more usefully filled; we
                    shall, therefore, confine ourselves to a statement of one or two of the most
                    prominent, with a brief view of the arguments by which they have been
                    enforced.</p>
                <p>1. By the Jewish expositors generally, Melchisedec is said to have been Shem, the
                    son of Noah, and this, as we learn from Epiphanius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Haeres,</hi> lv. p. 205), was also the opinion entertained by the Samaritans.
                    It has likewise been held by a few Christian interpreters, amongst whom is
                    Luther. The passages from Jewish writers advocating it, have been carefully
                    collected by Bochart, <hi rend="italic">(Phaleg.</hi> lib. ii. c. 1), who has
                    also very satisfactorily shewn its absurdity; apart from the decisive evidence
                    furnished against it by the statement of Paul, that Melchisedec was one whose
                    descent could not be identified with that of the Levites, (<hi rend="italic"
                    >μὴ</hi> γεvε <hi rend="italic">α</hi><hi rend="italic">λ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >o</hi><hi rend="italic">γ</hi><hi rend="italic">o</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ύ</hi><hi rend="italic">μ</hi><hi rend="italic">ε</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vo</hi><hi rend="italic">ς</hi><hi rend="italic">ἐ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ξ</hi><hi rend="italic">ὐ</hi><hi rend="italic">υτωv,</hi> Heb. vii. 5), a
                    statement which is not true of Shein, who was in the regular line of Levi’s
                    progenitors. It seems highly unreasonable that Moses, who often mentions Shem,
                    should here introduce him under another name, without giving any explanation as
                    to the person really intended; nor is it easily conceivable that Abraham should
                    have been described as “sojourning in g <hi rend="italic">strange</hi> country,”
                    if he had been in the immediate vicinity of his ancestor Shem. The Jews,
                    moreover, are not unanimous in this opinion, for Josephus tells us that
                    Melchisedec was a prince of the Canaanites;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>2. Augustin and Theodoret severally inform us of a class of heretics in the early
                    church, who received the name of Melchisedechians, from their holding the
                    opinion that Melchisedec was a mighty divine power, <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dei virtutem,</hi><hi rend="italic">μeγαληv uva</hi> καί <hi

                    the model after which Christ was formed. The founder of this sect was one
                    Theodotus, an usurer, who seems to have flourished about the year 174.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Theodoret, <hi rend="italic"

                    learn from Epiphanius, identified this divine power with the Holy Spirit. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Haer.</hi> lv. p. 304). The sect seems to have commanded little
                    attention, and their opinion is worthy of notice only as forming one of the
                    heresies of the early church.</p>
                <p>3. By some of the fathers, and not a few of the more modern expositors,
                    Melchisedec has been regarded as the Logos or second person of the Trinity, who
                    appeared to Abraham, not incarnate, but only, as Epiphanius expresses it, <hi
                    rend="italic">'</hi><hi rend="italic">ε</hi><hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ἰ</hi><hi rend="italic">δ</hi><hi rend="italic">έ</hi><hi

                    the model of man. In defence of this opinion, its advocates adduce, 1st, the
                    acknowledged fact that such appearances were vouchsafed to the patriarchs, as in
                    the case of Abraham, when “the <hi rend="italic">Lord”</hi> communed with him
                    respecting the destruction of Sodom, and of Jacob, when he wrestled with the
                    angel, and saw <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">God</hi> face to face
                    ;” 2dly, the evident mystery attached in Scripture to the person and character
                    of Melchisedec, “of whom,” says Paul, “we have many things to say and hard to be
                    uttered ;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Heb. v.
                    11.</p></note> 3dly, the assertion of the same apostle that Melchisedec was not
                    mortal, implied in his declaration, that'whilst other men who receive tithes
                    die, “it is witnessed of him that he liveth ;”<note anchored="true"

                    of the “order” of his priesthood, and its perpetual duration, are spoken of by
                    the same apostle, as well as by the psaloust;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Heb. vii. 3, &amp;c. Ps. ex. 4.</p></note>
                    5tbly, the language of Paul in regard to the mysterious existence of
                    Melchisedec, as “without father, without mother, without descent, having neither
                    beginning of days nor end of life,” language strikingly applicable to Christ,
                    “whose goings forth have been of old from everlasting,” but hardly to be
                    understood of a mere man; and, <hi rend="italic">finally,</hi> the circumstance
                    of Melchisedec’s receiving tithes as a free-will offering from Abraham, an
                    homage which was rendered by the pious to none but the Almighty. On the side of
                    this theory are ranked some eminent names both in the early and in the modern
                    church. It is enough to mention those of Ambrose, Damianus, Moulin, Cunaeus,
                    Outrein, Hottinger, Starke, Gaillard, Ridgley, Hunter, Henry, and Brown. A very
                    able defence of this opinion has recently appeared in a work entitled, <hi
                    rend="italic">Melchizedek,</hi> by the author of Balaam, Elijah, &amp;c. London,
                    1834, the production, we believe, of a lady.</p>
                <p>4. By far the most common opinion is, that Melchisedec was a righteous and
                    powerful king, a worshipper and priest <pb break="no" facs="nls:194206829"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-6829-0539"/>of the Most High God, in the land of Canaan, and a
                    type of Jesus Christ. In support of this opinion it is contended,-1st, that the
                    mysterious character attributed to Melchisedec in Scripture, is nothing more
                    than belongs to all the prophetical types; and that when Paul says he has many
                    things to say respecting him which are hard to be uttered, he only means that
                    owing to the carnality of those to whom he was writing, the revelation which he
                    was about to give of the <hi rend="italic">spiritual</hi> character of
                    Melchisedec as a type of Christ, would not be easily apprehended;<note

                    matre serva,</hi> because only his mother’s name (Cornicula) was matter of
                    history; 3dly, that what is said of his being “without beginning of days or end
                    of life,” refers merely to our ignorance of the time and manner of his birth and
                    of his death, which are purposely left unrecorded in order that he might serve
                    as a type of Christ “who ever liveth ;” 4thly, that in all the <hi rend="italic"
                    >certain</hi> instances of divine appearances recorded in the Old Testament, the
                    fact of the Deity’s being present is made apparent in the narrative itself, and
                    that this not being done in the case of Melchisedec renders it unjustifiable,
                    without express authority from some other part of Scripture, to suppose that he
                    was such an appearance; 5thly, that had Melchisedec been himself the Son of God,
                    the apostle would not have said that he was “made like <hi rend="italic"
                    >(</hi><hi rend="italic">ἀ</hi><hi rend="italic">φωμo</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    been to compare him with himself; 6thly, that no sufficient reason is apparent
                    from the narrative for so extraordinary a revelation as that of the second
                    person of the Trinity in human shape, nor does any end worthy of such means seem
                    to have been answered by the interview; and, <hi rend="italic">finally,</hi>
                    that Abraham’s offering of a tithe of the spoil might with great propriety be
                    presented to Melchisedec though only a man, as an act of homage not to himself,
                    but to that God whose priest he was and in whose name he had blessed the
                    patriarch. This view of the subject has been adopted by a majority of the
                    fathers as well as of modern divines. It has been strenuously defended by Dr.
                    Owen in his work on the Hebrews, where he denounces the opposite opinion as a
                    series of “groundless fables,” and “woful mistakes,” and has received the
                    suffrages of the greater part of those who have commented upon that epistle,
                    amongst whom may be mentioned the names of Calvin, Cameron, Scott, Blomfield,
                    Stuart, Kuinoel, and Tholuck. It may be regarded as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >common</hi> opinion of the orthodox church.</p>
                <p>According to this opinion, the reasoning of St. Paul in the passage referred to
                    goes to establish an analogy between Melchisedec and Christ, in respect of the
                    following points: 1st,of ∕∕√7,wzc and <hi rend="italic">designation,</hi><hi

                    peace ;” 2dly, of <hi rend="italic">obscurity of descent,</hi> both being
                    without beginning of days or end of life, the one because his genealogy is not
                    recorded, the other because with regard to him this was literally true; 3dly, of
                    <hi rend="italic">the homage rendered to both by their receiving tithes as a

                    office they sustained,</hi> neither having had either predecessors or
                    successors, the one, because God arranged it so, the other, because it was of

                    priesthood by the sacrifice of himself.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
