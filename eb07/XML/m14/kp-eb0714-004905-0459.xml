                    western coast of India, from Cape Comorin to the river Chandragiri, in lat. 12.

                    tract, which is situated between the 10th and 13th degrees of north latitude. Io
                    the north it is bounded by the province of Canara, to the south by the rajah of
                    Cochin’s territories, to the west by the ocean, and to the east by the chain <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the Western Ghauts, below which the country lies,
                    extending about 200 miles along the sea-coast. The country may be divided into
                    two portions, the first of which borders the seacoast, and consists of a poor
                    sandy soil, seldom above three miles wide, and in general not so much. Low
                    branches of hills extend from the Ghauts to a considerable distance’ to the
                    westward, and sometimes even to the sea. The strip of country bordering upon the
                    sea is well adapted for the cultivation of rice; and it is remarkably
                    intersected by inlets of the sea, which often run for great lengths parallel to
                    the line of coast, receiving the various mountainstreams, and communicating with
                    the ocean by different narrow and shallow openings. In other places, the fresh
                    water, as it descends from the mountains into the low lands within the downs
                    upon the sea-coast, in the rainy season, totally overflows them, as the water
                    has no issue, and must consequently stagnate until it evaporates. By this
                    natural irrigation the lands are fitted for some particular qualities of rice.
                    There are a few mountain streams and rivers; and the distance of the mountains
                    from the sea is too inconsiderable for the formation of any large river. By far
                    the most extensive portion of Malabar lies in the vicinity of the Ghaut
                    Mountains, and consists of low hills separated by narrow valleys, which are in
                    general extremely fertile, being the receptacles of the fine particles of mould
                    carried down from the hills, and which stop when they can be carried no farther.
                    The hills have mostly level summits, which are bare in many parts, especially
                    towards the north, and expose to the view large surfaces of naked rock, with
                    remarkably steep sides; but they are seldom of any considerable height. They are
                    in general very industriously cultivated; their sides, which possess the best
                    soil, being formed into terraces. The valleys are in most cases watered by
                    rivulets which carry off the superfluous water; and where there is no issue, it
                    overflows the adjacent lands. The upland is barren, and the cultivation much
                    neglected; and it is in the valleys and extensive ravines, and upon the banks of
                    the rivers, that the inhabitants chiefly reside. Dr Buchanan mentions that some
                    parts of the country which he passed through in this province were the most
                    beautiful he had ever seen, being equal to the finest parts of Bengal, but the
                    trees were loftier, and the palms more numerous. In many places the rice-grounds
                    are interspersed with high swells, that are crowded with <pb break="no"

                    the north is bounded by naked rocky mountains, and to the south by the lofty
                    forests of the Travancore hills.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Canara, and Malabar,</hi> by F. Buchanan, Μ. D. vol. ii. p. 347∙</p></note> The
                    climate is moist; the low country of Malabar, as well as the whole region which
                    lies under the Western Ghauts, becomes excessively hot in the month of February;
                    and the vapours and exhalations are so thick, that it is difficult to
                    distinguish objects at the distance even of five miles. These vapours may be
                    viewed from the mountains, where the cold is very severe. The moisture collected
                    increases with the heat; and in March and April a prodigious quantity is
                    accumulated, and floats in the atmosphere, sometimes ascending nearly to the
                    tops of the mountains, where it is checked or condensed by the cold; but,
                    descending immediately after, it is again rarefied by the heat of the lower
                    atmosphere, into vapour, before it reaches the earth. At the setting in of the
                    western monsoon, the whole is condensed into rain, which falls very heavily,
                    partly in the low country, and partly in the mountains; and a small portion
                    escapes and is blown across Mysore. These heavy rains serve to bear away the
                    soil, and leave nothing but loose stones and sand upon the hills. The country
                    abounds in lofty forests, which are sometimes intermixed with cornfields and
                    plantations of fruit-trees. The teak is produced in great abundance, mostly
                    about Manarghaut; but it is too remote from any navigable river to be
                    transported with a profit from the place of its growth. Sandal-wood is also
                    exported from Malabar, though it is not the produce of the country; at least
                    such as is found within the limits of Malabar is not of a good quality, being
                    entirely devoid of smell; but, growing as it does immediately to the eastward of
                    the Western Ghauts, all that is produced towards the sources of the Cavery
                    naturally comes to Malabar, which affords the nearest ports that can be found
                    for its exportation. The palm is produced in the greatest abundance about
                    Palighaut, and with proper care an excellent spirit might be extracted from it.
                    These forests, unlike those in India, are the private property of the
                    landholders, who have exercised the right of selling and mortgaging the trees to
                    Moplay merchants. This right is interfered with in a manner equally oppressive
                    and impolitic by the surveyor of forests, an officer appointed with a view to
                    preserve them. Sir Thomas Munro, with his usual enlightened views, remonstrated
                    against his interference with the proprietors of the forests, and pointed out
                    its prejudicial effects upon the interests of all parties concerned, and the
                    grievance was to a certain extent redressed. Cocoa-nut trees abound in the
                    province. Black pepper is produced abundantly in Malabar, and forms the chief
                    export by Europeans, who usually purchase about five eighths of all that is
                    produced, and carry it principally to Europe directly, or to Bombay and China.
                    The remainder is chiefly exported by native traders to the Bay of Bengal, Surat,
                    Cutch, Sinde, and other countries in the north-west of India; and a considerable
                    quantity finds its way to the Arabian ports of Muscat, Mocha, Hodeida, and Aden.
                    They use scarcely any horses, asses, swine, sheep, or goats, in Malabar; and
                    such as arc required for the use of the inhabitants are imported from the east.
                    They have a small breed of cattle and buffaloes; but even these are but little
                    used in the transportation of goods, which are usually carried by porters.
                    Poultry have been introduced into the country by the Europeans; and common fowl
                    may be had in abundance. In many parts field labour is performed by slaves, who
                    are the absolute property of their lords, and may be sold at pleasure. But. a
                    husband and wife cannot be separated, though parents may be taken from their
                    children. The country is distinguished by the neatness of its villages, which
                    are superior to any in India. They are built of mud, which is neatly smoothed,
                    and are either white-washed or painted; and are much embellished by the beauty
                    and elegant dresses of the Brahmin girls. The villages, as well as the bazars,
                    are the work of foreigners, the aboriginal natives of Malabar living in detached
                    houses surrounded with gardens. The higher ranks use little clothing, but are
                    remarkably clean in their persons; and all ranks are free from cutaneous
                    distempers, excepting the very lowest castes of slaves.</p>
                <p>The country being intersected by many rivers, and bounded by a high wall of
                    mountains, was protected by these natural obstacles against the torrent of
                    Mahommedan invasion which desolated other parts of India; and it was not till
                    1766, when it was invaded by Hyder Ali, that it was subjected to a foreign yoke.
                    Hence the original manners and peculiar customs of the Hindus have been
                    preserved here in much greater purity than in other parts of India. Besides the
                    Hindus, who form the great proportion of the inhabitants, the population
                    consists of Moplays or Mahommedans, Christians, and Jews. The Hindus are divided
                    into the following castes; namely, Nam-buries, or Brahmins; the Nairs of various
                    denominations; the Teers or Tiars, who are cultivators of the land, and freemen;
                    the Malears, who are musicians and conjurors, and also freemen; and, lastly, the
                    Patiars, who are slaves or bondmen. Of these castes, the most remarkable are the
                    Nairs, the pure Sudras of Malabar, who all lay claim to be born soldiers, though
                    they are of various ranks and professions. There are altogether eleven ranks of
                    Nairs, who form the militia of Malabar, under the Brahmins and rajahs. They are
                    proud and arrogant to their inferiors; and, in former times, a Nair was expected
                    instantly to cut down a cultivator or fisherman who presumed to defile him by
                    touching his person, or a Patiar who did not turn out of his road as a Nair
                    passed. It is a remarkable custom amongst this class, that a Nair never cohabits
                    with the person whom he calls his wife. He gives her all proper allowances of
                    clothing and food; but she remains in her mother’s or brother’s house, and
                    cohabits with any person or persons she chooses, of equal rank; so that no Nair
                    knows his own father; and the children all belong to the mother, whose claim to
                    them admits of no doubt. This state of manners also prevails in the neighbouring
                    countries of Travancore, Bednore, and Canara.</p>
                <p>As in Malabar, the ancient Hindu state of property and manners prevails, almost
                    the whole land, cultivated and uncultivated, belongs to individuals, and is held
                    by a right which conveys a full and absolute property in the soil. There are
                    many traditions and conjectures respecting the origin of landed property in
                    those countries; and upon this subject a very full detail will be found in Mr
                    Thackeray’s report on the land tenures and assessments in Malabar,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Fifth
                    Report of the Select Committee on India Affairs,</hi> p. 799.</p></note> in
                    which he, along with Colonel Munro and others, strongly contends, that in the
                    southern parts of India, namely, in Malabar, Tanjore, Trichinopoly, &amp;c. the
                    private right of property in the soil has been established from time immemorial.
                    “The occupants of the land,” says one of the collectors of the revenue in
                    Southern India, “by whatever name distinguished, have the right of selling,
                    bestowing, devising, and bequeathing their lands, in the manner which to them is
                    most agreeable.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    consequence of the extraordinary customs of the Nairs, depends on the mother,
                    about whom there can be no mistake, though the father is frequently
                    uncertain.</p>

                <p>Christianity appears at a very early period to have made considerable progress on
                    the Malabar coast; and there is a greater proportion of persons professing that
                    religion in this than in any other part of India. Three ecclesiastical chiefs,
                    two appointed by the Portuguese church at Goa, and one by the see of Rome, ruled
                    over this establishment, besides the Babylonish bishops who preside over the
                    Nestorian community. Forty-four churches compose at present the Nestorian
                    communion, which has been reduced from 200,000 souls, its amount before the
                    arrival of Vasco de Gama, to about 40,000. The total number of Christians on the
                    Malabar coast, including the Syrians or Nestorians, is computed to amount to
                    200,000, of whom 90,000 are settled in Travancore. The Jews are estimated at
                    30,000.</p>
                <p>It is supposed that Malabar was, at a very early period, conquered by a king from
                    above the Ghauts. The Nairs may have been established at the same time by the
                    conqueror, or called in by the Brahmins, as a military body, to support the
                    government. In process of time they obtained settlements in the land; and the
                    chiefs, taking every opportunity to aggrandize themselves, became rajahs, and
                    from a remote period continued to govern Malabar like independent princes, until
                    Hyder’s invasion in 1760. Tradition, and the general opinion of the inhabitants,
                    contradict the notion that any land-tax existed in Malabar prior to that event.
                    No conclusive evidence is supplied on this subject by the doubtful analogies of
                    the neighbouring states; in some of which, such as Travancore, no land-tax was
                    said to exist, whilst in Canara a regular land-tax has been imposed for
                    centuries. There does not seem to have been any urgent necessity for the
                    establishment of a general land-tax, as there was no army besides the militia,
                    nor indeed any expensive establishments. Hyder subdued the country in 1761, and
                    expelled all the rajahs, except such as conciliated him by immediate submission.
                    Disturbances were occasioned by these proceedings; but he succeeded in
                    establishing his authority, and in 1782 appointed a deputy, who made still
                    further progress in subduing and settling the country. In 1788 Tippoo, his son,
                    proposed to the Hindus to embrace the true faith, and began by levying
                    contributions on his infidel subjects, and forcibly circumcising many of the
                    Brahmins, Nairs, and others. This produced a serious rebellion, which, however,
                    was soon quelled by his vigorous administration; and in the mean time the
                    country was laid waste by these tyrannical proceedings. On the breaking out of
                    the war between Tippoo and the British in 1790, the refractory rajahs and Nairs,
                    who were leading a predatory life in the jungles, were encouraged to join the
                    Company’s army. After the war, they were re-instated in their authority; but
                    they made such large claims to independence, whilst they failed at the same time
                    to fulfil their engagements for the payment of the revenue, and were also so
                    tyrannical in their proceedings, that they were finally deprived of all
                    authority, and allowed one fifth of their revenues for the support of their
                    dignity. Many of them, in consequence, had recourse to rebellion; but they were
                    put down by a military force, and some of them punished. Since this period,
                    under the management of the British collectors of revenue, the country exhibits
                    comparative tranquillity, and is said to be advancing in prosperity; though the
                    heavy assessments imposed by the British tend to obstruct its progress.</p>
                <p>Under the name of Malabar is distinguished a large tract of country extending
                    along the western coast of India, from Cape Comorin to the river Chandragiri, in
                    lat. 12.30. north; and the term is frequently erroneously applied to the whole
                    country from Bombay to the southern extremity. The above account applies only to

                    in great repute for its sanctity amongst the numerous Hindus who resort thither
                    for the purpose of being purified from their sins, which is effected by passing
                    through the aperture, which is of considerable elevation, being situated amongst
                    rocks of difficult access, that, in the stormy season, are incessantly washed by
                    the billows. In the vicinity are the ruins of a temple, said to have been blown
                    “p by the Portuguese; and a beautiful Brahmin village, built round a fine tank
                    of considerable extent, with broad flights of steps down to the water.</p>
