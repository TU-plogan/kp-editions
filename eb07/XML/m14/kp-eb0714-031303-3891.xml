                    astronomy; 5. acoustics; 6. electricity; and, 7. magnetism.</p>
                <p>In attempting to discover the origin of arithmetic and geometry, it would be a
                    fruitless task to conduct the reader into those ages of fable which preceded the
                    records of authentic history. Our means of information upon this subject arc
                    extremely limited and imperfect; and it would but ill accord with the dignity of
                    a science the principles and conclusions of which are alike irresistible, to
                    place its history upon a conjectural or fabulous basis. But notwithstanding the
                    obscurity in which the early history of the sciences is enveloped, one thing
                    appears certain, that arithmetic and geometry, and some of the physical
                    sciences, had made considerable progress in Egypt, when the mysteries and
                    theology of that favoured kingdom were transplanted into Greece. It is highly
                    probable that much natural and moral knowledge was taught in the Elensinian and
                    Dionysian mysteries, which the Greeks borrowed from the Egyptians; and that
                    several of the Grecian philosophers were induced by this circumstance to travel
                    into Egypt in search of those higher degrees of knowledge which an acquaintance
                    with the Egyptian mysteries had taught them to look for in that country.</p>
                <p>We accordingly find that Thales and Pythagoras were successively under the
                    tuition of the Egyptian priests, and returned into Greece loaded with the
                    intellectual treasures of Egypt. By the establishment of the Ionian school at
                    Miletus, Thales instructed his countrymen in the knowledge which he had
                    received, and gave birth to that spirit of investigation and discovery with
                    which his followers were inspired. He taught them the method of ascertaining the
                    height of the pyramids of Memphis by the length of their shadows; and there is
                    reason to believe that he was the first who employed the circumference of a
                    circle for the mensuration of angles. That he was the author of greater
                    discoveries, which have been either lost or ascribed to others, there can be
                    little doubt; but these are the only facts in the history of Thales of which we
                    have any certain information.</p>
                <p>The science of arithmetic was one of the chief branches <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194203904" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3904-0314"/>of the Pythagorean
                    discipline. Pythagoras attached several mysterious virtues to certain
                    combinations of numbers. He swore by <hi rend="italic">four,</hi> which he
                    regarded as the chief of numbers. In the number <hi rend="italic">three</hi> he
                    supposed that many wonderful properties existed; and he regarded a knowledge of
                    arithmetic as the chief good. But of all Pythagoras’s discoveries in arithmetic,
                    none has reached our times except his multiplication table. In geometry,
                    however, the philosopher of Samos seems to have been more successful. The
                    discovery of the celebrated proposition which forms the forty-seventh of the
                    first book of Euclid’s Elements, that in every right-angled triangle the square
                    of the side subtending the right angle is equal to the sum of the squares of the
                    two sides containing it, has immortalized his name; and whether we consider the
                    inherent beauty of the proposition, or the extent of its application in the
                    mathematical sciences, we cannot fail to class it amongst the most important
                    truths in geometry. From the same proposition its author concluded that the
                    diagonal of a square is incommensurable with its side; and this gave occasion to
                    the discovery of several general properties of other incommensurable lines and
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>During the time which elapsed between the birth of Pythagoras and the destruction
                    of the Alexandrian school, the mathematical sciences were cultivated with great
                    ardour and success. Many of the elementary propositions of geometry were
                    discovered during this period; but history does not enable us to refer each
                    discovery to its proper author. The method of letting fall a perpendicular upon
                    a right line from a given point (Euclid, b. i. prop. 11), of dividing an angle
                    into two equal parts (Euclid, b. i. prop. 9), and of making an angle equal to a
                    given angle (Euclid, b. i. prop. 23), were invented by Oenopidus of Chios. About
                    the same time Zenodorus, some of whose writings have been preserved by Theon in
                    his commentary on Ptolemy, demonstrated, in opposition to the opinion then
                    entertained, that isoperimetrical figures have equal areas. Coeval with this
                    discovery was that of the theory of regular bodies, for which we are indebted to
                    the Pythagorean school.</p>
                <p>About this time the celebrated problem of the duplication of the cube began to
                    occupy the attention of the Greek geometers. In this problem it was required to
                    construct a cube whose solid content should be double that of a given cube; and
                    the assistance of no other instrument but the rule and compasses was to be
                    employed. The origin of this problem has been ascribed by tradition to a demand
                    of one of the Grecian deities. The Athenians having, offered some affront to
                    Apollo, were afflicted with a dreadful pestilence; and upon consulting the
                    oracle at Delos, received for answer, “Double the altar of Apollo.” The altar
                    alluded to happened to be cubical; and the problem, supposed to be of divine
                    origin, was investigated with ardour by the Greek geometers, though it
                    afterwards baffled all their acuteness. The solution of this difficulty was
                    attempted by Hippocrates of Chios. He discovered, that if two mean proportionals
                    could be found between the side of the given cube and the double of that side,
                    the first of these proportionals would be the side of the cube sought. In order
                    to effect this, Plato invented an instrument composed of two rules, one of which
                    moved in grooves cut in two arms at right angles to the other, so as always to
                    continue parallel with it; but as this method was mechanical, and likewise
                    supposed the description of a curve of the third order, it did not satisfy the
                    pure taste of the ancient geometers. The doctrine of conic sections, which was
                    at this time introduced into geometry by Plato, and which was so widely extended
                    as to receive the name of the “higher geometry,” was successfully employed in
                    the problem of doubling the cube. Menechmus found that the two mean
                    proportionals mentioned by Hippocrates might be considered as the ordinates of
                    two conic sections, which being constructed according to the conditions of the
                    problem, would intersect one another in two points proper for the solution of
                    the problem. The question having assumed this form, gave rise to the theory of
                    geometrical loci, of which so many important applications have been made. In
                    doubling the cube, therefore, we have only to employ the instruments which have
                    been invented for describing the conic sections by one continued motion. It was
                    afterwards found, that instead of employing two conic sections, the problem
                    could be solved by the intersection of the circle of the parabola. Succeeding
                    geometers employed other curves for this purpose, such as the conchoid of
                    Nicoedes and the cissoid of Diodes. An ingenious method of finding the two mean
                    proportionals, without the aid of the conic sections, was afterwards given by
                    Pappus in his mathematical collections.</p>
                <p>Another celebrated.problem, the trisection of an angle, was agitated in the
                    school of Plato. It was found that this problem depended upon principles
                    analogous to those of the duplication of the cube, and that it could be
                    constructed either by the intersection of two conic sections, or by the
                    intersection of a circle with a parabola. Without the aid of the conic sections,
                    it was reduced to this simple proposition: To draw a line to a semicircle from a
                    given point, which line shall cut its circumference, and the prolongation of the
                    diameter that forms its base, so that the part of the line comprehended between
                    the two points of intersection shall be equal to the radius. From this
                    proposition several easy constructions may be derived. Dinostratus of the
                    Platonic school, and the contemporary of Menechmus, invented a curve by which
                    the preceding problem might be solved. It had the advantage also of giving the
                    multiplication of an angle, and the quadrature of a circle, from which it
                    derived the name of <hi rend="italic">quadratrix.</hi></p>
                <p>Whilst Hippocrates of Chios was paving the way for the method of doubling the
                    cube, which was afterwards given by Pappus, he distinguished himself by the
                    quadrature of the lunulae of the circle; and had from this circumstance the
                    honour of being the first who found a curvilineal area equal to a space bounded
                    by right lines. He was likewise the author of Elements of Geometry, a work
                    which, though highly approved of by his contemporaries, has shared the same fate
                    with some of the most valuable productions of antiquity.</p>
                <p>After the conic sections had been introduced into geometry by Plato, they
                    received many important additions from Eudoxus, Menechmus, and Aristeus. The
                    latter of these philosophers wrote five books on conic sections, which,
                    unfortunately for science, have not reached our times.</p>
                <p>About this time appeared Euclid’s Elements of Geometry, a work which has been
                    employed for two thousand years in teaching the principles of mathematics, and
                    whicļi is still reckoned the most complete work upon the subject. Peter Ramus
                    has ascribed to Theon both the propositions and the demonstrations in Euclid.
                    But it is the opinion of some that the propositions belong to Euclid and the
                    demonstrations to Theon, whilst others have ascribed to Euclid the honour of
                    both. It seems most probable, however, that Euclid merely collected and arranged
                    the geometrical knowledge of the ancients; and that he supplied many new
                    propositions in order to form that chain of reasoning which runs through his
                    Elements. This great work of the Greek geometer consists of fifteen books,
                    eleven of which contain the elements of pure geometry, and the rest embrace the
                    general theory of ratios, together with the leading properties of commensurable
                    and incommensurable numbers.</p>
                <p>Archimedes, the greatest geometrician amongst the ancients, flourished about half
                    a century after Euclid. He <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203917"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3917-0315"/>was the first who found the ratio between the
                    diameter of a circle and its circumference; and, by a method of approximation,
                    he determined this ratio to be as 7 to 22. This result was obtained by taking an
                    arithmetical mean between the perimeters of the inscribed and circumscribed
                    polygon, and is sufficiently accurate for every practical purpose. Many attempts
                    have since been made to assign the precise ratio of the circumference of a
                    circle to its diameter; but, in the present state of geometry, this problem does
                    not seem to admit of a solution. The limits of the present article will not
                    permit us to enlarge upon the discoveries of the ’philosopher of Syracuse. We
                    can only state, that he discovered that the superficies of a sphere is equal to
                    the convex surface of the circumscribed cylinder, or to the area of four of its
                    great circles, and that the solidity of the sphere is to that of the cylinder as
                    3 to 2. He discovered that the solidity of the paraboloid is one half that of
                    the circumscribed cylinder, and that the area of the parabola is two thirds that
                    of the circumscribed rectangle; and he was the first who pointed out the method
                    of dra∖ving tangents and forming spirals. These discoveries are contained in his
                    works on the dimension of the circle, on the sphere and cylinder, on conoids and
                    spheroids, and on spiral lines. Archimedes was so fond of his discovery of the
                    proportion between the solidity of the sphere and that of the cylinder, that he
                    ordered to be placed upon his tomb a sphere inscribed in a cylinder, and
                    likewise the numbers which express the ratio of these solids.</p>
                <p>Whilst geometry was thus advancing with rapid strides, Apollonius Pergaeus, who
                    was so called from being born at Perga in Pamphylia, followed in the steps of
                    Archimedes, and widely extended the boundaries of the science. In addition to
                    several mathematical works, which are now lost, Apollonius wrote a treatise on
                    the theory of the conic sections, which contains all their properties with
                    relation to their axes, their diameters, and their tangents. He demonstrated the
                    celebrated theorem, that the parallelogram described about the two conjugate
                    diameters of an ellipse or hyperbola is equal to the rectangle described round
                    the two axes, and that the sum or difference of the squares of the two conjugate
                    diameters is equal to the sum or difference of the squares of the two axes.
                    Inhis fifth book he determines the greatest and the least lines that can be
                    drawn to the circumferences of the conic sections from a given point, whether
                    this point be situated in or out of the axis. This work, which contains
                    everywhere the deepest marks of an inventive genius, procured for its author the
                    appellation of the Great Geometer.</p>
                <p>There is some reason to believe that the Egyptians were a little acquainted with
                    plane trigonometry; and there can be no doubt that it was known to the Greeks.
                    Spherical trigonometry, which is a more difficult part of geometry, does not
                    seem to have made any progress till the time of Menelaus, an excellent
                    geometrician and astronomer. In his work on spherical triangles, he gives the
                    method of constructing them, and of resolving most of the cases which were
                    necessary in the ancient astronomy. An introduction to spherical trigonometry
                    had already been given to the world by Theodosius in his Treatise on Spherics,
                    where he examined the relative properties of different circles formed by cutting
                    a sphere in all directions.</p>
                <p>Though the Greeks had made great progress in the science of geometry, they do not
                    seem to have hitherto considered quantity in general or in the abstract. In the
                    writings of Plato we can discover something like traces of geometrical analysis;
                    and in the seventh proposition of Archimedes’s work on the sphere and the
                    cylinder, these traces are more distinctly marked. He reasons about unknown
                    magnitudes as if they were known, and he finally arrives at an analogy, which,
                    when transferred into the language of algebra, gives an equation of the third
                    degree, which leads to the solution of the problem.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> It was, however, reserved for Diophantus to lay
                    the foundation of the modern analysis, by his invention of the analysis of
                    indeterminate problems; for the method which he employed in the resolution of
                    these problems has a striking analogy to the present mode of resolving equations
                    of the first and second degrees. He was likewise the author of thirteen books on
                    arithmetic, several of which are now lost. The works of Diophantus were honoured
                    with a commentary by the beautiful and learned Hypatia, the daughter of Theon.
                    But the same fanaticism which led to the murder of this accomplished female was
                    probably the cause that her works have not descended to posterity.</p>
                <p>Near to the end of the fourth century of the Christian era, Pappus of Alexandria
                    published his mathematical collections, a work which, besides many new
                    propositions of his own, contains the most valuable productions of ancient
                    geometry. Out of the eight books of which this work consisted, two have been
                    lost; and the rest are occupied with questions in geometry, astronomy, and
                    mechanics.</p>
                <p>Diocles, whom we have already had occasion to mention as the inventor of the
                    cissoid, discovered the solution of a problem proposed by Archimedes, namely, to
                    cut a sphere by a plane in a given ratio. The solution of Diodes has been
                    conveyed to us by Eutocius, who wrote commentaries on some of the works of
                    Archimedes and Apollonius, in the year 520. About the time of Diodes flourished
                    Serenus, who wrote two books on the cylinder and cone, which have been published
                    at the end of Halley’s edition of Apollonius.</p>
                <p>Geometry was likewise indebted to Proclus, the head of the Platonic school at
                    Athens, not only for his patronage of men of science, but also for his
                    commentary on the first book of Euclid. Mathematics were likewise cultivated by
                    Marinus, the author of the Introduction to Euclid’s Data; by Isidorus of
                    Miletus, who was a disciple of Proclus; and by Hero the younger, whose work,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Geo-desia,</hi> contains the method of determining
                    the area of a triangle from its three sides.</p>
                <p>Whilst the mathematical sciences were thus flourishing in Greece, and were so
                    successfully cultivated by the philosophers of the Alexandrian school, their
                    very existence was threatened by one of those great revolutions with which the
                    world has been convulsed. The dreadful ravages which were committed by the
                    successors of Mahommed in Egypt, in Persia, and in Syria, the destruction of the
                    Alexandrian library by the caliph Omar, and the dispersion of a number of those
                    illustrious men who had flocked to Alexandria as the cultivators of science,
                    gave a deadly blow to the progress of geometry. When the fanaticism of the
                    Mahommedan religion, however, had subsided, and the termination of war had
                    turned the minds of the Arabs to the pursuits of peace, the arts and sciences
                    engaged their affection, and they began to rekindle those very intellectual
                    lights which they had so assiduously endeavoured to extinguish. The works of the
                    Greek geometers were studied with care; and the arts and sciences, reviving
                    under the auspices of the Arabs, were communicated in a more advanced condition
                    to the other nations of the world.</p>
                <p>The system of arithmetical notation at present adopted in every civilized country
                    had its origin amongst the Arabians. Their system of arithmetic was made known
                    to Europe by the famous Gerbert, afterwards Pope Sylvester II. who travelled
                    into Spain when it was under the dominion of that nation. <hi rend="italic"
                    >A</hi></p>
                <p>The invention of algebra has been ascribed to the Arabs by Cardan and Wallis,
                    from the circumstance of their using the words <hi rend="italic">square,
                    cube,</hi><hi rend="italic">quadrato-quadratum,</hi> &amp;c. instead<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194203930" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3930-0316"/> of the second,
                    third, fourth, &amp;c. powers, as employed by Diophantus. But whatever truth
                    there may be in this supposition, it appears that they were able to resolve
                    cubic, and even biquadratic equations, as there is in the Leyden library an
                    Arabic manuscript, entitled the Algebra of Cubic Equations, or the Solution of
                    Solid Problems.</p>
                <p>The various works of the Greek geometers were translated by the Arabs, and it is
                    through the medium of an Arabic version that the fifth and sixth books of
                    Apollonius have descended to our times. Mahommed Ben Musa, the author of a work
                    on Plane and Spherical Figures, and Geber Ben Aphla, who wrote a commentary on
                    Plato, gave a new form to the plane and spherical trigonometry of the ancients.
                    By reducing the theory of triangles to a few propositions, and by substituting,
                    instead of the chords of double arcs, the sines of the arcs themselves, they
                    simplified this important branch of geometry, and contributed greatly to the
                    abridgment of astronomical calculation. A treatise on the art of surveying was
                    likewise written by Mahommed of Bagdad.</p>
                <p>After the destruction of the Alexandrian school founded by Ptolemy Lagus, one of
                    the successors of Alexander, the dispersed Greeks continued for a while to
                    cultivate their favourite sciences, and exhibited some marks of that genius
                    which had inspired their forefathers. The magic squares were invented by
                    Moschopulos, a discovery more remarkable for its ingenuity than for its
                    practical use. The same subject was afterwards treated by Cornelius Agrippa in
                    his work on occult philosophy; by Bachet de Meziria, a learned algebraist, about
                    the beginning of the seventeenth century; and in later times by Frenicle de
                    Bessi, Μ. Poignard of Brussels, De la Hire, and Sauveur.</p>
                <p>The science of the pure mathematics advanced with a doubtful pace during the
                    thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. The algebra of the Arabians was
                    introduced into Italy by Leonardo di Pisa, who, in the course of his commercial
                    speculations in the East, had considerable intercourse with the Arabs. A work on
                    the Planisphere, and ten books on arithmetic, were written by Jordanus
                    Nemorarius. The Elements of Euclid wereìranslated by Campanus of Novara. A work
                    on algebra, entitled <hi rend="italic">Summa de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportione</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Proportionalitat,</hi> was published by Lucas Paccioli; and about
                    the same time appeared Regiomontanus’s treatise on trigonometry, which contains
                    the method of resolving spherical triangles in general, when the three angles or
                    three sides are known.</p>
                <p>During the sixteenth century, algebra and geometry advanced with rapidity, and
                    received many new discoveries from the Italian philosophers. The formula for the
                    solution of equations of the third degree was discovered by Scipio Ferri,
                    professor of mathematics at Bologna, and perhaps by Nicholas Tartalea of
                    Brescia; and equations of the fourth order were resolved by Louis Ferrari, the
                    disciple of Hieronymus Cardan of Bononia. This last mathematician published nine
                    books of arithmetic in 1539; and in 1545 he added a tenth, containing the
                    doctrine of cubic equations, which he had received in secrecy from Tartalea, but
                    which he had so improved as to render them in some measure his own. The common
                    rule for solving cubic equations still goes by the name of Cardan’s Rule.</p>
                <p>The irreducible case in cubic equations was successfully illustrated by Raphael
                    Bombelli of Bologna. He has shown in his algebra, what was then considered as a
                    paradox, that the parts of the formula which represents each root in the
                    irreducible case, form, when taken together, a real result; but the paradox
                    vanished when it was seen from the demonstration of Bombelli that the imaginary
                    quantities contained in the two numbers of the formula necessarily destroyed
                    each other by their opposite signs. About this time Maurolycus, a Sicilian
                    mathematician, discovered the method of summing up several seriesesof numbers,
                    such as the series 1, 2, 3,4, &amp;c.; 1, 4, 9, 16, &amp;c.; and the series of
                    triangular numbers, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The science of analysis is under great obligations to Francis Vieta, a native of
                    France. He introduced the present mode of notation, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >literal,</hi> by employing the letters of the alphabet to represent indefinite
                    given quantities; and we are also indebted to him for the method of transforming
                    one equation into another, whose roots are greater or less than those of the
                    original equation by a given quantity; for the method of multiplying or dividing
                    their roots by any given number, of depriving equations of the second term, and
                    of freeing them from fractional coefficients. The method which he has given for
                    resolving equations of the third and fourth degree is also new and ingenious,
                    and his mode of obtaining an approximate solution of equations of every order is
                    entitled to still higher praise. We are also indebted to Vieta for the theory.of
                    angular sections, the object of which is to find the general expressions of the
                    chords or sines for a series of arcs that are multiples of each other.</p>
                <p>Whilst analysis was making such progress on the continent, Napier of Merchiston
                    in Scotland was bringing to perfection his celebrated discovery of the <hi
                    rend="italic">logarithms,</hi> a set of artificial numbers, by which the most
                    tedious operations in multiplication and division may be performed merely by
                    addition and subtraction. This discovery was published at Edinburgh in 1614, in
                    his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Logarithrnorum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Canonis Descriptio, seu Arithmetica Supputationum Mirabilis Abbreviatio.</hi>
                    It is well known that there is such a correspondence between every arithmetical
                    and geometrical progression, viz. {θ’ θ’ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> θ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> θ|’ θθ ’ ļ that any terms of the geometrical
                    progression maybe multiplied or divided by merely adding or subtracting the
                    corresponding terms of the arithmetical progression; thus the product of four
                    and eight may be found by taking the sum of the corresponding terms in the
                    arithmetical progression, viz. 2 and 3, for their sum 5 points out 32 as the
                    product of 4 and 8. The numbers 0, J, 2, 3, &amp;c. are therefore the logarithms
                    of 1, 2, 4, 8, &amp;c. The choice of the two progressions being altogether
                    arbitrary, Napier took the arithmetical progression which we have given above,
                    and made the term 0 correspond with the unit of the geometrical progression,
                    which he regulated in such a manner that when its terms are represented by the
                    abscissae of an equilateral hyperbola in which the first absciss and the first
                    ordinate are equal to 1, the logarithms are represented by the hyperbolic
                    spaces. In consequence, however, of the inconvenience of this geometrical
                    progression, Napier, after consulting upon the subject with Henry Briggs of
                    Gresham College, substituted the decuple progression, 1, 10, 100, 1000, of which
                    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. are the logarithms. Nothing now remained but to construct
                    tables of logarithms, by finding the logarithms of the intermediate numbers
                    between the terms of the decuple progression. Napier, however, died before he
                    was able to calculate these tables; but his loss was in some measure supplied by
                    Mr Briggs, who applied himself with zeal to this arduous task, and published in
                    1618 a table of the logarithms of all numbers from 1 to 1000. In 1624 he
                    published another table containing the logarithms from 1000 to 20,000, and from
                    90,000 to 100,000. The defects in Briggs’s tables were filled up by his friends
                    Gellibrand and Hadrian Vlacq, who also published new tables containing the
                    logarithms of sines, tangents, &amp;c. for 90 degrees.</p>
                <p>During the time when Napier and Briggs were doing honour to their country by
                    completing the system of logarithms, algebra was making great progress in the
                    hands of our countryman Harriot. His <hi rend="italic">Artis Analyticae
                    Praxis,</hi> which appeared in 1620, contains, along with the discoveries<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194203943" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3943-0317"/> of its author, a
                    complete view of the state of algebra. He simplified the notation, by
                    substituting small letters instead of the capitals introduced by Vieta; and he
                    was the first who showed that every equation beyond the first degree may be
                    considered as produced by the multiplication of as many simple equations as
                    there arc units in the exponent of the highest power of the unknown quantity.
                    From this he deduced the relation which exists between the roots of au equation
                    and the co-efficients of the terms of which it consists.</p>
                <p>About the same time, a foreign author named Fernel, who was physician to King
                    Henry II. of France, had the merit of being the first who gave the measure of
                    the earth. By reckoning the number of turns made by a coach-wheel from Amiens to
                    Paris, till the altitude of the pole star was increased one degree, he estimated
                    the length of a degree of the meridian to be 56,746 toises, which is wonderfully
                    near the truth. He also wrote a work on mathematics, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Proportionibus.</hi> About this time it was shown by
                    Peter Metius, a German mathematician, that if the diameter of a circle be 113,
                    its circumference will be 355. This result, so very near the truth, and
                    expressed in so few figures, has preserved the name of its author.</p>
                <p>The next author whose labours here claim our attention is the illustrious
                    Descartes. We do not allude to those wild and ingenious speculations by which
                    this philosopher endeavoured to explain the celestial phenomena, but to those
                    great discoveries with which he enriched the kindred sciences of algebra and
                    geometry. He introduced the present method of marking the powers of any quantity
                    by numerical exponents. He first explained the use of negative roots in
                    equations, and showed that they are as real and useful as positive roots; the
                    only difference between them being founded on the different manner in which the
                    corresponding quantities are considered. He pointed out the method of finding
                    the number of positive and negative roots in any equation where the roots are
                    real; and developed the method of indeterminates, which Vieta had obscurely
                    hinted at.</p>
                <p>Though Regiomontanus, Tartalea, and Bombelli, had resolved several geometrical
                    problems by means of algebra, yet the general method of applying geometry to
                    algebra vas first given by Vieta. It is to Descartes, however, that ve are
                    indebted for the beautiful and extensive use which ıe made of his discovery. His
                    method of representing the ιature of curve lines by equations, and of arranging
                    them n different orders according to the equations which dis-inguished them,
                    opened a vast field of inquiry to subse- [uent mathematicians; and his methods
                    of constructing !urves of double curvature, and of drawing tangents to !iirve
                    lines, have contributed much to the progress of geo·· netry. The inverse method
                    of tangents, which it was eserved for the fluxionary calculus to bring to
                    perfection, ∣riginated at this time in a problem which Florimonde de Beaune
                    proposed to Descartes. It was required to coni tract a curve in which the ratio
                    of the ordinate and sub-angent should be the same as that of a given line to the
                    ∣ ∣ortion of the ordinate included between the curve and a .ue inclined at a
                    given angle. The curve was constructed y Descartes, and several of its
                    properties detected; but he ^as unable to accomplish the complete solution of
                    the probam. These discoveries of Descartes were studied and im-roved by his
                    successors, amongst whom we may number he celebrated Hudde, who published, in
                    Schooten’s com-ιentary on the geometry of Descartes, an excellent me-hod of
                    determining whether an equation of any order confins several equal roots, and of
                    discovering the roots which <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> contains.</p>
                <p>The celebrated Pascal, who was equally distinguished ļy his literary and his
                    scientific acquirements, extended lie boundaries of analysis by the invention of
                    his arithmetical triangle. By means of arbitrary numbers placed at the vertex of
                    the triangle, he formed all the figurate numbers in succession, and determined
                    the ratio between the numbers of any two cases, and the various sums resulting
                    from the addition of all the numbers of one rank taken in any possible
                    direction. This ingenious invention gave rise to the calculation of
                    probabilities in the theory of games of chance, and formed the foundation of an
                    excellent treatise of Huygens, entitled <hi rend="italic">De Patiociniis in Ludo
                    Aleae,</hi> published in 1657.</p>
                <p>Several curious properties of numbers were at the same time discovered by Fermat
                    at Toulouse. In the theory of prime numbers, particularly, which had first been
                    considered by Eratosthenes, Fermat made great discoveries; and in the doctrine
                    of indeterminate problems he seems to have been deeply versed, having
                    republished the arithmetic of Diophantus, and enriched it with many valuable
                    notes of his own. He invented the method of discovering the <hi rend="italic"
                    >maxima</hi> and <hi rend="italic">minima</hi> of variable quantities, which
                    serves to determine the tangents of geometrical curves, and paved the way for
                    the invention of the ŕluxionary calculus.</p>
                <p>Another step towards the discovery of fluxions was at this time made by Cavalleri
                    in his geometry of indivisibles. In this work, which was published in 1635, its
                    author supposes every plane surface to consist of an infinite number of planes;
                    and he lays it down as an axiom, that these infinite sums of lines and surfaces
                    have the same ratio when compared with the unit in each case as the superficies
                    and solids to be measured. This ingenious method was employed by Cavalleri in
                    the quadrature of the conic sections, and in the curvature of solids generated
                    by revolution; and in order to prove the accuracy of his theory, he deduced the
                    same results from different principles.</p>
                <p>Problems of a similar kind, which had been solved by Fermat and Descartes, now
                    occupied the attention of Roberval. The latter of these mathematicians began his
                    investigation of this subject about a year before the publication of Cavalleri’s
                    work, and the methods which both of them employed were so far the same as to be
                    founded on the principles of indivisibles. In the mode, however, which Roberval
                    adopted, planes and solids were considered as composed of an infinite number of
                    rectangles, whose altitudes and the thickness of their sections were infinitely
                    small. By means of this method, Roberval determined the area of the cycloid, the
                    centre of gravity of this area, and the solids formed by its revolution on its
                    axis and base. He also invented a general method for tangents, similar in
                    metaphysical principles to that of fluxions, and applicable both to mechanical
                    and geometrical curves. By means of this, he determined the tangents of the
                    cycloid; but there were some curves which resisted its application. Considering
                    every curve as generated by the motion of a point, Roberval regarded this point
                    as acted upon at every instant by two velocities which were ascertained from the
                    nature of the curve. He constructed a parallelogram having its sides in the same
                    ratio as the two velocities; and he assumed as a principle, that the direction
                    of the tangent-must fall on the diagonal, the position of which being
                    ascertained, gave the position of the tangent.</p>
                <p>In 1644, solutions of the cycloidal problems formerly resolved by Roberval were
                    published by Torricelli as invented by himself. The demonstrations of Roberval
                    had been transmitted to Galileo, the preceptor of Torricelli, and had also been
                    published, in 1637, in Mersenne’s <hi rend="italic">Universal Harmony.</hi> The
                    Italian philosopher was consequently accused of plagiarism by Roberval, and the
                    charge so deeply affected his mind as to bring him prematurely to the grave. It
                    is obvious, however, from the demonstrations of Torricelli, that he had never
                    seen those of Roberval, and that he was far from meriting that cruel
                    accusation<pb break="no" facs="nls:194203956" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3956-0318"/>
                    which deprived science of one of its brightest ornaments.</p>
                <p>The cycloid having attracted the notice of geometers, from the number and
                    singularity of its properties, the celebrated Pascal proposed to them a variety
                    of new problems relative to this curve, and offered prizes for their solution.
                    These problems required the area of any cycloidal segment, the centre of gravity
                    of that segment, the solids, and the centres of gravity of the solids, which are
                    generated either by a whole revolution, a half, or a quarter of a revolution, of
                    this segment round an abscissa or an ordinate. The resolution of these problems
                    was attempted by Huygens, Sluze, Sir Christopher Wren, Fermat, and Roberval.
                    Sluze discovered an ingenious method of finding the area of the curve. Huygens
                    squared the segment comprised between the vertex, and as far as a fourth of the
                    diameter of the generating circle; and Sir Christopher Wren ascertained the
                    length of the cycloidal arc included between the vertex and the ordinate, the
                    centre of gravity of this arc, and the surfaces of the solids generated durino∙
                    its revolution. These attempts were not considered by their authors as solutions
                    of Pascal’s problems, and therefore they did not lay claim to his prize. Our
                    countryman Wallis, however, and Lallouère a Jesuit, gave in a solution of all
                    the problems, and thought themselves entitled to the proffered reward. In the
                    methods employed by these mathematicians, Pascal detected several sources of
                    error: and it was reserved for that great genius to furnish a complete solution
                    of his own problems. Extending his investigations to curtate and prolate
                    cycloids, he proved that the length of these curves depends on the rectification
                    of the ellipse, and assigned in each case the axis of the ellipse. From this
                    method he deduced this curious theorem, That if two cycloids, the one curtate
                    and the other prolate, be such that the base of the one is equal to the
                    circumference of the circle by which the other is generated, the length of these
                    two cycloids will be equal.</p>
                <p>Whilst these discoveries were making on the continent, the friends of science in
                    Britain were actively employed in promoting its advancement. In 1655, Wallis
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica Infinitorum,</hi> a work of great
                    genius. He attempted to determine, by the summation of infinite series, the
                    quadrature of curves, and the curvature of solids; subjects which were
                    afterwards investigated in a different manner by Ishmael Bullialdus. By Wallis’s
                    method, curves were squared when their ordinates were expressed by one term; and
                    when their ordinates were complex quantities raised to entire and positive
                    powers, these ordinates were resolved into series, of which each term was a
                    monomial. Wallis attempted to extend his theory to curves the ordinates of which
                    were complex and radical, by attempting to interpolate the series of the former
                    kind with a new series; but he was unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>It was reserved for Newton to remove this difficulty. He solved the problem in a
                    more direct and simple manner by the aid of his new formula for expanding into
                    an infinite series any power of a binomial, whether its exponent was positive or
                    negative, an integer or a fraction. Algebra was also indebted to this
                    illustrious mathematician for a simple and extensive method of resolving an
                    equation into commensurable factors; for a method of summing up the powers of
                    the roots of an equation, of extracting the roots of quantities partly
                    commensurable and partly incommensurable, and of finding by approximation the
                    roots of literal and numerical equations of all ordern</p>
                <p>About this time, William Lord Brouncker, in attempting to demonstrate an
                    expression of Wallis on the magnitude of the circle, discovered the theory of
                    continued fractions. When an irreducible fraction is expressed by numbers too
                    great and complicated to be easily employed by the analyst, the method of Lord
                    Brouncker enables us to substitute an expression much more simple, and nearly
                    equivalent. This theory, which enables us to find a very accurate relation
                    between the diameter and circumference of the circle, was employed by Huygens in
                    the calculation of his planetary automaton for representing the motions of the
                    solar system, and was enlarged and improved by other celebrated geometers. Lord
                    Brouncker had likewise the merit of discovering an infinite series to represent
                    the area of the hyperbola. The same discovery was made by Nicholas Mercator, who
                    published it in his <hi rend="italic">Lο∙ garithmotechnia</hi> in 1668.</p>
                <p>The subject of infinite series received considerable addition from Mr James
                    Gregory. He was the first who gave the tangent and secant in terms of the arc,
                    and, inversely, the arc in terms of the tangent and secant. He constructed
                    series for finding directly the logarithm of the tangent and secant from the
                    value of the arc, and the logarithm of the arc from that of the tangent and
                    secant; and he applied this theory of infinite series to the rectification of
                    the ellipsis and hyperbola.</p>
                <p>The differential triangle invented by the learned Dr Barrow, for drawing tangents
                    to curves, may be regarded as another contribution towards the invention of
                    fluxions. This triangle has for its sides the element of the curve and those of
                    the absciss and ordinate, and those sides are treated as quantities infinitely
                    small.</p>
                <p>The doctrine of evolutes had been slightly touched upon by Apollonius. It
                    remained, however, for the illustrious Huygens to bring it to perfection. His
                    theory of evolutes is contained in his <hi rend="italic">Horologium
                    Oscillatorium,</hi> published in 1673, and may be regarded as one of the finest
                    discoveries in geometry. When any curve is given, Huygens has pointed out the
                    method of constructing a second curve, by drawing a series of perpendiculars to
                    the first, which are tangents to the second; and of finding the first curve from
                    the second. From this principle he deduces several theorems on the rectification
                    of curves, and that remarkable property of the cycloid, in which an equal and
                    similar cycloid is produced by evolution.</p>
                <p>, In contemplating the progress of analysis from the beginning of the seventeenth
                    century to the invention of fluxions, we cannot fail to perceive the principles
                    of that calculus gradually unfolding themselves to view. The human mind seemed
                    to advance with rapidity towards that great discovery; and it is by no means
                    unlikely that it would soon have arrived at the doctrine of fluxions, even if
                    the superior genius of Newton had not accelerated its progress. In Cavalleri’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Geometria Indivisibilium</hi> we perceive the germ, of the
                    infinitesimal calculus; and the method of Roberval for finding the tangents of
                    curves bears a striking analogy to the metaphysics of the fluxionary calculus.
                    It was the glory of Newton, however, to invent and illustrate the method of
                    fluxions; and the obscure hints which he received from preceding mathematicians
                    do not in the least detract from the merit of our illustrious countryman.</p>
                <p>On the claims of Leibnitz as a second inventor of fluxions we shall not here
                    enter at any considerable length. We shall merely give a brief view of the facts
                    which relate to the discovery of the higher calculus, and make a few
                    observations on the conclusions to which they lead. (See Professor Playfair’s
                    Dissertation, prefixed to this work.)</p>
                <p>In the year 1669, a paper of Sir Isaac Newton’s, entitled <hi rend="italic">De
                    Analysiper Equationes</hi><hi rend="italic">numero terminorum infinitas,</hi>
                    was communicated by Dr Barrow to Mr Collins, one of the secretaries of the Royal
                    Society. In this paper the author points out a new method of squaring curves,
                    both when the expression of the ordinate is a rational quantity, and when it
                    contains complex radicals, by evolving the expression of the ordinate into an
                    infinite number of simple <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203969"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3969-0319"/>terms, by means of the binomial theorem. In a
                    letter from Newton to Collins, dated 10th December 1672, there is contained a
                    method of drawing tangents to curve lines, without being obstructed by radicals;
                    and in both these works, an account of which was circulated on the continent by
                    the secretaries of the Royal Society, the principles of the fluxional calculus
                    are plainly exhibited; and it is the opinion of all the disputants, that those
                    works prove that Newton must have been acquainted with the method of fluxions
                    when he composed them.</p>
                <p>Leibnitz came to London in the year 1673; and though there is no direct evidence
                    that he saw Newton’s paper <hi rend="italic">De Analysi per Equationes,</hi> yet
                    it is certain that he had seen Sir Isaac’s letter to Collins of 1672; and it is
                    highly improbable that such a man as Leibnitz should have been ignorant of a
                    paper of Newton’s, which had been four years in the possession of the public,
                    and which contained discussions at that time interesting to every
                    mathematician.</p>
                <p>A letter from Newton to Oldenburg, one of the secretaries of the Royal Society,
                    dated 24th October 1676, was communicated to Leibnitz. This letter contains
                    several theorems without the demonstrations, which are founded on die method of
                    fluxions, and merely states that they result from the solution of a general
                    problem. The enunciation of this problem he expresses in a cipher, the meaning
                    of which was, an equation in which any number of flowing quantities being given,
                    it was required to find the fluxions, and inversely. In reply to this
                    communication, Leibnitz transmitted a letter to Oldenburg, dated 21st June 1677,
                    where he explains the nature of the differential calculus, and affirms that he
                    had long employed it for drawing tangents to curve lines.</p>
                <p>The correspondence between Leibnitz and Oldenburg having been broken off by the
                    death of the latter, Leibnitz published, in the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Eruditorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Lips,</hi> for October 1684, the

                    problems. In 1685 he likewise published two small pamphlets on the quadrature of
                    curves, containing the principles of the <hi rend="italic">Calculus
                    Summatorius,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Inverse Method of Fluxions·,</hi> and
                    in 1686 there appeared another tract by the same author, <hi rend="italic">On
                    the Recondite Geometry, and the Analysis of Indivisibles and Infinites,</hi>
                    containing the fundamental rule of the integral calculus.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of the year 1686, Sir Isaac Newton gave to the world his
                    immortal work entitled <hi rend="italic">Philosophiae Ntiimdis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Principia Mathematica.</hi> Some of the most difficult problems in
                    this work are founded on the fluxional calculus; and it is allowed by Bossut,
                    one of the defenders of Leibnitz, “that mathematicians did Newton the justice to
                    acknowledge, that at the period when his <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> was
                    published, he was master of the method of fluxions to a high degree, at least
                    with respect to that part which concerns the quadrature of curves.” The claim of
                    Leibnitz as a separate inventor of the differential calculus is evidently
                    allowed by Newton himself, when he observes, that Leibnitz had communicated to
                    him a method similar to his cwn for drawing tangents, &amp;c., and differing
                    from it only in the enunciation and notation.</p>
                <p>About this time it became fashionable amongst geometers to perplex each other by
                    the proposal of new and difficult problems; a practice which powerfully
                    contributed to the progress of mathematics. The dispute in which Leibnitz was
                    engaged with the Cartesians respecting the measure of active forces, which the
                    former supposed to be as the simple velocity, whilst the latter asserted that
                    they were as the square of the velocity, led him to propose the problem of the
                    isochronous curve, or “to find the curve which a heavy body must describe
                    equally, in order to approach or recede from a horizontal plane in equal times.”
                    This curve was found by Huygens to be the second cubic parabola; but he gave
                    only its properties and construction, without the demonstrations. In 1689, the
                    same solution, along with the demonstration, was given by Leibnitz, who, at the
                    same time, proposed to geometers to find the <hi rend="italic">paracentric
                    isochronal curve,</hi> or the curve in which a body would equally approach to or
                    recede from a given point in equal times.</p>
                <p>It was at this time that the two brothers, James and John Bernoulli, began to
                    display those talents from which the physical and mathematical sciences received
                    such immense improvements. James was born in 1654, and died in 1705; and John,
                    who was his pupil, was born in 1667, and lived to the advanced age of
                    sixty-eight years. In 1690, James Bernoulli gave the same solution of the
                    isochronous curve which had been given by Huygens and Leibnitz, and proposed the
                    celebrated problem of the catenary curve, which had formerly perplexed the
                    ingenuity of Galileo. In two memoirs, published in 1691, he determined, by means
                    of the inverse method of fluxions, the tangents of the parabolic spiral, the
                    logarithmic spiral, and the loxodromic curve, and likewise the quadratures of
                    their respective areas.</p>
                <p>The problem of the catenary curve having occupied the attention of geometers, was
                    resolved by Huygens, Leibnitz, and John Bernoulli. In these solutions, however,
                    the gravity of the catenary curve was supposed to be uniform; but James
                    Bernoulli extended the solution to cases where the weight of the curve varies
                    from one point to another, according to a given law. From this problem he was
                    also conducted to the determination of the curvature of a bended bow, and that
                    of an elastic bar fixed at one extremity, and loaded at the other with a given
                    weight. In the hopes of contributing to the progress of navigation, the same
                    mathematician considered the form of a sail swollen with the wind. When the
                    wind, after striking the sail, is not prevented from escaping, the curvature of
                    the sail is that of the common catenarian curve; but when the sail is supposed
                    to be perfectly flexible, and filled with a fluid pressing downwards on itself,
                    as water presses on the sides of a vessel, the curve which it forms is one of
                    those denominated <hi rend="italic">linteariae,</hi> which is expressed by the
                    same equation as the common elastic curve, where the extensions are reckoned
                    proportional to the forces applied at each point. The same problem was solved by
                    John Bernoulli, in the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Sçavans</hi> for 1692; but
                    there is satisfactory evidence that it was chiefly borrowed from his brother
                    James.</p>
                <p>The attention of James Bernoulli was now directed to the theory of curves
                    produced by the revolution of one curve upon another. He considered one curve
                    rolling upon a given curve equal to the first, and immoveable. He determined the
                    evolute and the caustic of the epicycloid, described by a point of the moving
                    circle; and he deduced from it other two curves, denominated the <hi
                    rend="italic">anti-evolute</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pericaustie.</hi> He found
                    also that the logarithmic spiral was its own evolute, caustic, anti-evolute, and
                    pericaustic; and that an analogous property belonged to the cycloid.</p>
                <p>• About this time Signor Viviani, an Italian geometer, distinguished as the
                    restorer of Aristeus’s conic sections, required the solution of the following
                    problem, viz. That there existed a temple of a hemispherical form, pierced with
                    j,four equal windows, with such skill that the remainder of the hemisphere might
                    be perfectly squared. With the aid of the new analysis, Leibnitz and James
                    Bernoulli immediate-lydiscovereda solution, whilst thatof Viviani was founded on
                    the ancient geometry. He proved that the problem might be solved by placing,
                    parallel to the base of the hemisphere, two right cylinders, the axes of which
                    should pass through <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203982"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3982-0320"/>the centres of two radii, forming a diameter of
                    the circle of the base, and piercing the dome each way.</p>
                <p>Prior to some of these discussions, the curves called <hi rend="italic"
                    >caustic,</hi> and sometimes <hi rend="italic">Tschirnliausenian,</hi> were
                    discovered by Tschirnhausen. These curves are formed by the crossing of the rays
                    of light, when reflected from a curved surface, or refracted through a lens so
                    as not to meet in a single point. With the assistance of the common geometry,
                    Tschirnhausen discovered that they are equal to straight lines when they are
                    formed by geometrical curves; and he also found out several other curious
                    properties. By the aid of the higher calculus, James Bernoulli extended these
                    researches, and added greatly to the theory of caustics produced by
                    refraction.</p>
                <p>The problem of the paracentric isochronal curve, proposed by Leibnitz in 1689,
                    was solved by James Bernoulli, who took for ordinates parallel straight lines,
                    and for abscissas the chords of an infinite number of concentric circles
                    described about the given point. In this way he obtained a separate equation,
                    constructed at first by the rectification of the elastic curve, and afterwards
                    by the rectification of an algebraic curve. The same problem was solved by John
                    Bernoulli and by Leibnitz.</p>
                <p>In 1694, a branch of the new analysis, called the <hi rend="italic">exponential
                    calculus,</hi> was invented separately by John Bernoulli and by Leibnitz. It
                    consists in differencing and integrating exponential quantities or powers with
                    variable exponents. To Leibnitz the priority in point of invention certainly
                    belongs, but John Bernoulli was the first who published the rules and uses of
                    the calculus.</p>
                <p>The Marquis de l’Hospital, who, in 1695, had solved the problem about the curve
                    of equilibration in draw-bridges, and shown it to be an epicycloid, published in
                    the following year his <hi rend="italic">Analysis of Infinites for the
                    understanding of Czirve Lines.</hi> In this celebrated work, the differential
                    calculus, or the direct method of fluxions, was fully explained and illustrated;
                    and as the knowledge of the higher geometry had been hitherto confined to a few,
                    it was now destined to enlighten the different nations of Europe.</p>
                <p>The methods which were employed by Descartes, Fermat, and others, for finding the
                    maxima and minima of quantities, yielded in point of simplicity and generality
                    to that which was derived from the doctrine of fluxions. Another class of
                    problems, however, of the same kind, but more complicated, from their requiring
                    the inverse method of fluxions, began now to exercise the ingenuity of
                    mathematicians. A problem of this class, for finding the solid of least
                    resistance, was solved by Newton in the thirty-fourth proposition of the second
                    book of his <hi rend="italic">Principia.</hi> After having determined the
                    truncated right cone, which being moved in a fluid by the smallest base (which
                    is unknown), experiences the least resistance, he gave, without any
                    demonstration, the ratio from which might be derived the differential equation
                    of the curve that generates by a revolution of its axis the solid of least
                    resistance. A general solution, however, was still wanting, until the attention
                    of geometers was directed to the subject by John Bernoulli, who proposed, in
                    1697, the celebrated problem of the <hi rend="italic">Brachysto-chronon,</hi> or
                    the curve along the concave side of which if a heavy body descend, it will pass
                    in the least time possible from one point to another, the two points not being
                    in the same vertical line. This problem was resolved by Leibnitz, Newton, the
                    Marquis de l’Hospital, and James Bernoulli, who demonstrated that the curve of
                    quickest descent is a cycloid reversed. This result will appear at first
                    surprising, when we consider a line as the shortest distance between two points;
                    but the surprise will cease, when we reflect, that in a concave curve lying
                    between the two given points, the moving body descends at first in a more
                    vertical direction, and therefore acquires a greater velocity than when it rolls
                    down an inclined plane. It follows that this addition to its velocity, at the
                    commencement of its path, may balance the increase of space through which it has
                    to move.</p>
                <p>At the close of this discussion commenced, between James and John Bernoulli, that
                    celebrated dispute about isoperimetrical problems, in which the qualities of the
                    head were much more conspicuous than those of the heart. These illustrious
                    characters, connected by the strongest ties of affinity, were, at the
                    commencement of their distinguished career, united by the warmest affection.
                    John was initiated by his elder brother into the mathematical sciences; and a
                    generous emulation, softened by friendship in the one, and gratitude in the
                    other, continued for some years to direct their studies, and accelerate their
                    progress. There are few men, however, who can support at the same time the
                    character of a rival and a friend. The success of the one party is apt to awaken
                    the envy of the other, and success itself is often the parent of presumption. A
                    foundation is thus laid for future dissension; and it is a melancholy fact in
                    the history of learning, that the most ardent friendships have been sacrificed
                    on the altar of literary ambition. Such was the case between the two Bernoullis.
                    As soon as John was settled as professor of mathematics at Groningen, all
                    friendly intercourse between the two brothers came to an end. Regarding John as
                    the aggressor, and provoked at the ingratitude which he exhibited, his brother
                    James challenged him by name to solve the following problems :—1. To find,
                    amongst all the isoperimetrical curves between given limits, such a curve that,
                    constructing a second curve, the ordinates of which shall be the functions of
                    the ordinates or arcs of the former, the area of the second curve shall be a
                    maximum or a minimum. 2. To find amongst all the cycloids which a heavy body may
                    describe in its descent from a point to a line, the position of which is given,
                    that cycloid which is described in the least possible time. A prize of fifty
                    florins was promised to John Bernoulli, if, within three months, he engaged to
                    sofve these problems, and publish within a year legitimate solutions of
                    them.</p>
                <p>In a short time John Bernoulli produced his solution, and demanded the prize. He
                    succeeded in constructing the problem of swiftest descent; but his solution of
                    the other problem was radically defective. This failure mortified the vanity
                    with which he gloried in his apparent success. He acknowledged the mistake in
                    his solution, and, with the same imperious tone, transmitted a new result, and
                    re-demanded the prize. This new solution, which was still defective, drew down
                    the wit and ridicule of James Bernoulli, which his brother attempted to repel by
                    a torrent of coarse invective.</p>
                <p>Leibnitz, Newton, and the Marquis de l’Hospital, being appointed arbiters in this
                    dispute, James Bernoulli published, in 1700, the formulae of the isoperimetrical
                    problem, without any demonstration; and John transmitted his solution to the
                    French Academy in February 1701, on condition that it should not be opened till
                    his brother’s demonstrations were published. In consequence of this, James
                    Bernoulli published his solution in May 1701, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Eruditorum,</hi> under the following title, <hi
                    rend="italic">Analysis</hi><hi rend="italic">magni Problematis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Isoperimetrici,</hi> and gained great honour from the skill which
                    it displayed. For five years John Bernoulli was silent upon the subject; but his
                    brother dying in 1705, he published his solution in the Memoirs of the Academy
                    for 1706. About thirteen years afterwards, John Bernoulli having perceived the
                    source of his error, confessed his mistake, and published a new solution, not
                    very different from that of his brother, in the Memoirs of the Academy for
                    1718.</p>
                <p>In the problem relative to the cycloid of swiftest descent, John Bernoulli
                    obtained a result similar to that of his brother, by a very ingenious method,
                    which extended <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203995" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3995-0321"
                    />the bounds of the new analysis. In his investigations he employed the
                    synchronous curve, or that which cuts a series of similar curves placed in
                    similar positions; so that the arcs of the latter included between a given point
                    and the synchronous curve shall be described by a heavy body in equal times. He
                    demonstrated, that of all the cycloids thus intersected, that which is cut
                    perpendicularly is described in less time than any other terminating equally at
                    the synchronous curve. But being unable to give a general solution of the
                    problem, he applied to Leibnitz, who easily resolved it, and at that time
                    invented the method of differencing <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >curva</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">curvam.</hi></p>
                <p>About a month after the death of the Marquis del’Hospital, John Bernoulli
                    declared himself the author of a rule, given by the marquis in his Analysis of
                    Infinites, for finding the value of a fraction the numerator and denominator of
                    which should vanish at the same instant, when the variable quantity that enters
                    into it has a certain given value. The defence made by the marquis’s friends
                    only induced John Bernoulli to make greater demands, till he claimed as his own
                    the most important parts of the Analysis of Infinites. But it does not appear,
                    from an examination of the subject, that there is any foundation for his
                    claims.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of 1704, Sir Isaac Newton published, at the end of his Optics,
                    his <hi rend="italic">Enumeratio</hi><hi rend="italic">Linearum Tertiae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ordinis,</hi> and his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Quadratura Curvarum.</hi> The first of these papers displays great
                    ability, but is founded only on the common algebra, and the doctrine of series
                    which Newton had brought to such perfection. His treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Quadratura Curvarum</hi> contains the resolution of
                    fluxional formulae, with one variable quantity which leads to the quadrature of
                    curves. By means of certain series he obtains the resolution of several
                    complicated formula?, by referring them to such as arc more simple; and these
                    series being interrupted in particular cases, give the fluents in finite terms.
                    From this several interesting propositions are deduced, amongst which is the
                    method of resolving rational fractions. In 1711 Newton published his Method of
                    Fluxions. The object of this work is to determine, by simple algebra, the linear
                    coefficients of an equation that satisfies as many conditions as there are
                    co∙efficients, and to construct a cucve of the parabolic kind passing through
                    any number of given points. Hence arises a simple method of finding the
                    approximate quadrature of curves, in which a certain number of ordinates are
                    determinable. It has been the opinion of some able mathematicians that this
                    treatise contains the first principles of the integral calculus with finite
                    differences, afterwards invented by Dr Taylor. A posthumous work of Newton’s,
                    entitled the Method of Fluxions and of Infinite Series, was Aiblished by Dr
                    Pemberton about nine years after the death of its author; but it does not
                    contain any investigations which may be considered as having accelerated the
                    progress of the new analysis.</p>
                <p>The mathematical sciences were at this time indebted to the labours of Manfredi,
                    Parent, and Saurin. The former of these geometers published a very able work,

                    we are indebted for the problem by which we obtain the ratio between the
                    velocity of the power and the weight, for finding the <hi rend="italic"
                    >maximum</hi> effect of machines; but his reputation was much injured by the
                    obscurity of his writings. Saurin was celebrated for his theoretical and
                    practical knowledge of watchmaking, and he was the first who elucidated the
                    theory of tangents to the multiple points of curves.</p>
                <p>Whilst the science of analysis was thus advancing with rapidity, the dispute
                    between Newton and Leibnitz began to be agitated amongst the mathematicians of
                    Europe, these illustrious rivals seemed to have been hitherto contented with
                    sharing the honour of having invented the fluxionary calculus. But as soon as
                    the priority of invention was attributed to Newton, the friends of Leibnitz came
                    forward with eagerness to support the claims of their master.</p>
                <p>In a small work on the curve of swiftest descent and the solid of least
                    resistance, published in 1699, Nicholas Facio de ʹ Duillier, an eminent Genoese,
                    attributed to Newton the first invention of fluxions, and hinted that Leibnitz,
                    as the second inventor, had borrowed from the English philosopher. Exasperated
                    at this improper insinuation, Leibnitz came forward in his own defence, and
                    appealed to the admission of Newton in his <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi>
                    that neither had borrowed from the other. He expressed his conviction that Facio
                    de Duillier was not authorized by Sir Isaac to prefer such a charge, and he
                    threw himself upon the testimony and candour of the English geometer.</p>
                <p>The discussion rested in this situation for several years, until our celebrated
                    countryman Dr Keill, instigated by an attack upon Newton in the Leipsic Journal,
                    repeated the same charge against Leibnitz. The German philosopher made the same
                    reply as he did to his former opponent, and treated Dr Keill as a young man
                    incapable of judging upon the subject. In 1711 Dr Keill addressed a letter to
                    Sir Hans Sloane, secretary to the Royal Society, and accused Leibnitz of having
                    adopted the differential notation, in order to have it believed that he did not
                    borrow his calculus from the writings of Newton.</p>
                <p>Leibnitz was with reason irritated at this accusation, and called upon the Royal
                    Society to interfere in his behalf. A committee of that learned body was
                    accordingly appointed to investigate the subject, and their report was published
                    in 1712, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Commercium Epistolicum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Analysi</hi><hi rend="italic">promota.</hi> In this report the
                    committee maintain that Leibnitz was not the first inventor, and absolve Dr
                    Keill from all blame in giving the priority of invention to Newton. They were
                    cautious, however, in stating their opin ion upon that part of the charge in
                    which Leibnitz was accused of plagiarism.</p>
                <p>In answer to the arguments advanced in the <hi rend="italic">Commercium
                    Epistolicum,</hi> John Bernoulli, the particular friend of Leibnitz, published a
                    letter, in which he has the assurance to state that the method of fluxions did
                    not precede the differential calculus, but that it might have taken its rise
                    from it. The reason which he assigns for this strange assertion is, that the
                    differential calculus was published before Newton had introduced an uniform
                    algorithm into the method of fluxions. But it may as well be maintained that
                    Newton did not discover the theory of universal‘gravitation, because the
                    attractive force of mountains and of smaller portions of matter was not
                    ascertained until the time of Maskleyne and of Cavendish. The principles of
                    fluxions are allowed to have been discovered before those of the differential
                    calculus; and yet the former originated from the latter, because the fluxionary
                    notation was not given at the same time.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the ridiculous assertion of John Bernoulli, it has been admitted
                    by all the foreign mathematicians that Newton was the first inventor of the
                    method of fluxions. The point at issue, therefore, is merely this:— Did Leibnitz
                    see any of the writings of Newton which contained the principles of fluxions,
                    before he published, in 1684, his <hi rend="italic">Nova</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">minimis?</hi> The friends of Leibnitz
                    have produced some presumptive proofs that he had never seen the treatise of
                    Newton <hi rend="italic">De Analysi,</hi> nor the letter to Collins, in both of
                    which the principles of the new calculus were to be found; and in order to
                    strengthen their argument, they have not scrupled to assert that the writings
                    already mentioned contained but a vague and obscure indication of the method of
                    fluxions, and that Leibnitz might have perused them without having discovered
                    it. This subsidiary argument. however.</p>

                <p>rests upon the opinion of individuals; and the only way of repelling it is to
                    give the opinion of an impartial judge. Montucla, the celebrated historian of
                    the mathematics, who, being a Frenchman, cannot be suspected of partiality to
                    the English, has admitted that Newton, in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De
                    Analysi,</hi> has disclosed, in a very concise and obscure manner, his
                    principles of fluxions, and “that the suspicion of Leibnitz having seen this
                    work is not destitute of probability; for Leibnitz admitted, that in his
                    interview with Collins, he had seen a part of the epistolary correspondence
                    between Newton and that gentleman.” It is evident, therefore, that Leibnitz had
                    opportunities of being acquainted with the doctrine of fluxions before he had
                    thought of the differential calculus; and as he was in London, where Newton’s
                    treatise was published, and in company with the very men to whom the new
                    analysis had been communicated, it is very likely that he then acquired some
                    knowledge of the subject. In favour of Leibnitz, however, it is but justice to
                    say, that the transition from the method of tangents by Dr Barrow to the
                    differential calculus is so simple, that Leibnitz might very easily have
                    perceived it; and that the notation of his analysis, the numerous applications
                    which he made of it, and the perfection to which he carried the integral
                    calculus, are considerable proofs that he was innocent of the charge which the
                    English have attempted to fix upon his memory.</p>
                <p>In 1708, Remond de Montmort published a curious work, entitled the Analysis of
                    Games of Chance, in which the common algebra was applied to the computation of
                    probabilities, and the estimation of chances. Though this work did not contain
                    any great discovery, yet it gave extent to the theory of series, and admirably
                    illustrated the doctrine of combinations. The same subject was afterwards
                    discussed by Μ. Demoivre, a French Protestant residing in England, in a small
                    treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Mensura</hi><hi rend="italic">Sortis,</hi>
                    in which are given the elements of the theory of recurrent series, and some very
                    ingenious applications of it. Another edition was published in English in 1738,
                    under the title of the <hi rend="italic">Doctrine of Chances.</hi></p>
                <p>A short time before his death, Leibnitz proposed to the English geometers the
                    celebrated problem of orthogonal trajectories, which was to find the curve that
                    cuts a series of given curves at a constant angle, or at an angle varying
                    according to a given law. This problem was put into the hands of Sir Isaac
                    Newton when he returned to dinner greatly fatigued, and he brought it to an
                    equation before he went to rest. Leibnitz being recently dead, John Bernoulli
                    assumed his place, and maintained that nothing was easier than to bring the
                    problem to an equation, and that the solution of the problem was not complete
                    until the differential equation of the trajectory was resolved. Nicholas
                    Bernoulli, the son of John, resolved the particular case in which the
                    intersected curves are hyperbolas with the same, centre and the same vertex.
                    James Hermann, and Nicholas Bernoulli, the nephew of John, treated the subject
                    by more general methods, which applied to the cases in which the intersected
                    curves were geometrical. The most complete solution, however, was given by Dr
                    Taylor in the Philosophical Transactions for 1717, though it was not
                    sufficiently general, and could not apply to some cases capable of resolution.
                    This defect was supplied by John Bernoulli, who, in the Leipzig Transactions for
                    1718, published a very simple solution, embracing all the geometrical curves,
                    and a great number of the mechanical ones.</p>
                <p>During these discussions, several difficult problems on the integration of
                    rational fractions were proposed by Dr Taylor, and solved by John Bernoulli.
                    This subject, however, had been first discussed by Roger Cotes, professor of
                    mathematics at Cambridge, who died in 1710. In his posthumous work, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Harmonia Mensurarum,</hi> published in 1716, he gave general and
                    convenient formulae for the integration of rational fractions; and we are
                    indebted to this young geometer for his method of estimating errors in mixed
                    mathematics, for his remarks on the differential method of Newton, and for his
                    celebrated theorem for resolving certain equations.</p>
                <p>In 1715, Dr Taylor published his learned work, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Methodus Incrementorum directa</hi><hi rend="italic">et inversa.</hi> In this
                    work the doctor gives the name of increments or decrements of variable
                    quantities to the differences, whether finite or infinitely small, of two
                    consecutive terms, in a series formed according to a given law. When the
                    differences are infinite« ly small, their calculus belongs to fluxions; but when
                    they are finite, the method of finding their relation to the quantities by which
                    they arc produced forms a new calculus, called the integral calculus of finite
                    differences. In consequence of this work, Dr Taylor was attacked anonymously by
                    John Bernoulli, who lavished upon the English geometer all that dull abuse and
                    angry ridicule which he had formerly heaped upon his brother.</p>
                <p>The problem of reciprocal trajectories was at this time proposed by the
                    Bernoullis. This problem required the curves which, being constructed in two
                    opposite directions in one axis, given in position, and then moving parallel to
                    one another with unequal velocities, should perpetually intersect each other at
                    a given angle. It was long discussed between John Bernoulli and an anonymous
                    writer, who proved to be Dr Pemberton. By an elegant solution of this problem
                    the celebrated Euler first began to be distinguished amongst mathematicians. He
                    was a pupil of John Bernoulli, and continued throughout the whole of his life
                    the friend and rival of his son Daniel. The great object of his labours was to
                    extend the boundaries of analysis; and before he had reached his twenty-first
                    year he published a new and general method of resolving differential equations
                    of the second order, subject to certain conditions.</p>
                <p>The common algebra had been applied by Leibnitz and John Bernoulli to determine
                    arcs of the parabola, the difference of which is an algebraic quantity;
                    imagining that such problems, in the case of the ellipse and hyperbola, resisted
                    the application of the new analysis. The Count de Fagnani, however, applied the
                    integral calculus to the arcs of the ellipsis and hyperbola, and had the honour
                    of explaining this new branch of geometry.</p>
                <p>In the various problems depending upon the analysis of infinites, the great
                    difficulty is to resolve the differential <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    equation to which the problems may be reduced. Count James Riccati having been
                    puzzled with a differential equation of the first order, with two variable
                    quantities, proposed it to mathematicians in the Leipzig Acts for 1725. This
                    question baffled the skill of the most celebrated analysts, who were merely able
                    to point out a number of cases in which the indeterminate can be separated, and
                    the equation resolved by the quadrature of curves.</p>
                <p>Another problem, suggested by that of Viviani, was proposed in 1718 by Ernest Von
                    Offenburg. It was required to pierce a hemispherical vault with any number of
                    elliptical windows, so that their circumferences should be expressed by
                    algebraic quantities; or, in other words, to determine on the surface of a
                    sphere, curves algebraically rectifiable. In a paper on the rectification of
                    spherical epicycloids, Hermann imagined that these curves were algebraically
                    rectifiable, and therefore satisfied the question of Offenburg; but John
                    Bernoulli <hi rend="italic">{Mem. Acad. Par.</hi> 1732) demonstrated, that as
                    the rectification of these curves depended upon the quadrature of the hyperbola,
                    they were only rectifiable in certain cases, and gave the general method of
                    determining the curves which are algebraically rectifiable on the surface of a
                    sphere.</p>
                <p>The same subject was also discussed by Nicoe and by Clairaut <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Menι. Acad.</hi> 1734). The latter of these mathe∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204021" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4021-0323"/>
                <p>maticians had already acquired fame by his <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur les
                    Courbes à double Courbure,</hi> published in 1730, before he was twenty-one
                    years of age; but his reputation was extended by a method of finding curves
                    whose property consists in a certain relation between these branches expressed
                    by a given equation. In this research Clairaut pointed out a species of paradox
                    in the integral calculus, which led to the celebrated theory of particular
                    integrals, which was afterwards fully illustrated by Euler and other
                    geometers.</p>
                <p>The celebrated problem of isochronous curves began at this time to be re-agitated
                    amongst mathematicians. The object of this problem is to find such a curve that
                    a heavy body descending along its concavity shall always reach the lowest point
                    in the same time, from whatever point of the curve it begins to descend. Huygens
                    had already shown that the cycloid was the isochronous curve <hi rend="italic"
                    >in vacuo.</hi> Newton had demonstrated that the same curve was isochronous when
                    the descending body experiences from the air a resistance proportional to its
                    velocity; and Euler and John Bernoulli had separately found the isochronous
                    curve when the resistance was as the square of the velocity. These three cases,
                    and even a fourth in which the resistance was as the square of the velocity
                    added to the product of the velocity by a constant co-efficient, were all
                    resolved by Fontaine, by means of an ingenious and original method; and it is
                    very remarkable that the isochronous curve is the same in the third and fourth
                    cases.' The method of Fontaine was illustrated by Euler, who solved a fifth
                    case, including all the other four, when the resistance is composed of three
                    terms, the square of the velocity, the product of the velocity by a given
                    co-efficient, and a constant quantity. He found also an expression of the time
                    which the body employs to descend through any arc of the curve.</p>
                <p>The application of analytical formulae to the physicomathematical sciences was
                    much facilitated by the algebra of sines and cosines with which Frederick
                    Christian Mayer and Euler enriched geometry. By the combination of arcs, sines,
                    and cosines, formulae are obtained which frequently yield to the method of
                    resolution, and enable us to solve a number of problems which the ordinary use
                    of arcs, sines, and cosines would render tedious and complicated.</p>
                <p>About this time a great discovery in the theory of differential equations of the
                    first order was made separately by Euler, Fontaine, and Clairaut. Hitherto
                    geometers had no direct method of ascertaining if any differential equation were
                    resolvable in the state in which it was presented, or if it required some
                    preparation prior to its resolution. For every differential equation a
                    particular method was employed, and their resolution was often effected by a
                    kind of tentative process, which displayed the ingenuity of its author, without
                    being applicable to other equations. The conditions under which differential
                    equations of the first order arc resolvable were discovered by the three
                    mathematicians whom we have mentioned. Euler made the discovery in 1736, but did
                    not publish it till 1740. Fontaine and Clairaut lighted upon it in 1739, and
                    Euler afterwards extended the discovery to equations of higher orders.</p>
                <p>The first traces of the integral calculus with partial differences appeared in a
                    paper of Euler’s in the Petersburg Transactions for 1734; but D’Alembert, in his
                    work <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les Vents,</hi> has given
                    clearer notions of it, and he was the first who employed it in solution of the
                    problem of vibrating chords proposed by Dr Taylor, and investigated by Euler and
                    Daniel Bernoulli. The object of this calculus is to find a function of several
                    variable quantities when we have the relation of the co-efficients which affect
                    the differentials of the variable quantities of which this function is composed.
                    Euler exhibited it in various points of view, and showed its application to a
                    number of physical problems; and he afterwards, in his paper entitled <hi

                    >conditione,</hi> completely explained the nature and gave the algorithm of the
                    calculus.</p>
                <p>Whilst the analysis of infinites was making such rapid progress on the continent,
                    it was attacked in England by the celebrated Dr Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne, in a
                    work called the Analyst, or a Discourse addressed to an Infidel Mathematician,
                    wherein it is examined whether the object, principles, and inferences of the
                    Modern Analysis are more distinctly conceived than Religious Mysteries and
                    Points of Faith. In this work the doctor admits the truth of the conclusions,
                    but maintains that the principles of fluxions are not founded upon reasoning
                    strictly logical and conclusive. This attack called forth Robins and Maclaurin.
                    The former proved that the principles of fluxions were consistent with the
                    strictest reasoning; whilst Maclaurin, in his Treatise of Fluxions, gave a
                    synthetical demonstration of the principles of the calculus after the manner of
                    the ancient geometricians, and established it with such clearness and
                    satisfaction that no intelligent man could refuse his assent. The differential
                    calculus had been attacked at an earlier period by Nieuwentiet and Rolle, but
                    the weapons wielded by these adversaries were contemptible when compared with
                    the ingenuity of Dr Berkeley.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this attack upon the principles of the new analysis, the science
                    of geometry made rapid advances in England in the hands of Thomas Simpson,
                    Landen, and Waring. In 1740, Mr Simpson published his Treatise on Fluxions,
                    which, besides many original researches, contains a convenient method of
                    resolving differential equations by approximation, and various means of
                    hastening the convergency of slowly converging series. We are indebted to the
                    same geometer for several general theorems for summing different series, whether
                    they are susceptible of an absolute or an approximate summation. His
                    Mathematical Dissertations, published in 1743; his Essays on several Subjects in
                    Mathematics, published in 1740; and his Select Exercises for Young Proficients
                    in the Mathematics, published in 1752, contain ingenious and original
                    researches, which contributed to the progress of geometry.</p>
                <p>In his Mathematical Lucubrations, published in 1755, Mr Landen has given several
                    ingenious theorems for the summation of series; and the Philosophical
                    Transactions for 1775 contain his curious discovery of the rectification of an
                    hyperbolic arc, by means of two arcs of an ellipsis, which was afterwards more
                    simply demonstrated by Legendre. His invention of a new calculus, called the
                    residual analysis, and in some respects subsidiary to the method of fluxions,
                    has immortalized his name. It was announced and explained in a small pamphlet
                    published in 1715, entitled a Discourse concerning the Residual Analysis.</p>
                <p>The progress of geometry in England was accelerated by the labours of Mr Edward
                    Waring, professor of mathematics at Cambridge. His two works entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Meditationes</hi><hi rend="italic">Analyticae,</hi> published in
                    1769, and <hi rend="italic">Meditationes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Algebrai-coe,</hi> and his papers in the Philosophical Transactions on the
                    summation of forces, are filled with original and profound researches into
                    various branches of the common algebra and the higher analysis.</p>
                <p>It was, however, from the genius of Lagrange that the higher calculus received
                    the most brilliant improvements. This great man was born in Piedmont. He
                    afterwards removed to Berlin, and from thence to Paris. In addition to many
                    improvements upon the integral analysis, he enriched geometry with a new
                    calculus called the Method of Variations. The object of this calculus is, when
                    there <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204034" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4034-0324"/>is given
                    an expression or function of two or more variable quantities the relation of
                    which is expressed by a certain law, to find what this function becomes when
                    that law suffers any variation infinitely small, occasioned by the variation of
                    one or more of the terms which express it. This calculus is as much superior to
                    the integral calculus as the integral calculus is to the common algebra. It is
                    the only means by which we can resolve an immense number of problems <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">maximis</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">minimis,</hi> and it is necessary for the solution of the most
                    interesting problems in mechanics. His theory of analytical functions is one of
                    the most brilliant specimens of human genius, In the Memoirs of Berlin for 1772
                    he had touched upon this interesting subject; but the theory was completely
                    developed in 1797, in his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Theorie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Fonctions Analytiques, contenant les principes du calcul
                    différentiel, dégages de toute</hi><hi rend="italic">consideration,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d’in-finiments petits, ou évanouissements, ou des limites, ou
                    des</hi><hi rend="italic">fluxions, et réduits a l’analyse algebraique des
                    quantités finies.</hi> In a great number of memoirs which are to be found in the
                    Memoirs of the Academy of Paris, in those of the Academy of Berlin, and in those
                    of the French Academy, Lagrange has thrown light upon every branch both of the
                    common algebra and of the new analysis.</p>
                <p>The new geometry has likewise been infinitely indebted to the celebrated Μ. de
                    Laplace. His various papers in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Sçavans</hi><hi rend="italic">Etrangers,</hi> and the Memoirs
                    of the French Academy, have added greatly to the higher calculus in all its
                    branches, whilst his application of analysis to the celestial phenomena, as
                    exhibited in the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi rend="italic">Celeste,</hi>
                    and his various discoveries in physical astronomy, entitle him to a high rank
                    amongst the greatest promoters of science.</p>
