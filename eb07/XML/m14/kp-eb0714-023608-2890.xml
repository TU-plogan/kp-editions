                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MANTUA</label>, a delegation of the Austrian kingdom ol
                    Lombardy, within the government of Milan. It is bounded on the south side by the
                    duchies of Modena and Parma, and on all the others by the other provinces of
                    Austrian Italy. It is generally a level district, watered by the river Mincio,
                    which falls into the Po. It extends over 610 square miles, and comprehends one
                    city, fifteen market-towns, some of them very extensive, fifty-seven villages,
                    33,700 houses, and 239,436 inhabitants. Until the year 1705, it had its dukes of
                    the family of Gonzaga. The last of that title, Charles IV., having taken part
                    with the king of France in the war of the Spanish succession, was deposed by the
                    emperor; and as he died soon afterwards without issue, his dominions were
                    granted to the house of Austria. It was in 1797 constituted by Bonaparte a part
                    of the Cisalpine republic, and afterwards formed a division of the province of
                    the Mincio in the kingdom of Italy. The fall of his power in 1814 restored it to
                    the house of Austria. The soil is various, but upon the whole productive,
                    yielding abundance of wine, silk, rice, maize, and some wheat; and in some parts
                    it has abundant pastures, on which much cheese is made from large dairies. It
                    has some manufactures of stuffs, silk, cloth, and leather. The climate in
                    general is moist, and occasions fever, more especially near the junction of the
                    river Mincio with the Po; but in the northern part of the district, where it
                    comes in contact with the lake of Garda, the climate is purer, and fevers are as
                    little known as in any part of Italy.</p>
                <p>The capital of this district is the city of the same name, celebrated as the
                    birth-place of the poet Virgil, and in modern times as one of the strongest
                    fortresses of Europe. To those who approach it, it has much the appearance of
                    Venice, from its lofty towers and magnificent domes, rising, like that city, out
                    of the water by which it is surrounded on all sides. To this peculiarity of
                    position it is mainly indebted for its impregnable strength, since it can only
                    be assailed by gaining possession of the narrow causeways which lead through the
                    lake, and which are defended by powerful outworks, and long fortified bridges.
                    One of these bridges may be more properly considered as a covered way, because
                    it only admits one passage for the water. The bridge leading to St George’s Gate
                    is a masterpiece of workmanship, being 1500 feet in length, and commanding a
                    view over the whole of the city. It requires at least a garrison of 30,000 men
                    to man the several batteries, and has often contained many more than that
                    number. It can only be taken by a long blockade, attended with the consumption
                    of all the provisions and ammunition contained in it. It was taken by the French
                    in 1796, after a blockade of very long duration, in which General Wurmser, the
                    Austrian commander, and his troops, had become exhausted by the united effect of
                    fatigue and starvation. It was retaken by the Austrian general Kray in 1799,
                    after the French garrison and the inhabitants had been nearly starved. In 1801
                    it was given up to the French by the treaty of Campo Formio; but at the peace of
                    1814 it was surrendered to Austria, having then but few troops within it, and no
                    stock of provisions or stores. The interior of the city is large, with broad and
                    regular streets, recently well paved, and a great number of fine old buildings,
                    mostly erected when it was the seat of the ducal sovereign, and contained 50,000
                    inhabitants. The ancient palace, which Bonaparte fitted up and furnished for an
                    imperial residence, is of vast extent, but at present scarcely occupied. The
                    other most remarkable edifices are, the church and library formerly belonging to
                    the Franciscans; the church of the Jesuits, with its lofty astronomical
                    observatory; the Palazzo della Gi-ustizia; the palace called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Te,</hi> from its form like T, with the picture gallery, in which
                    are the best pictures of Julio Romano, and the artists of his school; the
                    university, founded in 1625; and the academy of sciences and arts.</p>
                <p>There are several fine piazzas, the most distinguished of which bears the name of
                    the great poet, Piazza Virgiliana. It was planned by the French; the centre is
                    laid out in gardens; and around them are new and elegant mansions, and at the
                    end is the street Foro Virgiliano, which is terminated by a magnificent
                    triumphal arch, to commemorate the visit of the Emperor Francis in 1825.</p>
                <p>Mantua now contains only 25,000 inhabitants, and one half of the older large
                    houses are unoccupied. The employment of greatest extent is that of making
                    leather, both tanned and curried; and, besides, there are small establishments
                    for making silk goods, twine and cordage, parchment, linens, paper, glass, soap,
                    and barges and boats, to be used on the lakes. Virgil’s birth-place is in the
                    neighbouring village, formerly called Andes, and now Pietola.</p>
