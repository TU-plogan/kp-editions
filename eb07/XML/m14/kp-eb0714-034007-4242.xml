                    Pietro Mazarini, a noble Sicilian, was born at Piscina in the Abbruzzi on the
                    14th of July 1602. Having received the elementary part of his education at Rome,
                    he passed into Spain with the abbé, afterwards cardinal, Jerome Colonna, at the
                    age of seventeen, and, during three years, he attended courses of law in the
                    universities of Alcala and Salamanca. But he soon abandoned jurisprudence in
                    order to embrace the military profession, and in 1625 was sent, with the rank of
                    captain, into the Valteline, where the pontiff then had an army. From this time
                    he began to display his talents for diplomacy. The generals of his Holiness,
                    Conti and de Bagni, sent him successively to the Duke de Feria, general of the
                    Spaniards, and to the Marquis de Coeuvres, afterwards Marshal d’Estrées, who
                    commanded the French troops; and in both missions he acquitted himself in such a
                    manner as to merit the commendations of these chiefs. He then returned to Rome,
                    where he resumed the study of jurisprudence, and took his doctor’s degree. But
                    the disputed succession to the duchies of Mantua and Montferrat having kindled
                    up a new war, he quitted law for diplomacy, in which line nature had peculiarly
                    qualified him to excel. The competitors were the Duke d’c Nevers, whose cause
                    was espoused by the court of France, at which he resided, and the Duke de
                    Guastalla, who was supported by the emperor, the king'o. Spain and the Duke of
                    Savoy. The pope, desirous to prevent<pb break="no" facs="nls:194204255"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-4255-0341"/> a war, of which Italy was about to become the
                    theatre, sent cardinal Sacchetti to Turin to act in favour of the Duke de
                    Nevers, and Mazarin accompanied him in this mission. The talentsofthe latter
                    were very soon appreciated by the cardinal, who confided to him the care of the
                    negotiation. The mediation of the pope was disregarded, the war commenced, and
                    Louis XIII., in person, forced the pass of Susa, which constrained the Duke of
                    Savoy to treat with him and to separate himself from the Spaniards. Sacchetti
                    returned to Rome, leaving to Mazarin the title of in ternuncio, with power to
                    continue the negotiations, and to effect a peace. Cardinal Barbarini, nephew of
                    the pope, having been sent by his uncle in quality of legate to Piedmont,
                    honoured Mazarin with the same confidence which had been reposed in him by
                    Sacchetti; and thus a young man, less than thirty years of age, with a title of
                    little or no importance, was seen interposing with different powers, and
                    treating with all, in order to effect a pacification. With this view he made
                    several journeys, one of which laid the foundation of his fortune. It was at
                    Lyons in 1630 that he first saw Louis XIII., and had a long conference with
                    cardinal Richelieu. The cardinal conceived the highest opinion of him, and
                    feeling that France wanted an able and devoted man in Italy, he succeeded in
                    gaining the young diplomatist, who from this time openly shewed himself
                    favourable to the interests of France. He returned to Italy without having
                    obtained any success in his mission, and the war continued; but the Duke of
                    Savoy having died his son gave his entire confidence to Mazarin, who immediately
                    resumed the work of peace with fresh ardour. The Spaniards were besieging Casal,
                    and the French wished to relieve the place; but by negotiating with the chiefs
                    of both armies he induced them to consent to an armistice for six weeks. When
                    this truce had expired he demanded a prolongation, which the French refused, and
                    at the same time prepared to attack the lines. Mazarin then proposed a treaty,
                    in which they stipulated the hardest conditions. To engage them to relax in
                    their demands, he represented the formidable state of the Spanish army, and the
                    hazard of an attempt to force their entrenchments; but failing to persuade them,
                    he passed over to the Spaniards, reported to them the conditions required by the
                    French, and, still employing the same logic, urged the superiority of the
                    French, and their ardent desire for the combat. This time he succeeded. The
                    Spanish general assented to every thing. Mazarin immediately quitted the Spanish
                    trenches, and riding at full gallop towards the French, regardless of the balls
                    which whistled around him, waved his hat, exclaiming “Peace, peace.” The
                    soldiers repulsed him, crying ont “No peace ;” but he, nevertheless, addressed
                    himself to the marshal de Schomberg, who accepted the treaty, and caused his
                    troops to lay down their arms. This peace was confirmed the following year by
                    the treaty of Cherasco, which was negotiated by Mazarin. About the same time he
                    secured to France the town of Pignerol, having persuaded the Duke of Savoy that
                    he would be indemnified for the sacrifice, and deceived both the Spaniards and
                    imperialists who had only evacuated Casal and Mantua on condition that the
                    French garrison should quit Pignerol. Such conduct excited against him all the
                    hatred of the Spaniards; but it earned for him the acknow-ledgmeqts of Louis
                    XIII. and of Richelieu. This minister wrote to the pope, on the part of his
                    master, to congratulate liis Holiness on the ability displayed by his
                    negotiator. But in a court altogether ecclesiastical, the military habit was no
                    recommendation. In 1632, Mazarin quitted it, and immediately received a
                    benefice, with the office of referendary of the two signatures in the chancery.
                    Richelieu gave instructions to the French ambassador at Rome to obtain for
                    Mazarin an employment which should bring the latter into contact with himself.
                    In 1634 he was appointed vicelegate of Avignon, and before he had quitted Rome
                    to repair to his post, his wishes were fulfilled by an order which he received
                    to proceed to the court of France in the capacity of nuncio extraordinary. The
                    object of this mission was to intercede in favour of the Duke of Lorraine, who
                    had been deprived of his estates by Louis XIII.</p>
                <p>Received with the greatest distinction by Richelieu, who even wished to provide
                    him with lodgings in his own palace, Mazarin neglected no means of preserving
                    the good graces of the king and his minister; and in this he was so successful
                    that Louis XIII. promised to name him for the cardinalate, if he was not
                    anticipated therein by the pope. In 1635, the Spaniards had carried off the
                    elector of Treves, who was under the protection of France. This was the pretext
                    for a war which lasted five and twenty years. Mazarin, as minister of the court
                    of Rome, wished to interpose in an affair which regarded a prelate; but the
                    Spaniards remembered his conduct at Pignerol, and their intrigues with the
                    sovereign pontiff procured his recall to Avignon. They even attempted to get his
                    vice-legation revoked; but he anticipated them, and fearing that he would not be
                    left in oblivion at Avignon, he demanded his recall, and in 1636 returned to
                    Rome, where he openly supported the interests of France. It was he whom
                    Richelieu charged to demand a cardinal’s hat for the famous Père Joseph; but the
                    death of this capuchin put an end to the negociation. Richelieu, who lost a
                    faithful friend and useful confidant, now resolved to replace him by attaching
                    to himself Mazarin, who had already given him so many proofs of devotion; and he
                    engaged Louis XIII. to place on his head the cardinal’s hat which had been given
                    to Père Joseph. This demand hurt Urban VIII., who, though at first favourable to
                    Mazarin, had since allowed himself to be influenced against him by his numerous
                    enemies. But Richelieu had himself made the demand, and he knew not what it was
                    to recede. Mazarin nowattach-ed himself irrevocably to France. Being called by
                    Richelieu, he quitted Italy in the beginning of 1639, and proceeded to join the
                    cardinal. The war, which for so many years desolated Europe, had exhausted the
                    different powers, and all were now desirous of peace. The king of Denmark,
                    Christian IV., offered himself as mediator; and Hamburg was fixed upon as the
                    place for the assembling of their ambassadors. Louis XIII. had cast his eyes
                    upon Mazarin, whom he wished to send to this congress; but the troubles which
                    broke out in Savoy led the king to think that he would be more useful in a
                    country with which he was acquainted; and, accordingly, in the beginning of
                    1640, he was sent thither with the title of ambassador extraordinary. The
                    successes of the Count d’Harcourt in Piedmont enabled him, in December 1641, to
                    conclude a treaty between the Duchess of Savoy and <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi>
                    her brothers-in-law, who, supported by Spain, had disputed with her the
                    guardianship of her son. It was then that Mazarin obtained the hat long since
                    demanded for him; he was included in the nomination of the 16th December 1641,
                    and on the 25 th of February 1642 he received the cap from the hands of Louis
                    XIII. The intrigues which had pursued Richelieu during his whole life assumed
                    fresh force towards its close; but these did not prevent Mazarin from remaining
                    faithful towards his protector, to whom he rendered especial service, when the
                    discovery of the conspiracy of the fifth of March re-established his credit and
                    authority. This minister on his death-bed recommended him warmly to the king;
                    and if Mazarin did not succeed him in his title he was really first minister of
                    Louis XIII., since he had the direction of all affairs of state. Richelieu had
                    governed by terror; but Mazarin was not of a character to employ similar means,
                    and preferred to make himself friends. It was at his request that Marshal de
                    Bassompierre, Marshal de Vitry, andmany other victims of thelastministerwere
                    released from the Bastille. He also recalled several exiled members of
                    parliament, and contributed to the reconciliation of the Duke d’Orleans with the
                    king.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204268" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4268-0342"/>
                <p>On the 14th of May 1643 Louis XIII., whose health had for some time been
                    declining, terminated his melancholy existence. We cannot enter into any details
                    of the events that followed, and for an account of which we must refer the
                    reader to the memoirs and histories of the period. It is sufficient to state
                    that, during the minority of Louis XIV. and the regency of Anne of Austria, the
                    administration of affairs was entirely in the hands of Mazarin. The commencement
                    of his sway was attended with the happiest success; and the advantages gained by
                    the king’s armies secured to the cardinal the applause of the nation. But these
                    favourable dispositions were soon succeeded by the murmurs, not loud but deep,
                    of an oppressed people, and also by a combination of the high nobility who were
                    jealous of his advancement and power. The civil wars of 1649, 1650, 1651, and
                    1652, followed; and as the dissatisfaction daily became more general, it was at
                    length insisted on that he should be dismissed from the royal presence. Mazarin,
                    who knew when to yield as well as how to resist, demanded permission to retire,
                    and immediately withdrew from the kingdom. But such was the singular fortune of
                    the man, that this event may be considered as one of the incidents which mainly
                    contributed to his greatness. Decree upon decree was fulminated against him; his
                    fine library was sold; and a price was even put upon his head; yet, in spite of
                    all the rage of his enemies, he was enabled to return to court with greater
                    power than ever; and so mutable is popular opinion that many who had formerly
                    been his bitterest enemies now became his warmest friends. After this he was
                    instrumental in rendering the state some important services. He put an end to
                    the war between France and Spain, and, in order to consolidate the peace he had
                    re-established, negotiated a marriage between the king and the infanta, which
                    was celebrated at Sant-Jean-de-Luz on the 9th of June 1660. But the cardinal’s
                    glass was now nearly run. His continual application to business brought on a
                    dangerous illness, which terminated his existence at Vincennes on the 9th of
                    March 1661, in the fifty-ninth year of his age. Mazarin, like most ministers,
                    was but little regretted. A courtier writing at the time, says, “Le roi est, ou
                    parait, le seul touche de la mort du cardinal.” He had accumulated immense
                    wealth by very doubtful or equivocal means. His fortune is said to have amounted
                    to near eight millions sterling, all acquired in a period of external war or of
                    internal commotion. On the approach of death he began to feel some scruples of
                    conscience on the subject, but observed that he had nothing except what the
                    bounty of the king had conferred on him. His confessor, however, plainly told
                    him that he must distinguish between what he had actually received from the king
                    and what he had taken at his own hand; and that, in regard to the latter,
                    restitution was indispensable to salvation. In this dilemma Colbert counselled
                    him to give up all his property to the king, which he did by an act dated a few
                    days before his death; but the king, as had no doubt been foreseen, declined the
                    proposed donation, and the cardinal’s conscience was, we presume, satisfied.</p>
                <p>The only productions of Mazarin which have been published are his letters. Of
                    these, thirty-six, written by him whilst negotiating of the peace of the
                    Pyrenees, made their appearance in the year 1690; and seventy-seven more on the
                    same subject were published in 1693. The whole were collected and re-printed at
                    Amsterdam, in two volumes, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Négociations</hi><hi rend="italic">Secretes des Pyrenees·</hi> These letters
                    are not arranged in the order of their dates; but this error was corrected in a
                    later edition, for which we are indebted to the care of the Abbé Allainval, and
                    the value of which is still further enhanced from its being augmented by fifty
                    letters never before published. This work is entitled, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">du Cardinal Mazarin,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    letters have been found in an original collection which is preserved in the
                    royal library at Paris. Mazarin wrote a relation of the conferences for the
                    instruction of the king, and with the intention of accustoming him to affairs,
                    and there exist no better diplomatic lessons; for what passed in the conferences
                    is there unfolded with a clearness and precision which in some sort place the
                    reader <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">tiers</hi> with the two
                    plenipotentiaries. In 1663, there was published at Cologne a <hi rend="italic"

                    work, like so many other romances of the same kind, is undeserving of attention.
                    Another political testament of Mazarin appeared under the title of <hi

                    French writer, “est assez bon dans son espece diabolique.” Much more besides
                    hasbeen written concerning Mazarin, and in regard to his ministry, which
                    embraces nearly twenty years of the history of France. Count Galeazzo Gualdo
                    Priorato is authorof aliis-tory of Cardinal Mazarin, translated into French,
                    Paris, 1688, in two vols. 12mo, but which is not always exact. Another work of
                    the same kind by one Aubery, author of a great number of mediocre productions,
                    professed to give an account of Mazarin from his birth till his death; it was
                    originally printed at Paris in 1688 and 1695, in two vols. 12mo. The history of
                    the ministry of Cardinal Mazarin from 1643 to 1652, by a clergyman, is an able
                    work, but has more reference to the history of France during the period in
                    question, than to that of Mazarin in particular. One of the best apologies which
                    has yet appeared for the conduct of this minister is contained in the work of
                    Jean de Silhou, councillor of state, which was published in 1650, under the tide
                    of <hi rend="italic">Eclaircissements sur quelques difficultés touchant</hi><hi

                    Richelieu,</hi> and deserves to be consulted by every student of French history.
                    The Cardinal was the object of innumerable satires directed against him by the
                    Fronde, particularly during the year 1669; but, on the other hand, amongst his
                    most servile flatterers we find the great Corneille, who, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mort de Pompée,</hi> calls him “homme au-dessus de ľhomme.”</p>
                <p>The character of Mazarin has been compared, or rather contrasted with that of
                    Richelieu, and variously shaded according to the opinions and predilections of
                    those by whom it is delineated. “Cardinal Mazarin,” says President Hénault, “was
                    as gentle as Cardinal Richelieu was violent; one of his greatest talents
                    consisted in knowing men thoroughly. The character of his policy was rather
                    finesse and prudence than force....This minister thought that force should never
                    be employed but in default of other means; and his mind supplied the courage
                    required by circumstances; bold at Cassai, tranquil and active in his retreat at
                    Cologne; enterprising when it was necessary to cause the princes to be arrested,
                    but insensible to the pleasantries of the Fronde; despising the bravadoes of the
                    coadjutor, De Retz,and listening to the murmurs of the people as one listens on
                    the shore to the noise of the waves of the sea. There was in Cardinal Richelieu
                    something greater, vaster, and less composed; in Cardinal Mazarin, more address,
                    more management, and fewer extravagances. People hated the one and derided the
                    other; but both were masters of the state.” The parallel between these two great
                    men has been attempted by several writers, and some have placed Mazarin above
                    the minister who had the merit of distinguishing him amongst the crowd. That
                    which Voltaire has traced in the seventh canto of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Henriade</hi> is more just, but incomplete. Gaillard gives the preference to
                    Mazarin. “If we inquire,” says he, “of what use they have been to the world, we
                    shall find that it is unquestionably better to have allayed disorders than to
                    have occasioned them; that it is better to have terminated a war <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194204281" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4281-0343"/>of thirty years, than to have
                    maintained and kept it alive. The peace of Westphalia and that of the Pyrenees
                    are two epochs which place Mazarin above Richelieu and the greatest ministers.
                    These monuments of peace far outweigh the honour of having invented means that
                    were new, or revived means that were old, for disturbing Europe.” Bussy, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> has preserved a portrait of Mazarin: “Never
                    man,” says he, “had so fortunate a birth as his. He was born a Roman gentleman;
                    and he had studied in the university of Salamanca, where, having one day had his
                    horoscope cast, he had been assured that he would be pope. He had the finest
                    physiognomy in the world; the eyes and the mouth beautiful, the forehead large,
                    the nose well proportioned, and the visage open. He had much wit; no one related
                    a story or anecdote more agreeably. He was insinuating, and was sure to be loved
                    by those whom he took the trouble to please. He excelled in all games of skill
                    and address.” Insensible to the pamphlets which were daily discharged against
                    him, he usually observed when any one of them was mentioned, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laissons parler et faisons.</hi> Indifferent about an opposition, which exhaled
                    in satirical couplets, <hi rend="italic">“Qu’ils</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cantent,</hi><hi rend="italic">ces Français,”</hi> said he, “<hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">payent”</hi> Of all the pieces directed against him, the only one
                    which appears to have given any annoyance was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mazarinadeoĩ</hi> Scarron,who in consequence lost his pension of 1500 livres,
                    which had been bestowed upon him by the minister whom he sought to render
                    ridiculous. But he did not neglect men of letters, and charged Menage to furnish
                    him with a list of those who deserved rewards or encouragement. The arts were
                    also the object of his protection; and it is well known that he introduced the
                    opera into France. As a statesman, he belonged almost entirely to the Italian
                    school, themaxims of which he had early imbibed; he trusted chiefly to his
                    knowledge of men, and the dexterous employment of those arts by which that
                    knowledge may be made effectual; his policy was too subtle and refined to
                    impress a common observer with a just conception of its real quality; and as to
                    his ambition, it had nothing of that high-reaching and aspiring character, which
                    dignified even the aberrations of Richelieu, and was too nearly allied to
                    avarice to command general respect. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
