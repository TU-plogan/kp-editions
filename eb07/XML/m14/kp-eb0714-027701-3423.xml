                <p><label type="entry">MASKELYNE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Nevil</hi></label>, a most
                    industrious and accurate astronomer, born in London on the 6th of October 1732,
                    was the son of Mr Edmund Maskelyne, a gentleman of respectable family in
                    Wiltshire.</p>
                <p>At the age of nine he was sent to Westminster School, and continued to apply with
                    diligence to the usual pursuits of that place, until the occurrence of the great
                    solar eclipse of 1748, which made a strong impression on his mind, and was the
                    immediate cause of his directing his attention to astronomy, and beginning with
                    great ardour the study of the mathematics, as subservient to that of astronomy.
                    It is remarkable, that the same eclipse is said to have made an astronomer of
                    Lalande, who was only three months older than Maskclyne. He soon afterwards
                    entered as a member of Catherine Hall, Cambridge, but in a short time removed to
                    Trinity. He took a degree as bachelor of arts with great credit in 1754, and
                    proceeded regularly afterwards through the succeeding stages of academical rank
                    in divinity. He was ordained in 1755 to a curacy at Barnet, and the next year he
                    obtained a fellowship at Trinity. In 1758 he was elected a fellow of the Royal
                    Society; having previously become intimate with Dr Bradley, and determined to
                    make astronomy the principal pursuit of his life, feeling its perfect
                    compatibility with an enlightened devotion to the duties of his own
                    profession.</p>
                <p>In 1761 he was engaged by the Royal Society to undertake a voyage to St Helena,
                    in order to observe the transit of Venus. He remained ten months in that island,
                    but the weather prevented his observing the transit to advantage; and the faulty
                    attachment of the plumb-line of his quadrant, which was of the construction then
                    usually employed, rendered his observations on the stars less conclusive with
                    respect to annual parallax than he had expected. His voyage was, however, of
                    great use to navigation, by promoting the introduction of lunar observations for
                    ascertaining the longitude; and he taught the officers of the ship which
                    conveyed him the proper use of the instruments, as well as the mode of making
                    the computations.</p>
                <p>He performed a second voyage, in 1763, to the island of Barbadoes, in order to
                    determine the rates of Harrison’s watches, and also to make experiments with
                    Irwin’s marine chair, on board of the Princess Louisa, Admiral Tyrrel, acting at
                    the same time as chaplain to the ship. The chair he found of very little use for
                    observing the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites; and the maker of the
                    chronometers was not satisfied with his report of their performance, fancying
                    that he was too partial to the exclusive employment of lunar observations for
                    determining the longitude. The liberality of the British government, however,
                    bestowed on Harrison the whole reward that he claimed; and Maskelyne having been
                    appointed to the situation of astronomer-royal, and having thus become a member
                    of the Board of Longitude, was extremely active in obtaining a few thousand
                    pounds for the family of Professor Mayer, who had computed lunar tables, and a
                    compliment of L.300 for Euler, whose theorems had been employed in the
                    investigation.</p>
                <p>The merits of Mayer’s tables Jiaving been fully established, the Board of
                    Longitude was induced to promote their application to practical purposes, by the
                    annual publication of the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac,</hi> which was
                    arranged and conducted entirely under Maskelyne’s direction for the remainder of
                    his life. He was also actively employed, without any other motive than the love
                    of science and of his country, in almost every decision which was required of
                    the Board of Longitude; and he had to give his opinion of the merits of an
                    infinite number of fruitless projects which were continually submitted to his
                    judgment. He must of course have made many enemies amongst the weak and
                    illiberal; but the universal impartiality and the general accuracy of his
                    determinations were acknowledged by all candid persons; and it must be admitted
                    that the longitudinary speculators of Great Britain do in general submit to
                    discouraging remarks from persons in authority, with wonderful fortitude and
                    with great personal civility.</p>
                <p>During the forty-seven years that he held the situation of astronomer-royal, he
                    acquired the respect of all Europe by the diligence and accuracy of his
                    observations, which he never neglected to conduct in person whenever it was in
                    his power, and he required only one assistant. The French had a handsome
                    building to amuse the public by its exterior magnificence; but the establishment
                    of the observers was never arranged in so methodical a manner as that of the
                    English National Observatory, and the fruits of their labours were never
                    systematically made public, the attempt which was once made by Lemonnier, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">Celeste,</hi> having been
                    interrupted and discontinued. Dr Maskelvne, on the other hand, obtained leave
                    from the British government to have his observations printed at the public
                    expense, under the direction of the Royal Society, who are the legal visitors of
                    the observatory, appointed by the king’s sign manual. The early observations of
                    Flamsteed and of Bradley were considered as private property. Flamsteed
                    published his own, and Bradley’s were very liberally bought of his family, and
                    afterwards printed by the University of Oxford, who are still as liberal in
                    bestowing them where they are likely to be employed for the benefit of science.
                    Flamsteed was the astronomer-royal from 1690 to 1720, then Halley to 1750,
                    Bradley to 1762, and Bliss to 1765, when Maskelyne was appointed. He took his
                    doctor’s degree in the year 1777.</p>
                <p>He made several improvements in the arrangement and employment of the
                    instruments, particularly by enlarging the slits through which the light was
                    admitted; by making <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203436"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3436-0278"/>the eye-glass of his transit telescope moveable to
                    the place of each of the wires of the micrometer; and, above all, by marking the
                    time to tenths of a second, which had never been attempted before, but which he
                    found it practicable to effect with surprising accuracy, as the comparison of
                    the observations at the different wires sufficiently demonstrated.</p>
                <p>The object of his expedition to Shehallien is well known. Bouguer had made an
                    unsuccessful attempt to measure the attraction of a mountain in South America,
                    and had been obliged to conclude that the mountain was hollow, in consequence of
                    the eruption of a volcano, the attraction being too little sensible. Dr
                    Maskelyne’s results, on the other hand, as computed by Dr Hutton, made the
                    mountain more dense than could well have been expected; but those who are
                    acquainted with the difficulty of executing astronomical measurements without an
                    error of a single second of space, will be ready to allow that the deviation of
                    5" or 6", attributed to the effect of the mountain, is liable to a much greater
                    proportional uncertainty than the results obtained by Mr Cavendish with the
                    apparatus invented by Mr Michell. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Cavendish.)</hi> The
                    geodesical operations which were soon afterwards performed with his concurrence
                    and assistance, for determining the relative situations of Greenwich and Paris,
                    were equally creditable to the English artists who constructed the instruments,
                    and to the astronomers and geographers who made the observations with them; and,
                    even by the confession of their rivals, they excelled every thing that had ever
                    been effected in former measurements of the same kind.</p>
                <p>As no man had done more for practical astronomy than Dr Maskelyne, so there was
                    none whose merits were more justly appreciated. He made every astronomer his
                    friend, as well by his personal kindness as by his professional labours; and he
                    obtained the rare distinction of being made one of the eight foreign associates
                    of the French Academy of Sciences. His example and encouragement contributed to
                    the establishment of several private observatories, which must always be, if not
                    immediately, at least remotely, beneficial to astronomy, as tending to promote
                    the improvement of instruments, and of the methods of employing them.</p>
                <p>He was modest, and somewhat timid, in receiving the visits of strangers; but his
                    usual conversation was cheerful, and often playful, with a fondness for point
                    and for classical allusion. He inherited a good paternal property, and he
                    obtained considerable preferment from his college; he also married, somewhat
                    late in life, the sister and coheiress of Lady Booth of Northamptonshire. His
                    sister was the wife of Robert Lord Clive, and the mother of the Earl of Powis.
                    He died on the 9th of February 1811, in his seventy-ninth year, leaving a widow
                    and an only daughter.</p>
                <p>1. Dr Maskelyne’s first communication to the Royal Society is a Proposal for
                    discovering the Annual Parallax of Sirius. <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans,</hi>
                    li. 1760, p. 889.) It is founded on Lacaille’s observations made at the Cape of
                    Good Hope, which appeared to indicate a maximum amounting to 8 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi>. 2. A Theorem for Spherical Aberration (lii. 1761, p.
                    17), dated from the Prince Henry, St Helen’s Roads, the calculation being
                    adapted to the object-glasses of achromatic telescopes. 3. The next article (p.
                    21) is a letter from Lacaille, recommending that he should make observations at
                    St Helena on the lunar parallax, and remain some time in the island for that
                    purpose, and promising, on his own part, to make corresponding observations. It
                    is followed by a letter from Maskelyne, proposing some additional joint
                    observations. 4. Observation of the Transit of 1761 (p. 196). The sun was lower
                    than had been expected, and the instant of contact uncertain, from a tremulous
                    motion in the apparent discs. 5. Observations on a Clock of Shelton, 1762 (p.
                    434); giving the proportion of ∙99754 to 1 for the comparative force of gravity
                    at Greenwich and at St Helena. 6. A Letter on the Mode of observing and
                    computing Lunar Distances (p. 558); dated from St Helena: the first
                    demonstration of the practicability and utility of the method. He found the
                    error of observation not to exceed half a degree of longitude, an error which
                    was very strangely suffered to remain as a fair allowance for the uncertainty of
                    observation, in the acts for encouraging the perfection of the lunar tables,
                    only recently repealed. 7. On the Tides at St Helena (p. 586); observations made
                    in a harbour, for about two months. 8. Note to Lalande (p. 607), on lunar
                    distances and occultations. 9. Rules for correcting Lunar Distances <hi
                    rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.</hi> 1764, p. 263); a demonstration of the rules
                    before published in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> and in the <hi
                    rend="italic">British Mariners Guide.</hi> 10. Remarks on the Equation of Time
                    (p. 336); correcting a mistake of Lacaille and an inadvertence of Lalande, and
                    giving a formula, which, though not geometrically perfect, is abundantly
                    accurate for all practical purposes. 11. Astronomical Observations made at St
                    Helena (p. 348). The observations for determining the lunar parallax were too
                    few to afford a satisfactory result. The author suggests that the figure of the
                    earth might be ascertained by repeated and comparative observations of the
                    apparent distance of the moon from neighbouring stars. 12. Observations made at
                    Barbadoes (p. 189), especially on Jupiter’s satellites. 13. Introduction to two
                    Papers of Mr Smeaton (lviii. 1768, p. 154); the one on the menstrual parallax,
                    the other on observing stars out of the meridian. 14. Introduction to the
                    Observations of Mason and Dixon (p. 270). 15. Conclusion respecting the Length
                    of a Degree (p. 323, 325). Mr Charles Mason had been sent with Mr Dixon to
                    observe the transit of 1761, at Bencoolen; but. their voyage was interrupted by
                    accidental circumstances, and they made their observations at the Cape of Good
                    Hope, with tolerable success. They then proceeded to join Maskelyne at St
                    Helena, and to assist in his operations there. They were afterwards engaged by
                    Lord Baltimore and Mr Penn, to determine the boundaries between Maryland and
                    Pennsylvania; and having completed their survey, they suggested to the council
                    of the Royal Society the eligibility of measuring a degree in the country
                    bordering on the Delaware and the Chesapeake. Their proposals were readily
                    accepted, and the results of their measurement are here recorded. Dr Maskelyne
                    afterwards employed Mason in his operations on Shehallien, in computing
                    Bradley’s observations, and in improving Mayer’s tables, by a comparison with
                    them; but he was so fearful of admitting any empirical corrections, not founded
                    on the most general principles, that he would not allow some of the equations
                    discovered by Mason to be introduced into the computation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nautical Almanac,</hi> until Μ. de Laplace had proved their
                    dependence on the theory of gravity. Lalande tells us, that Mason was
                    dissatisfied because he did not receive a public reward for the success of his
                    labours; but he was, in fact, little more than the agent of Maskelyne, and of
                    the Board of Longitude; and he was fairly repaid for the time and labour which
                    his computations had required. Delambre says, that he died in Pennsylvania in
                    1787. Dixon is said to have been born in a coal mine, and to have died at Durham
                    in 1777. 15. Postscript respecting French and English Measures (p. 325). The
                    result of this comparison agrees admirably well with the later measurement of
                    Pictet, Prony, and Captain Kater. 16. Observation of the Transit of 1769, made
                    at the Royal Observatory (p. 355). 17. Eclipses and Occultations, 1769 (p. 399),
                    chiefly for the longitude of Glasgow. 18. On the Use of Dolland’s Micrometer,
                    1771 (p. 536). On the application of the divided object-glass micrometer to
                    determining differences of right ascension and of declination, especially in the
                    case of transits; a part of the instructions sent with the observers to the
                    South <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203449" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3449-0279"/>Seas.
                    19. On the Adjustment of Hadley’s Quadrant, 1772, p. 99; especially for the back
                    observation, and to insure the parallelism of the glasses. 20. Deluc’s Rule for
                    Measuring Heights, 1774 (p. 158); adapted to English measures, and rendered
                    somewhat more convenient. 21. Observations at Greenwich and in America compared
                    (p, 184, 190). 22. Proposal for Measuring the Attraction of a Hill, 1775 (p.
                    495); read in 1772. 23. Observations made on Shehaìlien (p. 500); a paper which
                    obtained its author the honour of a Copleian medal. Mason had been sent to
                    examine the hills of Scotland, and had recommended Shehal-líen; the funds were
                    supplied by the remainder of the royal grant for observing the transit of Venus.
                    Mr Reuben Burrow and Mr Menzies were principally employed in assisting the
                    astronomer-royal in his observations and surveys; and Dr Hutton afterwards made
                    the necessary computations for determining the attraction of the mountain. 24.
                    Description of a Prismatic Micrometer, 1777, (p. 799), consisting of one or more
                    prisms sliding in the axis of the telescope, and resembling in its operation
                    that of Rochon, which has in great measure superseded it. 25. On the Longitude
                    of Cork, 1779 (p. 179); observations for correcting the computed times of the
                    eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites. 26. On the Comet expected in 1789 <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi> 1786, p. 426); supposing those of 1532 and 1661
                    to he the same. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechain.)</hi> 27. On the Latitude,
                    and Longitude of Greenwich, 1787 (p. 151); with Cassini’s Memoir on its
                    uncertainty, which he states as amounting to 11" in longitude, and 15" in
                    latitude. Dr Maskelyne, however, shows that it is confined within much narrower
                    limits, though he approves of the object of the memoir in promoting a survey.
                    28. On a Difficulty in the Theory of Vision, 1789 (p. 256). This paper
                    sufficiently proves that Euler was mistaken in thinking the eye achromatic; and
                    that any appearance of colour which it could produce, according to the common
                    laws of refraction, would be imperceptible in ordinary circumstances. But that
                    there are circumstances under which such appearances may be observed, was
                    afterwards shown by Dr Young and Dr Wollaston. 29. Account of an Appearance of
                    Light on the Dark Part of the Moon, 1793 (p. 429); seen by Mr Wilkins, and by a
                    servant of Sir George Booth, and supposed to have arisen from a volcano. 30.
                    Observations of the Comet of 1793 <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.</hi> 1794, p.
                    55); discovered by the Rev. E. Gregory of Langar, in Nottinghamshire.</p>
                <p>31. The earliest of Maskelyne’s separate publications was the British Mariner’s
                    Guide, London, 1763, 4to; a small volume, which has become scarce, having been
                    superseded by later works.</p>
                <p>32. The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for 1767 appeared in 1766;
                    and the publication has been regularly continued upon the same plan to the
                    present time, by the computers and comparers whom Dr Maskelyne had trained by
                    his instruction and example. His successor in the observatory, though admirably
                    qualified to equal, and perhaps to excel him in the practical department, had it
                    not in his power to devote so much of his attention to the publication as Dr
                    Maskelyne’s paternal affection for a child of his own had induced him to bestow
                    on it; and the Board of Longitude was very liberally furnished by government
                    with the means of obtaining some further assistance to supply his place.</p>
                <p>33. Tables requisite to be used with the Nautical Almanac, London, 1766, 1783,
                    1802, 8vo; now partly superseded by Professor Lax’s new edition.</p>
                <p>34. The volume of Selections, from the additions that have been occasionally made
                    to the Nautical Almanac, London, 1812, 8vo, contains several papers of Dr
                    Maskelyne; for example, Instructions relating to the Transit of Venus in 1769,
                    N. A. 1769; Elements of Lunar Tables, and Remarks on Hadley’s Quadrant, N. A.
                    1774; Advertisement of the Comet expected in 1788, N. A. 1791; and on the
                    Disappearance of Saturn’s Ring in 1780, N. A∙ 1791.</p>
                <p>35. The Astronomical Observations made at Greenwich, from 1765 to 1811, were
                    published annually in folio, making three volumes, and part of a fourth, London,
                    1774. They are allowed to constitute the most perfect body of astronomy in
                    detail that was ever presented to the public. The first volume contains a
                    variety of useful tables, accompanying the observations for 1772, and
                    principally serving for the correction of the places of the stars, and for
                    facilitating the solution of other astronomical problems. Many of them have been
                    reprinted in Vince’s <hi rend="italic">Astronomy,</hi> but, in some cases,
                    without the necessary explanations.</p>
