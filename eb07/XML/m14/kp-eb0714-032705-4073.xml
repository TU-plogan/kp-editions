                    academician, was born at St Malo in the year 1698, and privately educated there
                    until he attained the age of sixteen, when he was placed under the celebrated
                    professor of philosophy Μ. le Blond, in the college of La Marche, at Paris. He
                    soon discovered a passion for mathematical studies, and particularly for
                    geometry. In his early years he likewise practised instrumental music with great
                    success, but fixed on no profession till he was twenty, when he entered into the
                    army. He first served in the Gray Musqueteers; but, in the year 1720, his father
                    purchased for him a company of cavalry in the regiment of La Rocheguyon. He
                    remained only five years in the army, during which time he pursued his
                    mathematical studies with great vigour; and it was soon remarked by Fréret and
                    other academicians, that nothing but geometry could satisfy his active soul and
                    unbounded thirst for knowledge. In the year 1723 he was received into the Royal
                    Academy of Sciences, and read his first performance, which was a memoir upon the
                    construction and form of musical instruments (15th November 1724). During the
                    first years of his admission, he did not wholly confine his attention to
                    mathematics; he dipped into natural philosophy, and discovered great knowledge
                    and dexterity in observations and experiments upon animals. If the custom of
                    travelling into remote climates, like the sages of antiquity, in order to be
                    initiated into the learned mysteries, had still subsisted, no one would have
                    conformed to it with greater eagerness than Μ. de Maupertuis. His first
                    gratification of this passion was to visit the country which had given birth to
                    Newton; and during his residence at London he became as zealous an admirer and
                    follower of that philosopher as any one of his own countrymen. His next
                    excursion was to Basil in Switzerland, where he formed a friendship with John
                    Bernoulli and his family, which continued till his death. At his return to
                    Paris, he applied himself to his favourite studies with greater zeal than ever.
                    To ascertain how well he fulfilled the duties of an academician, it is only
                    necessary to run over the Memoirs of the Academy from the year 1724 to 1736, in
                    which it appears that he was neither idle nor occupied by objects of small
                    importance. The most sublime questions in geometry and the relative sciences
                    received <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204086" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4086-0328"/>from
                    his bands that elegance, clearness, and precision, so remarkable in all his
                    writings. In the year 1736 he was sent by the king of France to the polar circle
                    to measure a degree of latitude, in order to ascertain the figure of the earth,
                    accompanied by MM. Clairaut, Camus, Le Monnier, the Abbé Outhier, and Celsius
                    the celebrated professor of astronomy at Upsal. This distinction rendered him so
                    famous, that at his return he was admitted <hi rend="italic">a</hi> member of
                    almost every academy in Europe.</p>
                <p>In the year 1740 Maupertuis received an invitation from the king of Prussia to go
                    to Berlin, which was too flattering to be refused. His rank amongst men of
                    letters had not wholly effaced his love for his first profession, namely, that
                    of arms. He followed his Prussian majesty into the field, and was a witness of
                    the dispositions and operations which preceded the battle of Mollwitz; but he
                    was deprived of the glory of being present when victory declared in favour of
                    his royal patron, by a singular kind of adventure. His horse having, during the
                    heat of the action, run away with him, he fell into the hands of the enemy, and
                    was at first but roughly treated by the Austrian soldiers, to whom he could not
                    make himself known, from ignorance of their language; but being carried prisoner
                    to Vienna, he received such honours from their imperial majesties as were never
                    effaced from his memory. From Vienna he returned to Berlin; but as the reform of
                    the academy which the king of Prussia then meditated was not yet mature, he went
                    back to Paris, where his affairs called him, and was in 1742 chosen director of
                    the Academy of Sciences. In 1753 he was received into the French Academy, which
                    was the first instance of the same person being at the same time a member of
                    both the academies at Paris. Μ. de Maupertuis again assumed the character of a
                    soldier at the siege of Friburg, and was pitched upon by Marshal Cogny and the
                    Count d’Argenson to carry the news to the French king of the surrender of that
                    citadel.</p>
                <p>He returned to Berlin in the year 1744, when, by the good offices of the
                    queen-mother, a marriage was negotiated and brought about between him and
                    Mademoiselle de Borck, a lady of great beauty and merit, and nearly related to
                    Μ. de Borck, at that time minister of state. This determined him to settle at
                    Berlin, as he was extremely attached to his new spouse, and regarded this
                    alliance as the most fortunate circumstance of his life.</p>
                <p>In the year 1746, Μ. de Maupertuis was declared by his Prussian majesty president
                    of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and soon afterwards was honoured
                    with the order of Merit. However, all these accumulated honours and advantages,
                    so far from lessening his ardour for the sciences, seemed to furnish new
                    allurements to labour and application. Not a day passed but he produced some new
                    project or essay for the advancement of knowledge. Nor did he confine himself
                    solely to mathematical studies. Metaphysics, chemistry, botany, polite
                    literature, all shared his attention, and contributed to his fame. At the same
                    time he had, it seems, a strange inquietude of spirit, with a morose temper,
                    which rendered him miserable amidst honours and pleasures. Such a temperament
                    did not promise a very pacific life, and in fact he was engaged in several
                    quarrels. He had a dispute with Koenig the professor of philosophy at Franeker,
                    and another of a more serious kin⅛l with Voltaire. Maupertuis had inserted in
                    the volume of Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin for 1746, a discourse upon the
                    laws of motion, which Koenig was not content with attacking, but attributed to
                    Leibnitz. Maupertuis, stung with the imputation of plagiarism, engaged the
                    academy of Berlin to call upon him for his proof, which Koenig failed to
                    produce, and was in consequence struck off the academy, of which he was a
                    member. Several pamphlets appeared on the subject; and Voltaire, for some reason
                    or other, took part against Maupertuis.</p>
                <p>This is the more unaccountable, because Maupertuis and Voltaire were apparently
                    upon the most amicable terms; and the latter respected the former as his master
                    in the mathematics. Voltaire, however, exerted all his wit and satire against
                    him; and, upon the whole, he was so much transported beyond what was thought
                    right, that he found it expedient in 1753 to quit the court of Prussia.</p>
                <p>Maupertuis’s constitution had long been considerably impaired by the fatigues of
                    various kinds in which his active mind had involved him; indeed, to the amazing
                    hardships he had undergone in his northern expedition, most of his future bodily
                    sufferings may be traced. The intense sharpness of the air could only be
                    supported by means of strong liquors, which served to increase his disorder, and
                    bring on a spitting of blood, which began at least twelve years before his
                    death. Yet his mind seemed still to possess the greatest vigour; for the best of
                    his writings were produced, and his most sublime ideas developed, during the
                    time of his confinement by sickness, when he was unable to occupy' his chair as
                    president at the academy. He took several journeys to St Malo, during the last
                    years of his life, for the recovery of his health; and though he always received
                    benefit by breathing his native air, yet, on his return to Berlin, his disorder
                    returned with greater violence. His last journey to France was undertaken in the
                    year 1757, when, soon after his arrival there, he was obliged to quit his
                    favourite retreat at St Malo, on account of the danger and confusion into which
                    that town was thrown by the arrival of the English in its neighbourhood. From
                    thence he proceeded to Bordeaux, hoping there to meet with a neutral ship to
                    carry him to Hamburg, on his way back to Berlin; but being disappointed in that
                    hope, he went to Toulouse, where he remained seven months. He had then thoughts
                    of going to Italy, in hopes that a milder climate would restore him to health;
                    but finding himself grow worse, he rather inclined towards Germany, and went to
                    Neufchatel, where for three months he enjoyed the conversation of Lord
                    Marischal, with whom he had formerly been much connected. At length he arrived
                    at Basil on the 16th of October 1758, and was there received by his friend
                    Bernoulli and his family with the utmost tenderness and affection. He at first
                    found himself much better there than he had been at Neufchatel; but this
                    amendment was of short duration; for as the winter approached his disorder
                    returned, accompanied by new and more alarming symptoms. He languished here many
                    months, during which he was attended by Μ. de la Condamine, and died in 1759.
                    The works which he published were collected into fourvolumes 8vo, published in
                    1756 at Lyons, where a new and elegant edition was also printed in 1768. These
                    consist of, 1. Essai de Cosmologie, first published at Berlin in 1748; 2.
                    Discours sur la Figure des Astres, first published in 1732; 3. Essai de
                    Philosophie Morale, in which he maintains that the sum of evil surpasses that of
                    good; 4. Reflexions Philosophiques sur l’Origine des Langues et la Signification
                    des Mots; 5. Venus Physique, or an Exposition of the System of Generation; 6.
                    Système de la Nature, first published in 1751, and which maybe considered as the
                    sequel of the preceding work; 7. Lettres, on various subjects; 3. Eléments de
                    Géographie, published at Paris in 1742, and containing an exposition of the
                    means for determining the figure of the earth; 9. Relation d’un Voyage fait par
                    ordre du Roi au Cercle Polaire, printed at Paris as early as 1738; 10. Relation
                    d’un Voyage au fond de la Laponie; 11. Letter on the Comet of 1742; 12. Discours
                    Académiques, pronounced in the French and Prussian Academies; 13. Mémoire sur la
                    moindre quantité d’Action; 14. Astronomie Nautique, a work mûch cried up when it
                    first appeared, but now little read; 15. Parallaxe de la Lune; 16. Mesure du
                    Degré du Nord. Besides these treatises, Maupertuis was the author of a <pb

                    papers, printed partly in the Memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences, and
