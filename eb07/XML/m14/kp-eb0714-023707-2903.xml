                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MANUTIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Aldus</hi></label> (in
                    Italian, <hi rend="italic">Aldo Pio Manuzio),</hi> the first of those justly
                    celebrated printers, illustrious for their learning as well as for uncommon
                    skill in their profession, who were in Italy what the Stephens afterwards became
                    in France. He was born in 1447, at Bassiano, a small town of the duchy of
                    Sermoneta, in the Roman state. He was educated at Rome, and, after completing
                    his course of study, repaired to Ferrara to study Greek under Guarini, a learned
                    professor of that language. In 1482, he quitted Ferrara, then threatened with a
                    siege by the Venetians, and retired to Mirandola, where he was received with
                    distinction by the all-accomplished Pico Yielding to the entreaties of Alberto
                    Pio, he then went to Carpi, where he was soon joined by Pico the uncle of the
                    prince. Μ. Renouard conjectures, with much apparent probability, that it was at
                    this time that Aldus conceived the design of forming a printing establishment,
                    with the view of multiplying the best works of the Greek and Latin authors, and
                    that the two princes (Alberto Pio and Picodi Mirandola) undertook to defray the
                    expense of setting up the establishment. In the course of the year 1488, he
                    repaired to Venice, a city which, from its position, its commerce, and the
                    literary taste of its inhabitants, appeared the best suited for his design. His
                    first object was to make himself advantageously known, and, with this view, he
                    commenced by giving public instructions in Greek and Latin; but in the mean time
                    he was very busily occupied in organizing his printinghouse; and at length, in
                    1494, he published the poem of Hero and Leander in Greek and Latin, which was
                    followed by the Grammar of Lascaris, that of Theodore Gaza, and die works of
                    Theocritus, Apollonius, and Herodian. But it was the publication of the works of
                    Aristotle which placed Manutius in the first rank of printers. It is impossible
                    to form a just conception of the patience and sagacity necessary to read and
                    decipher the manuscripts which served as the basis of this edition, to compare
                    and collate them with one another, to select the best readings when they
                    exhibited variations, and to supply the omissions of the copyists. This edition
                    alone, though less correct than the greater part of those which followed it,
                    would be sufficient to earn for Manιιtius the gratitude of posterity, and to
                    justify all the commendations which have been bestowed upon him. But if we
                    reflect that he published, with the same care, and almost always with the same
                    success, the greater part of the <hi rend="italic">chefs</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d’oeuvre</hi> of Greece; that, in multiplying good books, then so rare, he
                    changed the direction of study, hitherto limited to scholastic theology and a
                    barbarous jurisprudence; and that he thereby contributed in the most essential
                    manner to the progress of the human mind, and the advancement of civilization;
                    we cannot but entertain a sentiment of . profound veneration for the man whose
                    whole life was consumed in a series of labours which will extend their useful
                    influence even to the latest generations. Before this time the greater part of
                    books had been printed in the folio or largest size; Manutius, however,
                    conceived the happy idea of publishing a collection of the Latin classics in a
                    more convenient form, and with this view he had a character cast in imitation
                    (it is said) of the hand-writing of Petrarch, and employed it, for the first
                    time, in the impression of his Virgil which appeared in 1501. This character,
                    long afterwards known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Aldine,</hi> and now by
                    that of <hi rend="italic">Italic,</hi> was designed and cut by Francesco of
                    Bologna, an artist highly esteemed in his particular line. The multiplicity of
                    works which now issued from his presses having rendered it impossible for one
                    individual to superintend the impressions, he had recourse to the assistance of
                    some learned men, his personal friends; and out of this association of persons
                    united in one common object he formed the Aldine Academy, whose short duration
                    did not prevent it from attaining great celebrity. It reckoned amongst its
                    members, Bembo, Erasmus, Battista Egnazio, and Andrea Navagero, who every year
                    burned, in honour of Catullus, a copy of Martial; the monk Bolzani, the first
                    who wrote in Latin the principles of Greek grammar; Alcyonio, who is accused of
                    having destroyed the only manuscript of Cicero’s treatise <hi rend="italic">De
                    Gloria,</hi> after having transferred its finest passages to one of his own
                    works; the Greek Musurus Demetrius Chalcondylas, who published the first edition
                    of Homer; and Ale-andro, afterwards cardinal, who acted a prominent part in the
                    ecclesiastical affairs of the sixteenth century. In 1506, war obliged Aldus to
                    withdraw from Venice; and during his absence his goods were pillaged and his
                    domains seized. He made repeated efforts to recover possession of his property,
                    but, unfortunately, without success. On quitting Milan, where his friends had
                    sheltered him, he fell into the hands of a troop of soldiers, who, taking him
                    for a spy, conducted him to prison at Caneto. But he recovered his liberty,
                    through the good offices of Jaffredo Carolo, vice-chancellor of the senate of
                    Milan, and returned to Venice much poorer than when he left it. In 1507, he
                    resumed his typographical labours; but the want of funds rendered it impossible
                    for him to execute any great work. In these circumstances, Andrea Toresano
                    d’Asola, his father-in-law, came to his assistance; and, in 1512, they formed a
                    partnership, of which Aldus was constituted the head. He then re-opened his
                    printing-house, which for two years had been shut, and resumed his labours with
                    increased activity. But when he was on the point of publishing a Bible in three
                    languages, which would have secured to him the distinction of being the first
                    author of a polyglott, he was in 1515 removed from all his pursuits by death, at
                    the age of about seventy. By his marriage with the daughter of Andrea d’Asola he
                    had three sons and a daughter; but Paolo, his third son, was the only one who
                    followed in the footsteps of his father.</p>
                <p>The Greek editions which issued from the presses of Aldus are less correct than
                    either the Latin or the Italian editions; but it should be remembered that he
                    had frequently only a single manuscript, incomplete or half effaced, from which
                    to reproduce a work, and that the conservation of many is entirely owing to his
                    laborious patience. The mark of his press, it is well known, is a dolphin coiled
                    round an anchor. Besides the prefaces, and the Greek or Latin dissertations with
                    which he enriched most of his editions, Manutius was <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194202916" xml:id="kp-eb0714-2916-0238"/>the author of several works,
                    which would of themselves have been sufficient to insure to him a distinguished
                    place amongst the learned men of his age, if he had not been the most celebrated
                    printer it produced. Of these works the most important are, 1. Rudimenta
                    Grammatices Linguae Latinae, Venice, 1501, in 4to, very rare; 2. Grammaticae
                    Institutiones Graecae, 1515, in 4to; 3. Dictionarium Graeco-Latinum, 1497,1524,
                    in folio; 4. De Metris Horatianis, a little work often reprinted during the
                    sixteenth century; 5. Scripta Tria longe rarissima denuo edita et illustrata,
                    Bassano, 1806, in 8vo. The Abbé Morelli is the editor of this collection, which
                    contains a poem of ^Aldus, entitled <hi rend="italic">Musarum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Panegyris,</hi> in two little pieces addressed to the Prince of
                    Carpi. The original edition in 4to, without date, must have appeared before
                    1489. Manutius translated from Greek to Latin the Grammar of Lascaris, the
                    Batrachomyomachia, the Sentences of Phocylides, the Golden Verses of Pythagoras,
                    and the Fables of Aesop and of Gabrias (Babrius). (See Life of Aldus Manutius
                    the Elder, by Unger, augmented by Geret, Wittenberg, 1753, in 4to; also his Life
                    by Manni.) <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Manutius,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Paulus,</hi> son of the preceding, was born at Venice in 1512,
                    and, after the death of his father, remained under the care of his maternal
                    uncle, Andrea Toresano. Part of his early youth he passed at Asola, where his
                    education was much neglected; but, on his return to Venice, the old friends of
                    his father furnished him the means of gratifying his taste for learning. Under
                    their direction he applied to his studies with such zeal and assiduity, as even
                    to injure his health, and induce his physicians to enjoin a temporary abstinence
                    from labour. But he suffered more domestic disquiet than from the illness thus
                    occasioned. Andrea Toresano died in 1529; and∙the partition of his succession
                    excited keen disputes between his own sons and those of Aldus. Paul, however,
                    entered into an agreement with his uncles, whereby he remained at the head of
                    the printing'establishment, which, having been shut up in 1529, was re-opened in
                    1533, for the common benefit of the heirs of Aldus and Andrea d’Asola. In
                    imitation of his father, he sought the assistance of learned men, of whose
                    counsels he availed himself; published new editions, particularly of the Latin
                    classics, much more correct than the preceding ones; and enriched them with
                    prefaces, notes, and indexes, the usefulness of which now began to be felt.
                    Being passionately fond of the works of Cicero, which he read and re-read
                    incessantly, in order to form his own style, he published a careful
                    re-impression of the oratorical treatises and familiar letters; and this was
                    followed by a complete edition of the works of the prince of Roman eloquence.
                    But fresh annoyances which he experienced on the part of his uncles forced him
                    to suspend his labours in 1538; and he employed part of that year in visiting
                    the ancient libraries of Tuscany and the Milanese. The partnership which he had
                    formed with the Toresani was at length dissolved; and the printing establishment
                    having been re-opened in 1540, under the name of the sons of Aldus, soon began
                    to recover its ancient splendour. Manutius married in 1546; but the attention
                    which he owed to his wife and his young family did not abate his ardour for
                    study. Frequent illnesses, caused by excessive labour, or the difficulties with
                    which he had to contend, could alone withdraw him from his habitual occupations.
                    The little encouragement which he met with at Venice, however, led him to think
                    of removing his establishment to some other place; and having been received with
                    distinction in two journeys which he had made to Rome in 1535 and 1543, he
                    persuaded himself that he would there find more liberal patronage and support.
                    But every project of change was adjourned by the erection of the Venetian
                    Academy, which was founded by the senator Badoaro in 1558, upon nearly the same
                    plan as that afterwards adopt ed for the Institute of France. Paulus Manutius
                    was appointed professor of eloquence, and director of the press of the academy.
                    But this magnificent establishment, from which the most advantageous results
                    were expected, was dissolved in 1561; and almost at the same time Manutius
                    received a letter from Cardinal Scripandi, who, in the most pressing manner,
                    invited him to establish himself at Rome, in order to superintend the impression
                    of the works of the Fathers. After some hesitation, he accepted the offers made
                    to him, and repaired to Rome, where he was not long after joined by his family.
                    The new printing establishment was fixed in the capitol (⅛ <hi rend="italic"
                    >aedibus</hi><hi rend="italic">populi</hi><hi rend="italic">Romani),</hi> and
                    the first work which proceeded from it was a small treatise of Cardinal Polo,
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Concilio et Reformatione</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Angliae,</hi> dated 1562. But after the death of Paul IV., the
                    payment of the allowance granted to Manutius was discontinued. The vexation he
                    in consequence experienced affected his health, which was already in a
                    precarious state; and, about the end of 1570, he returned to Venice in a much
                    worse condition than when he had left it. He went to the country in quest of
                    that repose and diversion of which he had so much need; and, in the autumn of
                    the year 1571, he travelled to Genoa, Reggio, and Milan, labouring at intervals
                    on his Commentary on the Orations of Cicero. In 1572, he went to visit his
                    daughter, whom he had left in a convent at Rome, intending to remain there only
                    for a few weeks; but the liberality of Pope Gregory XIII. overcame all his
                    scruples, and induced him to. remain in that city. Being now easy as to the lot
                    of his family; he was proceeding to complete the works which he had so long
                    meditated, when the infirmity of ĥis’health forced him to abandon every kind of
                    occupation; and, after languishing for several months, he died on the 6th April
                    1574, and was interred in the church of the Dominicans, but without an
                    inscription. Although, during the last years of his life, his presses had begun
                    to decline, Paulus Manutius, as a printer and editor, was equal to his
                    illustrious father; and his works place him in the rank of the best critics and
                    most polished writers of his age. These were, 1. Epistolarum libri xii.

                    Orations; as well as Scholia, on the oratorical and philosophical treatises of

                    February 1567, he exhibited precocious talents, which his father cultivated with
                    the greatest care. At the age of eleven, he published a collection of Elegances
                    in the Latin and Italian languages, which had great success; but it is generally
                    believed that in making this collection he had been assisted by his father.

                    augment his collection of ancient inscriptions. He returned to Venice at the
                    latest in 1565, and assumed the direction of the Aldine press, the useful

                    1576 he was named professor of belles-lettres in the schools of the chancery;
                    and to this employment he, in 1584, joined that of secretary to the senate. He
                    transferred his printing establishment, which he had much neglected, to Nicoo
                    Manassi, one of his workmen; and, notwithstanding the proofs of esteem which he
                    had received from his fellow-citizens, he quitted Venice in 1585, in order to
                    occupy, at Bologna, the chair of eloquence, vacant by the death of Ligonio. The
                    offer of a more advantageous appointment decided him, in 1587, to settle at
                    Pisa; and, two years after, yielding to the solicitations of his friends, he
                    accepted the chair which Muretus had occupied with so much distinction at Rome,
                    and which had been kept for him since the death of that learned professor. The
                    condition ofManntius was still further ameliorated under the pontificate of
                    Clement VIII., who, in 1590, confided to him the direction of the Vatican press.
                    But he had the fault of indulging to excess in the pleasures of the table; and
                    he died in consequence of a debauch, on the 28th of October 1597, in the
                    fifty-first year of his age. He had memory and erudition, but much less taste
                    and critical ability than his father; and he was justly accused of plagiarism in
                    publishing, under his own name, notes on Paterculus, which had been communicated
                    to him by the learned Dupuis. His natural inconstancy prevented him from
                    undertaking anything truly great; and he owed his reputation less to his own
                    merit than to the celebrity which his father and grandfather had acquired. His
                    works are, 1. Eleganze, insieme con la copia della Lingua Toscana e Latina,
                    Venice, 1558, in 8vo; 3. Orthographia? Ratio, collecta ex libris antiquis

                    6. Oratio in funere B. Rottarii, ducis Sabaudiae apud Remp. Venetam legati,

                    4to; 11. Lettere Volgari, ibid. 1592, in 4to; 12. Viginti cinque Discorsi sopra
                    Livio della seconda Guerra Cartaginese, ibid. 1601, in 8vo. Aldus the younger
                    also wrote some Discourses; an Explication of the ode of Horace, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Lau∙ dibus Vitae rusticae</hi>; Commentaries on the Art of
                    Poetry by Horace, as well as on the Rhetoric and the Philosophical Books of
                    Cicero. After his death, the rich and extensive library collected by his
                    grandfather and his father was divided between his creditors and his nephews.
                    His intention, it is said, was to bequeath it to the city of Venice. (See
