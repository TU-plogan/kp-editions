                    rend="italic">(JManichoeT),</hi> a sect of ancient heretics, who asserted two
                    principles, and were so called from their author, <hi rend="italic">Manes</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Manichaeus,</hi> a Persian by nation, and educated amongst
                    the Magi, having been one of that number before he embraced Christianity. This
                    heresy took its first rise about the year 277, and spread itself principally in
                    Arabia, Egypt, and Africa. St Epiphanius, who treats of it at large, observes
                    that the true name of this heresiarch was Cubricus, and that he changed it for
                    <hi rend="italic">Manes,</hi> which in the Persian or Babylonian language
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">vessel.</hi> A rich widow, whose servant he had
                    been, having died without issue, left him her fortune, after which he boldly
                    assumed the title of the Apostle or Envoy of Jesus Christ. But, not contented
                    with the quality of Apostle of Jesus Christ, Manes also assumed that of the
                    Paraclete, whom Christ had promised to send; which Augustin explains by saying,
                    that Manes endeavoured to persuade men that the Holy Ghost personally dwelt in
                    him with full authority. He left several disciples, amongst whom were Addas,
                    Thomas, and Hermas. Manes, having undertaken to cure the king of Persia’s son,
                    and not succeeding, was, upon the young prince’s death, thrown into prison,
                    whence he made his escape; but he was soon afterwards apprehended, and flayed
                    alive. The doctrine of Manes was a motley compound of the tenets of Christianity
                    and the ancient philosophy of the Persians, in which he had been instructed in
                    his youth. He combined these two different systems, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194202851" xml:id="kp-eb0714-2851-0233"/>and applied and accommodated
                    to Jesus Christ the characters and actions which the Persians attributed to the
                    god Mithras. He established two principles, a good and an evil one. The first, a
                    pure and subtle matter, which he called <hi rend="italic">light,</hi> did
                    nothing but good; and the second, a gross and corrupt substance, which he called
                    <hi rend="italic">darkness,</hi> nothing but evil. This philosophy is very
                    ancient, and Plutarch treats of it at large in his Isis and Osiris. Manes
                    borrowed many things from the ancient Gnostics, on which account several authors
                    consider the Manicheans as a branch of the Gnostics. In truth, the Manichean
                    doctrine was a system of philosophy rather than of religion. The professors of
                    it made use of amulets, in imitation of the Basilidians, and are said to have
                    studied astronomy and astrology. They denied that Jesus Christ, who was only
                    God, had assumed a true human body, maintaining that it was only imaginary; and,
                    consequently, they also denied his incarnation, death, and resurrection. They
                    pretended that the law of Moses did not emanate from God, or the good principle,
                    but from the evil one; and that for this reason it was abrogated. They rejected
                    almost all the sacred books in which Christians look for the sublime truths of
                    their religion. They affirmed that the Old Testament was not the work of God,
                    but of the prince of darkness, who had been substituted by the Jews instead of
                    the true God. They abstained entirely from eating the flesh of any animal,
                    following therein the practice of the ancient Pythagoreans; and they also
                    condemned marriage. The rest of their errors may be seen in St Epiphanius and St
                    Augustin; the latter, having belonged to their sect, may be presumed to have
                    been thoroughly acquainted with them. Though the Manichees professed to receive
                    the books of the New Testament, yet in effect they only adopted as much of them
                    as suited their own opinions. They first formed to themselves a certain idea or
                    scheme of Christianity; and to this they adjusted the writings of the apostles,
                    pretending that whatever was inconsistent with this had been foisted into the
                    New Testament by later writers, who were half Jews. On the other hand, they
                    caused fables and apocryphal books to pass for apostolical writings; and they
                    are even suspected of having forged several others, the better to maintain their
                    errors. St Epiphanius gives a catalogue of several pieces published by Manes,
                    and adds extracts from some of them. These are the Mysteries, Chapters, Gospel,
                    and Treasury.</p>
                <p>The rule of life and manners which Manes prescribed to his followers was most
                    extravagantly rigorous and severe. However, he divided his disciples into two
                    classes; one of which comprehended the perfect Christians, under the name of the
                    <hi rend="italic">elect</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the other the imperfect
                    and feeble, under the title of <hi rend="italic">auditors</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">hearers.</hi> The elect were obliged to observe a rigorous and
                    entire abstinence from flesh, eggs, milk, fish, wine, all intoxicating liquors,
                    wedlock, and all amorous gratifications, and to live in a state of the severest
                    penury, nourishing their emaciated bodies with bread, herbs, pulse, and melons,
                    and depriving themselves of all the comforts which arise from the moderate
                    indulgence of natural passions, and also from a variety of innocent and
                    agreeable pursuits. The auditors were allowed to possess houses, lands, and
                    wealth, to feed on flesh, and to enter into the bonds of conjugal union; but
                    this liberty was granted them with many limitations, and under the strictest
                    conditions of moderation and of temperance. The general assembly of the
                    Manicheans was headed by a president, who represented Jesus Christ; and there
                    were joined to him twelve rulers or masters, who were designed to represent the
                    twelve apostles, who, again, were followed by seventy-two bishops, the images of
                    the seventy-two disciples of our Lord. These bishops had presbyters or deacons
                    under them, and all the members of these religious orders were chosen out of the
                    class of the elect. Their worship was simple and plain, consisting of prayers,
                    reading the Scriptures, and hearing public discourses, at which both the
                    auditors and the elect were allowed to be present. Towards the fourth century,
                    the Manicheans concealed themselves under various names, which they successively
                    adopted, and changed in proportion as they were discovered by them. Thus they
                    assumed the names of Encratites, Apotactics, Saccophori, Hy-droparastates,
                    Solitaries, and several others, under which they lay concealed for a certain
                    time, though they could not long escape the vigilance of their enemies. About
                    the close of the sixth century, this sect had gained a very considerable
                    influence, particularly amongst the Persians.</p>
                <p>Towards the middle of the twelfth century, the sect of Manicheans assumed a new
                    aspect on occasion of one Constantine, an Armenian, and an adherent of the
                    schism, taking upon himself to suppress the reading of all other books besides
                    the Evangelists and the epistles of St Paul, which he explained in such a manner
                    as to extract from them a new system of Manicheism. He entirely discarded all
                    the writings of his predecessors; rejecting the chimeras of the Valentinians and
                    their thirty aeons, the fable of Manes with regard to the origin of rain, and
                    other dreams, but still retaining all the impurities of Basilides. In this
                    manner he reformed Manicheism, insomuch that his followers made no scruple of
                    anathematizing Scythian, Buddas, called also Addas and Terebinth (the
                    contemporaries and disciples, as some say, and, according to others, the
                    predecessors and masters, of Manes), and even Manes himself; Constantine being
                    now received as their great apostle. After he had seduced a great number of
                    people, he was at last stoned to death by order of the emperor. This sect
                    prevailed in Bosnia and the adjacent provinces about the close of the fifteenth
                    century; propagating their doctrines with confidence, and holding their
                    religious assemblies with impunity.</p>
