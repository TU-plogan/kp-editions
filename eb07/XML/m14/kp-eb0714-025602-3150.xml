                <p><label type="entry">MARONITES</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical
                    History,</hi> a sect of oriental Christians, who follow the Syrian rite, and are
                    subject to the pope, their principal habitation being on Mount Libanus.</p>
                <p>Mosheim informs us, that the doctrine of the Monothelites, condemned and exploded
                    by the council of Constantinople, found a refuge amongst the Mardaites, a people
                    who inhabited the Libanus and the Anti-Libanus, and who, about the conclusion of
                    the seventh century, were calleci <hi rend="italic">Maronites,</hi> after Maro
                    their first bishop; a name which they still retain. None of the ancient writers
                    give any certain account of the first person who instructed these mountaineers
                    in the doctrine of the Monothelites. From several circumstances, however, it is
                    probable that it was John Maro, whose name they had adopted; and that this
                    ecclesiastic received the name of Maro from his having lived in the character of
                    a monk in the famous convent of St Maro, upon the borders of the Orontes, before
                    his settlement amongst the Mardaites of Libanus. From the testimony of Tyrius
                    and other unexceptionable witnesses, as also from the most authentic records, it
                    appears that the Maronites retained the opinions of the Monothelites until the
                    twelfth century, when, abandoning and renouncing the doctrine of one will in
                    Christ, they were, in the year 1182, re-admitted into the communion of the Roman
                    Catholic church. The most learned of the modern Maronites have left no method
                    unemployed to defend their church against this accusation; they have laboured to
                    prove, by a variety of testimonies, that their ancestors always persevered in
                    the Catholic faith, and in their attachment to the Roman pontiff, without
                    adopting the doctrine of the Monophysites, or Monothelites. But all their
                    efforts are insufficient to establish the truth of these assertions to such as
                    have any acquaintance with the history of the church and the records of ancient
                    times; for to all such the testimonies they produce must appear absolutely
                    fictitious and destitute of all authority.</p>
                <p>Faustus Nairon, a Maronite, settled at Rome, has published an apology for Maro
                    and the rest of his nation. His tenet is, that they really took their name from
                    the Maro who lived about the year 400, and of whom mention is made in
                    Chrysostom, Theodoret, and the <hi rend="italic">Menologium</hi> of the Greeks.
                    He adds, that the disciples of this Maro spread themselves throughout all Syria;
                    that they built several monasteries, and particularly one which bore the name of
                    their leader; that all the Syrians who were not tainted with heresy took refuge
                    amongst them; and that for this reason the heretics of those times called them
                    Maronites.</p>
                <p>Mosheim observes, that the subjection of the Maronites to the spiritual
                    jurisdiction of the Roman pontiff was agreed to upon this express condition,
                    that neither the popes nor their emissaries should pretend to change or abolish
                    any thing which related to the ancient rites, moral precepts, oř religious
                    opinions, of this people; so that in reality there is nothing to be found
                    amongst the Maronites which savours of popery, if we except their attachment to
                    the Roman pontiff, who is obliged to pay very dearly for their friendship. For,
                    as the Maronites live in the utmost distress and poverty, under the tyrannical
                    yoke of the Mahommedans, the bishop of Rome is under the necessity of furnishing
                    them with subsidies to appease their oppressors; to procure a subsistence for
                    their bishop and clergy; to provide all things requisite for the support of
                    their churches, and the uninterrupted exercise of public worship; and in general
                    to contribute to lessen their misery.</p>
                <p>The Maronites have a patriarch who resides in the monastery of Cannubin, on Mount
                    Libanus, and assumes the title of patriarch of Antioch, and the name of Peter,
                    as if he seemed desirous of being considered as the successor of that apostle.
                    He is elected by the clergy and the people, according to the ancient custom;
                    but, since their reunion with the church of Rome, he is obliged to have a bull
                    of confirmation from the pope. He observes perpetual celibacy, as well as the
                    rest of the bishops his suffragans; but as to the other ecclesiastics, they are
                    allowed to marry before ordination, though the monastic life is in great esteem
                    amongst them. Their monks are of the order of St Anthony, and live in the most
                    obscure places in the mountains, far from the commerce of the world.</p>
                <p>As to their faith, they agree in the main with the rest of the eastern church.
                    Their priests do not say mass singly, but together, all standing around the
                    altar. They communicate in unleavened bread; and the laity have hitherto
                    partaken in both kinds, though the practice of communicating in one has latterly
                    been gaining ground. In Lent they eat nothing after sunrise; and their other
                    fastings are very numerous.</p>
