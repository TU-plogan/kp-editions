                <p><label type="entry">MARCHAND, <hi rend="smallcaps">Prosper</hi></label>, a
                    learned bibliographer, born about the year 1675, at Guise, in Picardy, studied
                    at Paris with much success, and was then placed with a bookseller, to qualify
                    him for engaging in the same line of business. Having, from his infancy, been
                    passionately devoted to books, he soon acquired the requisite knowledge, and, in
                    1698, was admitted into the corporation of booksellers. He then opened, in the
                    Rue Saint Jacques, a shop under the sign of the Phoenix, which soon became the
                    rendezvous of all the lovers of books in Paris. An eager collector of literary
                    anecdotes, he transmitted them to Jacques Bernard, who then conducted in Holland
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles de la République des Lettres;</hi> and he at the
                    same time made for the use of that person collections which proved very
                    serviceable to him. In 1711, Marchand passed into Holland, that he might be more
                    free to profess the reformed religion, which he had embraced. He established
                    himself at Amsterdam, and there continued for some time the business of
                    bookselling; but being disgusted with the want of good faith on the part of his
                    brethren of “the trade,” he abandoned it altogether, in order to devote himself
                    exclusively to study. The editions of different works which he successively
                    published made him advantageously known; and he was consulted by most of the
                    learned men of Europe who were engaged in similar pursuits. The habits of a
                    frugal life had fortified his constitution, which was naturally robust, and he
                    seldom quitted his cabinet; but he there received all who had recourse to him,
                    and freely communicated to them the information they required. In the midst of
                    these peaceful occupations, he attained a very advanced age, and died on the
                    14th of June 1756. By his will he bequeathed the fruits of his economy to the
                    society for the relief of the poor at the Hague, and left his rich library to
                    the university of Leyden. Marchand had a share in the ingenious satire, <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Chef-d'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Oeuvre</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">nn</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Inconnu;</hi> he furnished notes to the satire called <hi
                    rend="italic">Menippee∙,</hi> and he was a principal conductor of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">Littéraire</hi> (Hague, 1713-1737,
                    in twenty-four vols. 12mo), one of the best periodical works printed in Holland.
                    Besides these, we have of his, 1. Catalogues of different libraries,
                    particularly that of Joachim Faultrier, 1709, in 8vo, now exceedingly scarce,
                    which is preceded by his new system of bibliography <hi rend="italic"
                    >(epitome</hi><hi rend="italic">systematis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bibliographi-cι)∙,</hi> 2. Histoire Critique de 1’Anti-Cotton, a satire
                    composed by Caesar de PIaix, an advocate; 3. Histoire de la Bible de
                    Sixte-Quint, inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Amaenitates Litterariae</hi> of
                    Schelhorn (tom. iv.); 4. Histoire de l’Origine ct des premiers Progrès de
                    í’Imprimerie, Hague, 1740, in 4to; 5, Dictionnaire Historique, or Critical and
                    Literary Memoirs of different distinguished persons, particularly in the
                    republic of letters, Hague, 1758,1759, two volumes folio in one. This last work,
                    which the author left in manuscript, forms a sort of supplement to the
                    Dictionaries of Bayle and of Chaufpié, and, though too minute perhaps, contains
                    many interesting facts and curious anecdotes. We may add, that Marchand rendered
                    important services to letters by the publication of a great number of useful
                    works, which he enriched with prefaces, letters, notes, and instructive remarks.
                    To him we are indebted for an edition, with remarks, of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lettres Choisies</hi> of Bayle, Rotterdam, 1714, in three volumes 12mo, which
                    is not surpassed by that of Desmaiseaux; and he likewise published the most
                    beautiful and the most esteemed edition of the Dictionary of that famous critic.
