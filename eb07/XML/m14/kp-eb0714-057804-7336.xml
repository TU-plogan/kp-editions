                    of character as well as of hypothesis. The affections in question are, in
                    reality, exceedingly numerous and complex; and considering the causes, known or
                    supposed, by which they are produced, much contrariety of opinion maybe expected
                    to prevail amongst those who treat of them.</p>
                <p>On the same ground we may account for the controversy respecting a proper
                    definition of these diseases, and their arrangement into species. The whole
                    subject, whether considered theoretically or practically, is beset with
                    difficulties; and hence it is equally easy to understand how there should
                    prevail so great misapprehensions respecting insanity, and, to perceive the
                    necessity for the exercise of that prudence which an experienced writer enjoins
                    upon his professional brethren, when they happen to be examined as witnesses in
                    courts of law. “I have felt,” says he, “something akin to shame, when I have
                    heard men of education not only delivering the most conflicting testimony, but
                    supporting distinctions that never had existence, except in their own inventive
                    imaginations.” The same writer mentions that, having been asked, on one
                    occasion, to define unsoundness of mind, he refused compliance, stating as his
                    reason for doing so, that he had heard the question frequently put to medical
                    men of the greatest eminence, but never knew an instance where one of them had
                    made the subject clearer by his explanation. In like manner Dr. Prichard,
                    considers all attempts at a definition of insanity as unavailing, and states
                    that the advantages thereby aimed at can only be attained by stating what the
                    disturbances· are to which the mental operations have been subjected.</p>
                <p>Both of these writers, confirmed by others, agree further in suggesting the
                    respective duties of the legal and medical professions, concerning questions of
                    insanity. “Lawyers,” says Dr Burrows, “are commonly fond of indulging in
                    metaphysical theories on the nature of the human mind <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194207349" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7349-0579"/>whilst, unfortunately, all
                    their information regarding mental derangement is, according to him, derived
                    either from certain great legal authorities, or from medical writers, who are
                    “as much inclined to theories as themselves.” In this manner,he conceives, that
                    their “natural fondness to involve questions of sanity or insanity in subtleties
                    is encouraged.” The counsel, in truth, cares not a straw for the definition; but
                    in proportion to the clearness of the testimony against his client, he is
                    anxious to get the witness entangled in a labyrinth, and eventually discredited.
                    On the other hand, the physician, not perceiving any such design, and either too
                    confident of his own powers, or “from the vanity of display,” falls into the
                    snare, and “becomes perfectly unintelligible, which is exactly what the counsel
                    desires.” Instead of thus exposing himself, a physician should only mention what
                    he has observed as to the existence of some delusions, noticed in conversation
                    with the lunatic, and, if practicable, should exemplify or illustrate them by
                    corresponding actions. This kind of evidence is not only good in itself, but
                    cannot be easily set aside, <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> *</p>
                <p>Dr. Prichard having characterised mental unsoundness as a defective condition,
                    which, by the disturbance or impediment of the operations of mind, renders a
                    person unfit for various duties, and impairs or altogether abrogates his
                    responsibility, mentions several questions connected with it, in the solution of
                    which both lawyers and physicians are equally concerned. “It belongs to the
                    latter, as observers of nature, to take note of the phenomena displayed by the
                    human constitution under disease, and from the relation of them to deduce such
                    results as common sense, aided by the habit of reflecting on similar subjects,
                    may enable them satisfactorily to establish. On these results, which are the
                    conditions given, legal regulations are to be constructed. They must be made to
                    accommodate themselves to the conditions, and they will doubtless be so
                    accommodated, when the latter shall have been set forth in a manner
                    unexceptionable, and commanding general assent. These arrangements, and the
                    elucidation of their principles, belong to lawyers and the framers of law.
                    Physicians are expected to supply them with information as to the nature of
                    those causes on which unsoundness of mind depends, as to their extent and
                    duration, their distinguishing characters, and ultimate results.” The precedence
                    thus awarded to medical men, has undoubtedly been sustained in the face of many
                    difficulties, and seems to indicate the propriety, or rather the expediency, of
                    certain changes in the administration of our laws. This is more especially
                    applicable to cases of what has been called <hi rend="italic">moral
                    insanity</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> namely, a disorder of the propensities and
                    affections, with little or no error of the understanding. To the actual
                    existence of this kind of derangement, legal functionaries have not by any means
                    been sufficiently attentive; whilst, unhappily, medical men themselves are still
                    far from approaching the “general assent” which is necessary towards the
                    discovery of a suitable remedy. Examples, such as Dr. Prichard has mentioned, of
                    “victims to ignorance,” of sacrifices to a mistaken sense of justice, occur
                    almost daily; and they will not cease, until the information which physicians
                    have supplied, or which they can supply, be deemed as imperative as it is
                    valuable and disinterested.</p>
                <p>If, after what has been said, a definition of mental diseases were insisted on,
                    they might be described as “deviations from sound health, involving some of the
                    functions of mind ;” and this, although not according to strict logic, might
                    pass unchallenged,.provided a qualification or explanation were added. In one
                    sense, accordingly, every morbid state may be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >mental,</hi> inasmuch as matter, however organised, or supposed to be
                    organised, is unsusceptible of pain, suffering, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >disease.</hi> On the other hand, the term <hi rend="italic">mind</hi> admits of
                    a signification which precludes the idea of injury, aberration, or decay. Thus,
                    according to Raleigh,</p>
                <p>“it is a part or particle of the soul, whereby it doth understand, not depending
                    upon matter, nor needing any organ; free from passion, coming from without, and
                    apt to be dissevered, as eternal, from that which is mortal.”</p>
                <p>With the controversy which has been maintained on this subject between the
                    materialists and their opponents, we have on the present occasion no coneem
                    whatever; and any discussion respecting the nature of the union which subsists
                    between mind and matter, is equally remote from the purpose of this article. We
                    assume the distinction as recognised and undeniable; but, at the same time, we
                    proceed on the fact, that the states and operations of the mind are only
                    manifested and discoverable by certain conditions and appearances in its
                    material associate. Their connection, in fact, limits as well as suggests the
                    researches of physiologists. “I consider,” says Boyle, “the chief thing that
                    inquisitive naturalists should look after, in the explicating of difficult
                    phenomena, is not so much what the agent is or does, as what changes are made in
                    the patient, to bring it to exhibit the phenomena that are proposed, and after
                    what manner these changes are effected.” Such must be the defence of the
                    pathologist, whose duty it is, after certain relations of structure and function
                    have been discovered in the state of health, to explore and point out the
                    transitions and correspondences of both when that state is subverted. Lord Bacon
                    expressly sanctioned this procedure, in regard to mental diseases; for in
                    alluding to them, he remarks that their absolute source, “if ever fully
                    developed, wall be found to exist in corporeal changes, or the effects of
                    external agents on the gross machine, and not primarily on the immaterial
                    principle, as has, unfortunately for the subjects of disease, been too commonly
                    apprehended.” But notwithstanding this great authority, which points out the
                    true and only mode of investigating thecauses of insanity, viz., by studying its
                    phenomena in the living, and seeking them by anatomical inspection in the dead;
                    yet were the latter neglected in this country for nearly two centuries after the
                    decease of this illustrious philosopher.</p>
                <p>Supposing that excess of passion or derangement affects the moral constitution of
                    our species no less than the intellectual, the eldest son of Adam was the first
                    maniac; and the malady may be said to have prevailed, when the Almighty declared
                    “that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination
                    of the thought of his heart wasonlyevil continually.” Intherestored world,
                    again, Noah soon gave a temporary example of it, after an indulgence which
                    millions have since practised with similar results. Passing over numerous other
                    indications, we find, amongst the threatenings against disobedience of the
                    divine laws, “madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart.” (Deut, xxviii.
                    28.) At a subsequent period, frequent mention is made of “the spirit of the
                    Lord” as leading men to courage, wisdom, and true predictions, in opposition to
                    “an evil spirit,” “the spirit of Belial,” whose influences are described as
                    dangerous, malignant, and inconsistent with truth. The Hebrew writers, canonical
                    and rabbinical, abound in evidences respecting what was held by them to be
                    supernatural agency in both these kinds; and, in relating various instances,
                    they throw light on <hi rend="italic">a</hi> subject which often engaged
                    attention amongst heathen authors. We allude to divination, real or supposed;
                    the descriptions of which, though occasionally explicable upon the principle of
                    fraud, are not rarely characteristics of insanity. Thus, Maimonides having
                    described the intellectual and imaginative faculties as liable to such
                    influences, separately or conjunctly, pourtrays some cases of a third or
                    inferior class, where the patients are subject to conceits, dreams, and
                    ccstacies, astonishing to the individuals themselves. In like manner, Albo,
                    another Jew,. speaks of some in whom the imagination was too strong, as amongst
                    witches and those who professed to commune with familiar spirits. Both concur in
                    believing in the reality of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207362"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7362-0580"/>divination; whereas Plato regarded the apparent
                    symptoms of this art as chiefly or altogether natural. “No sober man,” says he,
                    “is afflicted with this, except in sleep, when reason is bound, or when he
                    suffers alienation of mind, in consequence of sickness or enthusiasm.” Again,
                    limiting alleged divination to the consequences of a disturbed mind and
                    melancholy imagination, he deduces the word, whence we have obtained our term
                    <hi rend="italic">mania,</hi> from an expression denoting rage and fury, such as
                    arc sometimes exhibited in disease. In fact, insanity is more frequent, and
                    therefore more to be presumed, than inspiration; and, in the class of cases to
                    which we allude, knavery is more probable than insanity. “The fewest lunatics in
                    all communities,” says Dr. Burrows, “will be found among the truly
                    virtuous.”</p>
                <p>We may pass over the mythological ages of Egypt and Greece, with a slight
                    allusion to the monopoly of medicine by their priests, as sufficiently
                    accounting for the use of incantations and idolatrous rites when their scanty
                    pharmacopoeia failed. Thus, Melampus, a soothsayer and physician, is said to
                    have performed a cure by means of hellebore on the two daughters of Proetus,
                    king of Argos, w ho, for preferring their own beauty to that of J uno, were
                    afflicted with a madness, under which they imagined themselves transformed into
                    cows. If Pythagoras maintained, as has been alleged, that the brain is the seat
                    of the reasoning faculty, he made a material advance towards the knowledge of
                    insanity as dependent on the lesion or disease of that organ. Plato, adopting
                    the doc-, trine of Socrates, imputed one species of derangement to bodily
                    causes, and another to attacks from the invisible world, more especially by the
                    Eumenides, who had power to excite remorse of conscience, and otherwise to
                    inflict the divine vengeance on earth. Aristotle, his pupil and the son of a
                    physician, besides being a diligent cultivator of comparative anatomy, and
                    master of all the learning of his time, in some of his metaphysical speculations
                    threw an incidental light on the symptoms, if not the sources, of this disease,
                    which received further elucidation from his remarks on the nervous system. He
                    was indebted for part of his knowledge of the subject to the writings of
                    Hippocrates; who, however, added less to anatomical and physiological science
                    than to the symptomatology of disease. This diligent observer reckoned the brain
                    of great consequence in the animal economy, but had imperfect notions of its
                    structure. In the Alexandrian school of medicine, the nervous system was studied
                    by Hcrophilus and Erasistratus, who anticipated the course followed by
                    subsequent inquirers. But, unfortunately, all that is known of their early
                    labours can only be gleaned from sources which render it difficult to estimate
                    their true merit.</p>
                <p>The establishment of almost universal empire by the Romans was favourable to the
                    extension of science, but, on the whole, little creditable to their intellectual
                    character, as they depended chiefly on aliens or captives for those arts which
                    either adorn life or succour its calamities. Such was the case of medicine.
                    Asclepiades, a Bythinian, divided diseases into acute and chronic, since adhered
                    to in treating of mental derangement; and Themison, of Laodicea, who simplified
                    some of his general views, shared with him the praise awarded by Celsus, that
                    “per hos maxime viros salutaris ista nobis professio increvit.” Celsus
                    repeatedly alludes to the former in his chapter, <hi rend="italic">De
                    Tribus</hi><hi rend="italic">Insaniae</hi><hi rend="italic">Generibus,</hi> an
                    essay still valuable as a description, and also for some of its precepts. To
                    Coelius Aurelianus, a Numidian, we owe various hints on the disease, together
                    with much information respecting the practice of his contemporaries. Aretaeus, a
                    Capadocian, resident at Rome, merits regard as an observer of insanity, and for
                    an attempt, by no means injudicious, to explain its mysteries; but the exclusive
                    eulogium pronounced upon him by Dr. Ferriar of Manchester, is rather fanciful
                    than just.</p>
                <p>But with the exception of Hippocrates, all these medical writers were surpassed
                    by Galen, whose works, extraordinary and profound on other topics, demand
                    careful study in respect to madness. He deemed the brain the great organ of
                    intellect. The nerves proceeding from it are, according to him, the instruments
                    both of sensation and of voluntary motion, but require for their efficiency what
                    he styled the <hi rend="italic">pneuma,</hi> or animal spirit; an agent of
                    unknown nature, contained primarily in the ventricles of the brain, and sent
                    forth thence, as occasions required, to various members of the body. We have
                    here a mixture of truth and of hypothesis, which may equally bear on insanity,
                    or tend to distract attention from its actual phenomena. But, whatever may have
                    been his errors in physiology, and however defective his pathology of
                    derangement, he must be exempted from a charge which more successful researches
                    of a similar kind have encountered in modern times. No one, who credits his
                    disavowal of the animal spirit being either the essence or the habitation of the
                    soul, can charge him with materialism; whilst he was at pains to set forth the
                    goodness and wisdom of God in adjusting the members of animals to the purposes
                    for which they were destined.</p>
                <p>A neat abstract of Galen’s views, relative to the brain and nerves, was given by
                    Oribasius, a physician of Alexandria. Not long afterwards, Aetius, who studied
                    there, besides compiling from other writers, made original observations on the
                    same system. He was followed by Trallianus, signalized for particular attention
                    to one species of insanity. These and other authors adhered in general to the
                    doctrines of Galen, whose influence may be discerned throughout the medical
                    productions of many centuries, having survived the extinction of the Greek
                    schools, pervaded the writings of the Arabians, and sprung up afresh on the
                    restoration of learning in Europe. In the fifteenth century, one eminent
                    anatomist, Vesalius, thought proper to attack it with great keenness and no
                    small effect. But even he adopted certain portions of his doctrines, more
                    especially regarding the physiology of the nervous system. The brain was
                    considered by him as the seat of the rational soul, which he believed to act on
                    the sentient and moving frame through the nerves; in the distribution of which,
                    particularly as far as the lower animals are concerned, he admitted the
                    substantial accuracy of the master whom he chose to assail. Galen soon found an
                    able advocate in Laurentius. The history of anatomy by this author, has a value
                    distinct from a defence of Galen, whom he occasionally opposes; particularly in
                    denying that the nerves of sensation arise from the brain, and those of motion
                    from the spinal chord. One passage in it has been thought remarkable; “Universa
                    Arabum schola mansiones multas in cerebro statuit et singulis facultatibus
                    singulas sedes adsignat.”</p>
                <p>Passing by inferior authors, who treated incidentally of mental disorders,
                    subsequently to the time of Laurentius, we ought to mention the services
                    rendered to the physiological department by Willis, whom Dr.
                    Friendratherstrange-ly styled, “the first inventor of the nervous system ;” by
                    Vieussens, a labourer in the same field; and by Baglivi, an extensive
                    practitioner as well as skilful anatomist. But the doctrines of Stahl are
                    curious and widely influential. Adopting the early opinion, namely, that matter
                    is incapable of moving or of being moved, without the agency of mind, whilst he
                    conceived the brain to be the organ of the soul, his speculative genius led him
                    to ascribe all corporeal operations to the animating principle; regardless of
                    various functions in which the laws of mechanics and chemistry are concerned,
                    and of common language, which he either abandoned or employed without sanction.
                    Thus, liis favourite term, <hi rend="italic">rational soul,</hi> had a meaning
                    more extensive than its casual import, and comprehended the entire vital
                    phenomena, as well as those faculties which are deemed purely intellectual. His
                    theory of health and of disease followed; the former being the right course of
                    the functions under the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207375"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7375-0581"/>guidance of the rational soul, and the latter the
                    efforts at redress made by the same power. According to this view it might be
                    inferred, that, though styled a disorder, madness itself is salutary or
                    remedial, and may be said to have “method in it,” medically as well as
                    poetically.</p>
                <p>Hoffman, the colleague of Stahl at Jena, differed from him in several respects;
                    particularly in distinguishing between phenomena dependent on mechanical and
                    chemical laws, those which he ascribed to the sentient soul, as perception,
                    memory, desire, and the like; and, lastly, those of the rational soul, the
                    peculiar characteristic of our species, by which we compare and judge of ideas.
                    Besides much that is luminous and explicit in his general doctrines, Hoffman, by
                    his remarks on the nervous system, gave immense aid to the student of insanity.
                    It is a proof of his merit, thac Cullen took him as a guide in this province of
                    pathology, notwithstanding the claims of Boerhaave, whose comparative
                    inattention to the vital powers in health, impaired or vitiated his explanation
                    of the departures from the state of sanity. To a certain extent, however, this
                    great physician made up for this deficiency by an investigation of the mental
                    faculties, and an exposition of some phenomena of the senses, with a success
                    which might have been sufficient to direct subsequent researches concerning the
                    nature of disease. Two of his pupils, Gaubius and Haller, signalized themselves
                    partly in this line of inquiry, but still more in advancing physiology to the
                    rank of a science. Regarding our subject as connected with the structure and
                    functions of the nervous system, we may also mention the names Reil, Prochaska,
                    Richerand, Bichat, Le Gallois, Flourens, Bellingeri, Majendie, Brodie, Bell,
                    Philip Watson, Marshall Hall, Mayo, Macartney, Treviranus, Brachet, and
                    Tiedemann, all labourers, more or less successful, in developing this portion of
                    the animal economy. A brief sketch of some of their discoveries and views may
                    now be offered in elucidation of our subject.</p>
                <p>Living animals exhibit great differences of structure and functions, admitting
                    classification into genera and species; distinctions probably coeval with the
                    dawn of philosophy. In considering them, we perceive gradations of endowment,
                    from the merest indication of a vital principle to the display of intellectual
                    and moral powers, such as are found in our own race; and there exists, we know
                    not how, a correspondence between these and the varieties of bodily mechanism,
                    or the material constitution of the beings themselves. Like the elements of
                    which his frame is a compound, he is subjected to mechanical and chemical laws;
                    and also, like the lower animals, he depends on a systematic assemblage or
                    series of agencies, for those properties which he has in common with them;
                    whilst his superiority can neither be possessed nor exercised without visible
                    and palpable organs suitable for its maintenance. So far, therefore, from
                    denying or lightly esteeming this mysterious union, he ought to study it as a
                    proof of divine wisdom and beneficence, accomplishing the kindest designs by the
                    best arrangements. Supposing, with Sir John Herschel, that there is a
                    well-grounded expectation, “not only of constant increase in the physical
                    resources of mankind, and the consequent improvement of their condition, but of
                    continual accessions to our power of penetrating into the arcana of nature, and
                    becoming acquainted with her highest laws,” the conclusion thence deducible in
                    regard to mind is, “that it is the fittest agent which could have been employed
                    for working upon matter;” and, in regard to matter, “that it is the fittest
                    instrument which could have been placed under the disposal of mind.” The science
                    of both, considered in this relation, may consequently be prosecuted without any
                    apprehension of danger, or rather with the hope of advantage; and, on the same
                    principle, legitimate comparisons of our species with other living beings may be
                    deemed as safe as they are felt to be interesting. If there be truth in the
                    opinion of Hall, himself a sufferer under this malady, that, though inferior in
                    the perfection of several of his senses to different parts of the brute
                    creation, the superiority of man over all of them consists in his power of
                    multiplying by new combinations his mental perceptions, and thereby creating to
                    himself resources of happiness separate from external sensation; we may be
                    assured, that neither its value nor its beauty will be impaired by our
                    discovering a portion of organized matter subservient either to the greater
                    acquisition, or to an excellence, differing in kind no less than degree, in
                    which man has no competitor on earth.</p>
                <p>Keeping in view, then, particular no less than general differences amongst
                    animals, but passiri ’ g over their outward forms and members, we might appeal
                    to their internal structures, with the corresponding functions, as ample proof
                    of adaptation. Thus, provision is made in all for nutrition or the assimilation
                    of food; connected with this are secretion, excretion, &amp;c.; then come
                    circulation by means of a heart and blood-vessels, with respiration by the
                    trachea and lungs, processes somewhat higher in mechanism; next the faculty of
                    locomotion, in all its diversities; and, lastly, that by which the continuance,
                    or rather the reproduction of beings, is secured. This is but an outline, and
                    requires much filling up, with many qualifications. It shows complexity,
                    however, and suggests the possibility of such occurrences as constitute errors
                    or derangement, especially when, besides the numbers of parts and operations
                    concerned, we take into account the intimate relations in which they stand to
                    each other. Madness is obviously a departure from the harmony of health.</p>
                <p>With respect to this influence, we must in every case have recourse to structure.
                    It is maintained, we cannot tell how, by an apparatus widely diffused throughout
                    animals, and endowed with very peculiar powers or virtues, to which all the
                    changes in the living body must in greater or less degree be referred. The laws
                    of mechanics and of chemistry may, and do go far to solve some of the phenomena
                    above mentioned; but they have hitherto failed, and ever will fail, to explain
                    the whole of them; whilst, beyond all question, there is a region to which they
                    are entirely inapplicable, a region with affinities and repulsions of its own,
                    displaying an infinitude of actions or events not less curious and intricate
                    than liable to irregularities. It need scarcely be said that we allude to the
                    nervous system, a portion or modification of which is possessed apparently by
                    all animals, and to their peculiar share in which our own species is indebted
                    for its superiority over them.</p>
                <p>In certain animals, the existence of a nervous system is hardly demonstrable, but
                    may be inferred; in a grade somewhat higher, we find several whitish lines or
                    masses (some more easily discernible than others) connected with the apparatus
                    for digestion; ascending, there may be observed a double chord between the head
                    and posterior extremity, occasionally expanding into knots or ganglia; still
                    proceeding upwards, we perceive a large and peculiar portion of the nervous
                    system enclosed and defended by a series of hard, nicely-adjusted, and slightly
                    moveable joints, <hi rend="italic">(vertebrae),</hi> and terminating at one
                    extremity in a bony cell or receptacle, <hi rend="italic">{cranium),</hi> in
                    which also there is a mass of similar pulpy matter; whilst, from the great trunk
                    thus enveloped proceed numerous filaments of the same substance towards the
                    muscles, viscera, organs of sense, and in short every portion of the body
                    susceptible of feeling, motion, or other vital power. Amongst the animals of
                    this last kind, comprehending fishes, reptiles, birds, and the mammalia, the
                    distribution of nerves, whether issuing from the vertebrated column, or
                    belonging to a separate assemblage called ganglionia, bears relation to their
                    diversity of functions, and may thus be said to establish their respective
                    ranks. In other words, they seem to be endowed with powers proportional to the
                    extent and complication of the system; and there is reason to believe,
                    proportional to the development of that part which <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194207388" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7388-0582"/>terminates in or is connected
                    with the cranium. All of them have at least five senses, with various
                    propensities, whether instinctive or acquired; certain percipient faculties; and
                    a measure of what may be denominated intelligence. At the head of the list is
                    man, who, besides a nervous system resembling that of inferior animals, and
                    destined to similar purposes, possesses a brain more diversified and complex
                    than any of them, and which may be presumed from analogy to be connected with,
                    if not essential to, his supremacy in intellect of moral affections. “Of the
                    general position,” says Dr. Kidd, “that the brain is the instrument of
                    intelligence, and that the -degree of intelligence characteristic of different
                    classes of animals is proportioned to the approximation of their structure to
                    that of man, it may for the present be presumed that no one doubts.” Again,
                    having noticed a modern theory which ascribes peculiar mental functions to
                    special localities in the brain, he observes; “There are many phenomena,
                    connected with the moral and intellectual faculties of man, both in a healthy
                    and diseased state, which, by shewing the reciprocal influence of the two
                    distinct parts of our nature, the soul and the body, render it probable that the
                    energies of the former, although it be itself immaterial, may be manifested by
                    means of a material instrument.” Lastly, the same author admits, in concert with
                    all sound physiologists that, whether the brain act as one simple organ, by the
                    simultaneous operation of all its parts, or whether these act separately and
                    independently in the production of specific effects, it is undeniably the
                    instrument by which, principally, if not exclusively, the well-known
                    communication is maintained between the external world and the intelligent soul.
                    Assuming these premises as incontrovertible, we only require other decisive
                    observations to establish a basis on which many of the phenomena of insanity
                    must depend. The powers of the mind, like those of the body, may be strengthened
                    by exercise; they are also liable to injury from a variety of causes; and, as
                    they gradually advance to maturity from the period ofbirth, so, in the order of
                    nature, there in them is a tendency towards weakness and apparent decay or
                    extinction, when the corporeal frame itself is about to separate into its
                    physical elements.</p>
                <p>Of the soul in its uncombined state, the pure physiologist can take no
                    cognizance. His only legitimate method terminates with the physical phenomena;
                    all beyond or above pertaining to the speculations of moralists and the
                    disclosures of revelation, to which he may freely have recourse when his own
                    science fails. “Laissons parler de Fame ceux à qui appartient l’explication des
                    doctrines religieuses,”saysGuislain; “unissons ce principe au corps, puisqu’on
                    le trouve partout en connexion avec le corps, et envisageons tout simplement le
                    moral ae Thomme comme one fonction: nous pouvons le faire, sans enfreindre ce
                    que nous devons à la science divine, et à nous mêmes.”<note anchored="true"

                    One of our objects in this article is an attempt to reconcile the truths of
                    science. We conceive the living body to be the theatre of various combinations
                    and of events which are not explicable by mechanical and chemical agents, but
                    which acknowledge a power vested in the ner-chus system; in other words, that
                    apart from physics and voemistry, there is a vital force in this portion of the
                    animal economy, by which many if not most of its actions are governed in the
                    state of health, and to the derangements of which certain morbid symptoms must
                    be ascribed. In point of fact, the formation of this system precedes the
                    construction of all the organs designed for specific purposes, and appears
                    essential to them. Thus Tiedemann found that, in the case of acephalous
                    monsters, the deficiency of parts bore relation to the want ofthose nerves which
                    are distributed to them in the rightly-constituted foetus; that, if the spinal
                    chord be perfect, certain parts,'corresponding with it, are also complete; that
                    a similar remark applies ’to the nervous trunks issuing from the brain, in
                    connection with other parts to which they are respectively distributed; and
                    that, on the contrary, if either the spinal chord or the brain be imperfectly
                    developed, or altogether absent, the organs dependent on them are proportionally
                    deficient or altogether wanting. We must believe, therefore, that the perfection
                    of the nervous system is essential to the harmony of the whole frame with its
                    corresponding functions, whilst each portion of it has its peculiar endowment,
                    which is not transferable to or capable of being ministered by another.
                    Impressions on the nerve of the eye, accordingly, excite ideas of vision; on the
                    nerve of the ear, those of hearing; but we are quite at a loss to point out any
                    peculiarity of organization fitted to account for the differences in· function,
                    or to trace the manner in which affections of these nerves are transmitted to
                    the common sensorium. “To the most minute examination,” says Sir Charles Bell,
                    “the nerves, in all their course, and where they are expanded into the external
                    organs of sense, seem the same in substance and in structure. The disturbance of
                    the extremity of the nerve, the vibrations upon it, or the image painted upon
                    its surface, cannot be transmitted to the brain according to any physical laws
                    that we are acquainted with. The impressions of the nerve can have no
                    resemblance to the idea suggested in the mind. All that we can say is, that the
                    agitations of the nerves of the outward senses are the signais, which the Author
                    of nature has made the means of correspondence with the realities.” A again,
                    “Even the determined relations which are established, in a common act of
                    perception, have no more actual resemblance. How the consent, which is so
                    precise and constantes established, can neither be explained by anatomy nor by
                    physiology, nor by any mode of physical inquiry whatever.” May we not then
                    affirm that there is a thinking and sentient substance diffused over and
                    intimately united with the whole material frame, capable of acting on it in a
                    variety of ways, and of being as variously reacted on, yet that, though this be
                    no less incontestible than any truth in science, the human faculties cannot
                    possibly discover the grounds or nature of their relationship?</p>
                <p>But whilst our ignorance to this extent must be acknowledged, and even in regard
                    to functions not involving consciousness or intellect, there are grounds for
                    classifying the phenomena of the nervous system in connexion with its
                    distribution in point of structure. These have generally been arranged in two
                    large portions, called the cérébro-spinal and the sympathetic or ganglionic; to
                    which, a recent author, Dr. Marshall Hall, proposes adding a third division,
                    under the name of true spinal or excito-motory. According to this view, which
                    may be safely assumed without controversy on the present occasion, we have, in a
                    tabular form, exclusive of details,</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Cerebral,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sentient</hi> and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Voluntary System,</hi> divisible into, I. The Cerebrum,
                    comprehending its cortical and medullary substances, the hemispheres, anterior
                    lobes, corpora striata, thalami, and tuber annulare. II. The Cerebral nerves,
                    divisible into two classes, the sentient and the voluntary, the former of which
                    we have examples of in the olfactory, optic, and auditory nerves; and of the
                    latter in the oculo-motory, the masticatory, and myo-glossal. III. The
                    Cerebellum, comprehending its middle and lateral lobes. The first great
                    division, therefore, comprehends the whole of that part of the nervous system
                    which relates to sensation and volition in all their diversities. The centre
                    thereof is the cerebrum and cerebellμm. The sentient nerves run from the organs
                    of sense and external surfaces, first <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the cranium
                    or spine, and then <hi rend="italic">within</hi> both, <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                    that centre; <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207401" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7401-0583"
                    />whereas, the voluntary nerves take the reverse course, namely, from that
                    centre to the muscles of voluntary motion.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">True Spinal</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Excito-Motory
                    System</hi> —This is divisible into the true medulla and the true spinal nerves.
                    Under the former we have, the tubercula quadrigemina, medulla oblongata, and
                    medulla spinalis; under the latter are, the excitor and the reflex or motor
                    branches, both being exemplified in nerves distributed to the eye-lid, nostril,
                    fauces, larynx, pharynx, stomach, vesicae, and other parts, and having the
                    respective or relative offices implied in their generic titles. Speaking of this
                    division, Dr. Hall says, “The first, or the excitor nerves, pursue their course
                    principally from <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> surfaces, characterised by
                    peculiar susceptibilities, <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the true medulla oblongata
                    and spinalis; the second, or the motor nerves, pursue a reflex course <hi
                    rend="italic">from</hi> that medulla to muscles having peculiar actions
                    concerned principally in ingestion and egestion. The motions connected with the
                    cerebral subdivision are sometimes, nay frequently, <hi rend="italic"
                    >spontaneous</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> those connected with the true spinal
                    are, I believe, <hi rend="italic">always</hi> éxcited.” Considering, lastly, the
                    fifth and the posterior spinal nerves as allotted to the nutrition, &amp;c., of
                    organs, this gentleman subdivides the third great division, or ganglionic, into
                    the internal, comprising the sympathetic and pneumogastric; and the external,
                    comprising the above mentioned portions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    them, a subject very intimately connected with certain alleged causes, and
                    therefore with the nature, of insanity, may be briefly stated. “1. When the
                    action of the organ primarily excited, and that of the organ secondarily
                    implicated, both depend upon the cerebral nervous system, the communication
                    takes place through the medium of cerebral nerves, and the sympathy is cerebral,
                    whatever be the cerebral sensation or muscular movements which result. 2. When
                    both actions depend upon the ganglionic system, be they secretion, exhalation,
                    inflammation, &amp;c., the ganglionic nerves are necessarily the medium of
                    communication, and the sympathy is ganglionic. 3. When one of the actions
                    depends upon the cerebral, and the other upon the ganglionic system, the
                    sympathy is of a mixed nature. 4. When the primary excitement is applied to the
                    cerebral system, and the sympathetic affection depends upon the ganglionic, the
                    communication begins with the cérébro-spinal, and is transmitted to the
                    ganglionic system by some of their numerous anastomoses, and the sym-Íathy may
                    be termed cerebro-ganglionic, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa”</hi> n the
                    opinion of this author, the ganglionic system has no influence on the passions,
                    excepting in as far as it reflects on the brain those impressions which are
                    received from the viscera.</p>
                <p>The preceding statement shews the extreme intricacy of the nervous system, and
                    its wonderful subserviency to all the phenomena discoverable amongst animals.
                    One portion of this system, namely, the ganglionic, exists also in the vegetable
                    world. In fact, the functions performed by the nervous system are obviously
                    twofold; one class ministering. to consciousness, and the other being that by
                    which nutrition, secretion, and involuntary muscular action in all its forms,
                    are regulated. The former are simply channels of communication, or media of
                    transmission, between the external world and the sentient intelligent principle;
                    the latter, besides conveying impressions, are endowed with powers by which
                    specific effects are produced, independently of any direct agency in the brain
                    and spinal chord. Admitting the entire and harmonious state of both to be
                    requisite to perfect health of body and mind, the first class is more
                    particularly concerned in any theoretical view of insanity, and consequently
                    demands our special attention.</p>
                <p>Being divisible into sentient and voluntary, as already shewn, they are sometimes
                    separate in their course to or from various members and organs,but more often
                    bound up together in one investing sheath. The division, alteration or lesion of
                    the nerves, by any means whatever, suppresses or impairs their functions beyond
                    the point at which the injury is applied. The effects and symptoms of
                    disturbance in their functions, however produced, are of at least two kinds;
                    namely, those of depression and excitement, to which may be added vitiation or
                    change, not referable to either of these two. Injuries of the nerves are
                    characterised by different features or consequents, according to the nature of
                    the offending causes. These remarks apply, with some modifications, to the
                    spinal chord and to the contents of the encephalon. The former, like the nerves,
                    ministers to consciousness, and has at the same time an influence on anatomic
                    life. It has distinct fasciculi, destined to subserve sensation and volition; in
                    a certain degree it is an organ of transmission to, and for the exercise of its
                    functions, partly dependent on, the mass within the cranium; and like the
                    nerves, it is liable to various morbid affections, denoted by corresponding
                    symptoms, as loss of power, or sensation, or both, beyond the seat of
                    injury.</p>
                <p>Our information concerning the encephalic portion of the system is by no means
                    satisfactory. Of the medulla oblongata, however, we may observe that, besides
                    giving rise to nerves, in the same manner as the spinal chord, and proving the
                    channel of communication between it and the brain, it seems immediately to
                    connect the bodily frame with the sentient principle; and, hence, the entire
                    obliteration of consciousness follows the separation of this organ at a
                    particular point. That the cerebellum, again, is of material importance, not
                    only in the physical economy, but also in regard to certain affections of mind,
                    can hardly be doubted, though its physiology is exceedingly obscure. We are
                    inclined to believe that it is subservient to volition though in a manner quite
                    inexplicable; and, upon this hypothesis we should venture to reconcile numerous
                    experiments and observations to which it has been subjected. Of the cerebrum,
                    which is still more complex, we have already stated all that seems to be
                    necessary; concurring as we do in the opinion, that whilst it ministers to other
                    purposes, it is the organ instrumental to various affections of mind, moral and
                    intellectual. As in the case of individual nerves, so in that of the whole
                    encephalic contents, structure throws no light upon the offices performed; and
                    hence we can point out no peculiarity which fits any one portion for a distinct
                    and specific function. In truth, the most minute and correct observations, aided
                    by such experiments as were found practicable, have merely traced an alliance
                    between numerous phenomena and conditions of structure, leaving the <hi
                    rend="italic">rationale</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">operandi</hi> as much in the dark as ever. If this then be the
                    fact, in respect to the state of health, we need scarcely wonder at the
                    existence of similar or greater obscurity regarding the causes of disease. For
                    obvious reasons, they may altogether elude our researches; whilst, even if
                    discovered, they may afford no explanation. Sound philosophy must have
                    anticipated this conclusion. It holds good in all physical science, where we
                    discover only facts themselves, and observe these following one another in a
                    certain sequence or order, which, however, does not even imply their invariable
                    far less their necessary connection. In that still higher science, again, the
                    phenomena of which are characteristic of intellectual andmoral power, the idea
                    of causation by material agency, illogical in the former case, is rendered
                    obviously absurd by the existence of a principle devoid of all the qualities
                    which are amenable to the laws of chemistry, of mechanics, or even of organic
                    life.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207414" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7414-0584"/>
                <p>Accordingly, an able pathologist, Mayo, having discussed various affections of
                    the nerves depending on, or resulting from, changes of structure, thinks it
                    necessary to give up attemptingthe arrangement of disorders in the cerebral
                    functions on anatomical grounds; contenting himself, in the first instance, with
                    grouping them in natural families, and leaving for future examination those
                    conditions of the brain with which they are associated. Amongst these he
                    mentions derangement, which, according to him, “is either more a mental than a
                    corporeal disease, or else has to do with finer shades of alteration of
                    structure than anatomists can yet appreciate.” The remark appears to be
                    perfectly just. Whatever may be the features of the malady,.the appearances on
                    dissection are often very trivial, and may be paralleled in other cases where no
                    similar morbid symptoms were attendant. Moreover, they may have been the
                    effects, not the causes. In no way, perhaps, are they properly, or at all
                    essential, precursors of the symptoms; indeed, the actual morbid state or
                    organic lesion, on which these depend, may have vanished with them at death, or
                    subsequently. Lastly, there is reason to believe that madness, though often,
                    perhaps generally, if not always, a disease of the brain as regards function,
                    has occasionally its source in some other viscus. Les alterations organiques du
                    cerveau,” says Guislain, “sont, parfois, one cause manifeste de folie; parfois,
                    elles sont l’effet de cette dernière; et il y a des cas où il est difficile,
                    même impossible, d’en determiner la vraie origine.” Innumerable are the examples
                    of errors or delusions, am-mounting to positive and hopeless derangement; errors
                    in sensation, perception, propensity, affection, judgment, in fact, in every
                    department, for the solution or locality of which we shall vainly employ the
                    scalpel, syringe, or microscope of the dissecting room. But, notwithstanding the
                    disappointment thus to be expected, and the limits set to our researches, there
                    is much in the sentiments expressed by the same writer. “Je crois que la folie
                    est une maladie dont le siège est dans le cerveau; mais quand je la place dans
                    cet organe, j’entends parler du mal même, et non de sa cause. C’est sur ce point
                    que un grand nombre d’auteurs se sont expliqués avec une obscurité impénétrable.
                    On a dit: le siège de la folie est peut-être dans le foic, dans le coeur ou dans
                    tout autre organe; mais, cst-ce bien là que réside la maladie? n’est-ce pas une
                    cause de la folie qu’on y trouve? Etre en état de folie c’est, en effet, avoir
                    l’entendement troublé; et jamais on ne placera l’esprit dans la poitrine, ou
                    dans le ventre; mais ce sont les parties organiques renfermées dans ces cavités,
                    qui peuvent devenir le foyer de quelque altération, de quelque modification, que
                    re-agisse sur le cerveau, en causant la folie. Je dis, done, que l’aliénation
                    mentale est toujours une maladie du cerveau, mais qu’elle peut avoir pour <hi
                    rend="italic">cause</hi> l’anomalie de quelque autre organe.”<note

                    disease, the seat of which we must assign to the stomach, even although we
                    should fail to discover its cause in that organ.</p>
                <p>As to the precise condition of the part, or the nature of i the lesion, on which
                    insanity depends, there is some difference of opinion amongst those who agree
                    respecting its locality. Guislain conceives it to be a kind of sanguineous
                    orgasm orcrethism, meaning thereby a sudden injection of the blood-vessels,
                    nearly allied to what is called nervous excitement or irritation. Μ. Georget
                    deems it an ideopathic inflammation of the brain, whilst the disorders of
                    functions and parts remote from that organ are only incidental consequences.
                    Jacobi considers the cerebral affection as rather secondary, or of least
                    importance in the series of morbid changes; madness, according to him, being to
                    certain visceral diseases what delirium is to fevers arising from some visceral
                    inflammation. In our judgment, each of these views seems partially correct, that
                    is, it may be supported by a limited number of cases; and the error of the
                    theorists consists in the exclusion of facts equally cogent with those which are
                    produced and founded on. “On examining the brains of those who have died
                    insane,” says Mayo, “no constant appearance is met with. When the complaint has
                    not been of long standing, or modified by phrenetic attacks, no change at all is
                    observed. The commonest appearance, after continued mania, is thickening of the
                    arachnoid; this is indicative of former vascular action, which, however, has not
                    attended the ordinary course, but the occasional pyrexial exacerbation of the
                    malady. The more rare appearances, such as cysts and tumours of various kinds,
                    may be viewed rather as causes which have disposed the brain to the disease,
                    rendering it unusually irritable, than as themselves the sources of it. Or, in a
                    brain disposed by other circumstances to insanity, it is possible that these may
                    act as exciting causes.” We are inclined to generalize this last remark, on the
                    ground that, in peculiar constitutions, and possibly in all, under peculiar
                    circumstances, there needs only irritation in certain portions of the nervous
                    system, especially within the cranium, to bring on insanity; but we at the same
                    time admit, that every one of the appearances enumerated by Mayo, has been met
                    with in brains the possessors of which never shewed any symptoms of the disease.
                    It may be thought that the fact of the brain being a double organ, or consisting
                    of two hemispheres, each of which has similar functions, is sufficient to
                    account for such absence, where the appearance has been confined to one side
                    only; the healthy, perhaps even the increased activity of the other, subduing or
                    concealing the tendency to morbid manifestation. But admitting this idea as
                    perfectly probable, we recur to the former position, that the change of
                    structure is often an effect or incidental consequence of insanity, not its
                    cause; and we are convinced that, in the present state of physiological and
                    pathological science, the phenomena of insanity, like the creations of poetry or
                    the visions of a dream, which they somewhat resemble, must often be studied
                    without the hope of deriving aid from the material system.</p>
                <p>Without altogether coinciding with Heinroth, wħo seems to regard moral depravity
                    as the essential cause of insanity, or of Mayo, who thinks “it is practically
                    more useful to view this disease as a disease of the mind,” we are nevertheless
                    satisfied that logic, ethics, and religion, as well as anatomy, pathology, and
                    medicine, must be bad recourse to in developing and treating its phenomena. The
                    best known exciting or productive causes of the malady shew the expediency of
                    admitting both of the systems of interpretation thus briefly stated, more
                    especially if taken in conjunction with circumstances which may be deemed
                    antecedents or predisposing causes.</p>
                <p>On whatever insanity depends, it prevails in particular families to a degree that
                    warrants the title of hereditary; whilst, throughout many generations, not an
                    example of it has been met with in others. In the former there are peculiarities
                    of constitution, habits, and tendencies to the disease, which may be said to
                    form a predisposition. Apart from connate aptitude, another species originates
                    with individuals, from vicious indulgences, excessive occupation, neglect of
                    general health, want of due mental training, errors in opinion and belief
                    wilfully or carelessly entertained, relinquishment of business or pursuits which
                    afforded salutary exercise of thought, the adoption of modes of life
                    incompatible with previous tastes and propensities, and subjection to whatever
                    excites or debilitates the nervous system above or below a certain point. Any of
                    these circumstances may operate so as to occasion a susceptibility of the dis
                    ∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207427" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7427-0585"/>
                <p>ease, which, again, may directly result from them as productive causes. In some
                    states, there needs only a sudden or a strong impression, to upset the reason,
                    and bring on decided madness; and it even appears, that, whether from
                    irritation, or some incomprehensible principle of mental contagion, this malady,
                    like a plague or other pestilence, has often in rapid succession, visited a
                    number of persons who were placed in similar circumstances-</p>
                <p>As to the influence of sex, viewed in the light of a predisposition, we are
                    inclined to believe, that the difference between male and female is trivial, if
                    at all discernible, as affecting the number or proportion of the insane, though
                    by no means immaterial in modifying the kind or the form of the disease. But, in
                    considering this point, attention must be paid to the relative frequency or
                    dominion of the different predisposing and productive causes respectively
                    operating upon men and women. Insanity is very Tare before puberty; the period
                    in which its visitations are most frequent is between twenty-five and sixty; but
                    cases of it occur at seventy and upwards. What is called temperament seems
                    rather to qualify the type, than to be of much consequence as to the amount of
                    persons attacked. A predisposition arises from the malady itself, so that where,
                    it has once occurred, there is an increased liability to attack. Comparing
                    barbarous and civilized countries, insanity prevails more in the latter, and is
                    scarcely known amongst purely savage tribes; but, whilst society unquestionably
                    multiplies its causes, we are unable to detect in the improvement of our species
                    .any abstract reason for greater proclivity. Upon the same prin- 'ciple, we
                    ought to discriminate between education, taken in*gencral, and those misguided
                    systems to which fashion, caprice, vanity, and avarice often lend a currency.
                    Precor city of talent or genius, the idol of foolish parents, is a common enough
                    source of imbecility, and madness, and early death. It requires anxious
                    solicitude, but is not a theme for boasting. Mysterious as the fact may appear,
                    there is a convertibility between derangement and some other morbid affections,
                    so that the same individual may be subjected to them alternately or in
                    succession, and this frequently throughout a long period of life; and there are
                    cases equally marvellous, but more consolatory, in which, when an acute disease
                    has inflicted torture on the bodily frame, the mind which for years did not
                    emulate childhood, or was the victim of despair, becomes disenthralled, and
                    asserts the dignity of human nature.</p>
                <p>The productive causes ofinsanity are usually divided into physical and moral.
                    Amongst the former, are injuries of the head, the abuse of stimulants, sensual
                    vices, irritation of the intestinal canal, and morbid affections of the uterine
                    system. The catalogue of the latter embraces all agencies operating directly
                    upon the mind, and its own states or conditions. “Duplex est vis animorum atque
                    naturae. Una pars in appetitu posita est, quae est <hi rend="italic">ὁ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">pμ</hi><hi rend="italic">ὴ</hi> Graece, quae hominem· huc et illuc

                    sit: ita fit, ut ratio praes it, appetitus obtemperet.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cicero <hi rend="italic">de Off.</hi> i.
                    28.</p></note> Authors dispute as to the comparative influence of these two
                    classes, some ascribing most to physical, and others to moral causes; but,
                    whilst the distinction itself cannot always be nicely drawn, the calculations of
                    observers, are greatly at variance. We allude particularly to Pinel, Esquirol,
                    and Guislain, the discrepancies of whose statements, preclude any great
                    confidence in the speculative conclusions deduced from them. What, then, shall
                    be said of the doctrine maintained by Heinroth, according to whom, “il n’y a
                    qu’une cause de trouble intellectuel, et elle reside dans une prédisposition de
                    l’ame même: un moral dépravé; Thabitude des crimes?” To this the best answer,
                    perhaps, may be given in the words of Guislain: « Le système de Heinroth,
                    envisage dans ses details, n’est pas tout-à-fait dénué de vérité; car, si nous
                    jetons un coup d’oeil sur les différens caractères des hommes, nous y
                    rencontrons, à chaque moment, cette prédisposition.” “Si Heinroth,” he adds,
                    “avait été moins général dans ses conclusions, s’il eût envisagé le moral sous
                    le rapport qu’il a avec les fonctions du corps, sa théorie aurait, peut-être, pu
                    mener à d’heureux résultats: au reste, cet auteur est abstrait et hypothétique,
                    dans tout ce qu’il avance sur les aliénations mentales; il se livre, par fois, à
                    des raisonnemens qu’on croirait à peine être fait par un médécin.” Dr. Prichard
                    also admits that the system has a partial foundation in truth, but adds that “a
                    great proportion of the cases of insanity which occur arise from causes
                    independent of any moral weakness or defect.” Insanity by no means stands alone
                    in the predicament of transgression; for the reasoning of Heinroth might equally
                    apply to fever, rheumatism, and many other diseases. Wè can trace this disease,
                    where the supposition of immorality would be as absurd as it is uncharitable.
                    Jacobi, animadverting on Heinroth’s speculations, relates the case of an amiable
                    woman, who, after years of most virtuous conduct, and active benevolence,
                    especially towards insane persons, became deranged, but recovered before death.
                    “Now let Professor Heinroth,” says he, “direct his attention to the character of
                    this excellent individual, and from the point of view which he assumes, explain
                    how the state of mental darkness to which she was reduced can be regarded as the
                    result of guilt and evil conscience, connected as it was with long-continued ill
                    health, and in all probability depending on a chronic bodily disease under which
                    she had for a long time laboured.” Every one must have heard of similar
                    instances. Foι∙ our own part, we should deem the authenticated accounts of
                    violent madness arising solely from the want of food, and, still more of water,
                    during shipwreck, conclusive against the doctrine, to the extent of its
                    discarding physical causes.</p>
                <p>Enough has been said to point out the sources of those numerous diversities in
                    the forms and symptoms of insanity which engage the medical practitioner, and to
                    which, at the expense of very little genius or learning, the principles of
                    classification and nomenclature have been· applied. Were either physiology or
                    metaphysics perfect, an arrangement of the entire phenomena presented by the
                    disease, together with suitable titles, would be comparatively an easy task. But
                    despairing of this, we content ourselves.with divisionsand terms, which, though
                    objectionable on the ground of logic, or not comprehensive of every peculiarity,
                    are convenient in the way of reference and description. For our purpose, two
                    plans, having different characters, may be set down as contrasts; one aiming
                    simply at utility to the physician; the other claiming dignity in alliance with
                    mental philosophy.</p>
                <p>Dr. Prichard, availing himself of preceding systems and his own experience,
                    distinguishes four principal forms of this malady, namely: 1. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moral insanity,</hi> being a perversion of the feelings, affections,
                    inclinations, temper, habits, &amp;c., without any remarkable disorder or defect
                    of intellect, and without illusion or hallucination. 2. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monomania,</hi> or partial insanity, consisting in the influence or dominion of
                    some special illusion, which generates one train of thought, or fixes attention
                    to a single object; whereas, when otherwise directed, the intellectual powers
                    seem unimpaired. 3. <hi rend="italic">Mania,</hi> or raving madness, denoted by
                    general derangement of the understanding; the reasoning faculty being either
                    entirely lost, or disturbed throughout all its exercises, and the patient,
                    consequently talking absurdly on all subjects to which his thoughts maybe
                    directed. 4. <hi rend="italic">Dementia,</hi> or incoherence, characterised by
                    rapid succession of ideas and emotions, hav <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207440"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7440-0586"/>ing little or no connection with forgetfulness;
                    diminished attention, and loss of judgment. Assuming that all the varieties of
                    madness may thus be classified, Dr. Prichard thinks that it maybe described as a
                    chronic disease, manifested by deviations from the natural and healthy state of
                    the mind; these “consisting either in a moral perversion, or a disorder of the
                    feelings, &amp;c., or intellectual derangement, partial or general, or, lastly,
                    confounding or destroying the connexions or associations of ideas.”</p>
                <p>Heinroth’s method proceeds on a three-fold division of the mental operations,
                    accordingly as those relate to feeling or sentiment, understanding, and will.
                    Hence, we have, for the principal modifications: I. Disorders of the moral
                    dispositions: 1. Exultation or excessive intensity, of feelings, passions, and
                    emotions; and, 2. Depression, including simple melancholy, dejection without
                    illusion. II. Disorders of understanding, or the intellectual faculties: 1.
                    Exaltation, undue intensity of imagination, producing illusions; and, 2.
                    Depression, feebleness of conception, imbecility of judgment. III. Disorders of
                    the voluntary powers: 1. Exaltation, violence of will and propensities; and, 2.
                    Depression, weakness or incapacity of will, moral imbecility.</p>
                <p>Instead of commenting on these or other schemes of arrangement, we shall merely
                    remark, that, in practice, the same case frequently displays considerable
                    variety, so as to run through nearly any system of classification; that, in
                    general, it is more expedient to consider special errors and defects in relation
                    to the mind taken as a whole, than as restricted to one or other of its supposed
                    compartments or provinces ;’ that, in whatever manner we view or divide the
                    mental operations, it is advisable to regard their apparent perversion, as a
                    modification distinct from either their excitement above or dimunition below
                    what constitutes the healthy state; and that, whilst physiology assures us there
                    are numerous diversities of functions, each of which has its allotted
                    instrument, it is consistent equally with our knowledge and our ignorance to
                    detect and specify the precise symptoms of their diseases rather than to find “a
                    local habitation and a name” for them in any metaphysical nosology.</p>
                <p>The subject of treatment is too technical, for a summary like the present; but a
                    few observations thereon may nevertheless be hazarded. As the brain and nervous
                    system, form an important part of the animal economy, and as they are affected
                    by all the laws which regulate it, their morbid conditions must be treated
                    according to those principles and plans which have been found expedient and
                    serviceable in the maladies of other portions. The peculiar functions with which
                    these parts are endowed, undergo changes which may afford corresponding
                    indications of cure; but the latter cannot be fulfilled by agents possessing
                    specific virtues, nor by any exclusive procedure. For unsound minds, as for
                    fractured limbs, the boldness of quackery has hitherto announced few sovereign
                    remedies; and, believing that there is really none such, experienced physicians
                    have recourse to measures ordinarily available in their profession. They
                    endeavour, according to circumstances, to subdue inflammation, to allay
                    excitement, to remove irritating causes, to counteract depression, to promote
                    digestive action, to regulate the secretions, and excretions, to promote or
                    maintain strength; in short, to establish good physical health, as a requisite
                    (sometimes the only one) to the acquisition and enjoyment of mental sanity.
                    Attention to these points must commence and terminate with the case, which,
                    however obstinate, or seemingly hopeless, ought never to be entirely abandoned,
                    or left to the nostrums of unscientific keepers. Much more, not of a medical
                    character, is frequently necessary, and can only be supplied in appropriate
                    asylums. The benefits to be derived from these are immense, and cannot be too
                    highly estimated. Contrary to a vulgar and unjust prejudice, the features by
                    which they are best known most powerfully recommend them. They offer greater
                    safety than can be secured amidst the erroneous tenderness, the injudicious
                    efforts, the distraction, and often the dreadful apprehensions, of relations and
                    friends ;—the retirement and seclusion, which they immediately accomplish, are
                    proved by innumerable undoubted testimonies to be not only conducive, but, in
                    certain cases, necessary, to allay irritability, destroy delusions, and give
                    full effect to professional skill ;—whilst, in the control which they exercise,
                    the self-restraint which they cherish, the regularity of habits which they are
                    calculated to generate, the occupation afforded to the strong, the repose and
                    solace to the feeble, the direct supervision and prompt help to all, there is a
                    combination of positive and negative advantages,which not only divests insanity
                    of much of its horrors, by concealing or subduing them, but actually obtains a
                    victory over it scarcely equalled by medicine in any other formidable disease.
                    In some establishments of the kind, the average of recoveries is from sixty to
                    eighty, and even ninety per cent.; that of thirty or forty being reckoned small
                    in our day. Any of these results is gratifying to humanity.</p>
                <p>As a knowledge of the nature and seat of disease is essential to the adoption of
                    a right method of cure, we can make large allowance for errors which long
                    prevailed in the treatment of insanity. In truth, the works professedly written
                    on this branch of medicine were few; and, before the middle of last century, it
                    obtained comparatively little attention. The remedial measures were at first
                    nearly altogether superstitious. For a long time they seem to have been mostly
                    empirical, or suggested by incidental circumstances. In many instances they must
                    be charged with cruelty, or at least gross want of sympathy; and very few of
                    them, indeed, can be traced to any thing like a just theory either of mind or of
                    the corporeal frame. Convincing proofs of these remarks'will be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Traite</hi><hi rend="italic">du Delire,</hi> by Fodéré, to which
                    the reader is referred. Amongst the writers enumerated by this author as
                    deserving of notice, are Coelius Aurelianus, who reprobated severity, and
                    prescribed on the whole a gentle treatment, both medical and moral; Avicenna,
                    whose employment of emetics, purgatives, bleeding, bathing, and the like, had an
                    appearance of moderation, not a little contrasted, unhappily, by the use of the
                    actual cautery and other harsh measures; Savanarola, a physician of the
                    sixteenth century, remarkable for inculcating a judicious moral procedure, yet
                    practising sundry modes of castigation to an extent scarcely consistent with
                    humanity; Plater, Rivière, Sennertus, and others in the seventeenth century,
                    diligent but rather indiscriminate advocates of what has been styled the
                    antiphlogistic system; Mathiolus and Etmüller, who introduced certain
                    preparations of antimony, with a view to the evacuation of black bile, which was
                    long supposed to be materially concerned in one species of derangement; Wepfer,
                    no less strenuous in his admiration of mercury, which he used with a liberal
                    hand, sometimes-combined with opium; and Sydenham, the Hippocrates of England,
                    whose sagacity in detecting diversities of madness was equalled by the
                    appropriateness of his therapeutic efforts, but who does not seem to have had
                    employment enough in this department of his profession to do more than point out
                    the expediency of improvement. This may be said to have been effected gradually,
                    by Mead, Morton, Wedel, Camerarius, Vogel, Lorry, Stoll, and other
                    practitioners, till we reach the days of Willis in England, who, though not a
                    physician, delighted his countrymen and astonished the world by his triumph over
                    this malady, especially in the case of George III., at a period when, judging
                    from prevalent opinions, the idea of success was regarded as almost visionary.
                    His assertion, that nine persons out of ten had recovered, when placed under his
                    care within three months from the attack, excited nearly universal scepticism;
                    and, in allowing his majesty to make use of a razor, whilst he himself stood <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194207453" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7453-0587"/> by as a
                    spectator, a great part of the nation, besides being alarmed, saw ground for
                    doubt whether the royal patient or his attendant were the more insane. From this
                    event, though the proportion of cures may have rarely been such as Willis
                    declared, it is certain that medicine has acquired a decided mastery over the
                    class of mental diseases. In proof of what is here stated, we might appeal to
                    the results of practice in numerous establishments, or disclosed by various
                    individuals through the medium of the press; but, instead of naming the most
                    eminent of those who have thus promoted science, we deem it better to narrate an
                    occurrence of high interest, which, in addition to the personal virtue it
                    displays, sets forth the nature of an improvement in which humanity must ever
                    rejoice.</p>
                <p>In the year 1792, when a system of most barbarous coercion prevailed almost
                    universally in the prisons of maniacs, the elder Pinel, after repeatedly, but
                    vainly, urging that his government would permit the unchaining of patients in
                    the Bicêtre, made personal application to certain authorities for this purpose,
                    and eventually, though with much difficulty, succeeded. He was accompanied in
                    his benevolent visit by Couthon, a member of the commune, who seems to have been
                    rather forced than persuaded into the measure, and whose reluctance was
                    increased when he encountered the horrid noises and wild aspect of the miserable
                    beings upon whom the experiment was about to be performed. “Do with them what
                    you please,” said he to Pinel, “but I fear you will be their victim.” The only
                    reply was a commencement of the operation, by preparing as many strong
                    waistcoats as might be required instead of the chains hitherto used. Twelve
                    patients being selected for the trial, one of these, reckoned equal to any in
                    ferocity, was an English officer, the particulars of whose history were unknown,
                    save that he had been in fetters forty years, and that in a fit of frenzy he had
                    inflicted a fatal blow on his keeper; a deed which, of course, led to greater
                    restraint, and justified much caution in approaching him. Entering his cell
                    without attendants, and speaking gently, “Captain,” said Pinel, “I will order
                    your chains to be taken of f; and give you leave to walk in the court, if you
                    will promise to behave well, and not to injure any person.” “Yes, I promise,”
                    was the answer, “but you only laugh; you are all too much afraid of me.” “There
                    are six men at my command, if necessary,” rejoined Pinel, “but believe my word,
                    I will give you liberty, provided you put on this waistcoat.” The offer was
                    silently but cheerfully accepted, the keepers retired, and the door of the cell
                    was left open. After several attempts to raise himself from a position which had
                    so long cramped his limbs, and having partly succeeded in managing his
                    equilibrium, the captain at length tottered into the free air, when, looking up
                    to the sky, he cried out with enthusiastic delight, “How beautiful !” During the
                    rest of the day he moved about constantly, often expressing the pleasure he
                    experienced; in the evening be went voluntarily to his own cell, where a better
                    couch than he had been accustomed to was prepared for him; and during two years
                    afterwards, he was not only undisturbed by such paroxysms as he had formerly
                    exhibited, but rendered himself serviceable in the management of other
                    patients.</p>
                <p>The next subject of experiment proved to be a soldier of the guards, had who been
                    in chains for ten years, and whose case had also called for extraordinary
                    vigilance. Pinel, thoroughly acquainted with his delusions and character,
                    promised the same relief; adding, by way of encouragement, that he should be
                    employed in setting others at liberty, and, on good behaviour, taken into
                    service. The desired effect was realized. Upon being set free, the poor fellow
                    shewed at once his gratitude and obliging disposition; following Pinel with an
                    anxious eye, performing every order given to him, and speaking reasonably as
                    well as kindly to the patients. During the rest of his life, this man continued
                    devotedly attached to Pinel, whose son, the narrator of these affecting
                    incidents, speaks of him with tenderness as a partner in his own childish
                    games.</p>
                <p>In the cases of three Prussian soldiers, who bad been chained for many years,
                    though in general calm and inoffensive, the experiment seems to have given them
                    alarm, lest new severities were to be inflicted, and it proved inefficacious, as
                    the patients, either worn out by grief, or having become quite imbecile, were
                    insensible of the blessing conferred upon them. In the instance of a priest,
                    advanced in life, who had displayed religious excitement in one of its most
                    imposing forms, the release from chains, accompanied by a judicious order on the
                    part of Pinel, proved very satisfactory. That able physician directed the
                    attendants, instead of speaking to the patient, to practise his own exalted
                    reserve. The result was such as imprisonment and fetters never did nor could
                    produce. Gradually humbled and brought down to a level with mankind, he mixed in
                    the society of other patients, and, ere a twelvemonth had expired, he was
                    dismissed from the Bicêtre.</p>
                <p>Such are a few particulars of a plan of treatment pursued in regard to more than
                    fifty maniacs, of different countries and various conditions, with a success
                    which at once surpassed hope, put the opposite method to shame, and, by its
                    soothing influence, gave to other remedial measures a chance of operating
                    beneficially. We should decline presenting a contrast to the picture, by
                    adducing the horrid disclosures made in England, at a subsequent period by a
                    parliamentary committee, were there not a good purpose to be served by keeping
                    the memory of them alive, as an incentive and admonition.</p>
                <p>The report to the House of Commons, dated the 11th of July 1815, commences by
                    stating how sensible the members of the committee were of the importance of the
                    matter entrusted to them, and their earnestness in performing the duty which
                    they had undertaken, assigning the mass of evidence collected as a proof that
                    their inquiries had been extensive. Then follows a sentence which may be liable
                    to animadversion. “It was their intention to make observations in detail on the
                    several heads of the examination taken before them, and on the several public
                    and private establishments for the reception of insane persons; but, on
                    reconsidering the whole subject, they have thought it advisable, in the first
                    instance, to make their report more general.” This determination was more
                    prudent than wise; for it may be remarked, first, that the primary intention, if
                    carried into effect, would have been more satisfactory than the course actually
                    adopted; and, secondly, that the reasons for the latter are by no means
                    distinctly specified. The committee were very probably restrained by the
                    consideration that the length of the inquiry had prevented a bill on the subject
                    fi∙om being passed during that session. But, be this as it may, the report
                    proceeds thus: “Your committee cannot hesitate to suggest, with the utmost
                    confidence, from the evidence they now offer to the house, that some new
                    provision of law is indispensably necessary for insuring better care being taken
                    of insane persons, both in England and Ireland, than they have hitherto
                    experienced, the number of whom appears to be very considerable, as the
                    inquiries of the committee have convinced them that there are not in the country
                    a set of beings more immediately requiring the protection of the legislature
                    than the persons in this state, a very large proportion of whom are entirely
                    neglected by their relations and friends. If the treatment of those in the
                    middling or in the lower classes of life, shut up in hospitals, private
                    mad-houses, or parish workhouses, is looked at, your committee are persuaded
                    that a case cannot be found where the necessity for a remedy is more urgent.”
                    After alluding to some houses, (a few only), in which the arrangement was
                    comparatively good, and the treatment kind, the report proceeds: “But it is in
                    proof, that there is just and great cause <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207466"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7466-0588"/>of complaint against by far the greater part of
                    the houses of this description, which have hardly, in any instance, been built
                    for the purpose, and are incapable of being conveniently adapted to it;” the
                    favourable examples, only four in number, being specified by the committee.</p>
                <p>The observations of the committee in support of their general allegation, are
                    then classed under nine heads, as follows, viz.: 1. “Keepers of houses receiving
                    a much greater number of persons in them than they are calculated for; and the
                    consequent want of accommodation for the patients, which greatly retards
                    recovery. They are, indeed, represented by the president of the College of
                    Physicians, and the physician acting as secretary to the visiting commissioners,
                    who must be considered as the most competent judges on the subject, to be better
                    calculated for the imprisonment than the cure of patients.” 2. “The
                    insufficiency of the number of keepers, in proportion to that of patients, which
                    unavoidably leads to a proportionably greater degree of restraint than they
                    would otherwise be under.” 3. “Mixing patients who are outrageous with those who
                    are quiet and inoffensive; and those who are insensible to the calls of nature
                    with the cleanly.” 4. “The want of medical assistance applied to the malady, a
                    point worthy of the most serious attention, as tire practice very generally is
                    to confine medical aid to corporeal complaints; which circumstance the committee
                    are the more desirous of enforcing on the house, as an opinion has been given by
                    a respectable physician and another person of great experience, that when the
                    mental faculties are only partially affected, medical assistance is of the
                    highest importance.” 5. “Restraint of persons much beyond what is necessary,
                    certainly retarding recovery, even beyond what is occasioned by the crowded
                    state of the house.” Of this many instances are given by the committee. 6. This
                    article relates to the situation of parish paupers confined in workhouses,
                    regarding whom the committee made some inquiries, “as connected with the matter
                    before them, although not expressly included in the reference to them.” 7∙
                    “Detention of persons, the state of whose minds did not require confinement. On
                    this ground of complaint the committee had very slender means of information.”
                    8. “Insufficiency of certificates on which patients are received into
                    mad-houses.” 9- “The defective visitation of private mad-houses, under the
                    provisions of the 14 Geo. III. c.49.”</p>
                <p>After this enumeration, the committee refer to Ireland, as demanding even more
                    urgently than England some further provision for the safety and welfare of
                    insane persons; and, having adverted to other topics, they express themselves as
                    persuaded “that when the extent of the evil pointed out in this report shall be
                    generally known, the visiting physicians in London and its neighbourhood will,
                    as far as the professional calls upon them will permit, give additional
                    attention to the duty they have been desirous of discharging.” The
                    committee-also trusted that justices of the peace would “watch as narrowly as
                    circumstances would admit, over the conduct of the keepers of houses ;” and that
                    magistrates generally throughout the kingdom would think the condition of insane
                    persons worthy of their attention, and convey information to the Secretary of
                    State, if in any case of abuse a prosecution might be deemed requisite.” The
                    committee concluded byresolving, “thatthe chairman be directed to move the
                    house, that leave be given to bring in a bill to amend and enforce the
                    provisions of the act of the 14th Geo. III. c. 49,-intituled, “an act for
                    regulating mad-houses.”</p>
                <p>Every one who peruses the evidence produced upon this occasion, must think the
                    report itself less impressive than it might have been made, without any other
                    labour than that of condensing statements and arranging facts. Members of the
                    house, having access to copies, and taking interest in the subject, could no
                    doubt supply its deficiency by the exercise of their own judgment, but at this
                    period the public at large needed to be directly and powerfully roused. Looking,
                    moreover, to the almost total absence of any strong public feeling of
                    indignation regarding flagrant instances of cruelty and systematic
                    mal-administration, one might be tempted to imagine that the committee either
                    had not themselves been convinced by the testimonies before them, or were
                    apprehensive of producing a dangerous excitement throughout the country. The
                    discoveries at York alone,' indeed, were enough to inflame one province. But
                    what was the ultimate result? We answer in the words of a journal,’ which lent
                    its powerful aid in diffusing both knowledge and right feeling over society
                    :—“Under their tranquil but steady guidance, (alluding to the Society of
                    Friends, and to events long previous to the conimittee’s inquiry), a new
                    establishment was formed, that began the great revolution upon this subject,
                    which we trust the provisions of parliament will complete. Their institution, by
                    gentle methods,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> vol. xxviii.</p></note> &amp;c., achieved
                    what all the talents and public spirit of Mason and his friends had failed to
                    accomplish. It had still better effects,—the complete overthrow of the old
                    system.” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Nay, what was the immediate effect of
                    the appointment of the committee, and the anxiety it displayed? Decided
                    advantage to many sufferers. A speech of Lord Robert Seymour in the House of
                    Commons, penetrated Bethlem Hospital, and produced reformation. But there
                    remained much to be done elsewhere; and the fate of a bill for the better
                    regulation of mad-houses, presented by the committee, showed how difficult was
                    the task to secure complete relief. It passed the Commons, but got no further.
                    It was again brought forward next session, and lost in the Upper House, or, more
                    properly speaking, only postponed, with a view to the rectification of defects
                    then suggested; and, even at the distance of several years, though the
                    legislature interfered, there existed, in various establishments, abuses
                    sufficient to justify the severe reprehensions of another committee.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Scotland and Ireland, at different periods and in various ways,
                    received the attention of the legislature. We cannot afford space to treat of
                    what relates to both, or enter upon details respecting either. It is sufficient
                    to say, that an act to regulate madhouses in the former was passed during 1815,
                    and, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> empowered Sherifts-depute to make
                    inspections throughout their jurisdictions, and to send reports thereof to two
                    bodies, the Court of Justiciary, and the College of Physicians of Edinburgh;
                    that the duty thus enjoined has ever since been performed with unquestionable
                    benefit, though scarcely known to the public; but that, notwithstanding the good
                    intended or affected by it, one great class of society, in the most unhappy of
                    all circumstances, (namely, pauper lunatics,) is left without adequate
                    provision. The opposition to the bill, proposed for their relief by Lord
                    Haddington, entailed a stigma upon this country, which nothing but the most
                    strenuous exertions, and unwonted liberality, will ever obliterate. Scotland,
                    educated, and enlightened as she pretends to be, and with some justice, is
                    disgraced by the absence of national or provincial asylums for these
                    unfortunates; and, in regard to institutions of the kind, which approximate to a
                    really public character, the metropolis is actually inferior to many of the
                    provincial towns, to Glasgow, Dundee, Perth, Aberdeen, Dumfries, and some
                    others. Of late, however, efforts have been made, by several benevolent
                    individuals to wipe off this reproach; the subject has been examined in all its
                    details; and as inquiry is the certain precursor of improvement, there can be
                    little doubt, we should think, that the principal evils felt and complained of
                    will, ere long, be, in a great measure, corrected. &gt; (κ. κ. κ. κ.) <pb
