                    eminent classical editor, of a foreign family, was born in 1668. He was educated
                    at Westminster school, where Dr Busby kept him to the study of Greek and Latin
                    some years longer than usual. He then gained another powerful friend in Dr
                    South, canon of Christ Church, who made him a student of that house, where he
                    took the degree of master of arts early in 1696. From' 1695 till 1699, he was
                    second master of Westminster school, which· was afterwards indebted to him for
                    Graecae Linguae Dialecti, in usum Scholae Westmonastericnsis, 1706, 8vo, and
                    also for the English Grammar, applied to, and exemplified in, the English
                    Tongue, 1712, 8vo. In 1711, he published Remarks on Whiston’s Account of the
                    proceedings of Convocation relative to himself, in a Letter to the Bishop of
                    Bath and Wells, 8vo; and also an Essay against Arianism, and some other
                    Heresies, in reply to Whiston’s historical Preface and Appendix to his Primitive
                    Christianity Revived, 8vo. In 1709 he gave the first specimen of his skill in
                    typographical antiquities, by publishing Stephanorum Historia, vitas ipsorum ac
                    libros complectens, 8vo. This was followed in 1717 by Historia Typographorum
                    aliquot Parisiensium, vitas et libros complectens, 8vo; and in 1719 appeared
                    Annales Typographie! ab artis inventae origine ad annum <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >m.d.</hi> 4to. The second volume, divided into two parts, and continued to the
                    year 1536, was published at the Hague in 1702, prefaced by a letter of Toland,
                    under the title of Conjectura verisimilis de prima Typography Inventione; the
                    third volume, in two parts, continued to 1557, and (by an appendix) to 1664,
                    issued from the same press in 1725; and in 1733 was published at Amsterdam what
                    was usually considered as the fourth volume, under the title of Annales
                    Typographici ab artis inventae origine, ad annum <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    tomus quintus et ultimus, indicem in tomos quatuor praceuntes complectens,
                    divided, like the two preceding volumes, into two parts. In the intermediate
                    years, Mr Maittaire was diligently employed on various works of importance. In
                    1713 he published by subscription Opera et Fragmenta Veterum Poetarum, 1713, in
                    two volumes in folio; but the title of some copies is dated 1721. In 1714, he
                    edited a Greek Testament, in two volumes. The Latin writers, which he published
                    separately, most of them with good indexes, came out in the following order: In
                    1713, Christus Patiens, Justin, Lucretius. Phaedrus, Sallust, Terence; in 1715,
                    Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, Cornelius Nepos, Florus, Horace, Juvenal, Ovid
                    in three vols., and Virgil; in 1711, Caesar’s Commentaries, Martial, and Quintus
                    Curtius; in 1718 and 1725, Velleius Paterculus; in 1719, Lucan; and in 1720,
                    Bonefonii Carmina. In 1721, he published, Batrachomyomachia, Graece, ad veterum
                    exemplarium fidem recusa; glossa Graeca, variantibus lectionibus, versionibus
                    Latinis, commentariis et indicibus, illustrata, 8vo; and in 1722, Miscellanea
                    Graecorum aliquot Scriptorum Carmina, cum versione Latina et notis, in 4to. In
                    1724 he compiled, at the request of Dr John Freind, an index to the works of
                    Aretaeus, intended to accompany the folio edition of that author published in
                    1723. In 1725 he published an edition of Anacreon in 4to, of which only a
                    hundred copies were printed, and the few errata in each copy corrected by his
                    own hand. In 1726 he published Petri Petiti Medici Parisiensis in tres priores
                    Aretaei Cappadocis Libros Commentarii, nunc primum editi, in 4to. This learned
                    commentary was found amongst the papers of Graevius. From 1728 to 1733 he was
                    employed in publishing Marmorum Arundelianorum, Seldenianorum, aliorumque
                    Academiae Oxoni-ensi donatorum, una cum Commentariis et Indice, editio secunda,
                    folio, to which an appendix was printed in 1733; <pb break="no"

                    Maittaire ad D. P. des Maizeaux, in qua Indices in Annales Typographico methodus
                    explicatur, printed in the Present State of the Republic of Letters, for 1733
                    (p. 142). The life of Robert Stephens in Latin, revised and corrected by the
                    author, with a new and complete list of his works, is prefixed to the improved
                    edition of Stephens’s Thesaurus, 4 vols. in folio, which appeared in 1734. In
                    1736 was published Antiquae Inscriptiones duae, folio, being a commentary on two
                    large copper tables discovered near Heraclea, in the bay of Tarentum. In the
                    year 1738 were printed at the Hague, Graecae Ling'uae Dialecti in Scholae Rcgiae
                    Westmonasteriensis usum recogniti, opera Mich. Maittaire. In 1739 he addressed
                    to the empress of Russia a small Latin poem, under the title of Carmen
                    Epi-cinium Augustissimae Russorum Imperatrici sacrum. He was also editor of
                    Plutarch’s Apophthegmata, 1641, in 4to. The last publication of Maittaire was a
                    volume of poems in 4to, 1742, under the title of Senilia, sive Poetica aliquot
                    in argumentis varii generis Tentamina. Mr Maittaire died in 1747, aged
                    seventy-nine. His valuable library, which had been fifty years collecting, was
                    sold by auction at the close of the same year and the beginning of the
                    following, taking up in all forty-four nights. Mr Maittaire was patronized by
                    the first Earl of Oxford, both before and after that gentleman’s elevation to
                    the peerage, and he continued to be a favourite with his son the second earl; he
                    was also Latin tutor to Mr Stanhope, the Earl of Chesterfield’s favourite
                    son.</p>
