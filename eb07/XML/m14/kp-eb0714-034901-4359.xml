                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">μηχavn, a
                    machine,</hi> is the science which inquires into the laws of the equilibrium and
                    motion of solid bodies; into the forces by which bodies, whether animate or
                    inanimate, may be made to act upon one another; and into the means by which
                    these may be increased so as to overcome such as are more powerful. The term <hi
                    rend="italic">mechanics</hi> was originally applied to the doctrine of
                    equilibrium. It has by some late writers been extended to the motion and
                    equilibrium of all bodies, whether solid, fluid, or aeriform; and has been
                    employed to comprehend the sciences of hydrodynamics and pneumatics.</p>
                <p>HISTORY.</p>
                <p>As the science of mechanics is intimately connected with the arts of life, and
                    particularly with those which exist even in the rudest ages of society, the
                    construction of machines must have arrived at considerable perfection before the
                    theory of equilibrium, or the simplest properties of the mechanical powers, had
                    engaged the attention of philosophers. We accordingly find that the lever, the
                    pulley, the crane, the capstan, and other simple machines, were employed by the
                    ancient architects in elevating the materials of their buildings, long before
                    the dawn of mechanical science; and the military engines of the Greeks and
                    Romans, such as the catapultae and balistae, exhibit an extensive acquaintance
                    with the construction of compound machinery. In the splendid remains of Egyptian
                    architecture, which in every age have excited the admiration of the world, we
                    perceive the most surprising marks of mechanical genius. The elevation of
                    immense masses of stone to the tops of these stupendous fabrics, must have
                    required an accumulation of mechanical power which is not in the possession of
                    modern architects.</p>
                <p>The earliest traces of any thing like the theory of mechanics are to be found in
                    the writings of Aristotle. In some of his works (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Questiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Mechanicae)</hi> we discover a few erroneous
                    and obscure opinions respecting the doctrine of motion, and the nature of
                    equilibrium; and in his 28th mechanical question he has given some vague
                    observations on the force of impulse, tending to point out the difference
                    between that species of force and pressure. He maintained that there cannot be
                    two circular motions opposite to one another; that heavy bodies descended to the
                    centre of the universe, and that the velocities of their descent were
                    proportional to their weights. In answering the question, Why “small powers move
                    great weights by means of the lever, when they have, besides, the weight of the
                    lever itself to move?” Aristotle states, that the power moves the weight more
                    easily in proportion as it is more distant from the fulcrum; and the reason
                    which he assigns for this is, “that the end farthest from the centre describes a
                    greater circle, so that the power which moves the weight will, by the same
                    force, be transferred through a larger space. In discussing the same question,
                    he remarks, that the shorter arm of the lever is moved <hi rend="italic">more
                    against nature</hi> than the other; a distinction which shows the inaccurate
                    notions which he entertained on the subject</p>
                <p>The views of Aristotle, however, were so confused and erroneous, that the honour
                    of laying the foundation of theoretical mechanics is exclusively due to the
                    celebrated Archimedes, who, in addition to his inventions in geometry,
                    discovered the general principles of hydrostatics. In his two books entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Isoporrica,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">De Equiponderantibus,</hi>
                    he has demonstrated that when a balance with unequal arms is in equilibrio, by
                    means of two weights in its opposite scales, these weights must be reciprocally
                    proportional to the arms of the balance. From this general principle all the
                    other properties of the lever, and of machines referrible to the lever, might
                    have been deduced as corollaries; but Archimedes did not pursue the discovery
                    through all its consequences. In demonstrating the leading property of the
                    lever, he lays it down as an axiom, that if the two arms of the balance are
                    equal, the two weights must also be equal when an equilibrium takes place;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Professor Vince has deduced
                    this postulate from self-evident axioms. See Phil. Trans. 1794.</p></note> and
                    then shows, that if one of the arms be increased, and the equilibrium still
                    continue, the weight appended to that arm must be proportionally diminished.
                    This important discovery conducted the Syracusan philosopher to another equally
                    useful in mechanics. Reflecting on the construction of his balance, which moved
                    upon a fulcrum, he perceived that the two weights exerted the same pressure on
                    the fulcrum as if they had both rested upon it. He then considered the sum of
                    these two weights as combined with a third, and the sum of these three as
                    combined with a fourth; and he thus saw, that in every such combination the
                    fulcrum must support their united weight; and therefore that there is in every
                    combination of bodies, and in every single body which may be conceived as made
                    up of a number of lesser bodies, <hi rend="italic">a centre of pressure or
                    gravity.</hi> This discovery Archimedes applied to particular cases, and pointed
                    out the method of finding the centre of gravity of plane surfaces, whether
                    bounded by a parallelogram, a triangle, a trapezium, or a parabola. It appears
                    also from Plutarch and other ancient authors, that a great number of machines
                    which have not reached our times were invented by this philosopher. The military
                    engines which he employed in the siege of Syracuse, against those of the Roman
                    engineer Appius, are said to have displayed the greatest mechanical genius, and
                    to have retarded the capture of his native city.</p>
                <p>In his mathematical collections Pappus has published a theory of the inclined
                    plane, the pulley, the wheel and axle, the screw, and the wedge; but, for
                    reasons which we do not know, these theories have been ascribed to Archimedes.
                    In his theory of the inclined plane, Pappus thus announces the question: “Given
                    a weight, and the power which will move it along a horizontal plane, to find the
                    power which will move it along a given inclined plane.” In the erroneous
                    solution which he gives of this question, he supposes the weight to be formed
                    into a sphere, and placed on the inclined plane; and he regards the weight of
                    this sphere as supported by a lever, the fulcrum being the point of contact of
                    the sphere with the plane, and the power being applied at the extremity of the
                    horizontal radius. “No reasonable ground,” says Mr Whewell, “is or can be
                    assigned for identifying the effects of such a lever with those of the inclined
                    plane, for which it is thus substituted.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Among the various inventions which we have received from antiquity, that of
                    water-mills is entitled to the highest place, whether we consider the ingenuity
                    which they <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204372" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4372-0350"
                    />display, or the useful purposes to which they are subservient. In the infancy
                    of the Roman republic, the corn was ground by hand-mills, <hi rend="italic"
                    >molae</hi><hi rend="italic">versatiles,</hi> consisting of two millstones, one
                    of which was moveable and the other at rest; and at one period these mills were
                    driven by bondsmen. Shafts were subsequently added; and when cattle were yoked
                    to them, they were called <hi rend="italic">molae frwnen-tariae.</hi> The upper
                    millstone was made to revolve either by the hand applied directly to a winch, or
                    by means of a rope winding round a capstan. The precise time when the impulse or
                    the weight of water was substituted in the place of animal labour is not exactly
                    known. From an epigram in the <hi rend="italic">Anthologia Graeca,</hi> and from
                    Vitruvius’s description of them, it is evident that water-mills were invented
                    previously to the reign of Augustus. The invention of wind-mills is of a later
                    date. According to some authors, they were first used in France in the sixth
                    century; while others maintain that they were brought to Europe in the time of
                    the crusades, and that they had long been employed in the East, where the
                    scarcity of water precluded the ap- <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> plication of
                    that agent to machinery. In the twelfth century they had come into use both in
                    France and in England.</p>
                <p>The problem of the inclined plane assumed a more distinct shape in the hands of
                    Cardan,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Dο ΡοnMu</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d Mcn,uru.</hi></p></note> though he was unsuccessful in his solution of it. By
                    considering that the force necessary for supporting a weight upon an inclined
                    plane was nothing when the plane was horizontal, or its inclination nothing, and
                    that a force equal to the whole weight of the body was necessary to support it
                    when the plane was vertical, or its inclination 90°, he concluded that the force
                    increased uniformly from nothing to the weight of the body, and was therefore
                    proportional to the angle of the plane’s inclination.</p>
                <p>The Marquis Guido Ubaldi, the pupil of Commandine, and descended of the
                    illustrious house of Del Monte, devoted much of his time to mechanical statics.
                    His principal works are, <hi rend="italic">Mechanicarum Libri</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sex,</hi> Pisa, 1577; <hi rend="italic">In</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Archimedem</hi><hi rend="italic">de Equipon,derantibus Paraphrasis;</hi> and a
                    treatise on the Screw <hi rend="italic">(De Cochlea),</hi> published after his
                    death by his son in 1616, in which he gives a full account of Archimedes’s
                    forces.</p>
                <p>Several mechanical topics were discussed about this time by T. B. Benedetti, in a
                    work entitled <hi rend="italic">Diversarum Speculationum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Math,</hi><hi rend="italic">et Phys. Liber,</hi> which were published at Turin
                    in 1585. He demonstrates that the forces in the bent lever are as the
                    perpendiculars drawn from the fulcrum to the lines of direction in which they
                    act; and he ascribes the centrifugal force of moving bodies to their tendency to
                    move in straight lines. Benedetti was among the small number of philosophers who
                    supported the Copernican system.</p>
                <p>Simon Stevinus of Bruges, a Dutch mathematician, contributed greatly to the
                    progress of mechanical science. He discovered the parallelogram of forces, and
                    has demonstrated, in his work on statics, published in 1586, that if a body is
                    urged by two forces in the direction of the sides of a parallelogram, and
                    proportional to these sides, the combined action of these two forces is
                    equivalent to a third force acting in the direction of the diagonal of the
                    parallelogram, and having its intensity proportional to that diagonal. This
                    important discovery, which has been of such service in the different departments
                    of physics, should have, conferred upon its author a greater degree of celebrity
                    than he has actually enjoyed. His name has scarcely been enrolled in the temple
                    of fame; but justice may yet be done to the memory of such an ingenious man. He
                    had likewise the merit of illustrating other parts of statics; and he appears to
                    have been the first who, without the aid of the properties of the lever,
                    discovered the law of equilibrium in bodies placed on an inclined plane, namely,
                    that a body resting upon such a plane will be in equilibrio, when the power
                    acting parallel to the plane is to the weight as the height of the plane is to
                    its length. Mr Drinkwater, in his excellent life of Galileo, has stated that
                    this problem had received an earlier solution from Jordanus in the thirteenth
                    century, and that the solution was published by Tartalea in 1565. Mr Whewell,
                    however, is of opinion “that this (Jordanus’s) solution, even if it be
                    interpreted so as to be right in the result, was mixed up with many of the usual
                    Aristotelian errors on such subjects, and was not connected, so far as we know,
                    with any consistent and tenable train of mechanical reasoning. We may still, it
                    would seem, consider Stevin to be the father of modern statics.”<note

                    in 1605. They were translated into Latin in 1608, and into French in 1634; and
                    in these editions of his works, his Statics were enlarged by an appendix, in
                    which he treats of the rope machine, and on pulleys acting obliquely.</p>
                <p>The doctrine of the centre of gravity, which had been applied by Archimedes only
                    to plane surfaces, was now extended to solid bodies by Lucas Valerius, professor
                    of mathematics at Rome. In his work entitled <hi rend="italic">De Centro</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gravitatis Solidorum,</hi> published at Bologna in 1661, he has
                    discussed this subject with such ability, as to receive from Galileo the
                    honourable appellation of the <hi rend="italic">Novus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nos-trae actatis Archimedes,</hi> the Archimedes of the present age.</p>
                <p>In the hands of Galileo the science of mechanics assumed a new form. In 1572 he
                    wrote a small treatise on statics, which he reduced to this principle, that it
                    requires an equal power to raise two different bodies to altitudes in the
                    inverse ratio of their weights, or that the same power is*requisite to raise 10
                    pounds to the height of 100 feet, and 20 pounds to the height of 50 feet. This
                    fertile principle was not pursued by Galileo to its different consequences. It
                    was left to Descartes to apply it to the determination of the equilibrium of
                    machines, which he did in his explanation of machines and engines, without
                    acknowledging his obligations to the Tuscan philosopher. In addition to this new
                    principle, Galileo enriched mechanics with his theory of local motion. This
                    great discovery has immortalized its author; and whether we consider its
                    intrinsic value, or the change which it produced on the physical sciences, we
                    are led to regard it as nearly of equal importance with the theory of universal
                    gravitation, to which it paved the way. The first hints of this new theory were
                    given in his <hi rend="italic">Systema Cosmicum,</hi> dialogus ii. The subject
                    was afterwards fully discussed in another, entitled <hi rend="italic">Discursus
                    et Demonstrationes Mathematica circa duas novas Scientias pertinentes ad
                    Mechanicam et Motum Localem,</hi> and published in 1638. This work is divided
                    into four dialogues; the first of which treats of the resistance of solid bodies
                    before they are broken; the second points out the cause of the cohesion of
                    solids; in the third he discusses his theory of local motions, comprehending
                    those which are equable, and those which are uniformly accelerated; in the
                    fourth he treats of violent motion, or the motion of projectiles; and in an
                    appendix to the work, he demonstrates several propositions relative to the
                    centre of gravity of solid bodies. In the first of these dialogues he has
                    founded his reasoning on principles which are far from being correct; but he has
                    been more successful in the other three. In the third dialogue, which contains
                    his celebrated theory, he discusses the doctrine of equable motions in six
                    theorems, containing <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204385"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-4385-0351"/>the different relations between the velocity of
                    the moving body, the space which it describes, and the time employed in its
                    description. In the second part of the dialogue, which treats of accelerated
                    motion, he considers all bodies as heavy, and composed of a number of parts
                    which are also heavy. Hence he concludes, that the total weight of the body is
                    proportional to the number of the material particles of which it is composed,
                    and then reasons in the following manner: As the weight of a body is a power
                    always the same in quantity, and as it constantly acts without interruption, the
                    body must be continually receiving from it equal impulses in equal and
                    successive instants of time. When the body is prevented from falling, by being
                    placed on a table, its weight is incessantly impelling it downwards; but these
                    impulses are as incessantly destroyed by the resistance of the table, which
                    prevents it from yielding to them. But when the body falls freely, the impulses
                    which it perpetually receives are perpetually accumulating, and remain in the
                    body unchanged in every respect excepting the diminution which they experience
                    from the resistance of the air. It therefore follows, that a body falling freely
                    is uniformly accelerated, or receives equal increments of velocity in equal
                    times. Having established this preliminary proposition, he then demonstrates,
                    that the time in which any space is described by a motion uniformly accelerated
                    from rest, is equal to the time in which the same space would be described by an
                    uniform equable motion with half the final velocity of the accelerated motion;
                    and that in every motion uniformly accelerated from rest, the spaces described
                    are in the duplicate ratio of the times of description. After having proved
                    these theorems, he applies the doctrine with great success to the ascent and
                    descent of bodies moving on inclined planes.</p>
                <p>The theory of Galileo was embraced by bis pupil Torricelli, who illustrated and
                    extended it in his excellent work entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">motu gravium naturaliter accelerato,</hi> published in 1644. In
                    his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">motu projectorum,</hi>
                    published in the Florentine edition of his works in 1664, he has added several
                    new and important propositions to those which were given by his master on the
                    motion of projectiles; and he appears to have been the first who established the
                    principle applicable to all statical problems, “that if two weights are so
                    connected together, that when placed in any position, their common centre of
                    gravity neither ascends nor descends, they are in equilibrium in all these
                    positions.”</p>
                <p>It was about this time that steam began to be employed as the first mover of
                    machinery. This great discovery has been ascribed by the English to the Marquis
                    of Worcester, and to Papin by the French. About thirty-four years before the
                    date of the marquis’s invention, and about sixty-one years before the
                    construction of Papin’s digester, steam was employed as the impelling power of a
                    stamping engine by one Brancas an Italian, who published an account of his
                    invention in 1629; but in this case it acted merely by its impulse, and could
                    not even have suggested the idea of its acting by its expansive force. The
                    advantages of steam as an impelling power being thus known, the ingenious
                    Captain Savary invented an engine which raised water by the expansion and
                    condensation of steam. Several engines of this construction were actually
                    erected in England and France, but they were incapable <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    raising water from depths which exceeded thirty-five feet. The steam-engine
                    received great improvements from our countrymen Newcomen, Beighton, and Blackey;
                    but it was brought to its present state of perfection by Mr Watt of Birmingham,
                    one of the most accomplished engineers of his age. Hitherto it had been employed
                    merely as a hydraulic machine for draining mines or raising water, but in
                    consequence of Mr Watt’s improvements it has long been used as the impelling
                    power of almost every species of machinery. It is <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    curious circumstance, that the steam-engine was not only invented, but has
                    received all its improvements, in our own country.</p>
                <p>The success of Galileo in investigating the doctrine of rectilineal motion,
                    induced the illustrious Huygens to turn his attention to curvilineal motion. In
                    his celebrated work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Horologio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Oscillatorio,</hi> published in 1673, he has shown that the
                    velocity of a heavy body descending along any curve, is the same at every
                    instant in the direction of the tangent, as it would have been if it had fallen
                    through a height equal to the corresponding vertical absciss; and from the
                    application of this principle to the reversed cycloid with its axis vertical, he
                    discovered the isochronism of the cycloid, or that a heavy body, from whatever
                    part of the cycloid it begins to fall, always arrives at the lower point of the
                    curve in the same space of time. By these discussions, Huygens was gradually led
                    to his beautiful theory of central forces in the circle. This theory may be
                    applied to the motion of a body in any curve, by considering all curves as
                    composed of an infinite number of small arcs of circles of different radii,
                    which Huygens had already done in his theory of evolutes. The theorems of
                    Huygens concerning the centrifugal force and circular motions were published
                    without demonstrations. They were first demonstrated by Dr Keill, at the end of
                    his Introduction to Natural Philosophy. The demonstrations of Huygens, however,
                    which were more prolix than those of the English philosopher, were afterwards
                    given in his posthumous works.</p>
                <p>About this time the true laws of collision or percussion were separately
                    discovered by Wallis, Huygens, and Sir Christopher Wren, in 1661, without having
                    the least communication with each other. They were transmitted to the Royal
                    Society of London in 1788, and appeared in the forty-third and forty-sixth
                    numbers of their Transactions. The solution of Wallis was first sent, that of
                    Wren next, and that of Huygens last of all, in consequence of his living at a
                    greater distance. The rules given by Wallis and Wren are published in No. 43, p.
                    864 and 867, and those of Huygens in No. 46, p. 927. The foundation of all their
                    solutions is, that in the mutual collision of bodies, the absolute quantity of
                    motion of the centre of gravity is the same after impact as before it, and that
                    when the bodies are elastic, the relative velocity is the same after as before
                    the shock. We are indebted likewise to Sir Christopher Wren for an ingenious
                    method of demonstrating the laws of impulsion by experiment. He suspended the
                    impinging bodies by threads of equal length, so that they might touch each other
                    when at rest. When the two bodies were separated from one another, and then
                    allowed to approach by their own gravity, they impinged against each other when
                    they arrived at the positions which they had when at rest, and their velocities
                    were proportional to the chords of the arches through which they had fallen.
                    Their velocities after impact were also measured by the chords of the arches
                    through which the stroke had forced them to ascend, and the results of the
                    experiments coincided exactly with the deductions of theory. The laws of
                    percussion were afterwards more fully investigated by Huygens in his posthumous
                    work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Motu Corporum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">Percussione,</hi> and by Wallis in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Mechanica,</hi> published in 1670.</p>
                <p>The attention of philosophers was at this time directed to the two mechanical
                    problems proposed by Mersennus in 1635. The first of these problems was to
                    determine the centre of oscillation in a compound pendulum; and the second, to
                    find the centre of percussion of a single body, or a system of bodies turning
                    round a fixed axis. The centre of oscillation is that point in a compound
                    pendulum, or a system of bodies moving round a centre, in which, if a small body
                    were placed and made to move round the same centre, it would perform its
                    oscillations in the same time <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204398"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-4398-0352"/>as the system of bodies. The centre of percussion,
                    which is situated in the same point of the system as the centre of oscillation,
                    is that point of a body revolving or vibrating about an axis, which being struck
                    by an immoveable obstacle, the whole of the motion of the body is destroyed.
                    These two problems were at first discussed by Descartes .and Roberval, but the
                    methods which they employed were far from being correct. The first solution of
                    the problem on the centre of oscillation was given by Huygens. He assumed as a
                    principle, that if several weights attached to a pendulum descended by the force
                    of gravity, and if at any instant the bodies were detached from one another, and
                    each ascended with the velocity it had acquired by its fall, they would rise to
                    such a height that the centre of gravity of the system in that state would
                    descend to the same height as that from which the centre of gravity of the
                    pendulum had descended. The solution founded on this principle, which was not
                    derived from the fundamental laws of mechanics, did not at first meet with the
                    approbation of philosophers; but it was afterwards demonstrated in the clearest
                    manner, and now forms the principle of the conservation of active forces. The
                    problem of the centre of percussion was not attended with such difficulties.
                    Several incomplete solutions of it were given by different geometers; but it was
                    at last resolved in an accurate and general manner by James Bernoulli by the
                    principle of the lever.</p>
                <p>In 1666, a treatise, <hi rend="italic">De Vi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Percussionis,</hi> was published by J. Alphonse Borelli, and in 1686 another
                    work, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Motionibus naturalibus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a Gravitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Pendentibus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but he added nothing to the science of mechanics. His
                    ingenious work, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Motu Animalium,</hi>
                    however, published in 1681 and 1682, in two parts, is entitled to great praise,
                    for the beautiful application which it contains of the laws of statics to
                    explain the various motions of living agents. <hi rend="superscript">?</hi> The
                    application of statics to the equilibrium of machines was first made by Varignon
                    in his Project of a new System of Mechanics, published in 1687. The subject was
                    afterwards completely discussed in his <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle
                    Mécanique,</hi> a posthumous work published in 1725. In this work are given the
                    first notions of the celebrated principle of virtual velocities, from a letter
                    of John Bernoulli’s to Varignon in 1717. The virtual velocity of a body is the
                    infinitely small space through which the body excited to move has a tendency to
                    describe in one instant of time. This principle has been successfully applied by
                    Varignon to the equilibrium of all the simple machines. The resistance of
                    solids, which was first treated by Galileo, was discussed more correctly by
                    Leibnitz in the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Eruditorum</hi> for
                    1687. In the Memoirs of the Academy for 1702, Varignon has taken up the subject,
                    and rendered the theory much more universal.</p>
                <p>An important step in the construction of machinery was about this time made by
                    Parent. He remarked in general, that if the parts of a machine are so arranged
                    that the velocity of the impelling power becomes greater or less according as
                    the weight put in motion becomes greater or less, there is a certain proportion
                    between the velocity of the impelling power, and that of the weight to be moved,
                    which renders the effect of the machine a <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> or a
                    <hi rend="italic">minimum.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Mérn. de l’Αcαd,</hi> 1/04.</p></note> LIe
                    then applies this principle to undershot wheels, and shows that a maximum effect
                    will be produced when the velocity of the stream is equal to <hi rend="italic"
                    >thrice</hi> the velocity of the wheel. In obtaining this conclusion, Parent
                    supposed that the force of the current upon the wheel is in the duplicate ratio
                    of the relative velocity, which is true only when a single floatboard is
                    impelled by the water. But when more fìoatboards than one are acted upon at the
                    same time, it is obvious that the momentum of the water is directly as the
                    relative velocity; and by making this substitution in Parent’s demonstration, it
                    will be found that a maximum effect is produced when the velocity of the current
                    is double that of the wheel. This result was first obtained by the Chevalier
                    Borda, and has been amply confirmed by the experiments of Smeaton. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hydrodynamics.)</hi> The principle of Parent was also applied
                    by him to the construction of wind-mills. It had been generally supposed that
                    the most efficacious angle of weather was 45°; but it was demonstrated by the
                    French philosopher that a maximum effect is produced when the sails are inclined
                    54⅛ degrees to the axis of rotation, or when the angle of weather is 3¾ degrees.
                    This conclusion, however, is subject to modifications, which will be pointed out
                    in a subsequent part of this article.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Traite de Mécanique</hi> of De la Hire, published
                    separately in 1695, and in the 9th volume of the Memoirs of the French Academy
                    from 1666 to 1699, contains the general properties of the mechanical powers, and
                    the description of several ingenious and useful machines. But it is chiefly
                    remarkable for the <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Epicycloides,</hi> which is added to the edition published in the Memoirs of the
                    academy. In his interesting treatise, De la Hire considers the genesis and
                    properties of exterior and interior epicycloids, and demonstrates, that when one
                    wheel is employed to drive another, the one will move sometimes with greater and
                    sometimes with less force, and the other will move sometimes with greater and
                    sometimes with less velocity, unless the teeth of one or both of the wheels be
                    parts of a curve generated like an epicycloid. The same truth is applicable to
                    the formation of the teeth of rackwork, the arms of levers, the wipers of
                    stampers, and the lifting cogs of forge-hammers; and as the epicycloidal teeth,
                    when properly formed, roll one upon another without much friction, the motion of
                    the machine will be uniform and pleasant, its communicating parts will be
                    prevented from wearing, and there will be no unnecessary waste of the impelling
                    power. Although De la Hire was the first who published this important discovery,
                    yet the honour of it is certainly due to Olaus Roemer, the celebrated Danish
                    astronomer, who discovered the successive propagation of light. It is expressly
                    stated by Leibnitz,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Miseellan. Eerolinens.</hi> 1710, p∙ 315.</p></note> in his
                    letters to John Bernoulli, that Roemer communicated to him the discovery twenty
                    years before the publication of De la Hire’s work; but still we have no ground
                    for believing that De la Hire was guilty of plagiarism. Roemer’s researches were
                    not published; and from the complete discussion which the subject has received
                    from the French philosopher, it is not unlikely that he had the merit of being
                    the second inventor. Even Camus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The publication of Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> contributed greatly
                    to the progress of mechanics. His discoveries concerning the curvilineal motions
                    of bodies, combined with the theory of universal gravitation, enabled
                    philosophers to apply the science of mechanics to the phenomena or the heavens,
                    to ascertain the law of the force by which the planets are held in their orbits,
                    and to compute the various irregularities in the solar system which arise from
                    the mutual action of the bodies which compose it. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mécanique Céleste</hi> of La Place will be a standing monument of the extension
                    which mechanics has received from the theory of gravity. The important
                    mechanical principle<pb break="no" facs="nls:194204411"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-4411-0353"/> of the conservation of the motion of the centre
                    of gravity is also due to Newton. He has demonstrated in <hi rend="superscript">
                    &amp;</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> that the condition of the
                    centre of gravity of several bodies, whether in a state of rest or motion, is
                    not affected by the reciprocal action of these bodies, whatever it may be, so
                    that the centre of gravity of the bodies which act upon one another, either by
                    the intervention of levers, or by the laws of attraction, will either remain at
                    rest, or move uniformly in a right line.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that the principle of the conservation of active forces was
                    discovered by Huygens when he solved the problem of the centre of oscillation.
                    The principle alluded to consists in this, that in all the actions of bodies
                    upon each other, whether that action consists in the percussion of elastic
                    bodies, or is communicated from one body to another by threads or inflexible
                    rods, the sums of the masses multiplied by the squares of the absolute
                    velocities remain always the same. This important law is easily deducible from
                    two simpler laws admitted in mechanics: 1. That in the collision of elastic
                    bodies, their respective velocities remain the same after impact as they were
                    before it; and, 2. that the quantity of action, or the product of the masses of
                    the impinging bodies, multiplied by the velocity of their centre of gravity, is
                    the same after as before impact. The principle of the conservation of active
                    forces was regarded by its inventor only as a simple mechanical theorem. John
                    Bernoulli, however, considered it as a general law of nature, and applied it to
                    the solution of several problems which could not be resolved by direct’methods;
                    but his son Daniel deduced from it the laws of the motion of fluids from
                    vessels, a subject which had been formerly treated in a very vague manner. He
                    afterwards rendered the principle more general,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Mιm.del’Acad. Berlin,</hi>
                    1748.</p></note> and showed how it could be applied to the motmn of bodies
                    influenced by their mutual attractions, or solicited towards fixed centres by
                    forces proportional to any function of the distance.</p>
                <p>After the parallelogram of forces had been introduced into statics by Stevinus,
                    it was generally admitted upon the same demonstration which was given for the
                    composition of motion. The first complete demonstration was published by Daniel
                    Bernoulli in the Commentaries of Petersburg for 1726, independent of the
                    consideration of compound motion. This demonstration, which was both long and
                    abstruse, was greatly simplified by D’Alembert in the Memoirs of the Academy for
                    1769. Fonsencix and Riccati have given a very ingenious one in the Memoirs of
                    the Academy of Turin for 1761. This was also improved by D’Alembert, who gave
                    another in the same Memoirs, and a third in his <hi rend="italic">Traité de
                    Dynamique,</hi> published in 1743. Dr Robison<note anchored="true"

                    combined the demonstrations of Bernoulli and D’Alembert with one by Frisi, and
                    produced one that is more expeditious and simple. La Place has likewise given a
                    demonstration of the parallelogram of forces in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alécanique</hi><hi rend="italic">Céleste.</hi></p>
                <p>About the beginning of the eighteenth century, the celebrated dispute about the
                    measure of active forces was keenly agitated among philosophers. The first spark
                    of this war, which for forty years England maintained single-handed against all
                    the genius of the Continent, was excited by Leibnitz. In the Leipsic Acts for
                    1686, he asserted that Descartes was mistaken in making the force of bodies
                    proportional to their simple velocity, and maintained that it followed the ratio
                    of the square of the velocity. He showed that a body with a velocity of two feet
                    acquires the power of raising itself to a height four times as great as that to
                    which a body could rise with a velocity of only one foot; and hence he concludes
                    that the force of that body is as the square of its velocity. The Abbé de
                    Cotilon, a zealous Cartesian, allowed the premises of Leibnitz, but denied his
                    conclusion. The body, said he, which moves with a velocity of two feet, will
                    certainly rise to quadruple the height of another body that has only the
                    velocity of one foot; but it will take <hi rend="italic">twice the time</hi> to
                    rise to that height, and a quadruple effect, in a double time, is not a
                    quadruple force, but only a double one. The theory of Leibnitz was supported by
                    John Bernoulli, Hermann, Gravesande, Muschenbroeck, Poleni, Wolff,and Bulfinger;
                    and the opinion of Descartes by Maclaurin, Stirling, Clarke, Desaguliers, and
                    other English philosophers. The question was at last involved in metaphysical
                    reasoning; and if the dispute did terminate in favour of either party, the
                    English philosophers were certainly victorious.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Our countryman Smeaton, and more recently Dr
                    Wollaston and Mr Ewart of Manchester, have adopted the Leibnitzian doctrine. See
                    Phil. Trans. 1776, p. 450; Ibid. 1806; and Manchester Memoirs, vol. ii. p.

                    body, indicated by the space which it describes, is as the simple velocity, if
                    we consider the space as described in a determinate time; but it is as the
                    square of the velocity if we do not consider the time in which the space is
                    described. The question, therefore, which is chiefly one of words, comes to be
                    this: In estimating the forces of bodies in motion, ought we to take time into
                    consideration? If, with the followers of Leibnitz, we reject this element, then
                    we may maintain that the force of a child is equal to that of a man carrying a
                    load, because the child is also capable of carrying the same load, though in
                    small parts and in a greater length of time.</p>
                <p>In 1743, D’Alembert published his <hi rend="italic">Traité de Dynamique,</hi>
                    founded upon a new principle in mechanics. This principle, which Μ. Fontaine
                    seems to have recognised so early as 1739, was first employed by James Bernoulli
                    in his solution of the problem of the centre of oscillation; but D’Alembert had
                    the honour of generalizing it, and giving it all that simplicity and fertility
                    of which it was susceptible. He showed, that in whatever manner the bodies of
                    one system act upon one another, their motions may always be decomposed into two
                    others at every instant, those of the one being destroyed the instant following,
                    and those of the other retained, and that the motions retained are necessarily
                    known from the conditions of equilibrium between those which are destroyed. This
                    principle is evidently a consequence of the laws of motion and equilibrium, and
                    has the advantage of reducing all the problems of dynamics to pure geometry and
                    the principles of statics. By means of it D’Alembert has resolved a number of
                    beautiful problems which had escaped the notice of his predecessors, and
                    particularly that of the precession of the equinoxes, which had occupied the
                    attention of Newton. In his <hi rend="italic">Traité de Dynamique,</hi>
                    D’Alembert has likewise reduced the whole of mechanics to three principles, the
                    force of inertia, compound motion, and equilibrium; and has illustrated his
                    views on this subject by that profound and luminous reasoning which
                    characterizes all his writings.</p>
                <p>Another general principle in dynamics was about this time discovered separately
                    by Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and the Chevalier D’Arcy, and received the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">the conservation of the momentum of rotatory motion.</hi>
                    According to the first two philosophers, the principle may be thus defined: In
                    the motion of several bodies round a fixed centre, the sum of the products of
                    the mass of each body multiplied by the velocity of its motion round the centre,
                    and by its distance from the centre, is always independent<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194204424" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4424-0354"/> of the mutual action which
                    the bodies may exert upon each other, and always preserves itself the same,
                    provided the bodies are not influenced by any external cause. 1his principle was
                    given by Daniel Bernoulli in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin for 1746; and
                    in the same year by Euler in the first volume of his works. They were both led
                    to the discovery whilst investigating the motion of several bodies in a tube of
                    a given form, and which can only turn round a fixed point. The principle
                    discovered by the Chevalier D’Arcy was given in a memoir dated 1746, and
                    published in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1747. He showed that the sum of the
                    products of the mass of each body by the area which its radius vector describes
                    round a fixed point, is always proportional to the times. The identity of this
                    principle, which is a generalization of Newton’s theorem about the areas
                    described by the planetary bodies, with that of Euler and Bernoulli, will be
                    easily perceived, if we consider that the element of the circular arc, divided
                    by the element of the time, expresses the velocity of circulation, and that the
                    element of the circular arc, multiplied by the distance from the centre, gives
                    the element of the area described round that centre; so that the principle of
                    Euler is only a differential expression of the principle of D’Arcy, which he
                    afterwards expressed in this form, that the sum of the products of the masses of
                    each body by their velocities, and by the perpendiculars drawn from the centre
                    to their lines of direction, is a constant quantity.</p>
                <p>The principle of least action, which was first proposed by Maupertuis in 1744,
                    consists in this, that when several bodies, acting upon one another, experience
                    any change in their motion, this change is always such that the quantity of
                    action (or the product of the mass by the space and the velocity) employed by
                    nature to produce it, is the least possible. From this principle Maupertuis
                    deduced the laws of the reflection and refraction of light, and those of the
                    collision of bodies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mem
                    de l’Acac. Paris, 1744; and Mem. de l’Acad. erline, 1746</p></note> He
                    afterwards extended its application to the laws of motion, and made the
                    principle so general as to comprehend the laws of equilibrium, the uniform
                    motion of the centre of gravity in the percussion of bodies, and the
                    conservation of active forces. This celebrated principle was attacked by Koenig,
                    professor of mathematics at the Hague, in the Leipsic Acts for 1751, who not
                    only attempted to show its falsity, but asserted that Leibnitz had first
                    described it in 1707 in a letter to Hermann. The paper of Koenig gave rise to a
                    long and violent dispute about the accuracy of the principle, and the
                    authenticity of the letter of Leibnitz. The Academy of Berlin interfered in
                    behalf of their president; and Voltaire, under the influence of personal
                    feelings against Maupertuis, who had introduced the Abbé Raynal into the academy
                    against the wishes of the poet, took the part of Koenig, and assailed his
                    opponent with the warmest invective. Maupertuis, however, kept his ground, and
                    Voltaire was under the necessity of quitting Berlin in 1752.</p>
                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">des Isoperimétries,</hi>
                    printed at Lausanne in 1744, Euler extended the principle of least action, and
                    showed, .“that in the trajectories described by means of central forces, the
                    integral of the velocity, multiplied by the element of the curve, is either-a
                    <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">minimurn.</hi> ’ This
                    remarkable property, which Euler recognised only in the case of insulated
                    bodies, was generalized by Lagrange into this new principle, “that the sum of
                    the products of the masses by the integrals of the velocities, multiplied by the
                    elements of the spaces described, is always a maximum or a minimum.” In the
                    memoirs of Turin, Lagrange has employed this principle to resolve several
                    difficult problems in dynamics; and he has shown,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mecanique Analytique, p.189, 1788</p></note>
                    that when it is combined with the conservation of active forces, and developed
                    according to the rules of his method of variations, it furnishes directly all
                    the equations necessary for the solution of each problem, and gives rise to a
                    simple and general method of treating the various problems concerning the motion
                    of bodies.</p>
                <p>An important discovery in rotatory motion was at this time made by Professor
                    Segner of Gottingen. In a paper entitled <hi rend="italic">Specimen
                    Theories</hi><hi rend="italic">Turbinum,</hi> published at Halle in 1755, he
                    demonstrated, that if a body of any formormagnitude, after it has received
                    rotatory motions in all directions, be left entirely to itself, it will always
                    have three principal axes of rotation; or, in other words, all the rotatory
                    motions with which it is affected may be reduced to three, which are performed
                    round three axes, perpendicular to each, passing through the centre of gravity
                    of the revolving body, and preserving the same position in absolute space, while
                    the centre of gravity is either stationary or moving uniformly in a straight
                    line.</p>
                <p>The force of torsion began at this time to be investigated by Coulomb, who
                    published two ingenious papers on the subject, in the Memoirs of the French
                    Academy. Hehas successfully employed this principle in several physical
                    researches, but particularly in determining the laws of electric and magnetic
                    action, and in finding the laws of the resistance of fluids when the motions are
                    extremelyslow.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Memoires

                    detaild.</p></note> It was by means of an elegant experiment on the principle of
                    torsion that Mr Cavendish determined the mutual attraction of two masses of
                    lead, and thence deduced the mean density of the earth. We are also indebted to
                    Coulomb for a complete set of experiments on the nature and effects of friction.
                    By employing large bodies and ponderous weights, and conducting his experiments
                    on a large scale, he has corrected errors which necessarily arose from the
                    limited experiments of preceding writers; he has brought to light many new and
                    interesting facts, and confirmed others which had hitherto been partially
                    established. The most curious result of these experiments is the effect of time
                    in increasing the friction between two surfaces. In some cases the friction
                    reaches its maximum after the rubbing surfaces have remained in contact for one
                    minute; and in other cases five or six days were necessary before this effect
                    was produced. The increase of friction, which is generated by prolonging the
                    time of contact, is so great, that a body weighing 1650 pounds was moved with a
                    force of 64 pounds when first laid upon the corresponding surface. After
                    remaining in contact for the space of three seconds, 100 pounds were necessary
                    to put it in motion; and when the time was prolonged to six days, it could
                    scarcely be moved with a power of 622 pounds.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Before we conclude this brief sketch of the history of mechanics, we must give
                    our readers some account of the calculating machine of Mr Babbage, one of the
                    most remarkable inventions of the present age. The earliest calculating machine
                    was invented by the celebrated Pascal, with the view of facilitating certain
                    calculations which his father’s official duties required him to make<note

                    7, Paris, 1819.</p></note>? A series of wheels and cylindrical barrels
                    containing the ten digits were employed, but several of the operations were
                    performed by hand, so that the mechanism gave no security against error, while
                    it furnished its results with only a little more celerity than that with which
                    an expert calculator could have supplied them. Poleni, Moreland, Grillet,
                    Delepresse, and Boittissendeau, made similar but unsuccessful<pb break="no"

                    machinery. At a later period Leibnitz constructed a very complicated and
                    expensive machine, which he declined to describe, satisfying himself with giving
                    an account of its mode of operation, and of its results.<note anchored="true"

                    317-</p></note></p>
                <p>The purpose <hi rend="italic">of</hi> all these machines, even if they had
                    answered the purposes for which they were invented, was to perform particular
                    mathematical operations; but Mr Babbage had a much higher object in view. He
                    conceived the idea of calculating numerical tables of every kind by machinery,
                    of tabulating the results, and of printing them without the possibility of an
                    error during the press-work. In order to effect these objects, it became
                    requisite to discover some common principle in numerical tables as the <hi
                    rend="italic">basis of</hi> the calculating machinery; and among the properties
                    of numerical functions suited to this purpose, Mr Babbage selected the method of
                    differences. The principle of this method he embodied in wheel-work by a system
                    of mechanical contrivance in itself perfect; but, from the high importance of
                    the objects to be attained, he has added to the machinery a supplementary and
                    independent mechanism, by which all small errors and inequalities arising from
                    any cause whatever shall be expunged.</p>
                <p>When the calculations are made free from all error, they are submitted to the
                    printing part of the machinery, by which they are multiplied, without the
                    possibility of an error in any individual copy.</p>
                <p>The powers of this extraordinary machinery have greatly exceeded the expectations
                    of its inventor, and their extent seems to be incapable of appreciation. The
                    part of it which has been put up has already tabulated equations so far beyond
                    the grasp of mathematicians, that no remote term of the table can be predicated,
                    nor any function discovered, by which its general law can be expressed.</p>
                <p>The calculating part of the machinery occupies a space about ten feet broad, ten
                    feet high, and five feet deep. It consists of seven steel axes erected over one
                    another, each of them carrying eighteen wheels five inches in diameter, having
                    on them barrels one and a half inch in height, and inscribed with the ten
                    digits. The machine calculates to eighteen decimal places, true to the last
                    figure; but, by subsidiary contrivances, it will be possible to calculate even
                    to thirty decimal places. The working drawings which have been necessary in the
                    production of this machine are not only elaborate and complicated, but arc so
                    numerous that they cover upwards of a thousand superficial feet.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of completing the calculating machine, government has already
                    advanced L. 15,000; but not a farthing has been received by Mr Babbage for his
                    own labour. We regret to add, that so great a national undertaking is at a
                    stand; but this regret is diminished by the fact, that Mr Babbage has contrived
                    a machine, much more simple in its construction, and more extensive in its
                    application, and which may be regarded as entirely superseding his first
                    invention. It will therefore be a matter of deep consideration whether Mr
                    Babbage should complete his first machine in conformity with his arrangement
                    with government, or throw it entirely aside as comparatively imperfect, and
                    devote his whole time, with the aid of government, to the completion of his new
                    invention.</p>
                <p>In the construction of the calculating machinery, Mr Babbage early felt the
                    embarrassment arising from the impossibility of remembering all the various
                    movements and functions of the different parts of the machinery; and he was
                    therefore led to contrive a system of <hi rend="italic">mechanical
                    notation,</hi> capable of being applied to all kinds <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    machinery. This invention consists of two parts. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jlrst,</hi> a system of signs marks the origin and nature of every motion in
                    the machine, and also the nature of the mechanical connection between the part
                    moving and the part moved. In the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> part, a complete
                    period of the machinery is divided into any number of portions of time, so as to
                    exhibit to the eye in a table what every part of the machine is about at each
                    instant of the period. In this way the mind is disencumbered as it were of the
                    mechanism, and occupies itself only with the symbols of its parts. Since Mr
                    Babbage first published an account of his “Method of expressing by Signs the
                    Action of Machinery,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Phil. Trans. 1826, part iii. p. 2ő0.</p></note> he has greatly extended
                    and improved it, and introduced an additional section for representing the
                    process of circulation in machines through which liquids or gases are moved; and
                    it has been applied by a foreigner to express the structure, the operation, and
                    the circulation of the vital system of animals.</p>
                <p>One of the most important treatises on the science of motion is the Mechanics of
                    the celebrated Euler, published in 1736. It contains the whole theory of
                    rectilineal and curvilineal motion in an insulated body, affected by any
                    accelerating forces, either <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> or in a resisting
                    medium. He uniformly uses the analytical method, and has employed the principle
                    of the <hi rend="italic">vis inertiae,</hi> and that of compound motion, for
                    putting his problems into equations. By the <hi rend="italic">vis inertiae,</hi>
                    motion is at every moment of time rectilineal and uniform; and by the principle
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> compound motion, a body, exposed to the action of any
                    number of forces, tending to alter the quantity and the direction of its motion,
                    will move in such a direction as to reach the very point at which it would have
                    arrived had it obeyed successively each of the forces which act upon it. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Analytique</hi> of Lagrange, published in 1788, all
                    the mechanical problems are reduced to general formulae, which, being developed,
                    furnish us with the equations that are necessary for the solution of each
                    problem; and the different principles which have been discovered for
                    facilitating the solutions of mechanical questions are brought under one point
                    of view, and their connection and dependence clearly pointed out. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Architecture</hi><hi rend="italic">Hydraulique,</hi> by M. Prony,
                    published in 1790, and the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Philosophique</hi> of the
                    same author, published in 1799, contain all the late improvements in mechanics,
                    and a complete view both of the theory and application of that science. The
                    first of these works is intended chiefly for the use of the engineer, though an
                    extensive acquaintance with the higher geometry is necessary for perusing it
                    with advantage. His <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Philosophique</hi> is a profound
                    work, in which, without the aid of a single diagram, he gives all the formula?,
                    and the various theorems and problems which belong to the sciences of mechanics
                    and hydrodynamics. Every alternate page contains a methodical table of the
                    results obtained in the preceding page, the description of the symbols, and the
                    theorems, problems, and formulae which may have been obtained. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Traité de Mécanique Elémentaire,</hi> by Μ. Fran-ceur, published
                    in 1802, in one volume octavo, is an excellent abridgment of the works of Prony,
                    and is intended as an introduction to the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique
                    Philosophique</hi> of that author, to the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique

                    respective heads, we shall now direct the attention of the reader to the other
                    branches of theoretical mechanics.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I ON ELEMENTARY MACHINES, OR THE MECHANI</p>
                <p>CAL <hi rend="smallcaps">powers.</hi></p>
                <p>• The elementary machines have been generally reckoned six in number, 1. the
                    lever; 2. the wheel and axle, or <hi rend="italic">axis inperitrochio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> 3. the pulley; 4. the inclined plane; 5. the wedge; and, 6.
                    the screw: to which some writers on mechanics have added the <hi rend="italic"
                    >balance,</hi> and others the <hi rend="italic">rope-machine,</hi> It is
                    evident, however, that all these machines may be reduced to three, the <hi
                    rend="italic">lever,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">inclined plane,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">funicular</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rope-machine.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">pulley,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">wheel</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">axle,</hi> are oby,iously composed of an assemblage of levers; the
                    <hi rend="italic">balance</hi> is a lever with equal arms; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >wedge</hi> is composed of two inclined planes, with their bases in contact; and
                    the <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> is either a wedge or an inclined plane, wrapped
                    round a cylinder. Under the head of elementary machines, therefore, we cannot,
                    in strict propriety, include any of the mechanical powers, excepting the <hi
                    rend="italic">lever,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">inclined plane,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">rope-macliine.</hi></p>
                <p>DEFINITIONS.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 1. When two forces act against each other by the
                    intervention of a machine, the one force is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >power,</hi> and the other the <hi rend="italic">loeight.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">weight</hi> is the resistance to be overcome, or the effect to be
                    produced. The <hi rend="italic">power</hi> is the force, whether animate or
                    inanimate, which is employed to overcome that resistance, or to produce the
                    required effect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 2. The power and weight are said to balance each
                    other, or to be in equilibrio, when the effort of the one to produce motion in
                    one direction is equal to the effort of the other to produce motion in the
                    opposite direction; or when the weight opposes that degree of resistance which
                    is precisely required to destroy the action of the power.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I— <hi rend="italic">On the Lever.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Definitions.</hi> —1. A <hi rend="italic">lever</hi> is an
                    inflexible bar or rod, either straight or curved, moving freely round an
                    immoveable point, called its <hi rend="italic">fulcrum,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">centre of motion,</hi> 2. The parts of a lever which lie between
                    the <hi rend="italic">fulcrum</hi> and the points where the <hi rend="italic"
                    >power</hi> and <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> are applied, are called its <hi
                    rend="italic">arms.</hi></p>
                <p>Levers have been generally divided into <hi rend="italic">three</hi> kinds. In
                    levers of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> kind, the fulcrum is situated between
                    the power and the weight, as in balances, steelyards, scissors, pincers, a
                    poker, a crow-bar, &amp;c. Levers of the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> kind have
                    the weight between the power and the fulcrum, as in cutting-knives fastened at
                    the point of the blade, nutcrackers, a door, and a ship’s rudder, and in the
                    oars of a boat where the water is regarded as the fulcrum. In levers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">third</hi> kind, the power is between the weight and the fulcrum,
                    as in tongs, shears for sheep, the treddle of a turning lathe, &amp;c. In using
                    such levers, rapidity and dispatch are of greater consequence than great power.
                    The limbs of animals are generally considered as levers of the third kind; for
                    the muscles, by the contraction of which the power or moving force is generated,

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Axiom.</hi> 1. <hi rend="italic">Equal weights acting at the
                    extremities of equal arms of a straight lever, and having the lines of the
                    direction in which they act at equal angles to these arms, will exert the same
                    effort to turn the lever round its fulcrum.</hi> This axiom has been generally
                    restricted to the particular case when the weights act perpendicularly to the
                    arms of the lever; but no reason can be assigned for such a limitation. The
                    truth in the axiom is as self-evident when the angles formed by the arms of the
                    lever and the direction of the forces are 80° as when they are 90°, for in each
                    case the two weights exert their influence upon the lever in precisely the same
                    circumstances.</p>

                    each fulcrum is similarly situated with respect to both the weights, the
                    pressure upon each must be equal; and as the fulcra support both the equal
                    weights, the pressure upon each must be equal to one of the weights.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Proposition</hi> I.</p>
                <p>If two weights or forces acting at equal angles upon a straight lever, devoid of
                    weight, are in equilibrio, they are reciprocally proportional to their distances

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Case</hi> 1. Where the weights act on contrary sides of the
                    fulcrum.</p>
                <p>Let AB be a lever devoid of weight, and let it be supported upon the two fulcra,
                    <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> F, situated in such a manner that Ajf= <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ι</hi> ∕F = FB. Then, if two equal weights C, D of one pound
                    each are suspended at the extremities A, B, so as to act in the direction AC,
                    BD, making the angles CAB, DBA equal, these weights will be in equilibrio; for
                    since <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204463" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4463-0357"/>A∕=FB
                    (Axiom 1), the effort of the weight D to turn the lever round the fulcrum F,
                    will be equal to the effort of the weight C to turn it round the fulcrum <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> Now (Axiom 2) the pressure upon the fulcrum /is equal to
                    one pound, therefore if that fulcrum be removed, and a weight E of one pound be
                    made to act upward at the point F, the weights C and D will continue in
                    equilibrio. Then it is obvious, that since FB=I∕ the weight E of one pound
                    acting upwards at the point/, so that the angle DfF=DBA, will have the same
                    effect as an equal weight acting downwards at B. By removing the weight E,
                    therefore, and suspending its equal C at the extremity B, the equilibrium will
                    still be preserved. But the weights D, C, suspended at B, are equal to two
                    pounds, and the weight C is only one pound; and as FA is double of FB, it
                    follows that a weight of two pounds, placed at the end of one arm of a lever,
                    will be in equilibrio with a weight of one pound placed at twice the distance of
                    the former from the fulcrum. But 2:1 = 2FB or AF: FB, that is, when the
                    distances are as 2 to 1, an equilibrium takes place if the weights are
                    reciprocally proportional to these distances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Case</hi> 2. When weights act on the same side of the
                    fulcrum.</p>
                <p>Let AB be a lever in equilibrio upon the fulcrum F, and let FA be equal to FB,
                    consequently (Case 1) we must have C=D=1 pound.</p>
                <p>Now, as the fulcrum F supports a weight equal to C⅛D=2 pounds, the equilibrium
                    will continue if a weight E of two pounds is made to act upwards at the point F;
                    for in this case it supplies the place of the fulcrum. It is obvious also that a
                    fulcrum placed at A or B will supply the place of the weights at these parts
                    without affecting the equilibrium. Let, therefore, the weight D be removed, and
                    let the extremity B rest upon a fulcrum; then, since the lever is in equilibrio,
                    we have a weight E = C + D = 2 pounds acting at F, and balancing a weight C of
                    one pound acting at A. But 2: 1 = AB: FB, consequently, when there is an
                    equilibrium between two weights C, D acting at the distances 2 and 1 from the
                    fulcrum, and on the same side of the fulcrum, the weights are reciprocally
                    proportional to these distances.</p>
                <p>Again, let AB be the same lever, supported by the fulcra ∕ F, and let A∕= FB
                    and∕F = 2FB. Then if two weights C, D of one pound each be suspended at the
                    extremities A, B, they will be in equilibrio as before. But since the fulcrum
                    ∕supports a pressure of one pound (Axiom 2), the equilibrium will still continue
                    when that fulcrum s removed and a weight )f one pound made to ret in a contrary
                    direction/P at the point/ so that the ingle P∕F may be equal to DBA. Now (Axiom
                    1), a veight E of one pound acting upwards at∕ will be in equi-ibrio with a
                    weight E' of one pound acting downwards at <hi rend="italic">'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >if</hi> being equal to F∕, and therefore, by removing E ŕom the point∕ and
                    substituting E at the point∕', an equilibrium will still obtain. But since
                    Ff=2FB, a weight of one pound suspended from ∕ will have the same influence in
                    turning the lever round F as a weight of two pounds suspended at B (Case 2). Let
                    us remove, therefore, the weight E' from/, and substitute a weight G = 2E' so as
                    to act at B. Then, since the equilibrium is not destroyed, we have a weight C of
                    one pound acting at the distance FA, and the weights D + G = 3 pounds acting at
                    the distance FB. But FA = 3FB and D + G = 3C, consequently C: D + G = FB: FA;
                    that is, when the distances from the fulcrum are as 3 to 1, and when an
                    equilibrium exists, the weights are reciprocally proportional to these
                    distances.</p>
                <p>By making FA, in fig. 2, equal to 2FB, it maybe shown, as in Case 2, that the
                    weights are reciprocally proportional to their distances from the fulcrum, when
                    they act on the same side of the fulcrum, and when the distances are as 3 to
                    1.</p>
                <p>In the same way the demonstration may be extended to any commensurable proportion
                    of the arms, by making EA to FB in that proportion, and keeping∕A always equal
                    to FB. Hence we may conclude in general, that when two weights acting at equal
                    angles upon a straight lever devoid of weight are in equilibrio, they are
                    reciprocally proportional to their distances from the centre of motion. Q. E.
                    D.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 1. If two weights acting at equal angles upon the
                    arms of a straight lever devoid of weight are reciprocally proportional to their
                    distances from the fulcrum, they will be in equilibrio.</p>
                <p>For if an equilibrium does not take place, the proportion of the weights must be
                    altered to procure an equilibrium, and then, contrary to the proposition, the
                    weights would balance each other when they were not reciprocally proportional to
                    their distances from the fulcrum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 2. If a weight W be supported by a horizontal
                    lever resting on the fulcra A, B, the pressure upon A is to the pressure upon B
                    in the inverse ratio of their distances from the point where the weight is
                    suspended, that is, as BF to FA.</p>
                <p>For if we suppose B to be the fulcrum, and if, removing the fulcrum A, we support
                    the extremity A of the lever by a weight E equivalent to the weight sustained by
                    the fulcrum A, and acting upwards over the pulley P, then the weight E or that
                    sustained by A: W=BF: BA (Prop. I.); and if we conceive A to be the fulcrum, and
                    support the extremity B by a weight F equal to that which was supported by the
                    fulcrum B, we shall have the weight F or the weight sustained by B: W = AF: AB.
                    Hence, <hi rend="italic">ex aguo,</hi> the weight sustained by A is to the
                    weight sustained by B as BF is to FA.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 3. We may now call the two weights P and W the
                    power and the weight, as in fig. 5; and since P: W = FB: FA, we have P × FA = W
                    × FB, when an equilibrium takes place; <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ŋ W × FB P ×

                    We have already seen (Axiom 2), that when the <pb break="no"

                    contrary sides of the fulcrum, the pressure upon the fulcrum is equal to P + W,
                    or the sum of the weights; but it is obvious that when they act on the same side
                    of the fulcrum, the pressure which it supports will be P—W, or the difference of
                    their weights.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 5. If a weight P be shifted along the arm of a
                    lever AD, the weight W, which it is capable of balancing at A, will be
                    proportional to FA.</p>
                <p>When the weights are in equilibrio (Cor. 3) W: P = FA: FB, or, by alternation, W:
                    FA=P: FB; and if <hi rend="italic">w</hi> be another value of W, and <hi
                    rend="italic">fa</hi> another value of FA, we shall also have <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 6. It is obvious that the truths in the preceding
                    proposition and corollaries also hold when the lever has the form represented in
                    fig. 6, only the straight lines AF, FB are in that case the length of the
                    arm.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 7. Since by the last corollary FA: <hi
                    rend="italic">fa</hi> = W: <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> it follows, that in the <hi
                    rend="italic">steelyard,</hi> which is merely a lever with a long and short arm,
                    having a weight moveable upon the long one, the distances at which the constant
                    weight must be hung are as the weights suspended from the shorter arm. The
                    steelyard is represented in fig. 7, where AB is the lever, with unequal arms AF,
                    FB, and F the centre of motion. The body W, whose weight is to be found, is
                    suspended at the extremity A of the lever, and the constant weight P is moved
                    along the divided arm. FB till an equilibrium takes place. As soon as this
                    happens, the number placed at the point of suspension D indicates the weight of
                    the body. If the lever is devoid of weight, it is obvious that the scale FB will
                    be a scale of equal parts of which FA is the unit, and that the weight of the
                    body W will be always equal to the constant weight P multiplied by the number of
                    divisions between P and F. Thus, if the equilibrium takes place when P is pulled
                    out to the 12th division, we shall have W= 12 P; and if P = 1 pound, W = 12
                    pounds. But when the gravity of the lever is considered, which must be done in
                    the real steelyard, its arms arc generally of unequal weight, and therefore the
                    divisions of the scale must be ascertained by experiment. In order to do this,
                    remove the weight P, and find the point C, at which a weight P ’ equal to P
                    being suspended, will keep the unequal arms in equilibrio; C will then be the
                    point at which the equal divisions must commence. For when W and P are placed
                    upon the steelyard and are in equilibrio, W balances P along with a weight
                    which, placed at D, would support P placed at C: Therefore W × BF = P × DF + P ×
                    CF; but P × DF + P × CF = P × DC, consequently W × BF = P X DC, and W: DC=P: BF.
                    By taking different values of the variable quantities W and DC, as wand <hi
                    rend="italic">dc,</hi> we shall have <hi rend="italic">w</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi><hi rend="italic">dc</hi> = P: BF, consequently (Euclid, book v. prop.
                    xi. and xvi.) W: <hi rend="italic">w</hi> = DC: <hi rend="italic">dc,</hi> that
                    is, the weight of W varies as DC, and therefore the divisions must commence at
                    C. If the arm BF had been heavier than FA, which, however, can scarcely happen
                    in practice, the point C would have been on the other side of F. In constructing
                    steelyards, it might be advisable to make the unequal arms balance each other by
                    placing a weight M at the extremity of the lighter arm, in which case the scale
                    will begin at F. In the Danish and Swedish steelyard the body to be weighed and
                    'the constant weight are fixed at the extremities of the steelyard, but the
                    point of suspension or centre of motion F moves along the lever till the
                    equilibrium takes place. The point F then indicates the weight of the body
                    required. There are some steelyards in which the constant weight is fixed to the
                    shorter arm, while the body to be weighed moves upon the longer arm. The method
                    of dividing this and the preceding steelyard may be seen in De la Hire’s <hi

                <p>If two forces acting in any direction, and in the same plane, upon a lever of any
                    form, are in equilibrio, they will be reciprocally proportional to the
                    perpendiculars let fall from the fulcrum upon the directions in which they act.
                    Let AFB be alever of any form, F its fulcrum, A, B the points to which the
                    forces, or the power Pand weight λV, are applied, and AE, BK the directions in
                    which these forces act. Make AE to BK as P is to W, and they will therefore
                    represent the forces applied at A and B. Draw AC perpendicular to AF and EC
                    parallel to it, and complete the parallelogram ADEC. In the same way form the
                    parallelogram BGKH. Produce EA and KB towards <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and ?? if
                    necessary, and let fall Fm, Fz? perpendicular to AE, BK produced. Then P shall
                    be to W as F?? is to Fm. By the resolution offerees <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Dynamics,</hi> sec. 46), the force AE is equivalent to forces represented by
                    AD and AC, and acting in these directions. But as AD acts in the direction of
                    the arm AF, it can have no influence in turning the lever round F, and therefore
                    AC represents the portion of the force AD which contributes to produce an
                    angular motion round F. In the same way it may be shown that BG is the part of
                    the force BK which tends to move the lever round F. Now, suppose AF produced to
                    B, FB being made equal to FB and B'G' = BG. Then, by Prop. I. AC: B'G'= FB': FA;
                    but, by Axiom 1, the effort of BG to turn the lever round F is equal to the
                    effort of the equal force B'G' to turn the lever round F; therefore AC: BG = FB:
                    FA, and AC × FA = BG X FB. Now the triangles ACE, AF/« are similar, because the
                    angles at C and Μ are both right, and on account of the parallels FA, EC, τnAF =
                    AEC; therefore AC: AE = Fw: FA, and AC × FA = AE × F???. For the same reason, in
                    the similar triangles BGK, BFn we ιave BG: BK = Fn: FB, and BK × Fn = BG × FB.
                    Hence AE X Fzn= BK × Fn, and AE: BK or P: W <hi rend="smallcaps">= Fa</hi>: Fm.

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 2. The energies of the forces P, W to turn the
                    lever round the fulcrum F is the same, at whatever point in the directions <hi
                    rend="italic">mE, nK</hi> they are applied; for the perpendiculars to which
                    these energies are proportional remain the same. The truth of this corollary has
                    been assumed as an axiom by some writers on mechanics, who have very readily
                    deduced from it the preceding proposition. But it is very obvious, that the
                    truth assumed as self-evident is nearly equivalent to the truth which it is
                    employed to prove. Those who have adopted this mode of demonstration illustrate
                    their axiom by the case of a solid body that is either pushed in one direction
                    with a straight rod, or drawn by a cord; in both of which cases it is manifest
                    that the effect of the force employed is the same, at whatever part of the rod
                    or string it is applied. But these cases are completely different from that of a
                    body moving round a fixed centre.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 3. If AE and BK, fig. 10, the directions in which
                    the forces P, W are exerted, be produced till they meet at L; and if from the
                    fulcrum E the line FS be drawn parallel to the direction AL of one force till it
                    meets BL, the direction of the other; then LS, SF will represent the two forces.
                    For as the sides of any triangle are as the sines of the opposite angles LS: SF
                    = sin. LFS: sin. FLS; but on account of the parallels FS, AL the angle LFS =
                    FLA, and FL being radius, <hi rend="italic">Fm</hi> is the sine of FLA or LFS,
                    and F?? the sine of FLS; therefore, by substitution, LS: SF = <hi rend="italic"

                    in equilibrio, the sum of the products of the forces and the perpendiculars from
                    the fulcrum to the direction of the different forces on one side is equal to the
                    sum of the products on the other. For since the energy of each force to turn the
                    lever is equal to the product of the force and the perpendicular from the
                    fulcrum on the line of its direction; and since, in the case of an equilibrium,
                    the energy of all the forces on one side of the fulcrum must be equal to the
                    energy of all the forces on the other side; the products proportional to their
                    energies must also be equal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 5. If two forces act in a parallel direction upon
                    an angular lever whose fulcrum is its angular point, these forces will be in
                    equilibrio when a line drawn from the fulcrum upon the line which joins the two
                    points where the forces are applied, and parallel to the direction of the
                    forces, cuts it in such a manner that the two parts are reciprocally
                    proportional to the forces applied.</p>
                <p>Let AFB be the angular lever, whose fulcrum is F, and let the forces P, W be
                    applied at A and B in the parallel directions <hi rend="italic">Pm,</hi> W??;
                    then if the line FD, parallel to <hi rend="italic">Pm</hi> or <hi rend="italic"

                    Join AF, and draw <hi rend="italic">Fm, Fn</hi> perpendicular to CA and AH. The
                    weight of the wheel is evidently the weight to be raised, and may be represented
                    by W acting at the point A in the vertical direction AC. We may now consider AF
                    as a lever whose fulcrum is F, and, by</p>

                    Since Fm represents the mechanical energy of the power P to turn the wheel round
                    F, it is obvious that when FG is equal to the radius of the wheel, the weight P,
                    however great, has no power to move it over the obstacle; for when FG = AC, <hi
                    rend="italic">Fm</hi> = 0, and Fm × P = 0.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 9. If a man be placed in a pair of scales hung at
                    the extremities of a lever, and is in equilibrio with a weight in the opposite
                    scale, then if he presses against any point in the lever, except that pointfrom
                    which the scale is suspended, the equilibrium will be destroyed. Let CB be the
                    lever in equilibrio, F its fulcrum, and let the scales be suspended from A and
                    B, AP being the scale in which the man is placed. Then, if he presses with his
                    hand or with a rod against D, a point nearer the centre than A, the scale will
                    take the position AP', and the same effect will be produced as if ADP were a
                    solid mass acting upon the lever in the direction of gravity. Consequently, if
                    <hi rend="italic">F’p</hi> be drawn perpendicular from the point P ’ to FC, <hi
                    rend="italic">Fp</hi> will be the lever with which the man in the scale tends to

                    than FA, the man will preponderate. In the same way it may be shown, that if the
                    man in the scale AP presses upwards against a point C, more remote from the
                    fulcrum than A, he will diminish his relative weight, and the scale W will
                    preponderate; for in this case the scale assumes the position AP", and <hi

                <p>Various attempts have been made by different writers on mechanics to give a
                    complete and satisfactory demonstration of the fundamental property of the
                    lever. The first of these attempts was made by Archimedes, who assumes as an
                    axiom, that if two equal bodies be placed upon a lever, they will have the same
                    influence in giving it a rotatory motion as if they were both placed in the
                    middle part between them. This truth, however, is far from being self-evident,
                    and on this account Mr Vince<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. 1794, p. 33.</p></note> has completed the
                    demonstration by making this axiom a preliminary proposition. The demonstration

                    suspends a solid cylinder or prism from a lever by several threads. When the
                    lever is hung by its centre, the whole is in equilibrio. He then supposes the
                    cylinder to be cut into two unequal parts, which from their mode of suspension
                    still retain their position, and then imagines each part of the cylinder to be
                    suspended by its centre from the lever. Here then we have two unequal weights
                    hanging at unequal distances from the centre of suspension, and it follows from
                    the construction that these weights are in the reciprocal ratio of their
                    distances from that centre. Mr Vince, on the other hand, employs a cylinder
                    balanced on a fulcrum.</p>
                <p>He supposes this cylinder divided into unequal parts, and thus concludes, from
                    his preliminary proposition, that these unequal parts have the same effect in
                    turning the lever as if the weight of these parts was placed in their centres,
                    which is done by Galileo by suspending them from their centres. From this the
                    fundamental property of the lever is easily deduced. The next demonstration was
                    given by Huygens, who assumes as an axiom, that if any weight placed upon a
                    lever is removed to a greater distance from the fulcrum, its effort to turn the
                    lever will be increased. This axiom he might have demonstrated thus, and his
                    demonstration would have been completely satisfactory, though it applies only to
                    cases where the arms of the lever are commensurable. Let AB, fig. 1, be a lever
                    with equal weights C, D, supported on the fulcra^ F so that A/=FB; then, as was
                    shown in Prop. I. the weights will be in equilibrio, and each fulcrum will
                    support a weight equal to C or D. By removing the fulcrum <hi rend="italic"
                    >f,</hi> the weight C must descend, as the equilibrium is destroyed by a weight
                    equal to C acting at <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> therefore
                    the weight C, at the distance AF, has a greater effect in turning the lever than
                    an equal weight D placed at a less distance FB. In Sir Isaac Newton’s
                    demonstration, it is supposed that if a given weight act in any direction, and
                    if several radii be drawn from the fulcrum to the line of direction, the effort
                    of that <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204515" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4515-0361"/>weight
                    to turn the lever will be the same, to whatever of these radii it is applied. It
                    appears, however, from Prop. III. Cor. 2, that this principle is far from being
                    self-evident, and therefore the demonstration which is founded upon it cannot be
                    admitted as satisfactory. The demonstration given by Maclaurin<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Account of Newton’s
                    Discoveries.</p></note> is simple and convincing, and has been highly approved
                    of by Dr T. Young, and other writers on mechanics, though it extends only to any
                    commensurable proportion of the arms. He supposes the lever AB with equal arms
                    to be in equilibrio upon the fulcrum F, by means of the equal forces P, W, in
                    which case the fulcrum F will evidently be pressed down with a weight equal to
                    2P = P + W. He then substitutes, instead of the weight P, a fixed obstacle 0,
                    which will not destroy the equilibrium, and <hi rend="italic">considers the
                    fulcrum as still loaded with α weight equal to</hi> P + W. The pressure on F
                    being therefore equal to 2P or P + W, a weight E equal to 2P, and acting
                    upwards, is substituted in the room of that pressure, so that the equilibrium
                    will still continue. Here then we have a lever AB of the second kind, influenced
                    by two forces E and W acting at different distances from the fulcrum A; and
                    since E = 2P = 2W, and BB = 2AF, we have E: W= AB: AF, which expresses the
                    fundamental property of the lever. Without objecting to the circumstance that
                    this demonstration applies only to the lever of the second kind, we may be
                    allowed to observe, that it involves an axiom which cannot be called
                    self-evident. It is certainly manifest that when P and W are in equilibrio, the
                    pressure upon the fulcrum is = 2P = P + W; but it by no means follows that this
                    pressure remains the same when the fixed obstacle 0 is substituted in the room
                    of P. On the contrary, the axiom assumed is a result of the proposition which it
                    is employed to prove, or rather it is the proposition itself. For if, when the
                    extremity A bears against the obstacle 0, the pressure upon F is equal to 2W,
                    the force W obviously produces a pressure = 2W at half the distance AB, which is
                    the property to be demonstrated. The demonstrations given by Mr Landen and Dr
                    Hamilton, the former in his Memoirs, and the latter in his Essays,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See also Phil. Trans, vol.
                    xciii. p. Π3.</p></note> though in a great measure satisfactory, are long and
                    tedious. In the demonstration of Dr Hamilton, he employs the following
                    proposition: That when a body is at rest, and acted upon by three forces, they
                    will be to one another as the three sides of a triangle parallel to the
                    direction in which the forces act. When the three forces act on one point of a
                    body, the proposition is true; but it is not applicable to the case of a lever
                    where the forces are applied to three different points, and at all events the
                    demonstration does not hold when any two of the forces act in parallel
                    directions. The demonstration which we have given in Prop. I. is new, and
                    different from any that have been noticed. The truths on which it is founded are
                    perfectly axiomatic; and the only objection to which it seems liable is, that
                    the demonstration extends only to a commensurate proportion of the arms of the
                    lever. An analytical demonstration of the fundamental property of the lever was
                    given by Foncencix, which was afterwards improved by D’Alembert in the <hi

                    />rectilineal and with equal arms, we have AF = FB = <hi rend="italic"

                <p>If a power and weight acting upon the arms of any lever be in equilibrio, and if
                    the whole be put in motion, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the
                    weight as the weight is to the power.</p>
                <p>Let AFB be any lever whose fulcrum is F, and let the power P and weight W be
                    applied to its extremities A, B, so as to be in equilibrio. Draw Fm, <hi
                    rend="italic">Fn</hi> perpendicular to AD, BE the direction of the forces P, W.
                    Then suppose an uniform angular motion to be given to the lcver, so as to make
                    it describe the small angle AFA'; the position of the lever will now be A'FB',
                    and the directions of the forces P, W will be A'D', B'E, parallel to AD, BE
                    respectively, since the angle AEF is exceedingly small.</p>
                <p>Join AA', BB', and from A' and B' draw <hi rend="italic">A'x, B'z</hi>
                    perpendicular to AD and BE. Now it is obvious, that though the point A has moved
                    through the space AA' in the same time that the point B has described the space
                    BB', yet <hi rend="italic">Ax</hi> is the space described by A in the direction
                    AD, and <hi rend="italic">Bz</hi> the space described by B in the direction BE.
                    For if we suppose a plane passing through A at right angles to AD, and another
                    through P parallel to the former plane, it is manifest that <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ax</hi> measures the approach of the point A to the plane passing through P;
                    and for the same reason <hi rend="italic">Bz</hi> measures the approach of the
                    point B to a plane passing through W at right angles to WB. Therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">Ax, Bz</hi> represent the spaces uniformly and simultaneously
                    described by the points A, B, and may therefore be taken to denote the
                    velocities of these points; consequently the velocity of A: the velocity of B =

                    + <hi rend="italic">mF A</hi> (Euclid, book i. prop. 32), and A'AF = AmF,
                    because AFA'is so exceedingly small that A'A is sensibly perpendicular to AF;
                    consequently <hi rend="italic">xAA</hi> ’ = AFm; and as the angles at “and <hi

                    are similar.</p>

                    angle which one line in the plane AB forms with another in the horizontal plane
                    BC, both these lines being at right angles to the common intersection of the two

                <p>In order to understand how the inclined plane acts as a mechanical power, let us
                    suppose it necessary to elevate the weight D from C to A. If this weight is
                    lifted by the arms of a man to the point A, he must support the whole of the
                    load; but when it is rolled up the inclined plane, a considerable part of its

                <p>When any weight W is kept in equilibrio upon an inclined plane by a power P, the
                    power is to the weight as the sine of the plane’s inclination is to the sine of
                    the angle which the direction of the power makes with a line at right angles to
                    the plane.</p>
                <p>Let MN be the inclined plane, NO a horizontal line, and MNO the inclination of
                    the plane, and let the weight W be sustained upon MN by means of the power P
                    acting in the direction AE. From the point A, the centre of gravity of the
                    weight, draw AB perpendicular to the horizontal plane NO, and AF perpendicular
                    to MN; produce EA till it meets the plane in C, and from the point F where the
                    body touches the plane draw <hi rend="italic">Fm</hi> at right angles to AC, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Fn</hi> at right angles to AB. Then, since the whole body may
                    be considered as collected in the centre of gravity A, AB will be the direction
                    in which it tends to fall, or the direction of the weight, and EA is the
                    direction of the power; but AF is a lever whose fulcrum is F, and since it is
                    acted upon by two forces which are in equilibrio, we shall have (Prop. III. Cor.
                    8) P: W = Fn: Fm, that is, as the perpendiculars drawn from the fulcrum to the
                    direction in which the forces act. Now FA being radius, Fn is the sine of the
                    angle FAB, and <hi rend="italic">Fm</hi> is the sine of the angle FAC; but FAB
                    is equal to MNO the angle of the plane’s inclination, on account of the right
                    angles at F and B and the vertical angles at D; and FAC is the angle which the
                    direction of the power makes with a line perpendicular to the plane; therefore
                    P: W as the sine of the plane’s inclination is to the sine of the angle formed
                    by the direction of the power with a line at right angles to the plane.</p>

                    in the direction FA, then, when the direction of the power is AE parallel to the
                    horizon, the power, the weight, and the pressure upon the plane, will be
                    respectively as the height, the base, and the length of the plane. The weight W
                    is aeted upon by three forces; by its own gravity in the direction <hi

                    the power of P in the direction AF. Therefore, since these forces are in

                    measured by the space FD uniformly described; and for the same reason, though

                <p>The inclined plane, when combined with other machinery, is often of great use in
                    the elevation of weights. It has been the opinion of some writers, that the huge
                    masses of stone which are found at great altitudes in the splendid remains of
                    Egyptian architecture, were raised upon inclined planes of earth, with the aid
                    of other mechanical powers. This supposition, however, is not probable, as the
                    immense blocks of granite which compose the pyramids of Egypt could not possibly
                    have been raised into their present situation by any combination of the
                    mechanical powers with which we are acquainted. The inclined plane has been very
                    advantageously employed in the Duke of Bridgewater’s canal. After this canal has
                    extended forty miles on the same level, it is joined to a subterraneous
                    navigation about twelve miles long, by means of an inclined plane, and this
                    subterraneous portion is again connected by an inclined plane with another
                    subterraneous portion about 106 feet above it. This inclined plane is a stratum
                    of stone which slopes one foot in four, and is about 453 feet long. The boats
                    are conveyed from one portion of the canal to another by means of a windlass, so
                    that a loaded boat descending along the plane turns the axis of the windlass,
                    and raises an empty boat. A pair of stairs, and all <hi rend="italic">roads</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">railways</hi> that are not horizontal, may be regarded as
                    inclined planes; and hence it is a matter of great importance, in carrying a

                    The additional length which, in order to effect this purpose, must sometimes be
                    given to the line of road, is a trifling inconvenience, when compared with the
                    advantages of a gentle declivity. In ascending steep hills, the horses have the
                    sagacity to judge of the inclination of the plane, and facilitate the ascent by
                    winding from one side of the road to another.</p>

                    and sometimes the power is applied to the levers S, S fixed in the periphery of
                    the wheel; but in all these forms the principle of the machine remains
                    unaltered. That the wheel and axle is an assemblage of levers will be obvious,
                    by considering that the very same effect would be produced if a number of levers
                    were to radiate from the centre of the wheel, and if a rope carrying the power P
                    were to pass over their extremities, and extricate itself from the descending
                    levers when they come into a horizontal position.</p>

                    circumferences of the axle and wheel in the points A, B, by means of ropes
                    winding round these circumferences. As the effect is the same according to the

                    consequently the machine may be regarded as a lever AFB, whose centre of motion
                    is F. But since the directions of the power and weight make equal angles with
                    the arms of the lever, we have (Prop. I. p. 356) P: W = FB: FA, that is, the

                    mentioned in the preceding corollary, the power will be to the weight, in die
                    case of an equilibrium, as the product of the number of teeth in all the pinions

                    l</hi> of a watch, round which the chain is coiled, is a beautiful illustration
                    of the principle of the wheel and axle. The spring-box may be considered as the
                    wheel, and the fusee the axle or pinion to which the chain communicates the
                    motion of the box. The power resides in the spring wound round an axis in the
                    centre of the box, and the weight is applied to the lower circumference of the
                    fusee. As the force of the spring is greatest when it is newly wound up, and
                    gradually decreases as it unwinds itself, it is necessary that the fusee should
                    have different radii, so that the chain may act upon the narrowest part of the
                    fusee when its force is greatest, and upon the widest part of the fusee when its
                    force is least; for the equable motion of the watch requires that the inequality
                    in the action of the spring should be counteracted so as to produce an uniform
                    effect. In order to accomplish this, the general outline of the surface of the
                    fusee must be an Apollonian hyperbola, in which the ordinates are inversely as
                    their respective abscissae. For further information on this subject, see <hi

                    rend="smallcaps">Definition.</hi> The pulley is a machine composed of a wheel
                    with a groove in its circumference, and a rope which passes round this groove.
                    The wheel moves on an axis whose extremities are supported on a kind of frame
                    called the <hi rend="italic">bloch,</hi> to which is generally suspended the
                    weight to be raised. A system of pulleys is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >muffle,</hi> which is either fixed or moveable, according as the block which
                    contains the pulleys is fixed or moveable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> I.</p>
                <p>In a single pulley, or system of pulleys, where the different portions of the
                    rope are parallel to each other, and where one extremity of it is fixed, there
                    is an equilibrium when the power is to the weight as unity is to the number of
                    the portions of the rope which support the weight.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Case</hi> 1. In the single fixed pulley AA let the power P
                    and weight W be equal, and act against each other by means of the rope PA AW
                    passing over the pulley AA; then it is obvious, that whatever force is exerted
                    by P in the direction PA, the same force must be exerted in the opposite
                    direction WA, consequently these equal and opposite forces must be in
                    equilibrio; and as the weight is supported only by one rope, the proposition is
                    demonstrated, for P: W = 1: 1.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Case</hi> 2. In the single moveable pulley (fig. 30), where
                    the rope, fastened at H, goes beneath the moveable pulley D and over the fixed
                    pulley C, the weight to be raised is suspended from the centre of the pulley D
                    by the block <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and the power is applied at P in the
                    direction PE. Now it is evident that the portions Cjö, HD of the rope sustain
                    the weight W, and as they are equally stretched in every point, each must
                    sustain one half of W; but (Case 1) in the single pulley C the rope CEP sustains
                    a weight equal to what the rope <hi rend="italic">Cp</hi> sustains; that is, it
                    sustains one half of W. Consequently P = ⅜ W, or W = 2 P, when there is an
                    equilibrium; and since the weight W is supported by <hi rend="italic">two</hi>
                    strings, we have P: W = 1: 2.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Case</hi> 3. When the same rope passes round a number of
                    pulleys, the ropes which support the weight W are evidently equally stretched in
                    every part, and therefore each of them sustains the same weight. Consc-quently,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204580" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4580-0366"/>if there be

                    and therefore P = ⅛ W, or W = 10 P, which gives us P: W = 1:10. The pulley in
                    fig. 32 is the patent pulley invented by Mr White, in which the lateral friction
                    and shaking motion is considerably removed. This ingenious pulley has great
                    theoretical advantages; but it has been found difficult to give the grooves the
                    exact proportions, which depend on the thickness of the rope. If this is not
                    effected, the rope becomes unequally stretched; some parts being in a state of
                    great tension, and others comparatively slack. The rope is also subject to be
                    discharged from the grooves.</p>

                <p>This system is represented in fig. 34, where the rope which carries the power P
                    passes over the fixed pulley Μ, and beneath the moveable pulley A, to the hook
                    E, where it is fixed. Another rope fixed to a hook below A, passes over B, and

                <p>In this system of pulleys, the rope which sustains the power P passes over the
                    pulley C, and is fixed to the weight at D. Another rope attached to the pulley C
                    passes over the pulley B and is fixed to the weight at E, and a third rope
                    fastened to B passes over A and is fixed at F. Then it is manifest that the rope
                    CD sustains a weight equal to P; and since the pulley C is pulled downward with
                    a weight equal to 2P, the rope BC must support a weight equal to 2P, and the
                    rope B the same weight; consequently the rope AB sustains 4P. The whole weight
                    therefore is P + 2P + 4P, and hence P: W = P ∙ P + 2P + 4P, or P: W = 1: 1 +

                    which two pulleys arc supported by one rope, there is an equilibrium when P: W =
                    1 :4.</p>
                <p>In this combination of pulleys, the rope AB which supports the power P passes
                    over the moveable pulley A, and beneath C towards H, ¼4ιere it is fixed. Another
                    rope, attached to the pulley A, passes over the fixed pulley B, and is fastened
                    at E to the pulley C, which supports the weight W. Then, since the rope AP
                    supports 1 pound, the rope AC also supports 1 pound, and therefore the pulley A,
                    or the rope BA, is pulled down with a force of 2 pounds. But the rope BDE is
                    equally stretched with BA, consequently the pulley C, to which DE is attached,
                    is pulled upwards with a force of 2 pounds. Now the rope AC supporting 1 pound,
                    the rope GH must likewise support 1 pound, consequently, since DE sustains 2
                    pounds, AC 1 pound, and HG 1 pound, they will together sustain W = 4 pounds, and
                    therefore P: W = 1: 4.</p>

                <p>In this system the rope PB passes over B round C, and is fixed atE. Another rope
                    attached to B passes round AF, and is fixed at I to the pulley CD, which carries
                    the weight W. Now the rope BP being stretched with a force of 1 pound, the ropes
                    BGC, CDE, are also stretched with a force of 1 pound each, and the pulley CD is
                    pulled upwards with a force of 2 pounds. But since the three ropes BP, ED, and
                    GC, are each stretched with a force of 1 pound, the pulley Band the rope BA,
                    upon which they all act in one direction, must be pulled down with a force of 3
                    pounds. Now the rope FI is equally stretched with BA, consequently it will draw
                    the pulley CD upwards with a force of 3 pounds; and since it is drawn upwards by
                    the ropes CG, DF, with a force of 2 pounds, the whole force will sustain W = 5
                    pounds; but this force of 5 pounds is, by the hypothesis, in equilibrio with P

                <p>In a system of moveable pulleys, where each has a separate rope, and where the

                    invariable; consequently vclo-ity P: velocity W = W: P.</p>

                    which the ower is suspended, sixteen inches; so that since the ower of this

                    therefore CP is lengthened altogether seven inches, and as the power of the
                    pulley is as 7 to 1, we have, as before, velocity P: velocity W = W: P.</p>

                    are each shortened one inch. By the shortening of HG, CA one inch each, the rope
                    AP is lengthened <hi rend="italic">two inches;</hi> and by the shortening of DE

                    consequently, since AP is lengthened in all four inches, and since the power of
                    the pulleys is four, we have velocity P: velocity W = W: P.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Case</hi> 7. In the other Spanish barton, in fig. 37, when

                    is lengthened two inches; therefore, since the rope BP is lengthened altogether
                    five inches, and since the pulleys have a power of five, we have, as formerly,

                    rend="smallcaps">Definition.</hi> A wedge is a machine composed of two inclined
                    planes with their bases in contact; or, more properly', it is a triangular
                    prism, generated by the motion of a triangle, parallel to itself, along a
                    straight line passing through the vertex of one of its angles. The wedge is
                    called <hi rend="italic">isosceles, rectangular,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >scalene,</hi> according as the triangle ABC (fig. 40) by which the wedge is
                    generated, is an isosceles, a rectangular, or a scalene triangle. The part AB is
                    called the head or back of the wedge, DC its altitude, and AC, BC its faces. The
                    wedge is generally employed for cleaving wood or for quarrying stones; but all
                    cutting instruments, such as knives, swords, chisels, teeth, nails, pins,
                    needles, awls, &amp;c. properly belong to this mechanical power, whether they
                    act in a direction at right angles, or oblique to the cutting surface.</p>
                <p>The wedge is frequently employed in machinery where a great force is to be
                    exerted through a short space. Falling edifices have been thrown back into their
                    perpendicular position by means of wedges; ships are raised in docks by driving
                    wedges beneath their keels; and in America houses are raised by them, and a new
                    story built below.</p>
                <p>In the Dutch wind-mills described in a future part of this article, and used for
                    manufacturing oil of colza, the seeds from which the oil is expressed are placed
                    in bags of hair lying between two flat pieces of hard wood. Between each two of
                    these pieces of wood a wedge is inserted, and a stamper, lifted by each
                    revolution of the windshaft, strikes a blow on its head, which compresses the
                    planes, and consequently the bags, to such a degree, that the seeds are squeezed
                    into a mass almost as solid as wood.</p>
                <p>A beautiful application of the wedge was made by Mr Brunel in his earliest
                    attempts to cut veneers. He cut the wood by the application of pressure to the
                    back of the wedge, and the thin veneer coiled itself up like a scroll of paper.
                    The valuable wood was thus cut without any loss. As the strata of the wood,
                    however, were slightly separated by the force which compelled it to roll <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194204606" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4606-0368"/> itself up, the
                    London cabinet-makers would not purchase it. This apparent defect was, however,
                    a real advantage, for the glue insinuated itself into the fissures, and united
                    the veneer so firmly to its bed that they were inseparable. We have seen, in Mr
                    Brunel’s house at Battersea Bridge, beautiful furniture made of such veneers. It
                    was necessary, however, to yield to the prejudices of others, and Mr Brunel
                    abandoned his method of cutting veneers by the wedge, and resorted to the system
                    of circular saws, which he brought to the highest degree of perfection.</p>
                <p>In all wedges which cut by pressure, the cutting edge may be much sharper than
                    when they are urged by impulse. Tools for cutting wood should have an angle of
                    about 30°, for iron from 50° to 60°, and for brass from 80° to 90°.</p>

                <p>If each of the faces of an isosceles wedge, which are perfectly smooth, meet with
                    an equal resistance from forces acting at equal angles of inclination to their
                    faces, and if a power act perpendicularly upon the back, these forces will be in
                    equilibrio when the power upon the back is to the sum of the resistances upon
                    the sides, as the sine of half the angle of the wedge, multiplied by the sine of
                    the angle at which the resisting forces act upon its faces, is to the square of
                    radius.</p>
                <p>Let ABC be the wedge, AC, BC its acting faces, and MD, ND the directions in which
                    the resisting forces act upon these faces, forming with them the equal angles
                    DMA, DNB. Draw CD, DF, DE at right angles to three sides of the wedge, and join
                    F, E meeting CD in G. On account of the equal triangles CAD, CDB (Euclid, book
                    i. prop. 26), AD =DB; and in the equal triangles ADM, BDN, MD = ND. In the same
                    way DF = DE and AF = BE, therefore CF = CE. But in the triangles CFG,</p>
                <p>CEG there are two sides FC, CG equal to EC, CG, and the angle FCG = ECG,
                    consequently FG = GE, and FGC, ADC are both right angles, therefore FE is
                    parallel to AB. Now the force MD is resolvable into DF, FM, of which FM has no
                    effect upon the wedge. But, as the effective force FD is not in direct
                    opposition to the perpendicular force exerted on the back of the wedge, we may
                    resolve it into the two forces FG, GD, of which GD acts in direct opposition to
                    the power, while FG acts in a direction parallel to the back of the wedge. In
                    the same way it may be shown that EG, GD are the only effective forces which
                    result from the force ND. But the forces FG, EG being equal and opposite,
                    destroy each other; consequently 2GD is the force which opposes that which is
                    exerted upon the back of the wedge, and the wedge will be kept at rest if the
                    force upon the back is equal to 2GD, that is, when the force upon the back is to
                    the sum of the resistances upon the faces as 2GD is to MD + ND, or as 2GD: 2DM,
                    or as GD is to DM. Now</p>
                <p>DG: DF = sin. DFG: radius, or as (Euclid, vi. 8) sin. DCF: radius, and</p>
                <p>DF: MD = sin. DMF: radius; therefore, by composition,</p>
                <p>DG: MD = sin. DCF × sin. DMF :rad. × rad. or rad.∣ <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>. But DG: MD as the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances,
                    therefore the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances as sin. DCF ×
                    sin. DMF is to the square of the radius.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 1. If the direction of the resisting forces is
                    perpendicular to the faces of the wedge, DMF becomes a right angle, and
                    therefore its sine is equal to radius. Consequently we have, in this case, the
                    force upon the back <hi rend="underline">to the</hi> sum of the resistances, as
                    sin. DCF × rad. is to radius ∣ <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi>, that is, as sin.

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 2. In the particular case in the proposition, it
                    is obvious that the forces MF, NE are not opposed by any other forces, and
                    therefore the force upon the back will not sustain the resisting forces; but in
                    the case in Cor. 2 the forces MF, NE vanish, and therefore the other forces will
                    sustain each other.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 3. If the resisting forces act in a direction
                    perpendicular to AB, the angle DMF becomes equal to ACD, and therefore t <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 4. When the direction of the resistances is
                    parallel to the back of the wedge, the angle of inclination DMC becomes the
                    complement of the semi-angle of the wedge, and therefore the force upon the back
                    is to the sum of the resistances as the sin. ACD × cos. ACD is to the square of
                    the radius, that is, as DA × DC is to AC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. But in
                    the similar triangles DAF, DAC, we haveDF: DA = DC: AC, and DF × AC = DA × DC,
                    consequently the force upon the back of the wedge is to the sum of the
                    resistances as DF × AC is to AC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, that is, as DF:

                <p>If, on account of the friction of the wedge, or any other cause, the resistances
                    are wholly effective, that is, if the resisting surfaces adhere to the places to
                    which they are applied without sliding, there will be an equilibrium, when the
                    force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances, as the sine of the acute
                    angle which the direction of the resisting forces makes with the back of the
                    wedge is to radius.</p>

                    the forces MD, ND are resolvable into MH, HD and intoNH, HD, and since MH, HN
                    destroy each other, the force upon the back is sustained by 2HD. Consequently,
                    the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances as 2HD is to 2MD, or as
                    HD is to MD. But the angle ADM, which the direction of the forces makes with the
                    back of the wedge, is equal toDMN, and HD is the sine of that angle, MD being
                    radius; therefore the force upon the back is to the sum of the resistances as

                    sides of a wedge of any form, the forces are to one another as the sides of the
                    wedge.</p>
                <p>This is obvious from <hi rend="smallcaps">Dynamics,</hi> sect 50, <hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">seq.</hi> from which it follows, that
                    when three forces are in equilibrio, they are proportional to the sides of a
                    triangle, which are respectively perpendicular to their directions.</p>

                <p>When the power acting upon the back of a wedge is in equilibrio with the
                    resistances opposed to it, the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the
                    resistance as the resistance is to the power.</p>
                <p>Produce DM to K (fig. 40), and draw CK perpendicular to DK. Then, by Prop. I.,
                    the power is to the resistance as MD: DII. Let the wedge be moved uniformly from
                    D to C, and DK is the space uniformly described by the resisting force in the
                    direction in which it acts; therefore, the velocity of the power is to the
                    velocity of the resistance as DC: DK; that is, on account of the equiangular
                    triangles DHM, DKC, as MD: DH; that is, as the resistance is to the power.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">Definition.</hi> A screw is a cylinder with an inclined plane
                    wrapped round it, in such a manner, that the surface of the plane is oblique to
                    the axis of the cylinder, and forms the same angle with it in every part of the
                    cylindrical surface. When the inclined plane winds round the exterior surface of
                    a solid cylinder, it is called a male screw; but when it is fixed on the
                    interior circumference of a cylindrical tube, it is called a female screw. In
                    the female screw, the spiral grooves formed by the inclined plane on the surface
                    of the cylindrical tube must be equal in breadth to the inclined plane in the
                    male screw, in order that the one may move freely in the other. By attending to
                    the mode in which the spiral threads are formed by the circumvolution of the
                    inclined plane, it will appear, that if one complete revolution of the inclined
                    plane is developed, its altitude will be to its base as the distance between the
                    threads is to the circumference of the screw. Thus, let <hi rend="italic"
                    >abc</hi> (fig. 41) be the inclined plane, whose base is <hi rend="italic"
                    >αc</hi> and altitude <hi rend="italic">be,</hi> and let it be wrapped round the
                    cylinder MN 'fig. 42), of such a size that the points <hi rend="italic">a,
                    c</hi> may coincide. The surface <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> of the plane (fig.
                    41) .vill evidently form the spiral thread <hi rend="italic">adeb</hi> (fig.
                    12), and <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> the distance between the threads, jvill be
                    equal to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> (fig. 41), the altitude of the ιlane, and the
                    circumference of the screw MN will be equal to <hi rend="italic">ac,</hi> the
                    base of the plane. If any ιody, therefore, is made to rise along the plane <hi
                    rend="italic">ιdd&gt;</hi> in fig. 42, or along the spiral thread of the crew,
                    by a force acting in a direction parallel o <hi rend="italic">adcb,</hi> there
                    will be the same proportion beween the power and the resistance as if the body
                    as-ended the plane <hi rend="italic">abc</hi> (fig. 41).</p>
                <p>A male screw with triangular threads is re-resented in fig. 43, and its
                    corresponding fe~ ιale screw in fig. 44. A ,ιale screw with quad-angular threads
                    is ex-ibited in fig. 45, and the i ?male screw in which it <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> orks in fig. 46. The ’ ietion is considerably :ssin
                    quadrangular than ι triangular threads, tough, when the screw made of wood, the

                    the threads i ιoιιld be quadran-alar; but the tri angular form is preferable in
                    small screws. When the screw is employed in practice, the power is always
                    applied to the extremity of a screw-driver or lever placed temporarily or fixed
                    permanently in its head. This is shown in fig. 47, where AB is the lever acting
                    upon the screw BC, which works in a female screw in the block F, and exerts its
                    force in bending the spring CD.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> I.</p>
                <p>If the screw is employed to overcome any resistance, there will be an equilibrium
                    when the power is to the resistance as the distance between two adjacent threads
                    is to the circumference described by the power.</p>
                <p>Let FAK be a section of the screw represented in fig. 45, perpendicular to its
                    axis; CD a portion of the inclined plane which forms the spiral thread, and P
                    the power, which, when applied at C in the plane ACF, will be in equilibrium
                    with a weight upon the inclined plane CD. Then, in the inclined plane, when the
                    direction of the power is parallel to the base, we have (Prop. I. Cor. 1, Sect.
                    II.) P: W, as the altitude of the plane is to the base, or (Sect. IV. Der.) as
                    the distance between two threads is to the whole circumference FKCF. If we
                    suppose another power P' to act at the end of the lever AB, and describe the
                    arch HBG, and that this power produces the same effect at B as the power P did
                    at C, then (Sect. I. Prop. I.) we have P': P = CA: BA, that is, as FKCF is to
                    the whole circumference of the circle HBG; but it was shown before, that P: W as
                    the distance between two contiguous threads is to FKCF; therefore, by
                    composition, P': W as the distance between two threads is to HBG, or the
                    circumference of a circle whose radius is AB. Q. E. D.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 1. It is evident from the proposition, that the
                    power does not in the least depend upon the size of the cylinder FCK, but that
                    it increases with the distance of that point from the centre A, to which the
                    power is applied, and also with the shortness of the distance between the
                    threads. Therefore, if P, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> be the powers applied to two
                    different screws, D, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> the distances of these powers from
                    the axis, and T, <hi rend="italic">t</hi> the distances between the threads;
                    their energy in overcoming a given resistance will be directly as their
                    distances from the axis, and inversely as the distances of their threads, that
                    is, P: <hi rend="italic">p</hi> = ψ-: p or P va-</p>

                <p>In the endless screw there will be an equilibrium when the power is to the weight
                    as the distance of the threads multiplied by the radius of the axle is to the
                    distance of the power from the axis of the screw multiplied by the radius of the
                    wheel.</p>
                <p>The endless screw, which is represented in fig. 49, consists of a screw EF, so
                    combined with the wheel and axle ABC, that the threads of the screw may work in
                    teeth fixed in the periphery of the wheel, and thus communicate the power
                    exerted at the handle or winch P.</p>

                    but, in the wheel and axle, W': W as the radius of the axle is to the radius of
                    the wheel; therefore, by composition, P: W as the distances of the threads
                    multiplied by the radius of the axle C is to the distance of the power P from
                    the axis multiplied by the radius of the wheel AB.</p>

                <p>When there is an equilibrium in the screw, the velocity of the weight is to the
                    velocity of the power as the power is to the weight.</p>
                <p>It is obvious from fig. 48, that while the power describes the circumference of
                    the circle HBG uniformly, the weight uniformly rises through a space equal to
                    the distance between two adjacent threads; therefore the velocity of the power
                    is to the velocity of the weight as the distance between the threads is to the
                    arch described by the power, that is (by Prop. I.), as the weight is to the
                    power.</p>

                    1 threads in an inch, and into this female screw is introduced a male screw DE,
                    having, of course, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> + 1 threads in an inch. The screw DE
                    is prevented from moving round with CD by the frame ABCD and the cross bar <hi
                    rend="italic">a b,</hi> but is permitted to ascend and descend with-outa motion
                    of rotation. Then, by a revolution of the screw CD, the other screw DE will rise
                    through a space equal to , and if the circumference <hi rend="italic">η</hi> + 1

                    the number of threads in CD, to be 12, and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> + 1, or the
                    number of threads in DE, will consequently be 13. Let us suppose that the handle
                    CK is turned round 12 times; the screw CD will evidently ascend through the
                    space of an inch; and if the screw DE is permitted to have a motion of rotation
                    along with CD, it will also advance an inch. Let the screw DE be now moved
                    backwards by 12 revolutions, it will evidently describe a space of-j-∣ths of an
                    inch, and the consequence of both these motions will be that the point E is
                    advanced <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> 7</hi> th of an inch. But since DE is prevented from moving
                    round with CD, the same effect will be produced as if it had moved 12 times
                    round with CD, and had been turned 12 times backwards; that is, it will in both
                    cases have advanced ⅛th of an inch. Since, therefore, it has advanced <hi

                    length of the lever CK is eight inches, its extremity K will describe, in the
                    same time, a space equal to 16 × 3∙1416 =50∙2656 inches, the circumference of
                    the circle described by K; therefore the velocity of the weight is to the
                    velocity of the power as ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> th of an inch is to
                    50∙2656 inches, or as 1 is to 7841∙4336, that is (Prop. ΠI.), P: W = 1:
                    7841∙4336. Hence the force of this double screw is much greater than that of the
                    common screw, for a common one with a lever 8 inches long must have 156 threads
                    in an inch to give the same power, which would render it too weak to overcome
                    any considerable resistance.</p>
                <p>Mr Hunter proposes<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>ibid.
                    p. 65.</p></note> to connect with his double screws a wheel and a lantern, which
                    are put in motion by a winch or handle. The power of this compound machine is so
                    great, that a man, by exerting a force of 32 pounds at the winch, will produce
                    an effect of 172100 pounds; and if we suppose fds of this effect to be destroyed
                    by friction, there will remain an effect of 57600 pounds. In some screws it
                    would be advantageous, instead of perforating the male screw CD, to have two
                    cylindrical screws of different kinds at different parts of the same axis. Mr
                    Hunter also proposes to apply this form of the screw for producing the
                    adjustments in single and double microscopes, and also for moving the wires or
                    divided lenses of micrometers.</p>

                <p>In employing the screw for producing mechanical er- <hi rend="superscript">
                    j</hi> fleets, it is most useful when a great pressure is to be ex- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> erted within a short space. Hence it is used in all
                    presses <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> where liquids or juices are expressed
                    from solid bodies. It is peculiarly useful in coining and in printing, where the
                    pressure of the die upon the metal, or of the types upon the paper, is required
                    only through a very short space. The screw is also employed in compressing
                    cotton into hard dense masses, to reduce it into the smallest bulk for land or
                    sea carriage. The screw is likewise used for raising water, in which form it is
                    called the screw of Archimedes (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydrodynamics)</hi>;
                    and it has been lately employed in the flour-mills in America for pushing the
                    flour which comes from the mill-stones to the end of a long trough, from which
                    it is conveyed to other parts of the machinery, in order to undergo the
                    remaining processes. In this case, the spiral threads are very large in
                    proportion to the cylinder on which they are fixed.</p>
                <p>As the lever attached to the extremity of the screw moves through a very great
                    space when compared with the velocity of its other extremity, or of any body
                    which it puts in motion, the screw is of immense use in subdividing any space
                    into a great number of minute parts. Hence it is employed in the engines for
                    dividing mathematical instruments, and in those which have been recently used in
                    the art of engraving. It is likewise of great use in the common wire micrometer,
                    and in the divided object-glass micrometer, instruments to which the science of
                    astronomy has been under great obligations.</p>

                    coincides with that of FD, and consequently the beam AB, which is perpendicular
                    to CF, must be horizontal. When this happens, the weights in the scale are
                    evidently equal.</p>

                    length, which is known by changing the weights in the Mes; for if the

                    into a horizontal )sition. The centre of motion, therefore, should not •incide
                    with the centre of gravity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 4. If the centre of motion is in the line which
                    ins the points of suspension, the accuracy of the bance will be increased. The

                <p>A balance with all the properties mentioned in the preceding corollaries, has
                    been invented by Μ. Kuhne, and described in the work already quoted in the
                    Proposition. It is so contrived that the points of suspension may be placed
                    either above the centre of motion or below it, or in the line of its axis; the
                    beam is furnished with an index, which points out the proportion of the weights
                    upon a divided scale, and the friction of the axis is diminished by the
                    application of friction wheels.</p>
                <p>In order to get rid of the difficulties which attend the construction of the
                    tongue, the handle, and the arms of the balance, Μ. Magellan invented a very
                    accurate and moveable one, in Which there is no handle, and where one of the
                    arms acts as a tongue. The body to be weighed and the counterpoise are placed in
                    the same scale, so that it is of little consequence whether the arms of the
                    balance are equal or not. In this balance the centre of motion can be moved to
                    the smallest distance from the centre of gravity. See <hi rend="italic">Journal

                    property of the lever, which we have explained in Prop. V. Sect. I. The angular

                    equidistant from A and B. The weight P is suspended by a thread from A; and the

                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-4658-0372"/>, is suspended by" a thread from B. Hence it is
                    obvious, that with different bodies the lever AFB will have different degrees of
                    inclination, and the index or tongue LF/Ç which is perpendicular to AB, will
                    form different angles ZFL, <hi rend="italic">bFf</hi> with the line of direction

                <p>CHAP. IV.—ON THE CENTRE OF INERTIA OR GRAVITY.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Definition.</hi> The centre of inertia, or the centre of
                    gravity, of any body or system of bodies, is that point upon which the body or
                    system of bodies, when influenced only by the force of gravity, will be in
                    equilibrio in every position. The centre of inertia of plain surfaces bounded by
                    right lines, and also of some solids, may be easily determined by common
                    geometry. The application of the method of fluxions, however, to this branch of
                    mechanics is so simple and beautiful, that we shall also avail ourselves of its
                    assistance. The centre of gravity has been called by some writers the centre of
                    position, and by others the centre of mean distances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> I.</p>
                <p>To find the centre of inertia of any number of bodies, whatever be their
                    position.</p>
                <p>Let A, B, C, D be any number of bodies influenced by the force of gravity.
                    Suppose the bodies A, B connected by the inflexible line AB considered as devoid
                    of weight, then find a point F, so that the weight of A: the Weight of B, — BF:
                    FA. The bodies A, B will therefore be in equilibrio about the point F in every
                    position (Prop. I. Sect. I.) and the pressure upon F will be equal to A + B.
                    Join</p>
                <p>FC, and find the point <hi rend="italic">f</hi> so that A + B.∙C = C/:∕F; the
                    bodies A, B, C, will consequently be in equilibrio upon the point <hi
                    rend="italic">f,</hi> which will sustain a pressure equal to A + B + C. Join DyÇ
                    and take the point <hi rend="italic">&lt;p,</hi> so that A + B + C: D = <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;pÐ ∙. &lt;pf</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> s</hi> the
                    bodies A, B, C, D will therefore be in equilibrio about the point <hi
                    rend="italic">φ,</hi> which will be their common centre of inertia, and which
                    supports a weight equal to A + B + C + D. In the same manner we may find the
                    centre of inertia of any system of bodies, by merely connecting the last fulcrum
                    with the next body by an inflexible right line, and finding a new fulcrum from
                    the magnitude of the opposite weights which it is to sustain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 1. If the weights of the bodies A, B, C, D be
                    increased or diminished in a given ratio, the centre <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    inertia of the system will not be changed, for the positions of the points F,
                    <hi rend="italic">f &lt;p</hi> are determined by the relative and not by the
                    absolute weights of the bodies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 2. A motion of rotation cannot be communicated to
                    a body by means of a force acting upon its centre of inertia; for the
                    resistances which the inertia of each particle opposes to the communication of
                    motion act in parallel directions, and as they are proportional to the weights
                    of the particles, they will be in equilibrio about the centre of gravity.</p>

                <p>Let A, B, C, D, E be any number of bodies whose common centre of gravity is <hi

                <p>If we consider the straight line as composed of a number of material particles of
                    the same size and density, it is evident that its centre of inertia will be a

                    a lever supported upon its middle point as a fulcrum, it will evidently be in
                    equilibrio in every position, as the number of particles or weights on each side

                    equilibrio about a point situated in the line AD, consequently the centre of
                    gravity is in that line. For the same reason it follows, that the centre of
                    gravity is in the line CE, that is, it will be in F, the point of intersection
                    of these two lines. In order to determine the relation between FA and FD, join
                    ED; then, since BE = EA, and BD = DC, BE: EA = BD: DC, and consequently ED is
                    parallel to AC, and the triangles BED, BAC similar. We have, therefore, CA: CB =

                <p>To find the centre of inertia of a pyramid with a polygonal base.</p>
                <p>Let the pyramid be triangular, as AB CD, fig. 60. Bisect BD in F, and join CF and
                    FA. Make F∕ = ⅜ of FC, and F <hi rend="italic">φ = ⅜</hi> of FA, and draw <hi
                    rend="italic">fφ.</hi> It is evident, from Prop. II. of this chapter, that/ is
                    the centre of gravity of the triangular base BCD, and that the line <hi
                    rend="italic">Af,</hi> which joins the vertex and the point/, will pass through
                    the centre of gravity of all the triangular laminae or sections of the pyramid
                    parallel to its base BCD; for, by taking any section <hi rend="italic">bed,</hi>
                    and joining <hi rend="italic">cm,</hi> it may be easily shown that <hi
                    rend="italic">bm = and,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tnn = ⅜ me,</hi> so that <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> is the centre of gravity of the section <hi rend="italic"
                    >bed.</hi> It follows, therefore, that A∕will pass through the centre of gravity
                    of the pyramid. In the same way it may be shown, by considering ABD as the base,
                    and C the vertex, and making Fp = ⅜ FA, that the centre of gravity lies in the
                    line <hi rend="italic">&lt;pC.</hi> But as the lines A∕, pC lie in the plane of
                    the triangle AFC, they must intersect each other; and therefore the point of
                    intersection H will be the centre of inertia of the triangular pyramid. Now,
                    since Ff=⅜ FC, and Fp = ⅜FA, we have Fp: FA=F∕: FC, therefore <hi rend="italic"
                    >f&lt;p</hi> is parallel to AC. The triangle <hi rend="italic">&lt;pfH</hi> will
                    consequently be similar to AFIC, and Hp: HC = H∕: HA <hi rend="italic">=

                    = ⅜ AH = į A∕</p>
                <p>When the pyramid has a polygonal base, it may be conceived to be formed of a
                    number of triangular pyramids, whose centres of inertia will be in one plane
                    parallel to the base. Their common centre of gravity will therefore be in the
                    same plane, and in the line drawn from the vertex to the centre of gravity of
                    all the triangles which compose the base; the distance of the centre of gravity,
                    therefore, from the vertex, will be equal to three fourths of the altitude of
                    the pyramid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 1. Hence it is obvious that the centre of gravity
                    of a right cone is a point in its axis whose distance from the vertex is equal
                    to three fourths of the length of the axis; for as this may be demonstrated of a
                    pyramid whose base is a polygon with an infinite number of sides, it must hold
                    also of a right cone, which may be considered as a pyramid of this
                    description.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 2. By proceeding as in Prop. II. Cor. 1, of this
                    chapter, it will be found, that in a triangular pyramid, the distance of any of
                    the vertices from its centre of inertia is equal to one fourth of the square
                    root of the difference of thrice the sum of the squares of the three edges which
                    meet at that vertex, and the sum of the squares of the other three edges; and
                    likewise, that the sum of the squares of the distances of the centre of inertia
                    from the vertices of any triangular pyramid, is equal to one fourth of the sum
                    of the squares of the six edges of the pyramids. A demonstration of these
                    theorems may be seen in Gregory’s <hi rend="italic">Mechanics</hi> vol. i. p.

                    particles, will be in equilibrio about their points of bisection E, R; and
                    therefore the centre of inertia of the body will lie in the axis. But if we
                    consider the body as composed of a number of small weights Dć¾rG, we shall find
                    its centre of inertia by multiplying each weight by its distance from any line
                    <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> parallel to the ordinates, and dividing the sum of all
                    these products by the sum of all the particles (Prop. II. of this chapter).
                    Thus, let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> denote the distance EB, then its fluxion <hi
                    rend="italic">χ</hi> will be. the breadth of the element or small weight D⅛zG,
                    and <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> × DG will represent the weight, and the fluent of
                    this quantity will be the sum of all the weights. Again, if we multiply the
                    weight <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> × DGby&lt;r = EB, its distance from the point B,
                    we shall have the momentum of that weight = <hi rend="italic">χ × x</hi> × DG,
                    and the fluent of this quantity will express the sum of the momenta of all the
                    weights into which the body is divided. But, by Prop. II. the distance of the
                    centre of gravity from a given point B is equal to the sum of all the momenta
                    divided by the sum of all the weights or bodies, that is, if F be the centre of

                <p>Let ACB be the circular arc, it is required to find its centre of inertia, or the

                    it is evident that the line which joins the centres of gravity of each of the
                    semiarcs AB, AC must be parallel to HG, and therefore the distance of their
                    common centre of gravity, which must be in that line, from the line HG, will be
                    equal to the distance of the centre of gravity of the semiarc from the same

                <p>From the specimens which the preceding propositions contain of the application of
                    theformulae in page 374, col. 2, the reader will find no difficulty in
                    determining the centre of inertia of other surfaces and solids, when he is
                    acquainted with the equation of the curves by which the surfaces are bounded,
                    and by whose revolution the solids are generated.</p>
                <p>A knowledge of the nature of these curves, however, is not absolutely necessary
                    for the determination of the centres of inertia of surfaces and solids. A method
                    of finding the centre of gravity, without employing the equation of the bounding
                    curves, was discovered by our countryman Mr Thomas Simson. <hi

                    make it describe the space BZ» in a second; and having drawn øG parallel to Bδ,
                    take a point G, so that <hi rend="italic">φG</hi>: Bô = B: A + B + C, and G will

                    in the same direction, it will be found somewhere in the line fy ’ at the end of
                    a second. But as the quantity of motion is equal to the product of the velocity
                    of the body multiplied by its quantity of matter, the velocities are inversely
                    as the quantities of matter, and consequently the velocity of the body at/is to
                    A’s velocity as A is to A + B⅛C, that is, as <hi rend="italic">fφ</hi> is to Aα;
                    therefore <hi rend="italic">Aa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f&lt;p</hi> are

                    and that it will be found at H after it has received the momentum that was
                    communicated to C; consequently, if it received all these momenta at the same

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 1. If the bodies of a system move uniformly in
                    right lines, their common centre of gravity will either be at rest, or move
                    uniformly in a right line. For if the momenta communicated to the bodies A, B, C
                    were communicated to a body at∕= A + B + C, it will either remain at rest or
                    move uniformly in a straight line. (See Newton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principias</hi> i. sect. iii. cor. 1.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 2. The centre of gravity of any system is not
                    affected by the mutual action of the bodies which compose it. For let B and C
                    (fig. 64) be two bodies whose common centre of gravity is F, and let the points
                    <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> κ, be taken, so that B/3: Cκ = C: B; the spaces B/3,
                    Cκ will represent the mutual action of the bodies B, C, that is, B/3 will
                    represent the action of C upon B, or the motion which is the result of that
                    action, and Cκ the action of B upon C, or the motion which results from it.
                    Then, since F is the common centre of gravity of B and C, we have (Prop. I.
                    Chap. IV.) B: C = FC: FB; but B: C = Cκ: B/3, therefore FC: FB = Cκ: B/3. But Cκ
                    is a magnitude taken from FC, and B/3 is a magnitude taken from FB, consequently
                    (Playfair’s Euclid, book v. prop. 19) the remainder κF: ∕3F = FC: FB, that is,
                    κF :/3F=B: C, that is, the point F continues to be the centre of gravity
                    notwithstanding the action of the bodies B, C. If the system is composed of
                    several bodies, the same thing may be proved of every two of the bodies, and
                    consequently of the whole system. (See D’Alembert’s <hi rend="italic"

                <p>If a body is placed upon a horizontal plane, or suspended by two threads, it
                    cannot be in equilibrio unless a perpendicular drawn from the centre of inertia
                    to the horizontal plane, or a horizontal line passing through the two threads,
                    <hi rend="subscript"> w</hi> fall within the base of the body, or upon that part
                    of the horizontal line which lies between the threads.</p>
                <p>1. Let AB CD be a body placed in the horizontal plane CD, G its centre of
                    gravity, and GE a perpendicular drawn to the horizontal line DE. Then the whole
                    matter of the body ABCD may be conceived as united in its centre of gravity G;
                    and as its tendency downwards is in the vertical line GE, it can descend only by
                    turning round the point C as a centre. Here then we have a body G placed at the
                    end of a lever GC, whose fulcrum is C, and its power to turn round C is
                    represented by the quantity of matter in G multiplied by the perpendicular CE,
                    let fall from the fulcrum upon its line of direction; and as there is no force
                    to counterbalance this, the body G, and consequently the body ABCD, will fall by
                    turning round C When the vertical line GE coincides with GC, EC vanishes and the
                    weight of the body concentrated at G has nc power to turn the lever round C, but
                    is supported upon the fulcrum C. When the vertical line GE (by some writers
                    called the <hi rend="italic">line of direction)</hi> falls within the base CD,
                    it is obvious that the weight at G has no influence in producing a motion round
                    C or D, but is employed in pressing the body upon the horizontal plane ED.</p>

                    threads. It is obvious that the centre of gravity can never change its distance
                    from the fixed points of suspension <hi rend="italic">f, &lt;ρ</hi>; if
                    therefore the body is not in equilibrio, its centre of gravity must descend
                    either towards <hi rend="italic">m</hi> or <hi rend="italic">n;</hi> let it
                    descend towards <hi rend="italic">m</hi> till it rests at Uic point <hi

                    therefore the point G cannot descend, that is, the body is in equilibrio. It may
                    be shown in the same way, that it will be in equilibrio when G is anywhere
                    between <hi rend="italic">n</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ο,</hi> that is, when the

                    <hi rend="italic">Gm</hi> vanishes, and G has no power to turn round F. The body
                    AB, therefore, cannot be in equilibrio till the perpendicular <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gi</hi> falls within∕F, which it does as soon as it arrives at <hi

                    an inclined plane, supposed without friction, it will slide down the plane when
                    the line of direction falls within its base, and will roll down when this line
                    falls without the base. This is the reason why a sphere or cylinder rolls down
                    an inclined plane; for as they touch the plane only in one point or line, the
                    point of direction must always fall without the base.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 2. The higher the centre of gravity of a body is,
                    the more easily will it be overturned. For if AB CD be the body whose centre of

                    the power with which it resists, being overturned, is diminished; that is, the

                    not be at rest unless its centre of gravity is in the direction of the thread
                    produced; for when the two threads <hi rend="italic">hf, h</hi><hi rend="italic

                    >i</hi> must in the case of an equilibrium fall upon F, and the lines Gι, GF
                    must coincide with wιF; but HF and <hi rend="italic">mF</hi> are both
                    perpendicular to the horizontal line <hi rend="italic">fţ&gt;</hi>; therefore
                    the centre of gravity G is in the direction of the thread HF.</p>

                    by any point F from the hook H, they will not be in equilibrio unless their
                    common centre of gravity G is in the vertical line FG passing through the ∣
                    point of suspension; and, in ∖ fig. 69, the bodies A, B connected by the bent
                    rod AFB, will not be in equilibrio unless their common centre of gravity G is in
                    a vertical line passing through F, the point in which the system rests upon the
                    plane CD.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scholium.</hi></p>
                <p>We have seen in the preceding proposition and corollaries, the position which
                    must be given to the centre of gravity in order to procure an equilibrium. It is
                    evident, however, that though the bodies are necessarily at rest, yet they have
                    different degrees of stability, depending on the position of the centre of
                    gravity with regard to the centre of motion. Hence bodies are said to have a
                    stable equilibrium when their centre of gravity cannot move without ascending,
                    or when the path described by their centre of gravity has its concavity
                    upwards,—a tottering equilibrium when the centre of gravity cannot move without
                    descending, or when the path which it describes has its concavity downwards,—and
                    a neutral equilibrium when the body will rest in any position. Thus, in fig. 70,
                    if the vessels A, B have their handles so placed that in the one the handle A is
                    fixed above the centre of gravity <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and in the other the
                    handle B is fixed below the centre of gravity <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> then the
                    equilibrium of A will be stable, and that of B tottering; for if A is held by
                    the handle, it will require a considerable force to make its centre of gravity
                    describe the path <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> whereas the smallest force will
                    destroy the equilibrium of B. The vessel A, too, has 1 constant tendency to
                    recover its equilibrium, and always recovers it as soon as the disturbing force
                    is removed; but the vessel B has no tendency to do this even when its
                    equi-ibrium is affected in the smallest degree. For the same reason, die
                    elliptical body A (fig. 71), when resting on the extremity of its conjugate
                    axis, has a stable equilibrium, ιut when resting on its transverse axis, as at
                    B, its equili-ιrium is tottering. The equi-ibrium of a circle or sphere s always
                    neutral; for when it is disturbed, the body has neither a tendency to fall nor
                    to resume its former situation. A flat body A, supported by a sphere B (fig.
                    72), will have its equilibrium stable when its centre of gravity is nearer the
                    point of contact than the centre of the sphere is, and the equilibrium of C will
                    be tottering when its centre of gravity is farther distant from the surface of
                    the sphere D than the centre of the sphere is.</p>

                <p>1. To find the centre of inertia mechanically.</p>
                <p>If the body whose centre of inertia is to be found can be suspended by a thread,
                    then, when the bodyis∙in equilibrio, the centre of gravity will be somewhere in
                    the line, prolonged if necessary, that is, formed by the thread upon the surface
                    of the body. Let a body be again suspended from another part of its surface, so
                    that the direction of the thread may be nearly at right angles to its former
                    direction; then, as the centre of gravity must also be in the new direction of
                    the thread prolonged, it will be in the point where these two lines intersect
                    each other.</p>
                <p>2. If the body is of such a kind that it cannot be conveniently suspended,
                    balance it upon two sharp points, and its centre of motion will be somewhere in
                    the line which joins these points. Balance it a second time upon the sharp
                    points, so that the line which joins the points maybe nearly at right angles to
                    the former line. The intersection of these two lines will be the centre of
                    inertia of the body.</p>
                <p>3. If the body is so flexible that it can neither be suspended by a thread nor
                    balanced upon points, then let a thin board be balanced upon the points as
                    before, and let the body be so placed upon this board when balanced, that the
                    equilibrium may still continue; then, having found the centre of gravity of the
                    board when loaded with the body, the centre of gravity of the body will be a
                    point on its surface exactly opposite to that centre.</p>
                <p>The preceding method, however, only gives us the centre of gravity when the body
                    has no sensible thickness; for when it is of three dimensions, the centre of
                    gravity must be somewhere between the two opposite surfaces.</p>

                    by its centre of gravity G. It is evident from Prop. III. Chap. IV. that the sum

                    the same point P. Now every particle of the surface ABCD, during its revolution
                    round the point P, will obviously describe the arch of a circle proportional to
                    the distance of that particle from the point P, which is the centre of all the
                    arches; therefore the sum of the products of all the particles multiplied by the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 1. Let us suppose the circle BACO (see fig. 62) to
                    be generated by the revolution of the line DA round the point D; then, since the
                    centre of gravity of the line DA is in its middle point G, the path of this
                    centre will be a circumference whose radius is DG, or a line equal to half the
                    circumference BONAB, therefore, by the theorem, the area of the circle BONB will
                    be equal to the radius DA multiplied by the semicircumference, which coincides
                    with the result obtained from the principles of geometry. (See Playfair’s <hi

                    means of the preceding theorem, we may readily determine the area of any

                <p>The centro-barye method, which is one of the finest inventions of geometry, was
                    first noticed by Pappus in the preface to the seventh book of his mathematical
                    collections; but it is to Father Guldinus that we are indebted for a more
                    complete discussion of the subject. He published an account of his discovery
                    partly in 1635 and partly in 1640, in his work entitled <hi rend="italic">De
                    Centro</hi><hi rend="italic">Gravitatis,</hi> lib. ii. cap. 8, prop. 3, and gave
                    an indirect demonstration of the theorem, by showing the conformity of its
                    results with those which were obtained by other means. Leibnitz demonstrated the
                    theorem in the case of superficies generated by the revolution of curves, but
                    concealed his demonstration <hi rend="italic">(Act. Leips.</hi> 1695, p. 493).
                    The theorem of Leibnitz, however, as well as that of Guldinus, was demonstrated
                    by Varignon in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1714, p. 78. Leibnitz observes
                    that the method will still hold, even if the centre round which the revolution
                    is performed be continually changed during the generating motion. For further
                    information on this subject, the reader is referred to Dr Wallis’s work <hi

                <p>To show the use of the doctrine of the centre of inertia in the explanation of
                    some mechanical phenomena.</p>
                <p>In the equilibrium and motion of animais, we perceive many phenomena deducible
                    from the properties of the centre of gravity. When we endeavour to rise from a
                    chair, we naturally draw our feet inwards, and rest upon their extremities, in
                    order to bring the centre of gravity directly below our feet, and we put the
                    body into that position in which its equilibrium is tottering, a position which
                    renders the smallest force capable of producing motion, or of overturning the
                    body. In this situation, in order to prevent ourselves from falling backwards,
                    we thrust forward the upper part of the body for the purpose of throwing the
                    centre of gravity beyond our feet; and when the equilibrium is thus destroyed,
                    we throw out one of our feet, and gradually raise the centre of gravity till the
                    position of the body is erect. When we walk, the body is thrown into the
                    position of tottering equilibrium by resting it on one foot; this equilibrium is
                    destroyed by pushing forward the centre of gravity, and the body again assumes
                    the position of tottering equilibrium by resting it on the other foot. During
                    this alternate process of creating and destroying a tottering equilibrium, the
                    one foot is placed upon the ground, and the other is raised from it; butin
                    running, which is performed in exactly the same way, both the feet are never on
                    the ground at the same time. At every step there is a short interval during
                    which the runner does not touch the ground at all.</p>
                <p>When we ascend an inclined plane the body is thrown farther forward than when we
                    walk on a horizontal one, in order that the line of direction may fall without
                    our feet; and in descending an inclined plane, the body is thrown backward, in
                    order to prevent the line of direction from falling too suddenly without the
                    base. In carrying a burden, the centre of gravity is brought nearer to the
                    burden, so that the line of direction would fall without our feet if we did not
                    naturally lean towards the side opposite to the burden, in order to keep the
                    line of direction within our feet. When the burden is therefore carried on the
                    back, we lean forward; when it is carried in the right arm, we lean towards the
                    left; when it is carried in the left arm, we lean towards the right; and when it
                    is carried before the body, we throw the head backwards.</p>
                <p>When a horse walks, he first sets out one of his fore feet and one of his hind
                    feet, suppose the right foot; then at the same instant he throws out his left
                    fore foot and his left hind foot, so as to be supported only by the two right
                    feet. His two right feet are then brought up at the same instant, and he is
                    supported only by his two left feet. When a horse pulls at a load which he can
                    scarcely overcome, he raises both his fore feet, his hind feet become the
                    fulcrum of a lever, and the weight of the horse collected in his centre of
                    gravity acts as a weight upon this lever, and enables him to surmount the
                    obstacle. (See Appendix to Ferguson’s <hi rend="italic">Lectures,</hi> vol.
                    ii.)</p>
                <p>When a rope-dancer balances himself upon the fore part of one foot, he preserves
                    his equilibrium in two ways, either by throwing one of his arms or his elevated
                    foot, or his balancing pole, to the side opposite to that towards which he is
                    beginning to fall, or by shifting the point of his foot on which he rests, to
                    the same side towards which he is apt to fall; for it amounts to the same thing
                    whether he brings the centre of gravity directly above the point of support, or
                    brings the point of support directly below the centre of gravity. For this
                    purpose the convex form of the foot is of great use; for if it had been
                    perfectly flat, the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204775"

                    variations in its position.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>We have already seen (Prop. XVI. Cor. 2) that any body is more easily overturned
                    in proportion to the height of its centre of gravity. Hence it is a matter of
                    great importance that the centre of gravity of all carriages should be placed as
                    low as possible. This may often be effected by a judicious disposition of the
                    load, of which the heaviest materials should always have the lowest place. The
                    present construction of our mail and post coaches is therefore adverse to every
                    principle of science, and the cause of many of 'those accidents in which the
                    lives of individuals have been lost. The elevated position of the guard, the
                    driver, and the outside passengers, and the two boots which contain the baggage,
                    raises the centre of gravity of the loaded vehicle to a very great height, and
                    renders it much more easily overturned than it would otherwise have been. When
                    any accident of this kind is likely to happen, the passengers should bend as low
                    as possible, and endeavour to throw themselves to the elevated side of the
                    carriage. In two-wheeled carriages, where the horse bears part of the load upon
                    its back, the elevation of the centre of gravity renders the draught more
                    difficult, by throwing a greater proportion of the load upon the horse’s back
                    when he is going down hill, and when he has the least occasion for it; and
                    taking the load from the back of the horse when he is going up hill, and
                    requires to be pressed to the ground.</p>
                <p>A knowledge of the laws of the centre of gravity enables us to explain the
                    experiment represented in fig. 74, where the vessel of water CG is suspend-, ed
                    on a rod AB, passing below its handle, and resting on the end E of the beam DE.
                    The extremity B of the rod AB is supported by another rod BF, which bears
                    against the bottom of the vessel; so that the vessel and the two rods become, as
                    it were, one body, which, by Prop. XVI. Cor. 4, will be in equilibrio when their
                    common centre of gravity C is in the same vertical line with the point of
                    support Ė.</p>
                <p>The cylinder G may be made to ascend the inclined plane ABC by putting a piece of
                    lead or any heavy substance on one side of its axis, so that the centre of
                    gravity is not at G, but at <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> Hence it is obvious that
                    the centre of gravity <hi rend="italic">g</hi> will descend, and by its descent
                    the body will rise towards A. The inclination of the plane, however, must be
                    such, that before the motion commences, the angles formed by a vertical line
                    drawn from <hi rend="italic">g</hi> with a line drawn from G perpendicularly to
                    AB, must be less than the angle of inclination ABC, or, which is the same thing,
                    when the vertical line drawn from <hi rend="italic">g</hi> does not cut the line
                    which lies between the point of contact and the centre of the cylinder. When the
                    vertical line, let fall from <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> meets the perpendicular
                    line drawn from G to the plane in the point of contact, the cylinder will be in
                    equilibrio on the inclined plane.</p>
                <p>Upon the same principle, a double scalene cone may be made to ascend an inclined
                    plane without being loaded with a weight. In fig. 76, let ABC be the section of
                    a double inclined plane, AB, BC being sections of its surfaces perpendicular to
                    the line in which the double scalene cone AD EFC moves. Then, since the centre
                    of gravity of a cone is in the line joining the vertex and the centre of its
                    base, and since the axis of a scalene cone is not perpendicular to its base, the

                    C its centre, the line which joins the centres of gravity of the two cones will
                    terminate in some point G at a distance from the centre, and therefore the
                    double cone will ascend the plane upon the same principles, and under the same

                <p>CHAP. V. ON THE MOTION OF BODIES ALONG INCLINED</p>
                <p>PLANES AND CURVES, ON THE CURVE OF SWIFTEST DESCENT, AND ON THE OSCILLATIONS OF
                    PENDULUMS.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> I.</p>
                <p>When a body moves along an inclined plane, the force which accelerates or retards
                    its motion is to the whole force of gravity as the height of the plane is to its
                    length, or as the sine of its inclination is to radius.</p>
                <p>Let ABC be the inclined plane, A the place of the body, and let AB represent the
                    whole force of gravity. The force AB is equivalent to the two forces AD, DB, or
                    AE, AD, of which AD is the force that accelerates the motion of the body down
                    the plane, while AE is destroyed by the resistance or reaction of the plane. The
                    part of the force of gravity, therefore, which makes the body arrive at C, is
                    represented by AD, while the whole force of gravity is represented by AB; but
                    the triangle ABD is equiangular to ABC, and AD: AB = AB: AC, that is, the
                    accelerating force which makes the body descend the inclined plane, is to the
                    whole force of gravity as the height of the plane is to its length, or as the
                    sine of the plane’s inclination is to radius; for when AC is radius, AB becomes
                    the sine of the angle ACB. <hi rend="superscript"> fe</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    the accelerating force, the accelerating force is also uniform; consequently the
                    laws of accelerated and retarded motions, as exhibited in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dynamics,</hi> are also true when the bodies move along
                    inclined planes. If H, therefore, represent the height AB of the plane, L its
                    length AC, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> the force of gravity, and A the accelerating
                    force, we shall have, by the proposition, L: H = <hi rend="italic">g</hi>:

                <p>H</p>

                    body begins to descend through the vertical AB at the same time that another
                    body descends along the plane AC, when the one is at any point <hi rend="italic"
                    >m,</hi> the position of the other will be <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> which is
                    determined by drawing <hi rend="italic">m n</hi> perpendicular to AC. The forces
                    by which the two bodies are actuated are as AB to AD, that is, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Am</hi> to <hi rend="italic">An;</hi> but forces are measured by
                    the spaces described in the same time; therefore the spaces described in the
                    same time are as <hi rend="italic">Am, An,</hi> that is, as the length of the
                    plane is to its height; for <hi rend="italic">Am</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">An</hi> = AC: AB; consequently, when the body that descends along
                    the vertical line AB is at <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> the other body will be at
                    <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> Through the three points A, <hi rend="italic">m,

                    angle, the centre of the semicircle will be in the line <hi rend="italic"
                    >Am</hi> (Playfair’s Euclid, book iv prop. 5); consequently, if <hi
                    rend="italic">two bodies descend from the point A at the same time, the one

                    there be drawn any number of lines making different angles with the diameter <hi
                    rend="italic">Am,</hi> and if bodies be let fall from A, so as to move along
                    these lines, they will, at the end of any given time, be found in the
                    circumferences of circles which touch one another in the point A. If the lines
                    are not in the same plane, the bodies will be in the circumferences of spheres
                    which touch each other in the point A.</p>

                    point A along any number of inclined planes AC, AF, their velocities at the

                    >v</hi> = ι∙', that is, when the velocities of the two bodies are equal, the
                    spaces described are as sin. DAB: radius, which can only happen when BC is
                    perpendicular to AB. In the same way it may be shown that the velocity at F is
                    equal <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> to the velocity at C, therefore the velocity
                    at C is equal to the velocity at F.</p>

                <p>and taking equal multiples of these two last terms, that is, multiplying them by

                    >Dynamics,</hi> as the square root of AB; and as the velocities at F, C are
                    equal to that at B, they will also be as the square root of AB.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> II.</p>
                <p>If a body descend from any point along a number of inclined planes to a
                    horizontal line, its velocity, when it reaches the horizontal line, will be
                    equal to that which it would have acquired by falling in a vertical direction
                    from the given point to the horizontal line.</p>
                <p>Let AB, BC, CD, be a number of planes differently in-dined to a horizontal line
                    DF, and let the body be let fall from the point A, so as to move along these
                    planes, without losing any of its velocity at the angular points; it will have
                    the same velocity when it reaches the horizontal plane at D, which it would have
                    acquired by falling freely from A to F. It is manifest from Prop. I. Cor. 3,
                    that the velocity of the body when at B will be the same as that of another body
                    which had fallen freely from A to <hi rend="italic">c</hi> in a vertical line.
                    The two bodies set out from B and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> with the same
                    velocity, and will therefore continue to have the same velocity when they reach
                    the points C, G, because cG = Bd. The two bodies again set off from the points
                    C, G with the same celerity, and since GF = Ce, their respective velocities will
                    be equal when they arrive at the points D, F in the horizontal plane. The
                    velocity, therefore, acquired by the falling body along the plaues AB, BC, CD is
                    equal to that which is acquired by the same body falling through the vertical
                    line AF.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 1. As the preceding proposition holds true,
                    whatever be the number of inclined planes which lie between the point A and the
                    horizontal line, it will hold true also of any curve line which may be
                    considered as made up of an infinite number of straight lines. And since the
                    small planes are diminished without limit, the radius is diminished without
                    limit, and therefore the versed sine, or the velocity lost in passing from one
                    plane to another, is diminished without limit 5<note anchored="true"

                    from friction, a body will ascend or descend a curve surface without losing any
                    of its velocity from the curvature of the surface.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 2. If a body be made to ascend a curve surface, or
                    a system of inclined planes, the vertical height to which it will rise is equal
                    to that through which it must fall in order to acquire the velocity with which
                    it ascended, abstracting from the effects of friction, and the velocity which is
                    lost in passing from one plane to another. This is obvious from <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dynamics</hi>; for the body experiences the same decrements of
                    velocity in its ascent, as it received increments in its descent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 3. The same thing will hold if the body is kept in
                    the curve by a string perpendicular to the curve; for the string sustains that
                    part of the weight which was sustained by the curve, since the re-action of the
                    curve surface is in a line perpendicular to the curve.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scholium.</hi></p>
                <p>It is obvious that the body which moves along the system of inclined planes must
                    lose a part of its velocity in passing from one plane to another. By the
                    resolution of motion it will be found that the velocity acquired by falling
                    through any of the planes, is to the velocity lost in passing to the succeeding
                    one, as radius is to the versed sine of the angle formed by the two planes. Or
                    the velocity with which the body enters upon one plane, is as the cosine of the

                    of the circle touches the other extremity A, the point D will describe a curve
                    DBA, called a cycloid.</p>
                <p>The line AD is called" the <hi rend="italic">base of tine cycloid;</hi> the line
                    CB, which bisects AD at right angles, and meets the curve in B, is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">axis,</hi> and B the <hi rend="italic">vertex.</hi></p>
                <p>The circle NOP is called the generating circle.</p>
                <p>1. The base AD is equal to the circumference of the generating circle, and AC is
                    equal to half that circumference.</p>
                <p>2. The axis CB is equal to the diameter of the generating circle.</p>
                <p>3. If from any point G of the cycloid, there be drawn a straight line GM parallel
                    to AD, and meeting the circle BLC in L, the circular arc BL is equal to the line
                    GL.</p>
                <p>4. If the points L, B be joined, and a tangent drawn to the cycloid at the point
                    G, the tangent will be parallel to the chord LB; and the tangent is found by
                    joining G, E, for GE is parallel to LB.</p>
                <p>5. The arc. BG of the cycloid is double of the chord BL, and the arc BA or BD is
                    equal to twice the axis BC.</p>
                <p>6. If the two portions AB, DB of the cycloid in fig. 82 be placed in the inverted
                    position AB, DB (fig. 80), and if a string BP, equal in length to BA, be made to
                    coincide with BA, and then be evolved from it, its extremity P will describe a
                    semicycloid AF, similar and equal to BA. In the same way the semicycloid DF
                    (fig. 80), produced by the evolution of the string BP from the semicycloid BD,
                    is equal and similar to BD and to AF. Therefore, if BP be a pendulum or weight
                    attached to the extremity of a flexible line BP, which vibrates between the
                    cycloidal cheeks BA, BD, its extremity D will describe a cycloid AFD, equal to
                    that which is composed of the two halves BA, BD.</p>
                <p>7. The chord CN is parallel to MP, and MP is perpendicular to the cycloid AFD, at
                    the point P.</p>
                <p>8. If <hi rend="italic">Ρp</hi> be an infinitely small arc, the perpendicular to
                    the curve drawn from the points P,pwill meet at Μ, and <hi rend="italic">Ρp</hi>
                    may be regarded as a circular arc whose radius is MP. Àn infinitely small
                    cycloidal arc at F may likewise be considered as a circular arc whose radius is
                    BF.</p>
                <p>As these properties of the cycloid are demonstrated in almost every treatise on
                    mechanics, and as their demonstrations more properly belong to geometry than to
                    mechanics, they are purposely omitted to make room for more important
                    matter.</p>

                    of all the other corresponding arcs of the cycloid and circle, and therefore it
                    follows that the time in which the pendulum performs one complete oscillation is
                    equal to the time in which the semicircle <hi rend="italic">poq</hi> is
                    uniformly described with the velocity acquired at F.</p>

                <p>The time in which a cycloidal pendulum performs a complete oscillation is to the
                    time in which a body would fall freely through the axis of the cycloid, as the
                    circumference of a circle is to its diameter.</p>
                <p>Since FP = 2FN (see fig. 80), and since the velocity acquired by falling down NF
                    is equal to the velocity acquired by falling down PF, the body, if it continued
                    to move uniformly with this velocity, would describe a space equal to 2PF in the
                    same time that it would descend NF or CF (Chap. V. Prop. I. Cor. 2). Calling T,
                    therefore, the time of an oscillation, and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> the time of

                <p>T = time along <hi rend="italic">poq,</hi> with the velocity at F, and by the

                    that is, they are performed in equal times, whatever be the size of the arc
                    which the pendulum describes. For the time of an oscillation has a constant
                    ratio to the time of descent along the axis, and is therefore an invariable ⅛
                    quantity.</p>

                    small circular arc will also be to the time of descent along the axis, as the

                    of the axis CF, the time of an oscillation in a cycloid or small circular arc
                    varies as the time of descending alon&lt;* CF, half the length of the pendulum,
                    the force of gravity being constant. But the time of descent along CF varies as
                    √CF, therefore the time of an oscillation in a small circular or cycloidal arc
                    varies as the square root of half the length of the pendulum, or as the square
                    root of its whole length. If T. <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> therefore, be the

                    going from the poles to the equator, the time of an oscillation is directly as
                    the square root of the length of the pendulum, and inversely as the square root
                    of the force of gravity. The time of an oscillation varies as the time of
                    descent along half the length of the pendulum, and the time of descent through
                    any space varies as where</p>

                <p>Since, by Proposition VIII., the time of an oscillation is to the time along half

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 1. When a body moving with a certain velocity
                    strikes another body, either at rest or in motion, the one is said to impinge
                    against, or to impel, the other. This effect has been distinguished by the names
                    collision or impulse, percussion, and impact.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 2. The collision or impact of two bodies is said
                    to be <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> when the bodies move in the same straight
                    line, or when the point in which they strike each other is in the straight line
                    which joins their centres of gravity. When this is not the case, the impulse is
                    said to be oblique.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 3. A <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> body is one which
                    is not susceptible of compression by any finite force. An <hi rend="italic"
                    >elastic</hi> body is one susceptible of compression, which recovers its figure
                    with a force equal to that which compresses it. A <hi rend="italic">soft</hi>
                    body is one which does not recover its form after compression. There does not
                    exist in nature any body which is either perfectly hard, perfectly elastic, or
                    perfectly soft. Every body with which we are acquainted possesses elasticity in
                    some degree or other. Diamond, crystal, agate, &amp;c. though among the hardest
                    bodies, are highly elastic; and even clay itself will in some degree recover its
                    figure after compression. It is necessary, however, to consider bodies as hard,
                    soft, or elastic, in order to obtain the limits between which the required
                    results must be contained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 4. The mass of *a body is the sum of the material
                    particles of which it is composed; and the <hi rend="italic">momentum,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">moving force,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">quantity of
                    motion,</hi> of any body, is the product arising from multiplying its mass by
                    its velocity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> I.</p>
                <p>Two hard bodies B, B' with velocities V, V' striking each other perpendicularly,
                    will be at rest after impact, if their velocities are inversely as their
                    masses.</p>
                <p>1. When the two bodies are equal, their velocities must be equal in the case of
                    an equilibrium after impulse, and therefore B: B'=V': V, or BV=B'V'; for if they
                    are not at rest after impact, the one must carry the other along with it. But as
                    their masses and velocities are equal, there can be no reason why the one should
                    carry the other along with it.</p>
                <p>2. If the one body is double of the other, or B=2B', we should have V'=2V'. Now,
                    instead of B we may substitute two bodies equal to B', and instead of V' we may
                    substitute two velocities equal to V, with which the bodies B' may be conceived
                    to move; consequently we have 2B' × V=B'× 2V, or B': 2B'=V: 2V; but 2V is the
                    velocity of B', and V is the velocity of 2B', therefore, when one body is double
                    of the other, they will remain at rest when the masses of the bodies are
                    inversely as their velocities.</p>
                <p>In the same way the proposition may be demonstrated when the bodies are to one
                    another in any commensurable proportion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> II.</p>
                <p>To find the common velocity <hi rend="italic">v</hi> of two hard bodies B, B'
                    whose velocities are V, V',“after striking each other perpendicularly.</p>
                <p>If the bodies have not equal quantities of motion they cannot be in equilibrio
                    after impulse. The one will carry the other along with it, and, in consequence
                    of their hardness, they will remain in contact, and move with a common velocity
                    <hi rend="italic">v.</hi></p>
                <p>1. In order to find this, let us first suppose B' to be at rest and to be struck
                    by B in motion. The quantity of motion which exists in B before impulse is BV,
                    and as this is divided between the two bodies after impulse, it must <hi
                    rend="underline">be equ</hi> al to the quantity of motion after impulse. But <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> × B + B' is the quantity of motion after impulse, there
                    fore <hi rend="italic">v</hi> × B + B'=BV, and <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi></p>
                <p>2. Let us now suppose that both the bodies are in motion in the same direction
                    that B follows B'. In order that B may impel B', we must have V greater than V'.
                    Now, we may conceive both the bodies placed upon a plane moving with the
                    velocity V'. The body B', therefore, whose velocity is V' equal to that of the
                    plane, will be at rest upon the plane, while the velocity of B with regard to B'
                    or the plane, will be V — V'; consequently, the bodies are in the same
                    circumstances as if B' were at rest, and B moving with the velocity V—V'.
                    Therefore, by the last case, we have the common velocity of the bodies in
                    the</p>

                    an</hi> d by adding to this V', the velocity of the plane, we shall have <hi

                    equal to the sum of the quantities of motion before impact.</p>
                <p>3. If the impinging bodies mutually approach each other, we may conceive, as
                    before, that the body B' is at rest upon a plane which moves with a velocity V'

                <p>To determine the velocities of two elastic bodies after impact.</p>
                <p>If an elastic body strikes a hard and immoveable plane, it will, at the instant
                    of collision, be compressed at the place of contact. But as the elastic body
                    instantaneously endeavours to recover its figure, and as this force of
                    restitution is equal and opposite to the force of compression, t will move
                    backwards from the plane in the same direc- ;ion in which it advanced. If two
                    elastic bodies, with &gt;qual momenta, impinge against each other, the effect of
                    heir mutual compression is to destroy their relative velocity, and make them
                    move with a common velocity, as in he case of hard bodies. But by the force of
                    restitution, equal to that of compression, the bodies begin to recover heir
                    figure, the parts in contact serve mutually as points ∣f support, and the bodies
                    recede from each other. Now, ∣∣efore the force of restitution began to exert
                    itself, the odies had a tendency to move in one direction with a ommon momentum;
                    therefore the body, whose effort to recover its figure was in the same direction
                    with that of he common momentum, will move on in that direction, 'ith a momentum
                    or moving force equal to the sum of the orce of restitution and the common
                    momentum; while ae other body, whose effort to recover from compression in a
                    direction opposite to that of the common momen-ιm, will move with a momentum
                    equal to the difference etween its force of restitution and the common momen-ιm,
                    and in the direction of the greatest of these momenta, fter impact, therefore,
                    it either moves in the direction )posite to that of the common momentum, or its
                    motion the same direction as that of the common momentum diminished, or it is
                    stopped altogether, according as the rce of restitution is greater, less, or
                    equal to the com- ∣on momentum.</p>
                <p>I In order to apply these preliminary observations, let us !opt the notation in
                    the two preceding propositions, and t <hi rend="italic">V</hi> be the common
                    velocity which the bodies would have ceived after impact if they had been hard,
                    and <hi rend="italic">v',</hi> √'the locities which the elastic bodies B, B'
                    receive after im∙ .ct∙</p>
                <p>1. If B follows B', then V is greater than V', and when has reached B', they are
                    both compressed at the point impact. Hence, since <hi rend="italic">v</hi> is
                    the common velocity with uch they would advance if the force of restitution
                    were: t exerted, we have V — <hi rend="italic">v</hi> = the velocity lost by B,
                    and ľ—V' = the velocity gained by B', in consequence of impression. But when the
                    bodies strive to recover their f in by the force of restitution, the body B will
                    move l ckwards in consequence of this force, while B'will move &lt; ward in its
                    former direction with an accelerated velocity.</p>
                <p>Hence, from the force of restitution, B will again lose the velocity V — <hi
                    rend="italic">v,</hi> and B' will, a second time, gain the velocity <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> — V'; consequently the whole velocity lost by B' is 2V —
                    <hi rend="italic">2v,</hi> and the whole velocity gained by B' is <hi
                    rend="italic">2v</hi> — 2V'. Now, subtracting <hi rend="underline">this
                    loss</hi> from the original velocity of B, we have V — 2V — <hi rend="italic"
                    >2v</hi> for the velocity of B after impact, and adding the velocity gained by B
                    to its original velocity, we have V' + <hi rend="italic">2v</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> 2V' for the velocity of B' after impact; hence we have <hi
                    rend="italic">v'</hi> = V — 2V — <hi rend="italic">2v = 2v</hi> — V, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> z</hi>," _ V' + <hi rend="italic">2v</hi> — 2V' = <hi
                    rend="italic">2v</hi> — V.</p>
                <p>Now, substituting in these equations the value of <hi rend="italic">v</hi> as
                    found in Case 2, Prop. II., we obtain</p>
                <p>, BV — B'V + 2B'V'</p>
                <p>B + B'</p>

                <p>B + B'</p>
                <p>2. When the bodies move in opposite directions, or mu tually approach each other,
                    the body B is in precisely the same circumstances as in the preceding case; but
                    the body B' loses a part of its velocity equal to <hi rend="italic">2v</hi> +
                    2V'—V'. Hence we have, by the same reasoning that was employed in the preceding
                    case, <hi rend="italic">v' = 2v</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >N',</hi><hi rend="italic">vT</hi><hi rend="italic">= 2v</hi> + V'; and by
                    substituting instead of <hi rend="italic">v</hi> its value, as determined in
                    Case 3, Prop. II., or by merely changing the sign of V' in the two last
                    equations in the preceding corollary, we obtain the two following equations,
                    which will answer for both cases, by using the upper sign when the bodies move
                    in the same direction, and the under sign when they move in opposite
                    directions:</p>

                <p>B + B'</p>
                <p>From the preceding equation the following corollaries may be deduced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 1. The velocity gained by the body that is struck,
                    and the velocity lost by the impinging body, are twice as great in elastic as
                    they are in hard bodies; for in hard bodies the velocities gained and lost were
                    <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> V', and V — <hi rend="italic"
                    >v;</hi> whereas in elastic bodies the velocities gained and lost were <hi

                <p>VB —VB' „ 2VB</p>
                <p>B + B' ’ B + B’</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 3. If one of the bodies B' is at rest, and their
                    masses equal, we have B = B' and V' = 0, by substituting which in the preceding
                    formulae, we obtain <hi rend="italic">v'</hi> = 0, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >vl'</hi> = V; that is, the impinging body B remains at rest after impact, and
                    the body B' that is struck when at rest moves on with the velocity of the body B
                    that struck it, so that there is a complete transfer of B’s velocity to B'.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 4. If B' is at rest and B greater than B', both
                    the bodies will move forward in the direction of B’s motion; for it is obvious
                    from the equations in Cor. 2, that when B is greater than B', <hi rend="italic"

                    move forward in the direction in which B moved before the stroke. For it is
                    evident that when B is less than B', <hi rend="italic">vf</hi> is negative and

                    />velocity than it had before it. This is obvious from the formula in Case 1 of

                    B' will move on with B’s velocity. For in the formulae in Case 1, when B = B, we
                    have <hi rend="italic">v'</hi> ±= V' and <hi rend="italic">v" = V.</hi><hi

                    both the bodies will recoil or move backwards after impact with the same
                    velocities which they had before impact. For in the formulae in Case 2, with the
                    inferior signs, when B = B' and V = V', we have <hi rend="italic">v'</hi> = — V

                <p>B + B B + B'</p>
                <p>Hence it is obvious, that if B = 3B', or if one of the impinging bodies is thrice
                    as great as the other, the greatest will be stopped, and the smallest will
                    recoil with a velocity double of that which it had before impact. For since B =
                    3B', by substituting this value of B in the preceding equations, we obtain √ =
                    0, and <hi rend="italic">d'</hi> = 2V.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 10. If the impinging bodies move in opposite
                    directions, and if B=B', they will both recoil after a mutual exchange of
                    velocities. For when B = B', we have <hi rend="italic">v'—</hi> —V', and
                    t&gt;"=V.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 11. When the bodies move in opposite directions,
                    the body which is struck, and the body which strikes it, will stop, continue
                    their motion, or return backwards, according as BV — B'V is equal to or greater
                    or less than 2B'V'.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 12. The relative velocity of the bodies after
                    impact is equal to their relative velocity before impact, or, which is the same
                    thing, at equal instants before and after impact, the distance of the bodies
                    from each other is the same. For in the different cases we have <hi

                    similar to that which was employed in Prop. 2, Cor. 3, it may be shown that B +

                    CM, MD, or MD, FD; CM, DF being a parallelogram. But the part of the velocity

                    therefore the body will, after impact, move along the plane with the velocity

                    the plane. The other part of the velocity FD is destroyed by compression; but
                    the force of restitution or elasticity will generate a velocity equal to FD, but
                    in the opposite direction DF. Consequently the impinging body after impact is

                <p>To determine the motions of two spherical bodies which impinge obliquely upon

                    perpendicular to IK, and it will touch the bodies at the point of impact. Now,
                    the velocity CA may be resolved into the two velocities CI, IA, and the velocity

                    which are parallel to the plane, will not be altered by collision, therefore IA,
                    KB are the velocities with which the bodies directly impinge upon each other,

                    = AF, and from the line LM, by the velocity AN, it will describe AO, the
                    diagonal of the parallelogram NF; and for the same reason the body B will

                <p>In the preceding proposition, we have endeavoured to give a short and perspicuous
                    view of the common theory of impulsion. The limits of this article will not
                    permit us to enter upon those interesting speculations to which this subject has
                    given rise. Itjnaybe proper however to remark, that all the phenomena of
                    impulse, as well as pressure, are owing to the existence of forces which prevent
                    the particles of matter from coming into mathematical contact. The body which is
                    struck, in the case of collision, is put in motion by the mutual repulsion of
                    the material particles at the point of impact, while the velocity of the
                    impinging body is diminished by the same cause. Hence we see the absurdity of
                    referring all motion to impulse, or of attempting to account for the phenomena
                    of gravitation, electricity, and magnetism, by the intervention of any invisible
                    fluid. Even if the supposition that such a medium exists were not gratuitous, it
                    would be impossible to show that its particles, by means of which the impulse is
                    conveyed, are in contact with the particles of the body to which that impulse is
                    communicated.</p>
                <p>A physicomathematical theory of percussion, in which the impinging bodies are
                    considered as imperfectly elastic, has been lately given by Don Georges Juan, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Examen</hi><hi rend="italic">Maritimo,</hi> a Spanish work
                    which has been translated with additions by Μ. l’Eveque, under the title of <hi

                    la manoeuvre des vaisseaux, et autres batimens.</hi> This theory has been
                    embraced by many eminent French philosophers, and may be seen in Prony’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Architecture</hi><hi rend="italic">Hydraulique,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    208; and in Gregory’s <hi rend="italic">Mechanics,</hi> vol. i. p. 291.</p>
                <p>In some cases of collision the results of experiments are rather at variance with
                    those of theory, in consequence of the communication of motion not being exactly
                    instantaneous. “If an ivory ball (says Mr Leslie) strikes against another of
                    equal weight, there should, according to the common theory, be an exact transfer
                    of motion. But if the velocity of the impinging ball be very considerable, so
                    far from stopping suddenly, it will recoil back again with the same force, while
                    the ball which is struck will remain at rest; the reason is, that the shock is
                    so momentary as not to permit the communication of impulse to the whole mass of
                    the second ball; a small spot only is affected, and the consequence is therefore
                    the same as if the ball had impinged against an immoveable wall. On a perfect
                    acquaintance with such facts depends, in a great measure, the skill of the
                    billiard player. It is on a similar principle that a bullet fired against a door
                    which hangfe freely on its hinges will perforate without agitating it in the
                    least.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When a bullet is
                    fired through a sheet of paper hung loosely, the paper scarcely receives a
                    perceptible motion from the momentum of the bullet. Professor Whewell has given
                    the following excellent illustration of this experiment: “The reason,” says
                    Professor Whewell, “is, that the bullet acts upon the paper only during the very
                    short time which it employs in passing through it. If the bullet have a velocity
                    of 1000 feet a second, and the paper be one thousandth of an inch in thickness,
                    the time of the action is only τo⅛π °f ⅛ °f τ0⅛0 °f <hi rend="superscript">
                    a</hi> second, or 10n⅛005 °f <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> second. If we
                    suppose that the bullet shot into a solid mass of paper would have lost all its
                    velocity by penetrating one foot, this penetration would have occupied the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi> of a second; and hence,
                    in the τδδποοσπ °i <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> second, it would, in the same
                    substance, lose only the <hi rend="subscript"> 5τ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript">
                    os</hi> °f R <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> momentum, or the momentum
                    corresponding to a velocity of half an inch a second; and the paper would gain
                    the amount of momentum which the bullet thus loses. If the paper be one
                    twenty-fourth of the weight of the bullet, the paper will acquire a velocity of
                    a foot a second; and therefore in <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi>, of a second,
                    which is a portion of time quite perceptible, it would only move through one
                    inch. And as the resistance of the air upon a sheet of paper is very
                    considerable, the whole velocity would be destroyed almost before the motion
                    could be observed.”</p></note></p>

                <p>Nay, a pellet of clay, a bit of tallow, or even a small bag of water, discharged
                    from a pistol, will produce the same effect. In all these instances the
                    impression of the stroke is confined to a single spot, and no sufficient time is
                    allowed for diffusing its action over the extent of the door. If a large stone
                    be thrown with equal momentum, and consequently with smaller velocity, the
                    effect will be totally reversed, the door will turn on its hinges, and yet
                    scarcely a dent will be made on its surface. Hence likewise the theory of most

                    the saw, the file, the scythe, the hedge-bill, &amp;c. In the process of
                    cutting, the object is to concentrate the force in a very narrow space, and this
                    is effected by giving the instrument a rapid motion. Hence, too, the reason why
                    only a small hammer is used in riveting, and why a mallet is preferred for
                    driving wedges.” <hi rend="italic">(^Inquiry into the Nature of Heat,</hi> p.

                <p>The successive propagation of motion may be illustrated by a very simple
                    experiment. Take two balls A, B, of which B is very large when compared with A,
                    and connect them by a string S passing over the pulley P. If the ball B is
                    lifted up towards S and allowed to fall by its own weight, instead of bringing
                    the little ball A along with it, as might have been expected, the string will
                    break at P. Here it is evident that the motion is not propagated
                    instantaneously, for the string is broken before the motion is communicated to
                    the portion of the string between P and A.</p>
                <p>q An apparatus for making experiments on }the collision of bodies is represented
                    in fig. ⅛9. The impinging bodies are suspended by threads like pendulums, and as
                    the velocities acquired by descending through the arches of circles are in the
                    ratio of their chords, the ve rities of the impinging bodies may be easily
                    ascertained. Tie apparatus is therefore furnished with a graduated arch IN,
                    which is gradually divided into equal parts, though it ould be more convenient
                    to place the divisions at the ex-: ’ emities of arcs whose chords are expressed
                    by the corre-ιonding numbers. The balls that are not used may be laced behind

                    may be of different zes. Sometimes a dish like G is attached to the extremities
                    of the strings, for the purpose of holding argillaceis balls, and balls of wax
                    softened with a quantity of oil ∏ιal to one fourth part of their weight. (See

                <p>CHAP. VII.—ON THE MAXIMUM EFFECT OF MACHINES.</p>
                <p>We have already seen in some of the preceding chapters, at when two bodies act
                    upon each other by the intervention either of a simple or compound machine,
                    there is an equilibrium when the velocity of the power is to the velocity of the
                    weight as the weight is to the power. In this position of equilibrium,
                    therefore, the velocity of the weight is nothing, and the power has no effect in
                    raising the weight,—or, in other words, the machine performs no work. When the
                    weight to be raised is infinitely small, the velocity is the greatest possible;
                    but in this case likewise the machine performs no work. In every other case,
                    however, between these two extremes, some work will be performed. In order to
                    illustrate this more clearly, let us suppose a man employed in raising a weight
                    by means of a lever with equal arms; and that he exerts a force upon the
                    extremity of the lever equivalent to 50 pounds. If the weight to be raised is
                    also 50 pounds, there will be an equilibrium between the force of the man and
                    the weight to be raised, the machine will remain at rest, and no work will be
                    performed. If the man exert an additional force of one pound, or if his whole
                    force is 51 pounds, the equilibrium will be destroyed, the weight will rise with
                    a very slow motion, and the machine will therefore perform some work. When the
                    motion of the machine therefore is = 0, the work performed is also nothing; and
                    when the machine is in such a state that the power preponderates, the work
                    performed increases. Let us now suppose that the weight suspended from the lever
                    is infinitely small, the motion of the machine will then be the greatest
                    possible; but no work will be performed. If the weight, however, is increased,
                    the motion of the machine will be diminished, and work will be performed. Here
                    then it is evident that the work performed increases from nothing when the
                    velocity is a maximum, and decreases to nothing when the velocity is a minimum.
                    There must therefore be a particular velocity when the work performed is a <hi
                    rend="italic">maximum,</hi> and this particular velocity it is our present
                    object to determine. Sometimes, indeed, the velocities of the machine are
                    determined by its structure, and therefore it is out of the power of the
                    mechanic to obtain a maximum effect by properly proportioning them. The same
                    object, however, may be obtained by making the work to be performed, or the
                    resistance to be overcome, in a certain proportion to the power which is
                    employed to perform the work or overcome the resistance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 1. In a machine performing work, the powers
                    employed to begin and continue the motion of the machine are called the <hi
                    rend="italic">first movers,</hi> or the moving powers, and those powers which
                    oppose the production and continuance of motion are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >resistances.</hi> The friction of the machine, the inertia of its parts, and
                    the work to be performed, all oppose the production and continuance of motion,
                    and are therefore the resistances to be overcome. When various powers act at the
                    same time, and in different directions, the equivalent force which results from
                    their combined action is called the <hi rend="italic">moving force,</hi> and the
                    force resulting from all the resisting forces, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >resistance.</hi> If <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204918"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-4918-0392"/>the machine, for example, is a lever AB moving
                    round the centre F, by means of which, two men raise water out of two pump
                    barrels by the chains Aw, <hi rend="italic">Cw</hi> attached to the pistons, and
                    passing over the arched heads or circular sectors Μ, N, for the purpose of
                    giving the pistons and chains a vertical motion. Let the force of the man at B,
                    six feet from F, be equal to 50 pounds, or τ, his mechanical energy tojturn the
                    lever is 6 × 50 = 300. Let the force of the other man applied at E, four feet
                    from F, be also equal to 50 pounds, or <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> His mechanical
                    energy will be 4 × 50 = 200, so that the whole moving power is equal to 300 +
                    200 = 500. But if the two forces of 50 pounds, instead of being applied at two
                    different distances from F, had been applied at the same point G, five feet from
                    F, their energy to turn the lever would have been the same; for 5 × 50 + 50 =
                    500. In the present case, therefore, the <hi rend="italic">moving force</hi> is
                    equivalent to P × GF, or a force of 100 pounds acting at a distance of five feet
                    from the centre of motion. Now let us suppose that each piston Aw, Cw; raises 60
                    pounds of water, equivalent to the weights w, <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> and that
                    CF = 2 feet, and AF = 3 feet, then the mechanical energy of these weights will
                    be respectively 2 × 60 = 120, and 3 × 60 = 180, and the sum of their energies =
                    300. But two forces of 60 pounds each, acting at the distances two feet and
                    three feet from F, are equivalent to their sum =120 pounds acting at a distance
                    of two feet and a half from F, for 2∣ × 120 — 300; therefore the resistance
                    arising from the work to be performed, or from the water raised in the pump
                    barrels, is equal to a weight P of 120 pounds acting at the distance DF=2∣ feet.
                    But in addition to the resistance arising from the work to be performed, the two
                    men have to overcome the resistance arising from the friction of the piston in
                    the barrels, which we may suppose equivalent to/ļ <hi rend="italic">&lt;ρ,</hi>
                    each equal to 10 pounds, acting at the points A, C; but these forces are
                    equivalent to 20 pounds, or <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> f+ <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ</hi> acting at D, therefore the resistance arising from the work and from
                    friction is equal to 140 pounds acting at the distance DF = 2 feet and a half.
                    While the two men are employed in overcoming these resistances, they have also
                    to contend against the inertia of the beam AF, and that of the chains and
                    pistons, which we may suppose equal to 20 pounds when collected in their centre
                    of gravity <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> whose distance from F is 2∙2 feet; but a
                    weight of 20 pounds acting at the distance of 2∙2 is equivalent to a weight of
                    19⅛ pounds acting at the distance of 2∙5 feet, or DF, consequently the sum of
                    all the resistances, when reduced to the same point D of the lever, is equal to
                    159∣ pounds acting at the distance of 2*5 feet from F. The mechanical energy,
                    therefore, of the sum of all the resistances will be = 2∙5 × 159į = 398∙75,
                    while the energy of the moving force, or the sum of all the moving powers, is
                    equal to 500.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 2. The <hi rend="italic">impelled point</hi> of a
                    machine is that point to which the moving power is applied if there is only one
                    power, or that point to which all the moving powers are reduced, or at which the
                    moving force is supposed to act. The <hi rend="italic">working point</hi> of a
                    machine is that point at which the resistance acts if it is single, or that
                    point to which all the resistances are reduced, and at which they are supposed
                    to act when combined. Thus, in fig. 90, G is the impelled point of the machine,
                    and D the working point. Had a single force <hi rend="italic">it</hi> been
                    applied at the point B to raise a single weight w, acting at the point A, then B
                    would have been the impelled point and A the working point of the machine. In
                    the wheel and axle, the point of the wheel at which the rope touches its
                    circumference is the impelled point, while the working point is that point in
                    the circumference of the axle where the rope which carries the weight is in
                    contact with it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 3. The velocity of the moving power, and the
                    velocity of the resistance, are respectively the same as the velocity of the
                    impelled point and the velocity of the working point.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 4. The <hi rend="italic">effect</hi> of a machine,
                    or the <hi rend="italic">work performed,</hi> is equal to the resistance
                    multiplied by the velocity of the working point; for when any machine raises
                    amass of matter to a given height in a certain time, the effect produced is
                    measured by the product of the mass and the height through which it rises, that
                    is, by the product of the mass by the velocity with which it moves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 5. The <hi rend="italic">momentum of impulse</hi>
                    is equal to the moving force’ multiplied by the velocity of the impelled
                    point.</p>
                <p>In any machine that has a motion of rotation, let a: be the velocity of the
                    impelled point, and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> the velocity of the working point.
                    When the machine is a lever, <hi rend="italic">x,</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    will express the perpendiculars let fall from the centre of motion upon the line
                    of direction in which the forces act; and if the machine is a wheel and axle,
                    <hi rend="italic">x,</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi> will represent the diameters
                    of the wheel and the axle respectively. In compound machines, which may be
                    regarded as composed of levers (Chap. II. Sect. I.), <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    will represent the sum of all the levers by which the power acts, and <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> the sum of all the levers by which the resistance acts.</p>
                <p>Let P be the real pressure which the moving power exerts at the impelled point of
                    the machine, and R the actual pressure which the mere resistance of the work to
                    be performed exerts at the working point, or which it directly opposes to the
                    exertion of the power. Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the inertia of the power
                    P, or the mass of matter which the power P must move with the velocity of the
                    impelled point in order that P may exert its pressure at the impelled point; and
                    let <hi rend="italic">b</hi> be the inertia of the resistance R, or the mass of
                    matter which must be moved with the velocity of the working point in the
                    performance of the work.</p>
                <p>Since the resistance arising from the friction of the communicating parts is an
                    uniformly retarding force, it may be measured by a weight ç&gt; acting at the
                    working point of the machine, which will oppose the same resistance to the
                    moving power as the friction of the parts.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be the inertia of the machine, or rather that
                    quantity of matter which, acting at the working point of the machine, will
                    require the same part of the moving force to give it an angular motion; then,
                    since <hi rend="italic">y</hi> represents the arm of the lever by which the
                    resistance acts, or the distance of the working point from the centre of motion;
                    and since the momentum of inertia, or the momentum with which any mass revolving
                    round a centre resists being put in motion, is equal to its quantity of matter
                    multi- ’ plied by the square of its distance from its centre of motion (see
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Rotation),</hi> we have <hi rend="italic">my'~</hi>
                    for the momentum of inertia of the machine. It is obvious that every machine
                    opposes a certain resistance to any force that endeavours to give it an angular
                    motion, and that this resistance will increase with the inertia of its parts. It
                    is easy, therefore, to find a quantity of matter which, when placed at any part
                    of the machine, will oppose the same resistance to an angular motion as the
                    combined inertia of the various parts of the machine. This is the quantity of
                    matter which we have called <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and which we have supposed
                    to act. at the working point, because to that point all the other resistances
                    have been reduced. Collecting the symbols, therefore, we have <hi rend="italic"
                    >X</hi> = the velocity of the impelled point, or the ra dius of the wheel, or
                    the length of the lever by which the power acts.</p>

                    >y</hi> for almost every species of machinery; so that the mechanic may easily
                    determine the velocities which must be given to the impelled and working points
                    of the machine in order to produce a maximum effect.</p>
                <p>When the machine, however, is already constructed, the velocities of the impelled
                    and working points cannot be changed without altering the structure of the
                    machine; and therefore we must find the ratio between the power and resistance,
                    which will enable us to obtain a maximum effect. The method of determining this
                    will be shown in the following proposition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> II.</p>
                <p>To determine the ratio between the power and the resistance of a machine when its
                    performance is a maximum.</p>
                <p>Since the structure of the machine is given, the values of ae, <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> are known, and therefore we have to determine the relative values of P
                    and R when the effect of the machine is a maximum. This would be easily done by
                    making R variable in the formula which expresses the performance of the machine,
                    and making its fluxion equal to 0, if none of the other quantities varied along
                    with R. It often happens, however, that while R varies, the mass <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> suffers a considerable change, though in other cases the
                    change induced upon <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is too unimportant to merit notice.
                    This proposition, therefore, admits of two cases; 1. when the change upon <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> is so small that it may be safely omitted in the
                    investigation; and, 2. when the change upon <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is
                    sufficiently great to require attention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Case</hi> 1. When R is the only quantity which is variable,

                <p>Now, according to the experiments of Coulomb, the friction is, in general,
                    proportional to the resisting pressure, or a certain part of that pressure, for
                    example, -X-R; and calling Z = - <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛-, and omitting

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Case</hi> 2. When <hi rend="italic">b</hi> varies at the

                    therefore may be represented by any multiple of R, as &lt;ZR&gt; where <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> may be either an integer or a fraction. In order to
                    simplify the investigation, we may consider the fraction p as a resistance
                    diminishing the impelling power, instead of regarding it as a resistance to be
                    added to the other resisting forces. Thus the impelling power P will become P —

                    viii. This subject has been treated with great ability by Dr Robison, though he
                    has omitted the various steps in the investigation which conduettothe leading
                    formulae. The subject has been also ably discussed by Sir John Leslie, in a
                    paper published in the first edition of the appendix to Ferguson’s Lectures,
                    vol. ii. p. 353; and as the results of his investigations may be of great use in
                    practice, we shall here present the reader with a short abstract of them.</p>

                    resistance is very great compared with the power, the velocity should at least
                    be double of that which would procure an equilibrium, in order that the machine
                    may produce a maximum effect.</p>

                    the maximum be procured, the force which impels the weight can never amount to
                    one fourth part of the direct action of the power; and that, in ma-added<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194204957" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4957-0395"/> to that of the
                    sphere itself; that is, any sphere <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is in equilibrio
                    from the result of two forces, one of which is produced by the weights of <hi
                    rend="italic">c, d, c</hi> acting at the lower point of <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> while the other force arises from the weight of <hi rend="italic"
                    >bcde</hi> acting at its upper point. The equilibrium of this chain of spheres
                    is evidently of the stable kind, as it will immediately recover its position
                    when the equilibrium is disturbed. Let us now suppose this arch inverted, so as
                    to stand in avertical plane, as in fig. 95. It will still preserve its
                    equilibrium. For the relative positions of the lines which mark the directions
                    remain unchanged by inverting the curve, the force of gravity continues the
                    same, and therefore the result of these forces will be the same, and the arch
                    wilI be in equilibrio. The equilibrium, however, which the arch now possesses is
                    of the tottering kind, so that the least disturbing force will destroy it, and
                    it will consequently be unable to support any other weight but its own.Let us
                    now suppose that it is required to form an equilibrated arch, whose span is AB,
                    whose altitude is DÄ, and which will support the materials of a roadway, whose
                    form TUV is given. It is obvious, that if the spheres <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,
                    d,</hi> &amp;c. increase in density from <hi rend="italic">h</hi> towards <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> the catenarian curve will grow less concave at its vertex
                    e, and more concave toward its extremities A,B. Let us then suppose that the
                    densities of the spheres <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, d, e,</hi> &amp;c. are
                    respectively as <hi rend="italic">am, bn, co, dp, cq,</hi> &amp;c. the vertical
                    distances of their respective centres from the roadway TUV, the arch will have a
                    form different from that which it would have assumed if the spheres were of
                    equal density, and will be in equilibrio when inverted as in fig. 95. Now, in
                    place of the spheres <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, d, e,</hi> &amp;c. of different
                    densities, let us substitute spheres of the same density, and having the same
                    position as those of different densities; let us then load the sphere <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> with a weight which, when combined with the weight of <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> will be equal to the weight of the corresponding sphere
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> that had a greater density; and let us load the other
                    spheres <hi rend="italic">b, c, d,</hi> &amp;c. with weights proportional to <hi
                    rend="italic">bn, co, dp,</hi> &amp;c. Then it is obvious that the pressure of
                    each sphere when thus loaded upon that which is contiguous to it, is precisely
                    equal to the pressure of the spheres of different densities upon each other,
                    because the density of these spheres varied as their distances from the roadway.
                    But the arch composed of spheres of different densities was in equilibrio when
                    inverted, therefore, since the loaded spheres of the same density have the same
                    position and exert the same pressures, the arch composed of these spheres, and
                    supporting TUVBΛA, composed of homogeneous materials, will be in equilibrio. <hi
                    rend="italic">Hence a roadway of a given form, and composed of homogeneous
                    materials, will be supported by an arch, whose form is that of a catenary, each

                    roadway</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or, which is the same thing, <hi

                    from the surface of the roadway.</hi> Hence we have the following practical
                    method of ascertaining the form of an equilibrated arch, whose span is AB, and
                    altitude D∕q and which is to support a roadway of the form T'U ’ V ’. Let a

                    employed as double of what is barely able to maintain the equilibrium.</p>
                <p>CHAP. VIII.—ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF ARCHES, PIERS, AND ABUTMENTS.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 1. An arch is represented in fig. 92 by the
                    assemblage of stones <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">cd, er,</hi>
                    &amp;c. forming the mass ABMN, whose inferior surface is the portion of a curve.
                    The parts A, B are called the <hi rend="italic">spring of the arch,</hi> the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> 2. A cate- ∣arian curve is the urve formed by ny
                    line or cord erfectly flexible, nd suspended by its xtremities. Thus ’ the chain
                    ACB e suspended by its xtre∏ιities A, B, it ill, by the action ’gravity upon all
                    its parts, assume the form ACB, which called the catenary, or catenarian
                    curve.</p>
                <p>There are three modes of determining the construction 'arches; the first of which
                    is to consider the arch as an verted catenary; the second is to establish an
                    equilibri-m between the vertical pressures of all the materials be- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> cen the intrados and extrados; and the third is to
                    re- :ird the different arch-stones as portions of wedges withit friction, which
                    endeavour by their,own weight to force cir way through the arch. The first of
                    these methods is given by the ingenious Dr Hook, and is contained in e following
                    proposition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> I.</p>
                <p>í&gt; determine the form of an arch by considering it as an I inverted catenary,
                    when its span, its altitude, and the form of the roadway or extrados, are
                    given.</p>
                <p>Let«, <hi rend="italic">b,c,d,</hi> &amp;c.be a number of spheres or beads
                    connect- &lt;∣ by a string, and impended by their cx- 1 .mities A, B; they V1
                    form a catenarian owe AoZ∣cB, and be i&lt;3quilibrio by the actin of gravity.
                    Each sιere is acted upon ⅛ two forces; at its Wer point by the Wight of the
                    spheres immediately below it, ad at its upper point by the weight of the same
                    spheres <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204970" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4970-0396"/>the
                    arch. Divide AB into any number of equal parts, suppose eight, and let the
                    vertical lines <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">m, 2n,</hi> 3o, drawn
                    from these points, intersect the . catenary in the points α, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b, c.</hi></p>
                <p>From the points <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, k, r, s, t,</hi> suspend pieces of
                    chain of uniform density, and form them of such a length, that when the whole is
                    in equilibrio, the extremities of the chains may lie in the line T'U' V', fig.
                    95; then the form which the catenary AÅB now assumes will be the form of an
                    equilibrated arch, which, when inverted like AKB, will support the roadway TUV,
                    similar to T'U'V', fig. 95. This is obvious from the last paragraph, for the
                    pieces of chain <hi rend="italic">am, bn, co, hU,</hi> &amp;c. are forces acting
                    upon the points <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, k</hi> of the catenary, and are
                    proportional to <hi rend="italic">am, bn, co,</hi> &amp;c. the distances of the
                    points <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, k,</hi> &amp;c. from the roadway.</p>
                <p>An arch of this construction will evidently answer for a bridge, in which the
                    weight of the materials between the roadway and the arch-stones is to the weight
                    of the arch-stones as the weight of all the pieces of chain suspended from <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> &amp;c. is to the weight of the chain AÄB. As the
                    ratio, however, of the weight of the archstones to the weight of the
                    superincumbent materials is not known, we may assume a convenient thickness for
                    the arch-stones; and if from this assumed thickness their weight be computed,
                    and be found to have the required ratio to the weight of the incumbent mass, the
                    curve already found will be a proper form for the arch. But ii the ratio is
                    different from that of the weight of the whole chain to the weight of the
                    suspended chains, it may be easily computed how much must be added to or
                    subtracted from the pieces of chain, in order to make the ratios equal. The new
                    curve which the catenary then assumes, in consequence of the change upon the
                    length of the suspended chains, will be the form of an equilibrated arch, the
                    weight of whose arch-stones is equal to that which we assumed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scholium.</hi></p>
                <p>In most cases the catenarian curve thus determined will approach very near to a
                    circular arc equal to 120 degrees, which springs from the piers so as to form an
                    angle of 60 degrees with the horizon. The form of the arch, however, as
                    determined in the preceding proposition, is suited only to those cases in which
                    the superincumbent materials exert a vertical pressure. A quantity of loose
                    earth and gravel exerts a pressure in almost every direction, and therefore
                    tends to destroy the equilibrium of a catenarian arch. This tendency, however,
                    may be removed by giving the arch a greater curvature towards the piers. This
                    will make it approach to the form of an ellipsis, and make it spring more
                    vertically from the piers or abutments.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed to deduce the form of an arch and its roadway, by
                    establishing an equilibrium among the weights of all the materials between the
                    arch and the roadway. This method was given by Emerson in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fluxions,</hi> published in 1742; and afterwards by Dr Hutton in his excellent
                    work <hi rend="italic">On Bridges.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> II.</p>
                <p>To determine the form of the roadway or extrados, when the form of the arch or
                    intrados is given.</p>
                <p>Let the lines AD, DE, EB, BF, FG, GH lie in the same plane, and let them be
                    placed perpendicular to the horizon. From the points D, E, B, &amp;c. draw the
                    vertical lines D√, Ee, BZ&gt;, &amp;c. and taking Dp of any length, make Er
                    equal to Dp, &amp;c. and complete the parallelograms pc, <hi rend="italic"
                    >τq.</hi> Again, make Bs = <hi rend="italic">qe,</hi> and complete the
                    parallelogram <hi rend="italic">ts</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in like manner,
                    make F7e = <hi rend="italic">sb,</hi> and complete the parallelogram <hi
                    rend="italic">Ff</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> and so on with all the
                    other lines, making the side of each parallelogram equal to that side of the
                    preceding parallelogram which is parallel to it. Let us now suppose that the
                    lines CD, DE, EB, &amp;c. can move round the angular points D, E, B, F, &amp;c.
                    the extremities A, C being immoveable; and that forces proportional to D&lt;7,
                    Ee, Bó, &amp;c. are exerted upon the points D, E, B, F, &amp;c. and in the
                    direction D⅛ Ee, &amp;c. Now, by the resolution of forces, the force Dd may be
                    resolved into the forces De, Dp, the force Ee into the forces E&lt;∕, Er, and
                    the force B6 into the forces <hi rend="smallcaps">Bí,</hi> Bt, and so on with
                    the rest. The force De produces no other effect than to press the point A on the
                    plane on which it rests, and is therefore destroyed by the resistance of that
                    plane; but the remaining force Dp tends to bring the point D towards Ľ, and to
                    enlarge the angle ADE; this force, however, is destroyed by the equal and
                    opposite force <hi rend="italic">Eq,</hi> and in the same way the forces Er, Bí,
                    Fae are destroyed by the equal and opposite forces Bí, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >F/í,</hi> Gø, while the remaining force <hi rend="italic">Gw</hi> is destroyed
                    by the resistance of the plane which supports the point C. When the lines AD,
                    DE, &amp;c. therefore, are acted upon by vertical forces proportional to D√, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ee, Bb, &amp;c.</hi> these forces are all destroyed by equal and
                    opposite ones, and the lines will remain in equilibrio.</p>
                <p>Now the force De: Dp or <hi rend="italic">Eq</hi> = sin. <hi rend="italic"

                    A from the extrados or roadway, is infinite. The curve VUcT, therefore, will run
                    up to an infinite height, approaching continually to a vertical line drawn from
                    A, which will be its asymptote. Such a form of the extrados, however, is
                    inadmissible in practice; and therefore a semicircular arch is not an arch of
                    equilibration. When the arch is less than a semicircle, as PBR, the curve
                    terminates in the point <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and as
                    it does not rise very much above a horizontal line passing through U when the
                    arch is small, we might produce a perfect equilibrium by making the horizontal,
                    as <hi rend="italic">tUv,</hi> and making the density of the superincumbent
                    columns <hi rend="italic">Pn, Eo,</hi> which press upon the points P, E

                    these points from the curvilineal roadway The inconvenience, however, arising
                    from the inflexion of the extrados, may be considerably removed by throwing the
                    point of contrary flexure to a greater distance, which may be done by
                    diminishing BU, the thickness of the incumbent mass above the keystone. Thus, if
                    BU is diminished to <hi rend="italic">Bd,</hi> and if points <hi rend="italic"
                    >a, b</hi> are taken in the lines <hi rend="italic">Pp,</hi> Ec, so that <hi

                    the arch, and if a new roadway <hi rend="italic">vdbat</hi> be drawn through
                    these points, the equilibrium <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the arch will still
                    continue, for the various pressures which it sustained, though they are
                    diminished, preserve the same proportion.Let us suppose it necessary to have the
                    extrados a horizontal line, and let it be required to find BU=zzz when there is
                    an equilibrium. In this case the point H coincides with U; or rather, when the

                    their sines will be equal. Therefore, by making these substitutions in the last

                    is much flatter, the point of contrary flexure in the extrados is thrown at a
                    greater distance, and therefore it will, with less inconvenience, admit of a
                    horizontal roadway. Elliptical arches have also the advantage of being more
                    elegant, and likewise require less labour and materials.The cycloidal arch is
                    likewise superior to a circular one, but inferior to those which are elliptical.
                    Parabolic, hyperbolic, and catenarian arches may be employed when the bridge has
                    only one arch, and is to rise high; butin other cases they are inadmissible. The
                    method of determining the roadway for all these forms of arches will be found in
                    Dr Hutton’s excellent work <hi rend="italic">On the Principles ο; Bridges,</hi>

                    work <hi rend="italic">On Fluxions,</hi> published in 1742.When the form of the
                    roadway is given, the shape of the intrados for an arch of equilibration may be
                    determined. As the investigation is very difficult, unless when the roadway is a
                    horizontal line, we shall merely give the formula, which will enable any person
                    to construct tire curve. In all other curves the equilibrium of the arch is
                    imperfect; but the curve described by the following formula is an arch of
                    perfect equilibration, and has been called <hi rend="italic">the mechanical

                <p>The construction of arches has also been deduced from considering the arch-stones
                    as frustums of polished wedges without friction, which endeavour to force their
                    way through the arch. This principle has been adopted by Belidor, Parent,
                    Bossut, Prony, and other French philosophers, and likewise by our ingenious
                    countryman the late Mr Atwood. This theory, however, is more plausible than
                    useful. So far from the arch-stones having liberty to slide <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205009" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5009-0399"/>between those which are
                    contiguous to them, without friction, they are bound together by the strongest
                    cement, and sometimes connected by iron pins or wedges. The theory likewise
                    requires that the weight of the arch must regularly increase as the portion of
                    the vertical tangent cut off by lines drawn from a given point in a direction
                    parallel to that of the joints, and therefore either the density or the
                    magnitude of the arch-stones must be very great at the spring of the arch, where
                    the portion of the vertical tangent is a maximum. Those who wish to be
                    acquainted with the mode of investigation by which the equilibrium of arches is
                    established in this theory, may consult Prony’s <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Construction of Piers and Abutments.</hi></p>
                <p>∖ In the construction of piers and abutments, there are wo circumstances which
                    claim our attention. 1. The Strength that must be given to them in order to
                    resist the lateral thrust which they sustain from the adjacent semi- ∣rches, and
                    which tend either to overset them or make hem slide upon their base. 2. The form
                    which must be çiven to their extremities, so that the force of the current ιay
                    be a minimum. The adhesion of the pier to the place n which it rests is always
                    much greater than one third of ιe pressure; and as the lateral thrust of the
                    arch which us adhesion resists is oblique to the horizon, and may e resolved
                    into two forces, one of which is horizontal, nd the other vertical, we have the
                    vertical portion of the teral thrust, the weight of the pier, and the friction
                    on s base, combined in resisting the horizontal portion of ιe lateral thrust
                    which tends to make the pier slide upon s base, so that there is no danger of
                    the pier yielding to ich a pressure. We do not here consider, that the la- :ral
                    thrust which tends to give a horizontal motion to the er is completely
                    counteracted by the lateral thrust of ιeopposite semiarch, because it is
                    necessary that the pier wukl have sufficient stability to resist the lateral
                    thrust ‘one semiarch, in case of the failure of the opposite one. 2t us
                    therefore consider the strength of the pier which ill prevent it from being
                    overset.</p>
                <p>For this purpose, let ABC, fig. 100, be an arch, MHTO e pier, and BUHA the loaded
                    semiarch, whôse pressure nds to overturn the pier. Let G be the centre of
                    gravity of e mass BUHA. Join GA, and from G draw GK perpen- &lt;cular to AC,
                    fig. 1Q0. Then, since the whole pressure of e arch is exerted at its spring A,
                    and since this pressure</p>
                <p>İ the same as if the whole weight of the arch were collect-I into the point G, GA
                    will be the direction in which the ’ light of the arch and the superincumbent
                    mass acts upon ı.e point A. Now, by <hi rend="smallcaps">Dynamics,</hi> the
                    force GA may be Solved into the two forces GK, KA, one of which, KA, tdeavours
                    to give the pier a motion of rotation about the jint 0, while the other, GK,
                    denotes the weight of the hided arch in the direction GK. Putting W, therefore,
                    li∙ the weight or area of the superincumbent mass, we II <hi rend="italic"
                    >nV</hi> rr <hi rend="subscript"> A</hi>, <hi rend="subscript"> ιr</hi> W × KA
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> live GK: KA = W: — , the pressure upon A.</p>
                <p>ľ&gt;w, as this force tends to turn the pier round 0 by titans of the lever OA,
                    and as ON = AM is the perpen- (5ιular from the centre of motion upon the line of
                    di-W × KA</p>
                <p>ration, we have AM × ———— for the force which (jrK</p>
                <p>tļlids to overturn the pier. Now, the force which is op-ped to this is the weight
                    of the pier MHTO collected in its centre of gravity <hi rend="italic">g,</hi>
                    which acts by the vertical Uer <hi rend="italic">Om</hi> = ⅜ OM, because <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> is in the centre of the rect- 4gle TM. But the weight or
                    area of the pier may be Presented by OM × MH; therefore the force which rcists
                    the lateral thrust of the loaded arch is OM × MH &gt;⅛∣OM, or ⅜MH × OM. Now, in
                    the case of an equi librium between these opposing forces, we have AM W × KA <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>× GK — jMH × OM <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, which, by reduction, becomes
                    OM=√^ <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> ×^ΚΔ, This formula gives us the breadth of
                    the pier which is capable of balancing the lateral thrust, and therefore OM must
                    be taken a little greater than the preceding value. In practice, OM is generally
                    between one fifth and one seventh of AC, the span of the arch. The method of
                    finding the centre of gravity G of the loaded arch, whether the arch is in
                    perfect equilibrium or not, may be seen in Dr Hutton’s work already quoted, p.
                    49. A very simple method of doing this is to form the part BUHA of a piece of
                    card, and to find its centre of gravity G by the rules already given. This
                    indeed supposes all the materials to be homogeneous; but if they are of various
                    kinds, we can load the arch made of card in a similar manner, and determine its
                    centre of gravity as before.</p>
                <p>The limits of this article will not permit us to apply the method of fluxions to
                    the determination of the form which should be given to the ends of the pier, in
                    order that the impulse of the current may be the least possible. The theory of
                    the resistance of fluids, indeed, differs so widely from experiment, that such
                    an investigation would, in this place, be of little practical utility. It may be
                    sufficient merely to remark, that the pier should have an angular form, and that
                    the impulse of the current will be diminished as the angle is more acute. When
                    the ends are semicircular, the impulse of the stream is reduced to one half; and
                    though a triangular termination of the piers reduces the impulse still more, yet
                    semieircular ends are more pleasing to the eye, and are particularly
                    advantageous when small vessels have occasion to pass the arch. When such
                    vessels happen to impinge against the piers, the semicircular ends are more able
                    to bear the shock, and do less injury to the vessel, while the additional
                    quantity of masonry will give greater stability to the pier.</p>

                    axis of the cylinder. The force which produces these oscillations <hi

                    and the angle measured by the arch ON is called the <hi rend="italic">angle of

                    angle of torsion after the time <hi rend="italic">t.</hi></p>
                <p>Since the force of torsion is supposed to be proportional to the angle of
                    torsion, the momentum of the force of torsion must be some multiple of that
                    angle, or <hi rend="italic">η</hi> × A Μ, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> being a

                    of the metallic wire. If, therefore, we call <hi rend="italic">v</hi> the
                    velocity of any point <hi rend="italic">d</hi> at the end of the time Z, when

                <p>Therefore, since the time in which the cylinder oscillates must be equal to the

                <p>In the preceding investigation we have supposed, what is conformable to

                    oscillatory motion of the cylinder, we shall proceed to give an account of the
                    results of his experiments.</p>
                <p>In these experiments M. Coulomb employed the torsion balance represented in fig.
                    101, in which he suspended cylinders of different weights from iron and brass
                    wires of different lengths and thicknesses; and, by observing carefully the
                    duration of a certain number of oscillations, he was enabled to determine, by
                    means of the preceding formulae, the laws of the force of torsion relative to
                    the length, the thickness, and the nature of the wires employed. If the
                    elasticity of the metallic wires had been perfect, and if the air opposed no
                    resistance to the oscillating cylinder, it would continue to oscillate till its
                    motion was stopped. The diminution of the amplitudes of the oscillations,
                    therefore, being produced solely by the imperfection of elasticity, and by the
                    resistance of the air, Μ. Coulomb was enabled, by observing the successive
                    diminution of the amplitude of the oscillation, and by subtracting the part of
                    the change which was due to the resistance of the air, to ascertain, with the
                    assistance of the preceding ſormulae, according to what laws this elastic force
                    of torsion was changed.</p>

                <p>following table. The angles of torsion were always so small that the particles of
                    the twisted wires returned to their original state. This was not the case,
                    however, at angles greater than those in the table.</p>
                <p>As the twenty oscillations of the cylinder were in these experiments sensibly
                    isochronous, Coulomb considered the supposition on which the preceding formulae
                    are founded, as a fundamental law, <hi rend="italic">that in all metallic
                    wires,</hi> when the <hi rend="italic">angles of torsion are not very great, the
                    force of torsion is sensibly proportional to the angle of torsion</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and hence the formulae may be safely used in the discussion
                    of the experiments.</p>
                <p>It appears from the first and second, third and fourth, seventh and eighth, and
                    ninth and tenth experiments, that when the suspended weight was <hi
                    rend="italic">two</hi> pounds, the oscillations were performed in the times</p>
                <p>242", 85", 442", and 110",while with weights of half a pound the times were120'',
                    43", 220", and 57", which are nearly one half of the former. But 1:2= <hi
                    rend="subscript"> v</hi> A⅛: 4/2. Consequently <hi rend="italic">the durations
                    of the oscillations are proportional to the square roots of the suspended
                    cylinders.</hi> Hence it appears that the different degrees of tension produced
                    by the different weights used in these experiments has no sensible influence on
                    the re-action of the force of torsion.</p>
                <p>If we vary the lengths of the wires without changing their diameters, or the
                    suspending weights, as in experiments ninth and tenth, where the lengths are as
                    9 to 36, or 1:4, and the times 110" and 222", or as 1: 2, it follows that <hi
                    rend="italic">the times of the same number of oscillations arc as th</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> e</hi><hi rend="italic">square roots of the lengths of
                    the wires,</hi> as the theory indicates.</p>
                <p>When the diameters of the wires are varied without changing their lengths, or the
                    weight of the cylinders, the momentum of the force of torsion varies <hi
                    rend="italic">as the fourth power of the diameters of the wires.</hi> Now this
                    result is perfectly conformable to theory; for if we suppose two wires of the
                    same substance and of the same length, but having their diameters as one to two,
                    it is obvious, that in the wire whose diameter is double that of the other,
                    there are four times as many parts extended by torsion as in the smaller wire,
                    and that the mean extension of all these parts will be proportional to the
                    diameter of a wire, the same as the mean arm of a lever is relative to the axis
                    of rotation. Hence it appears that, according to theory, the force of torsion of
                    two wires of the same nature and of the same length, but of different diameters,
                    is proportional to the fourth power of their diameter.</p>
                <p>From this it follows in general, that in metallic wires the <hi rend="italic"
                    >momentum of torsion is directly in the compound ratio of the angle oftorsionand
                    the fourth power of their diameter, and inversely as the length of the
                    wires.</hi> If <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> therefore, be the angle of torsion, λ
                    the length of the thread, ð its diameter, and F the force of torsion, we shall
                    have p __ <hi rend="italic">maδ</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">,~ ~Γ~</hi> ’ where <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is a constant
                    co-efficient for wires of the samemetal, depending on the tenacity of the metal,
                    and dedu-cible from experiment.</p>
                <p>When the angle of torsion is not great relative to the length of the wire, the
                    index of the cylinder returns to the position which it had before the torsion
                    took place, or, in other words, the wire untwists itself by the same quantity by
                    which it had been twisted. But when the angle of torsion is very great, the wire
                    does not completely untwist itself, and therefore the centre of torsion will
                    have advanced by a quantity equal to that which it has not untwisted. If the
                    angle of torsion, for example, is 180°, and if after the oscillations have
                    ceased the index returns only 170° in place of I80°, the centre of torsion is
                    said to have advanced 10°, or to be displaced by that quantity.</p>
                <p>In his experiments on this subject, Μ. Coulomb used the iron wire No. 1, 6⅜
                    inches long, and supporting a weight of two pounds. The following were his

                <p>When the wire was twisted through a greater angle than 90°, the centre of torsion
                    suffered a displacement which increased with the angle of torsion, as shown in
                    the following table :—</p>
                <p>In this table the first column contains the angle through which the index has
                    been turned, the second shows the angle through which the wire has untwisted
                    itself. The differences between the first column and the second constitute the
                    third column, which shows the angle which the wire wanted of returning to its
                    primitive state, or the displacement of the centre of torsion at each successive
                    experiment. The fourth column shows the total displacement of the centre of
                    torsion, and is obtained by adding any one displacement in column 3 to all that
                    precede it.</p>
                <p>From these experiments it appears that for angles of torsion below 45°, the
                    decrements of the amplitudes of the oscillations were nearly proportional to the
                    amplitudes of the angles of torsion, and that when the angles exceeded 45°, the
                    decrements increased in a much greater ratio. From the results in the second
                    table, it appears that the centre of torsion did not begin to advance or be
                    displaced till the angle of torsion was nearly 180°; that this displacement
                    increases in proportion as the thread is twisted; that it is irregular till the
                    angle of torsion is310°; and that for greater angles the re-action of torsion
                    remained nearly die same for all angles of torsion.</p>
                <p>From these and other experiments, which our limits will not permit us to give,
                    Coulomb has deduced the following theory of elasticity and cohesion in
                    metals.</p>
                <p>In all metallic wires the forces necessary for compressing or dilating the
                    integrant particles are proportional to the compressions or the dilatations they
                    experience, or their elasticity is perfect. Cohesion, however, which is
                    different from elasticity, unites these particles together. In small torsions,
                    when the twisting force is less than that of cohesion, the integrant particles
                    are elongated or compressed without any change of place in the points by which
                    they adhere. But when the torsions are so great that the force of compression or
                    dilatation is equal to the cohesion of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205061"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5061-0403"/>particles, these particles ought to separate, or
                    slide upon one another. This sliding of the particles takes place in all ,
                    ductile bodies; but if by this cause the body is compressed, the extent of the
                    points of contact and the extent of the field of elasticity become greater. As
                    the particles have a given figure, the extent of the points of contact cannot
                    augment but to a certain degree, at which the body breaks.</p>
                <p>In confirmation of this theory, Coulomb made the following experiment, in which
                    he varied the cohesion without changing the elasticity. A copper wire which
                    broke with 22 lbs. was brought to the temper of a white heat, which reduced its
                    cohesion so much that it could scarcely support 12 or 14 lbs. The two wires,
                    however, when twisted through the same angle by the same weight, performed the
                    same number of oscillations in the same time, though the cohesion was only half
                    as great in the one wire as in the other, and the amplitude of elasticity
                    diminished in the same proportion.</p>
                <p>Coulomb confirmed these views by some ingenious experiments on the flexion of
                    steel plates in different states with respect to cohesion, and he extends his
                    views of ‘the ^constitution of metals to all bodies whatever. Their integrant
                    particles have always a perfect elasticity; but bodies are hard, soft, or fluid,
                    according to the cohesion of these particles. If they can slide upon one
                    another, as in hard bodies, without any sensible change of distance, the 3θdy
                    will be ductile or malleable; but if they cannot thus &gt;lide without their
                    distance being sensibly altered, the body will break when the compressing or
                    dilating force is equal ;o the cohesion.</p>
                <p>The resistance of solid bodies had never undergone that ρareful investigation
                    which its importance demanded. Mr L Bevan, however, has supplied in a great
                    measure this lefect, by a very complete series of frequently-repeated

                <p>In exemplifying the application of the first formula, Mr Bevan takes a square
                    shaft of English oak fifty inches long and six inches by six inches, subject to
                    a strain of 3000 lbs. at the circumference of a wheel two feet in diameter, or
                    having a leverage of twelve inches; then <hi rend="italic">r</hi> =12, Z= 50,

                    = 6, and T = 20000; then we shall have D = 0∙83, or about jtths of an inch. If
                    the weight or force <hi rend="italic">w</hi> were 300 lbs., then, as the
                    deflection is directly as the force, the deflection will be - <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> ⅛th of an inch.</p>
                <p>Mr Bevan observed, in a great many of his experiments, that the modulus of
                    torsion bears a close relation to the weight of the wood when dry, whatever be
                    the kind of wood employed; and he has given the following formula for
                    determining the deflection D from the specific gravity D = <hi

                <p>By comparing the numbers in the preceding table with the modulus of elasticity of
                    the same metals, Mr Bevan has found that the modulus of torsion is <hi
                    rend="italic">one sixteenth</hi> of the modulus of elasticity in metals.</p>
                <p>The theory of torsion is particularly useful in delicate researches, where small
                    forces are to be ascertained with a precision which cannot be obtained by
                    ordinary means. It has been successfully employed by Coulomb in discovering the
                    laws of the forces of electricity and magnetism, and in determining the
                    resistance of fluids when the velocities are very small. Its application to
                    these purposes will be found in our articles on <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>PART II.—ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF MACHINERY.</p>
                <p>We have already stated, when considering the maximum effects of machines, the
                    various causes which affect their performance. It appeared from that
                    investigation, that there must be a certain relation between the velocities of
                    the impelled and working points of a machine, or between the power and the
                    resistance to be overcome, before it can produce a maximum effect, and therefore
                    it must be the first object of the engineer to ascertain that velocity, and to
                    employ it in the construction of his machine. The performance of the machine is
                    also influenced by the friction and inertia of its various parts; and as both
                    these act as resistances, and therefore destroy a considerable portion of the
                    impelling power, it becomes an object of great importance to attend to the
                    simplification of the machinery, and to ascertain the nature of friction, so as
                    to diminish its effect, either by the application of unguents or by mechanical
                    contrivances. Since the impelled and working points of a machine are generally
                    connected by means of toothed wheels, the teeth must be formed in such a manner
                    that the wheels may always act upon each other with the same force, otherwise
                    the velocity of the machine will be variable, and its structure soon injured by
                    the irregularity of its motion. The irregular motion of machines sometimes
                    arises from the nature of the machinery, from an inequality in the resistance to
                    be overcome, and from the nature of the impelling power. In large machines, the
                    momenta of their parts are generally sufficient to equalize these
                    irregularities; but in machines of a small size, and in those where the
                    irregularities are considerable, we must employ fly-wheels for regulating and
                    rendering uniform their variable movements. These various subjects, and others
                    intimately connected with them, we shall now proceed to discuss in their
                    order.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I.—ON THE PROPORTION BETWEEN THE VELOCITY OF THE IMPELLED AND WORKING
                    POINTS OF MACHINES, AND BEŢWEEN THE POWER AND RESISTANCE, IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY
                    PERFORM THE GREATEST WORK.</p>
                <p>In the chapter on the maximum effect of machines we have deduced formulae
                    containing <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> the velocities
                    of the impelled and working points of the machines, and including every
                    circumstance which can affect their motion. The formula which exhibits the value
                    of y, or the velocity of the working point, assumes various forms, according as
                    we neglect one or more of the elements of which it is composed. When the work to
                    be performed resists only by its inertia, which is the case in urging round a
                    millstone or heavy fly, the quantity R may be neglected, and the second formula
                    (page 393, col. 2) should be employed. In small machines, and particularly in
                    those where the motion is conveyed by wheels with epicycloidal teeth, the
                    friction is very trifling, and the element ø may be safely omitted. In corn and
                    saw mills, the quantity <hi rend="italic">h</hi> or the inertia of the
                    resistance, may be left out of the formula, as the motion communicated to the
                    flour or to the saw-dust is too small to be subjected to computation. It
                    machines where one heavy body is employed to raise another merely by its weight,
                    the inertia of the power and the resistance, viz. <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi>
                    are proportional to P, R, the powers and resistances themselves, and
                    consequently P, R may be substituted in the formula in the place of <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b.</hi> The engineer therefore must consider, before he
                    construct his machine, what elements should enter into the formula, and what
                    should be omitted, in order that he may adapt it to the circumstances of the
                    case, and obtain from his machine the greatest possible effect.</p>
                <p>When the inertia of the power and that of the resistance are proportional to the
                    power and resistance themselves, and when the inertia and friction of the
                    machine may be omitted, the formula becomes <hi rend="italic">y —</hi> + 1| — 1;
                    from which the following table is computed, which contains the values of <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> for different values of P; R being supposed = 10, and <hi

                <p>In order to explain the use of this table, let us suppose liât it is required to
                    raise one cubic foot of water in a .econd, by means of a stream which discharges
                    three cufic feet of water in a second; and let it be required to ind the
                    construction of a wheel and axle for performing his work; that is, the diameter
                    of the axle, that of the vheel being 6. Here the power is evidently three cubic
                    eet, while the resistance is only one cubic foot, therefore ’ = 3 R; but in the
                    preceding table R = 10, consequently ’ = 3 X 10 = 30. But it appears from the
                    table that when ’= 30, <hi rend="italic">y</hi> or the diameter of the axle is
                    1, upon the sup-ιosition that the diameter <hi rend="italic">x of</hi> the wheel
                    is 1; but as <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> nust be = 6, we shall have <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> = 6.</p>
                <p>Instead of using the preceding table, we might find the best proportion between
                    <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> by a kind of tentative <hi
                    rend="italic">c ıc</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="superscript">
                    x</hi> Ry — R <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> y <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>...</p>
                <p>process, trom the formula — <hi rend="subscript"> p</hi> y <hi rend="italic"
                    >-</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> p</hi><hi rend="italic">-f~,</hi> which
                    exprès-</p>
                <p>ses the work performed. This method is indeed tedious; and we mention it only for
                    the sake of showing the conformity of the results, and of proving that there is
                    a certain proportion between <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> which gives a maximum effect. Let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = 6, as in
                    the preceding paragraph, and let us suppose <hi rend="italic">y</hi> to be
                    successively 5, 6, and 7, in order to see which of these values is the best.
                    Since P = 3, R = 1, and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = 6, we have,</p>

                    it is required find the resistance R, or the quantity of water which ust be put

                    velocities of the im- 41ed and working points, are equal; and since <hi

                    rend="italic">y</hi> = 1, which cor-sponds in the table with 0∙4142, the value
                    of R, P beg = 1 in the table: but in the present case P ≈ 10, therefore 10: 1 =
                    0∙4142: 4∙142, the value of R when P = 10.</p>
                <p>The same result might be obtained in a more circuitous method by means of the

                <p>CHAP. II. ON THE SIMPLIFICATI0 N OF MACHINERY.</p>
                <p>As the inertia of every machine adds greatly to the resistance to be overcome,
                    and as the friction of the communicating parts is proportional to the pressure,
                    it becomes a matter of great practical importance, that the different parts of a
                    machine should be proportioned to the strains to which they are exposed. If the
                    beam of a steam-engine, for example, is larger than what is necessary, an
                    immense portion of the impelling power must be destroyed at every stroke of the
                    piston, by dragging the superfluous mass from a state of rest into motion; the
                    pressure upon the gudgeons will also be increased, and their friction in their
                    sockets proportionally enlarged. The engineer, therefore, should be well
                    acquainted with the strength of the materials of which the machine is to be
                    constructed, and should frame its different parts in such a manner that they may
                    not be heavier than what is necessary for resisting the forces with which they
                    are urged. When the motions of the machine are necessarily irregular, and when
                    the machine may be exposed to accidental strains, the parts must be made
                    considerably stronger than what is necessary for resisting its ordinary strains;
                    but it is not often that such a precaution should be observed* The gudgeons of
                    water-wheels, and of the beams of steam-engines, ought to be made as short and
                    small as possible, as the friction increases with the rubbing surfaces. This is
                    very seldom attended to in the construction of waterwheels. The diameter of the
                    gudgeons is frequently thrice as large as what is necessary for supporting the
                    weight of the wheel.</p>
                <p>In the construction of machinery we must not only attend to the simplification of
                    the parts, but also to the number of these parts, and the mode of connecting
                    them. From the nature and quantity of the work to be performed, it is easy to
                    ascertain the velocity of the working point which is most proper for performing
                    it. Now this velocity may be procured in a variety of ways, either by a
                    perplexing multiplicity of wheels, or by more simple combinations. The choice of
                    these combinations must be left solely to the judgment of the engineer, as no
                    general rules can be laid down to direct him. It may be useful, however, to
                    remark, that the power should always be applied as near as possible to the
                    working point of the machine, and that when one wheel drives another, the
                    diameter of the one should never be great when the diameter of the other is very
                    small. The size of wheels is often determined from the strains to which they are
                    exposed. If, for example, we are obliged to give a certain velocity to an axle
                    by means of a wheel with 120 teeth, and if the force with which this wheel is
                    urged requires the teeth to be at least one inch thick in order to prevent them
                    from breaking, we shall be obliged to make its diameter at least seven feet; for
                    supposing the spaces between the teeth to be equal to the thickness of the
                    teeth, the circumference of the wheel must at least be equal to 120 + 120= 240
                    inches, the sum of the teeth and their intervals, which gives a diameter of six
                    feet eight inches. There are some cases where our choice of combination must be
                    directed by the nature of the machinery. If the work to be performed is a load
                    raised with a certain velocity by means of a rope winding round a hollow drum,
                    and if the simplest combination of mechanical powers for producing this velocity
                    should give a small diameter to the drum, then this combination must give way to
                    another which corresponds with a larger size of the drum; for, on account of the
                    inflexibility of the ropes, a great portion of the impelling power would be
                    wasted in winding them about the circumference of a small drum.</p>
                <p>The advantages of simplifying machinery are well exemplified in the folibwing
                    capstan, which unites great strehgth and simplicity. Itisrepre-sented in fig.
                    103, where AD is a compound barrel composed of two cylinders of different
                    radii.</p>
                <p>The rope DEC is fixed at the extremity of the cylinder D; and after passing over
                    the pulley E, which is attached to the load by means of the hook F, it is coiled
                    round the cylinder D, and fixed at its upper end. The capstan bar AB urges the
                    compound barrel CD about its axis, so that while the rope coils round the
                    cylinder D it unwinds itself from the cylinder C. Let us suppose that the
                    diameter of the part D of the barrel is 21 inches, while the diameter of the
                    part C is only 20 inches, and let the pulley E be 20 inches in diameter. When
                    the barrel AD, therefore, has performed one complete revolution by the pressure
                    exerted at B, 63 inches of rope, equal to the circumference of the cylinder,
                    will be gathered upon the cylinder D, and 60 inches will be unwinded from the
                    cylinder C. The quantity of wound rope, therefore, exceeds the quantity that is
                    unwound by 63 — 60 = 3 inches, the difference of their respective perimeters;
                    and the half this quantity, or 1∣ inch, will be the space through which the load
                    or pulley E moves by one turn of the bar. If a simple capstan of the same
                    dimensions had been employed, the length of rope coiled round the barrel would
                    have been 60 inches; and the space described by the pulley, or load to be
                    overcome, would have been 30 inches. Now, as the power is to the weight as the
                    velocity of the weight is to the velocity of the power, and as the velocity of
                    the power is the same in both capstans, the weights which they will raise will
                    be as 1∣ to 30. lf it is wished to double the power of the machine, we have only
                    to cover the cylinder C with lathes a quarter of an inch thick, so that the
                    difference between the radii of each cylinder may be half as little as before;
                    for it is obvious that the power of the capstan increases as the difference
                    between the radii of the cylinders is diminished. As we increase the power,
                    therefore, we increase the strength of our machine, while all other engines are
                    proportionally enfeebled by an augmentation of power. Were we, for example, to
                    increase the power of the common capstan, we must diminish the barrel in the
                    same proportion, supposing the bar AB not to admit of being lengthened, which
                    will not only diminish its strength, but destroy much of its power by the
                    additional flexure of the rope. This capstan may be easily converted into a
                    crane by giving the compound barrel a horizontal position, and substituting a
                    winch instead of the bar AB. The superiority of such a crane <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205113" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5113-0407"/>above the common ones does
                    not require to be pointed out; but it has this additional advantage, that it
                    allows the weight to stop at any part of its progress, without the aid of a
                    ratchet-wheel and catch, because the two parts of the rope pull on the contrary
                    sides of the barrel. The rope indeed which coils round the larger part of the
                    barrel acts with a larger lever, and consequently with greater force, than the
                    other; but as this excess of force is not sufficient to overcome the friction of
                    the machine, the weight will remain stationary in any part of its path.</p>
                <p>The principle on which the preceding capstan is constructed might be applied with
                    great advantage when two separate axles AB, CD arc driven by means of the winch
                    H and the wheels B and A. It is evident that when the winch is turned round in
                    one direction, the rope R is unwinded from the axle BD; the wheel B drives the
                    wheel A, so that the axle AC moves in a direction opposite to that of BD, and
                    the rope is c oiled around the axle AC. If the wheels A, <gap instant="false"
                    reason="overbinding"/> are of the same diameter and the same number of teeth,
                    the weight <unclear instant="false" reason="overbinding">W</unclear> will be
                    stationary, as the rope <unclear instant="false" reason="overbinding"

                    the other. If the wheels have different diameters, or different numbers of
                    teeth, the quantity of rope wound around the one axle will exceed what is
                    unwound from the other, and the weight will be raised.</p>

                    view of this difficult branch of mechanical philosophy. By employing large
                    bodies, and conducting his experiments on a great scale, he has corrected
                    several errors which arose from the limited experiments of others; he has
                    brought to light many new and striking phenomena, and confirmed others which
                    were hitherto but partially established. As it would be foreign to the nature of
                    this work to follow this ingenious philosopher through his numerous and varied
                    experiments, w® shall, only present the reader with a description of his
                    apparatus, and an account of the interesting results which he obtained.</p>
                <p>The apparatus used by Coulomb in his experiments on friction, consists of a solid
                    table resting upon very strong legs. The plank <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> fig.
                    105, and <hi rend="italic">dd</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> fig. 106, which
                    constitutes the table, is eight feet long, two wide, and three inches thick. Two
                    pieces of oak AB, A'B', twelve feet long and eight inches thick, are placed on
                    the table in the direction of its length, and at the distance of three inches
                    from each other. A pulley H of hard wood, a foot in diameter, and of fourteen
                    pounds weight, is fixed upon an axle of green oak ten lines in diameter, and
                    moving in sockets at the ends B, B <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> of the two
                    pieces of oak. A cord passing over this pulley carries at one end a scale P, and
                    is fixed at the other to a sledge S, fig. 106, which runs upon the table. The
                    scale P, for carrying weights, is capable of descending four feet into a pit cut
                    beneath it. A small horizontal wheel and axle is placed at the other ends A, A'
                    of the pieces of oak AB, A ’ B. Above these pieces is fixed another plank <hi
                    rend="italic">aa'bb</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> eight feet long, sixteen
                    inches wide, and three inches thick, having its upper surface smoothly planed.
                    Sledges of the form shown in the annexed figures are made to slide upon this
                    plank. The sledge ABDC, fig. 107, is a plank eighteen inches wide, but having
                    its length variable; and there is nailed beneath it two pieces ACom ʹ, BDrm', so
                    that when this sledge is placed upon*the fixed plank <hi rend="italic"
                    >aa'bb',</hi> it may be retained by these pieces on <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205126" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5126-0408"/>both sides with a play of two
                    or three lines, so that it may move undisturbed in the direction of the plank.
                    When the touching sur- • faces are required to be smaller, other pieces of
                    different widths are nailed upon the plank ABDC, and their ends rounded for
                    receiving the nuts, to prevent them from rubbing on the plank. To one of the
                    hooks <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is fixed the pulley cord, and to the other <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> the cord which goes round the wheel and axle already
                    mentioned, and the use of which is to bring back the sledge to the side A A' of
                    the apparatus. In some of the experiments a steelyard was used, as shown in fig.
                    106.</p>
                <p>1. The friction of homogeneous bodies, or bodies of the same kind, moving upon
                    one another, is generally supposed to be greater than that of heterogeneous
                    bodies; but Coulomb has shown that there are exceptions to this rule. He found,
                    for example, that the co∙efficient of friction of oak upon oak was equal to -
                    <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi> of the force of pressure, or -5—- when the surfaces
                    were very small; the friction of pine against pine that of oak against pine ~p~,
                    and that ofelm against elm —⅛ττ. With elm alone in small nres-ŵ* to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> sures the friction increases with the velocity. The
                    friction of oak against copper was ~, and that of oak against iron nearly the
                    same.</p>
                <p>2. It was generally supposed, that in the case of wood, the friction is greatest
                    when the bodies are dragged contrary to the course of their fibres; but Coulomb
                    has shown that the friction is in this case sometimes the smallest. When the
                    bodies moved in the direction of their fibres, the friction in the case of oak
                    upon oak was — of the force ŵVT</p>
                <p>with which they were pressed together; but when the motion was contrary to the
                    courses of the fibres, the friction <hi rend="superscript"> was0n</hi>
                    ⅛-3⅛β-</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The longer the rubbing surfaces remain in contact, the
                    greater is their friction.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> When wood was moved upon
                    wood, according to the direction of the fibres, the friction was increased by
                    keeping the surfaces in contact for a few seconds; and when the time was
                    prolonged to a minute, the friction seemed to have reached its farthest limit.
                    But when the motion was contrary to the course of the fibres, a greater time was
                    necessary before the friction arrived at its maximum. When wood was moved upon
                    metal, the friction did not attain its maximum till the surfaces continued in
                    contact for five or six days; and it is very remarkable, that when wooden
                    surfaces were anointed with tallow, the time requisite for producing the
                    greatest quantity of friction was increased. The increase of friction which is
                    generated by prolonging the time of contact is so great, that a body weighing
                    1650 pounds was moved with a force of 64 pounds when first laid upon its
                    corresponding surface. After having remained in contact for the space of three
                    seconds, it required 160 pounds to put it in motion; and, when the time was
                    prolonged to six days, it could scarcely be moved with a force of 622 pounds.
                    When the surfaces of metallic bodies were moved upon one another, the time of
                    producing a maximum of friction was not changed by the interposition of olive
                    oil; it was increased, however, by employing swine’s grease as an unguent, and

                    2474 pounds. In these cases the friction was successively τ~-, -≈τw&gt; τΛτ&gt;

                <p>were obtained in all Coulomb’s experiments, even when metallic surfaces were
                    employed. The second part of the proposition has also been established by
                    Coulomb. He found that the greatest friction is engendered when oak moves upon
                    pine, and that it amounts to - <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> ⅛- of the force 1 ’
                    7o of pressure; on the contrary, when iron moves upon brass, the least friction

                    surfaces were very small in respect to the force with which they were pressed,
                    <hi rend="italic">the friction was diminished by augmenting the

                    surfaces were very large when compared with the force of pressure. When the wood
                    was moved contrary to the direction of its fibres, the friction in every case
                    remained the same. If wood be moved upon metals, the friction is greatly
                    increased by an increase of velocity; and when metals move upon wood besmeared
                    with tallow, the friction is still augmented by adding to the velocity. When
                    metals move upon metals, the friction is always a constant quantity; but when
                    heterogeneous substances are employed which are not bedaubed with tallow, the
                    friction is so increased with the velocity, as to form an arithmetical
                    progression when the velocities form a geometrical one.</p>

                <p>After the surfaces were polished as highly as possible, and greased with oil or
                    tallow, they were attached to the sledge, and made to rest upon one another
                    under a great pressure for half an hour, the grease being from time to time
                    renewed, till it had penetrated the pores of the metal, and in this manner
                    communicated to the rulers a degree of polish which they could not have received
                    from any other method. The size of the rulers was the same as in section 1, and
                    the areas in contact the same. The velocity of the sledge was below an inch in a
                    second. The friction was at first uncertain, but it became more regular as the
                    polish increased.</p>

                    the frictions increase in an arithmetical progression when the velocities
                    increase in a geometrical one. Coulomb likewise found that when the pressure and

                <p>These results are highly important in practice; but the grease must not be
                    allowed to acquire any consistency, otherwise the friction increases very
                    perceptibly. It must therefore be removed, and renewed when necessary. In order
                    to obtain an estimate of the influence of this thickening of the grease, Coulomb
                    caused the sledge, when carrying the plates of brass, to move fifteen times over
                    the fixed oaken plank, without removing or renewing the tallow. The consequence
                    of this was, that the friction was triple of that which was necessary to give
                    the sledge an insensible velocity when the tallow coating was new. The velocity
                    of the sledge diminished, or the friction increased, at every trial; and at the
                    fifteenth trial the <hi rend="italic">sledge ceased to move.</hi> Hence it
                    follows that the tallow actually increases the friction, or is injurious, when
                    the surfaces move a long time without a renewal of the grease.</p>

                <p>The results were nearly the same when the surfaces were well tallowed. The ratio
                    of the friction to the pressure is constant, and not much influenced by the
                    velocity. This case is analogous to the case of axles of iron turning upon
                    wood.</p>
                <p>From the preceding experiments, Coulomb has drawn the following curious
                    inferences respecting the structure of the surfaces of woods and metals.</p>
                <p>He supposes that the fibres of wood are as shown in fig. 109, which represents
                    one surface lying upon another.</p>
                <p>When the fibres are bent by the application of a force to the upper surface, but
                    before the fibres are detached from one another, he supposes the two surfaces to
                    be like fig. 110.</p>
                <p>When the surfaces are detached, and the upper surface is in motion over the under
                    one, he supposes the surface to be as in fig. 111.</p>
                <p>He considers the surfaces of metals to be more smooth than those of wood, and to
                    have the undulated structure shown in fig. 112.</p>

                <p>Mr Rennie has drawn the following conclusions from his experiments.</p>
                <p>1. The laws which govern the retardation of bodies gliding over each other are as
                    the nature of the bodies.</p>
                <p>2. In fibrous substances, such as cloth, friction is increased by surface and
                    time, and diminished by pressure and velocity.</p>
                <p>3. In harder substances, such as woods, metals, and stones, and within the limits
                    of abrasion, the friction is directly as the pressure, without regard to
                    surface, time, or velocity.</p>
                <p>4. With dissimilar substances, the friction will be determined by the limit of
                    abrasion of the softer substance.</p>
                <p>5. Friction is greatest with <hi rend="italic">soft,</hi> and least with <hi
                    rend="italic">hard,</hi> substances.</p>
                <p>6. The effect of unguents is as the nature of the unguents, without reference to
                    the substances to which they arc applied.</p>
                <p>7. The very soft woods, stones, and metals, approximate to the laws which
                    regulate the friction of fibrous substances.</p>
                <p>In comparing his results with those of Coulomb, Mr Rennie found that the
                    differences relate chiefly to time, and he conceives that the small pressures
                    used by the French philosopher (varying from one pound to forty-five pounds per
                    square inch) account for these differences.</p>
                <p>The selection of substances used by Mr Rennie was made on the following
                    grounds:</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Ice,</hi> in reference to its resistance to sledges, skates,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Leather,</hi> from its utility in the pistons of pumps.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Stones,</hi> in reference to their use in arches and
                    buildings.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Cloth,</hi> from its remarkable properties of resistance in
                    opposition to the .law observed by solids.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Woods</hi> and <hi rend="italic">metals,</hi> from their
                    universal application to machinery, carriages, and railways.</p>
                <p>Mr Rennie’s experiments on leather are very interesting.</p>
                <p>When nine square inches of leather, <hi rend="italic">soaked in water,</hi> moved
                    over a plate of iron, seven pounds barely kept in motion fifty-six pounds after
                    starting with the hand. After a contact of five minutes twenty-nine pounds were
                    required to start it; twenty-eight pounds barely kept in motion sixty-four
                    pounds after starting it; and after being one minute in contact it took
                    forty-two pounds to start it.</p>
                <p>Where a surface of four and half inches area (one and a half by three) was used,
                    six and a half pounds barely kept in motion thirty-six pounds after starting it.
                    After remaining five minutes it required twenty-one pounds to start it. Hence
                    <hi rend="italic">the friction of hide leather soaked in water is greatly
                    increased by time and weight,</hi> a fact which explains the enormous friction
                    evinced in the pistons of pumps when first put in motion.</p>
                <p>When the hide leather moved <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> over a surface of cast
                    iron, the friction evinced from one fourth to nearly one sixth of the pressure,
                    and was, <hi rend="italic">caeteris paribus,</hi> diminished by a diminution of
                    surface. The surfaces employed were two and a fourth, four and a half six and
                    three fourths, and nine square inches.</p>

                <p>According to Morisot, granite resists abrasion twelve times more than has, while
                    it possesses a repulsive power only three times greater. According to Boistard,
                    the friction of hard calcareous stones is 0*78.</p>

                <p>In order to ascertain the friction experienced by the axles of machinery in
                    motion, Coulomb used axles of iron moving in boxes of brass. The iron axis had a
                    diameter of nineteen lines, and a play of one and three-fourth lines in the
                    brass box. In order to give the rubbing surfaces the highest polish, the iron
                    axis was made to work a considerable time in the brass box. The following is a
                    brief abstract of the results which were obtained.</p>

                <p>In all these experiments, the friction was least when the surfaces were merely
                    greasy, and not coated with tallow. Unless in the first instants of rest, the

                <p>From these various results, which we have abridged as much as possible, Mr Rennie
                    concludes “that the diminution of friction by unguents varies as the insistent
                    weights and nature of the unguents: the lighter the weight, the finer and more
                    fluid should be the unguent, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.'’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">On the Friction of Pivots.</hi></p>
                <p>In the construction of clocks and watches, and all delicate pieces of machinery,
                    but particularly in the formation of compasses, the proper form of pivots, as
                    well as the material of which they are made, and in which they move, are
                    subjects of the greatest importance.</p>
                <p>All that we know on this subject is due to the celebrated Coulomb, who made two
                    different sets of experiments on the friction of pivots. The last was macle with
                    most accuracy, and <hi rend="italic">in vacuo,</hi> to get rid of the effects of
                    the airs resistance.</p>
                <p>The apparatus used by Coulomb is shown in the annexed figure, where <hi
                    rend="italic">akhb</hi> is a brass wire fork, fixed at <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    to a concave lens of glass, whose radius is about two or three lines. Two
                    metallic plates <hi rend="italic">a, b</hi> are fixed to the lower ends of the
                    bent wire, and the whole moves upon a pivot beneath <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> at
                    the upper end of the needle <hi rend="italic">gd,</hi> which was made of
                    tempered steel, and fixed into the cylindrical stand. A rotatory motion is given
                    to the fork by a hooked rod <hi rend="italic">er,</hi> and the whole is enclosed
                    in an air-tight glass receiver AB, in which a vacuum is made in the usual manner
                    by an air-pump. Coulomb found that when <hi rend="italic">αb</hi> was two
                    inches, the time of the fork’s revo lution was seven or eight seconds, and the
                    weight of a and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> about five or six gros (a gros is about
                    the eighth part of an ounce). It is unnecessary to perform the experiments <hi
                    rend="italic">in vacuo,</hi> though it is proper to protect the apparatus from
                    currents of air, by placing it under a receiver.</p>
                <p>In order to compare the experimental results, Coulomb investigated the following
                    formula:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    multiplied into the square of its distance <hi rend="italic">r</hi> from the
                    axis of motion, and divided by the distance <hi rend="italic">a</hi> from the

                <p>— is a constant quantity.</p>
                <p>With a different apparatus Coulomb made the following preliminary experiments. He
                    took a glass receiver, four inches wide, five inches high, and five ounces in
                    weight, and having caused this to revolve upon a pivot, he observed the time
                    employed in making the <hi rend="italic">four</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >five</hi> first turns, from a mean of which he obtained the primitive velocity
                    <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and he then counted the number of revolutions
                    performed by the revolving receiver till it stopped. Having found that the
                    resistance of the air bore no sensible proportion to that of friction, the
                    preceding results enabled him to calculate the friction by which the receiver
                    was brought to rest. The following were the results:—</p>

                    momentum of friction is constant, and as the value of y, the first term, appears

                <p>mentum of friction is also constant; and hence Coulomb drew the conclusion, that

                <p>In order to determine the friction of pivots when they supported planes of
                    different materials, Coulomb used the apparatus represented above. The fork <hi

                    was a semicircle of about three inches long, and the branches <hi rend="italic"
                    >ak, kb</hi> three inches long. The pieces of metal <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi>
                    and the plane <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> were attached to the wire by wax. At <hi

                    needle of tempered steel, whose point could be made more or less sharp or
                    obtuse, as the nature of the planes and the magnitude of the pressure required.
                    The angle of the point at <hi rend="italic">g</hi> was, in the following
                    experiments, eighteen or twenty degrees, the weight of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> was a quarter of an ounce, and that of the fork

                <p>Hence it may be shown, that the momentum of friction is proportional to the fd
                    power of the pressure. When the pressure was very considerable, and the pivot
                    shaped to any angle, the friction varied nearly as the pressure. These results
                    were deduced from the experiments with the glass plane, as the friction was
                    greater and the results more regular with it than with either garnet or
                    agate.</p>
                <p>Coulomb found the cups made by the best workmen very irregular in their
                    curvature, and producing a friction three or even four times greater than that
                    of well-polished planes of the same substance. With such cups the angles of the
                    pivots should be diminished.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Friction of Machines.</hi></p>
                <p>In the year 1786, and at subsequent periods, the late Mr John Rennie made several
                    experiments on the friction and resistance of heavy machinery. He found that an
                    augmentation of resistance took place with the quantity of machinery put in
                    motion; in one instance in the ratio of one to five, when from one fifth to one
                    tenth of the power expended was absorbed; an anomaly which Mr George Rennie
                    ascribes to the irregularity of the movement, and to the difficulty of producing
                    simultaneous actions in corn <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205230"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5230-0416"/>plicated machinery. The resistance in these
                    experiments was likewise increased by reversing the direction of motion. The
                    velocities not exceeding 120 feet a minute, appeared to have had no
                    influence.</p>
                <p>The following experiments were made by Mr George Rennie:</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Twenty-one cwt.</hi> was suspended at each extremity of a
                    chain passing over two cast-iron sheaves two feet in diameter, with wrought-iron
                    axles working in brass bearings oiled, and twelve feet ten inches apart. It was
                    disturbed by three cwt. or <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th of the total weight.
                    Another double-purchased crane gave one ninth.</p>
                <p>2. A weight of 7057 lbs. suspended to a double-purchased crane indicated <hi
                    rend="strikethrough">- θ--</hi> for the friction. Another similar one indicated
                    one ninth. In one of the corn-mills at Deptford, it required one tenth of the
                    weight of the mass to overcome the inertia and friction of the bearings and
                    tangential surfaces. The pressures in this case varied from twenty-eight lbs. to
                    eight cwt. per inch, and the velocities of the surfaces from 50 to 120 feet per
                    minute.</p>
                <p>Mr Rennie remarks, that it has been usual to deduct one fourth of the power
                    expended for friction; but though this may hold in machines newly set in motion,
                    he conceives that the proportion is much less when the bearings are properly
                    proportioned to the weights of the parts, and their surfaces kept from contact
                    by unguents.</p>
                <p>Having thus considered the nature and effects of friction, we shall now attend to
                    the method of lessening the resistance which it opposes to the motion of
                    machines. The most efficacious mode of accomplishing this, is to convert that
                    species of friction which arises from one body being dragged over another, into
                    that which is occasioned by one body rolling upon another. As this will always
                    diminish the resistance, it may be easily effected by applying wheels or rollers
                    to the sockets or bushes which sustain the gudgeons of large wheels and the
                    axles of wheel-carriages. Casatus seems to have been the first who recommended
                    this apparatus. It was afterwards mentioned by Sturmius and Wolfius, but was not
                    used in practice till Sully applied it to clocks in the year 1716, and Mondran
                    to cranes in 1725. Notwithstanding these solitary attempts to introduce
                    friction-wheels, they seem to have attracted little notice, till the celebrated
                    Euler examined and explained, with his usual accuracy, their nature and
                    advantages. The diameter of the gudgeons and pivots should be made as small as
                    the weight of the wheel and the impelling force will permit. The gudgeons should
                    rest upon wheels as large as circumstances will allow, having their axes as near
                    each other as possible, but no thicker than what is absolutely necessary to
                    sustain the superincumbent weight. When these precautions are properly attended
                    to, the resistance which arises from the friction of the gudgeon, &amp;c. will
                    be extremely trifling.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>An example of the application of friction-wheels is to be found in Atwood’s
                    machine, described in a subsequent part of this Article.</p></note></p>
                <p>The effects of friction may likewise in some measure be removed by a judicious
                    application of the impelling power, and by proportioning the size of the
                    friction-wheels to the pressure which they severally sustain. If we suppose, for
                    example, that the weight of a wheel, whose iron gudgeons move in bushes of
                    brass, is 100 pounds, then the friction arising from both its gudgeons will be
                    equivalent to 25 pounds. If we suppose also that a force equal to 40 pounds is
                    employed to impel the wheel, and acts in the direction of gravity, as in the
                    cases of overshot-wheels, the pressure of the gudgeons upon their supports will
                    then be 140 pounds and the friction 35 pounds. But if the force of 40 pounds
                    could be applied in such a manner as to act in direct opposition to the wheel’s
                    weight, the pressure of the gudgeons upon their supports would be 100 — 40, or
                    60 pounds, and the friction only 15 pounds. It is impossible, indeed, to make
                    the moving force act in direct opposition to the gravity of the wheel in the
                    case of watermills, and it is often impracticable for the engineer to apply the
                    impelling power but in a given way; but there are many cases in which the moving
                    force may be so exerted as at least not to increase the friction which arises
                    from the wheel’s weight.</p>
                <p>When the moving force is not exerted in a perpendicular direction, but
                    obliquely,as in undershot-wheels, the gudgeon will press with greater force on
                    one part of the socket than on any other part. This point will evidently be on
                    the side of the bush opposite to that where the power is applied; and its
                    distance from the lowest point of the socket, which is supposed circular and
                    concentric with</p>
                <p>H the gudgeon, being called <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> we shall have tan.</p>
                <p>that is, the tangent of the arch contained between the point of greatest pressure
                    and the lowest point of the bush, is equal to the sum of all the horizontal
                    forces divided by the sum of all the vertical forces and the weight of the
                    wheel, H representing the former, and V the latter quantities. The point of
                    greatest pressure being thus determined, the gudgeon must be supported at that
                    part by the largest friction-wheel, in order to equalize the friction upon their
                    axles.</p>
                <p>The application of these general principles to particular cases is so simple as
                    not to require any illustration. To aid the conceptions, however, of the
                    practical mechanic, we may mention two cases in which friction-wheelshavebeen
                    successfully employed.</p>
                <p>Mr Gottlieb, the constructor of a new crane, has received a patent for what he
                    calls an anti-attrition axle-tree, the beneficial effects of which he has
                    ascertained by a variety of trials. It consists of a steel roller R, about four
                    or six inches long, which turns within a groove cut in the inferior part of the
                    axle-tree C, which runs in the nave AB of the wheel. When the wheel-carriages
                    are at rest, Mr Gottlieb has given the friction-wheel its proper position; but
                    it is evident that the point of greatest pressure will change when they are put
                    in motion, and will be nearer the front of the carriage. This point, however,
                    will vary with the weight of the load; but it is sufficiently obvious that the
                    friction-roller should be at a little distance from the lowest point of the
                    axle-tree.</p>
                <p>Mr Garnett of Bristol has applied friction-rollers in a different manner, which
                    does not, like the preceding method, weaken the axle-tree.</p>
                <p>Instead of fixing them in the iron part of the axle, he leaves a space between
                    the nave and the axis, to be filled with equal rollers almost touching each
                    other. A section of this apparatus is represented in fig. 115, where ABCD is the
                    metallic ring inserted in the nave of the wheel. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205243" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5243-0417"/>axle-tree is represented at
                    E, placed between the frictionrollers I, I, I, made of metal, and having their
                    axes inserted into a circle of brass, which passes through their centres. The
                    circles are riveted together by means of bolts passing between the rollers, in
                    order to keep them separate and parallel.</p>
                <p>As it appears from the experiments of Coulomb that the least friction is
                    generated when polished iron moves upon brass, the gudgeons and pivots of
                    wheels, and the axles of friction-rollers, should all be made of polished iron;
                    and the bushes in which these gudgeons move, and the frictionwheels, should be
                    formed of polished brass.</p>
                <p>When every mechanical contrivance has been adopted for diminishing the
                    obstruction which arises from the attrition of the communicating parts, it may
                    be still farther removed by the judicious application of unguents. The most
                    proper for this purpose are swine’s grease and tallow when the surfaces are made
                    of wood, and oil when they are of metal. When the force with which the surfaces
                    are pressed together is very great, tallow will diminish the fricion more than
                    swine’s grease. When the wooden surfaces are very small, unguents will lessen
                    their friction a little; but it will be greatly diminished if wood moves upon
                    metal greased with tallow. If the velocities, however, are increased, or the
                    unguent not often enough renewed, in both hese cases, but particularly in the
                    last, the unguent will be nore injurious than useful. The best mode of applying
                    it s to cover the rubbing surfaces with as thin a stratum as possible, for the
                    friction will then be a constant quantity, and will not be increased by an
                    augmentation of velocity.</p>
                <p>In small works of wood, the interposition of the powder of black lead has been
                    found very useful in relieving the motion. The ropes of pulleys should be rubbed
                    with tallow, and whenever the screw is used, the square threads hould be
                    preferred.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Appendix to
                    Ferguson’s Lectures, vol. ii.</p></note></p>
                <p>A very important unguent for diminishing the friction of machinery was
                    accidentally discovered at Lowell in North America. The substance is <hi
                    rend="italic">steatite</hi> or <hi rend="italic">soapstone,</hi> pulverised and
                    mixed with oil, tallow, or tar, according to the use to which it is to be
                    applied. It has been used most successfully in all kinds of machinery, and it is
                    said to be equally applicable to carriage-wheels. The following fact, stated by
                    Mr Moody, the superintendent of the tarworks near Boston, will show the value of
                    steatite as an unpent. A horizontal balance-wheel of 14 tons runs on a step 5
                    inches in diameter, and revolves from 75 to 125 times in a minute. This wheel is
                    connected with the rolling machine, and though 100 tons of iron are rolled in
                    this machine in a minute, yet the balance-wheel has sometimes been used from <hi
                    rend="italic">three to five weeks</hi> without inconvenience before the
                    soapstone has been renewed. When machinery begun to be heated, its application
                    is said to succeed when all other unguents fail.<note anchored="true"

                    the application of cow’s dung is particularly effectual. A more

                <p>When ropes pass over cylinders or pulleys, a considerable force is necessary to
                    bend them into the form of the circumference round which they are coiled. The
                    force which is necessary to overcome this resistance is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">stiffness</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rigidity</hi> of the ropes.
                    This important subject is first examined by Amontons,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Mém. Acad.</hi> 1699 ,p.
                    217.</p></note> who contrived an ingeneous apparatus for ascertaining the
                    rigidity of ropes. His experiments were repeated, and confirmed in part, by
                    Desaguliers<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Course of
                    Nat. Phil. vol. i. p. 243.</p></note> and others, but particularly by Μ.
                    Coulomb, who has investigated the subject with more care and success than any of
                    his predecessors. His experiments were made both with the apparatus of Amontons
                    and with one of his own invention; and as there was no great discrepancy in the
                    results, he was authorized to place more confidence in his experiments. The
                    limits of this article will not permit us to give an account of the manner in
                    which the experiments were conducted, or even to give a detailed view of the
                    various conclusions which were obtained. We can only present the reader with
                    some of those leading results which may be useful in the construction of
                    machinery.</p>
                <p>1. The rigidity of ropes increases, the more that the fibres of which they are
                    composed are twisted.</p>
                <p>2. The rigidity of ropes increases in the duplicate ratio of their diameters.
                    According to Amontons and Desaguliers, the rigidity increases in the simple
                    ratio of the diameters of the ropes; but this probably arose from the
                    flexibility of the ropes which they employed; for Desaguliers remarks, that when
                    he used a rope whose diameter was half an inch, its rigidity was increased in a
                    greater proportion; so that it is probable that if they had employed ropes from
                    two to four inches in^ diameter, like those used by Coulomb, they would have
                    obtained similar results. (See No. 5.)</p>
                <p>3. The rigidity of ropes is in the simple and direct ratio of their tension.</p>
                <p>4. The rigidity of ropes is in the inverse ratio of the diameters of the
                    cylinders round which they are coiled.</p>
                <p>5. In general, the rigidity of ropes is directly as their tensions and the
                    squares of their diameters, and inversely as the diameters of the cylinders
                    round which they are wound.</p>
                <p>6. The rigidity of ropes increases so little with the velocity of the machine,
                    that it need not be taken into the account when computing the effects of
                    machines.</p>
                <p>7. The rigidity of small ropes is diminished when penetrated with moisture; but
                    when the ropes are thick, their rigidity is increased.</p>
                <p>8. The rigidity of ropes is increased and their strength diminished when they are
                    covered with pitch; but when ropes of this kind are alternately immersed in the
                    sea and exposed to the air, they last longer than when they are not pitched.
                    This increase of rigidity, however, is not so perceptible in small ropes as in
                    those which are pretty thick.</p>
                <p>9. The rigidity of ropes covered with pitch is a sixth part greater during frost
                    than in the middle of summer, but this increase of rigidity does not follow the
                    ratio of their tensions.</p>
                <p>10. The resistance to be overcome in bending a rope over a pulley or cylinder may
                    be represented by a formula <hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >_ _ aP)η.</hi> composed of two terms. The first term —— is a constant quantity
                    independent of the tension, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> being a constant quantity
                    determined by experiment, Dr a power of the diameter D of the rope, and <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> the radius of the pulley or cylinder round which the rope
                    is coiled. The second term of the formula is T × , where T is the tension of the
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> rope, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> a constant quantity, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Dr</hi> and <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> the same as before. Hence
                    the complete formula is fT × , or <hi rend="italic">× a</hi> + TZ». <hi
                    rend="italic">r r</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi></p>
                <p>The exponent <hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the quantity D diminishes with the
                    flexibility of the rope, but is generally equal to 1∙7 or 1*8; or, as in No. 2,
                    the rigidity is nearly in the duplicate ratio of the diameter of the rope. When
                    the cord is much used, its flexibility is increased, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> becomes equal to 1∙5 or 1∙4.</p>

                <p>CHAP. IV.—ON THE NATURE AND ADVANTAGES OF FLY-WHEELS.</p>
                <p>A fly, in mechanics, is a heavy wheel or cylinder, which moves rapidly on its
                    axis, and is applied to machines for the purpose of rendering uniform a
                    desultory or reciprocating motion, arising either from the nature of the
                    machinery, from an inequality in the resistance to be overcome, or from an
                    irregular application of the impelling power. When the first mover is inanimate,
                    as wind, water, and steam, an inequality of force obviously arises from a
                    variation in the velocity of the wind, from an increase or decrease of water
                    occasioned by sudden rains, or from an augmentation or diminution of the steam
                    in the boiler, produced by a variation of heat in the furnace; and accordingly
                    various methods have been adopted for regulating the action of these variable
                    powers. The same inequality of force obtains when machines are moved by horses
                    or men. Every animal exerts its greatest strength when first set to work. After
                    pulling for some time, its strength will be impaired; and when the resistance is
                    great, it will take frequent though short relaxations, and then commence its
                    labour with renovated vigour. These intervals of rest and vigorous exertion must
                    always produce a variation in the velocity of the machine, which ought
                    particularly to be avoided, as being detrimental to the communicating parts as
                    well as the performance of the machine, and injurious to the animal which is
                    employed to drive it. But if a fly, consisting either of cross bars or a massy
                    circular rim, be connected with the machinery, all these inconveniences will be
                    removed. As every flywheel must revolve with great rapidity, the momentum of its
                    circumference must be very considerable, and will consequently resist every
                    attempt either to accelerate or retard its motion. When the machine therefore
                    has been put in motion, the fly-wheel will be whirling with an uniform celerity,
                    and with a force capable of continuing that celerity when there is any
                    relaxation in the impelling power. After a short rest the animal renews his
                    efforts; but the machine is now moving with its former velocity, and these fresh
                    efforts will have a tendency to increase that velocity. The fly, however, now
                    acts as a resisting power, receives the greatest part of the superfluous motion,
                    and causes the machinery to preserve its original celerity. In this way the fly
                    secures to the engine an uniform motion, whether the animal takes occasional
                    relaxations or exerts his force with redoubled ardour.</p>
                <p>We have already observed that a desultory or variable motion frequently arises
                    from the inequality of the resistance, or work to be performed. This is
                    particularly manifest in thrashing mills on a small scale, which are driven by
                    water. When the corn is laid unequally on the feeding board, so that too much is
                    taken in by the fluted rollers, this increase of resistance instantly affects
                    the machinery, and communicates a desultory or irregular motion even to the
                    water-wheel or first mover. This variation in the velocity of the impelling
                    power may be distinctly perceived by the ear in a calm evening when the machine
                    is at work. The best method of correcting these irregularities is to employ a
                    fly-wheel, which will regulate the motion of the machine when the resistance is
                    either augmented or diminished. In machines built upon a large scale there is no
                    necessity for the interposition of a fly, as the <hi rend="italic">inertia</hi>
                    of the machinery supplies its place, and resists every change of motion that may
                    be generated by an unequal admission of the corn.</p>
                <p>A variation in the velocity of engines arises also from the nature of the
                    machinery. Let us suppose that a weight of 1000 pounds is to be raised from the
                    bottom of a well 50 feet, by means of a bucket attached to an iron chain which
                    winds round a barrel or cylinder, and that every foot length of this chain
                    weighs two pounds. It is evident that the resistance to be overcome in the first
                    moment is 1000 pounds added to 50 pounds the weight of this chain, and that this
                    resistance diminishes gradually as the chain coils round the cylinder, till it
                    is only 1000 pounds when the chain is completely wound up. The resistance
                    therefore decreases from 1050 to 1000 pounds; and if the impelling power is
                    inanimate, the velocity of the bucket will gradually increase; but if an animal
                    be employed, it will generally proportion its action to the resisting load, and
                    must therefore pull with a greater or less force according as the bucket is near
                    the bottom or top of the well. In this case, however, the assistance of a fly
                    may be dispensed with, because the resistance diminishes uniformly, and may be
                    rendered constant by making the barrel conical, so that the chain.may wind upon
                    the part nearest the vertex at the commencement of the motion, the diameter of
                    the barrel gradually increasing as the weight diminishes. In this way the
                    variable resistance will be equalized much better than by the application of a
                    fly-wheel, for the fly, having no motion of its own, must necessarily waste the
                    impelling power.</p>
                <p>Having thus pointed out the chief causes of variation in the velocity of
                    machines, and the method of rendering it uniform by the intervention of
                    fly-wheels, the utility, and in some instances the necessity, of this piece of
                    mechanism, may be more obviously illustrated by showing the propriety of their
                    application in particular cases.</p>
                <p>When machinery is driven by a single-stroke steam-engine, there is such an
                    inequality in the impelling power, that for two or three seconds it does not act
                    at all. During this interval of inactivity the machinery would necessarily stop,
                    were it not impelled by a massy fly-wheel of a great diameter, revolving with
                    rapidity, till the moving power again resumes its energy.</p>
                <p>If the moving power be a man acting with a handle or winch, it is subject to
                    great inequalities. The greatest force is exerted when the man pulls the handle
                    upwards from the height of his knee, and he acts with the least force when the
                    handle, being in a vertical position, is thrust from him in a horizontal
                    direction. The force is again increased when the handle is pushed downwards by
                    the man’s weight, and it is diminished when the handle, being at its lowest
                    point, is pulled towards him horizontally. But when a fly is properly connected
                    with the machinery, these irregular exertions are equalized, the velocity
                    becomes uniform, and the load is raised with an equable and steady motion.</p>
                <p>In many cases, where the impelling force is alternately augmented and diminished,
                    the performance of the machine may be increased by rendering the resistance
                    unequal, and accommodating it to the inequalities of the moving power. Dr
                    Robison observes, that “there are some beautiful specimens of this kind of
                    adjustment in the mechanism of animal bodies.”</p>
                <p>Besides the utility offly-wheels as regulators ofmachinery, they have been
                    employed for accumulating or collecting power. If motion is communicated to a
                    fly-wheel by means of a small force, and if this force is continued till the
                    wheel has acquired a great velocity, such a quantity of motion will be
                    accumulated in its circumference, as to overcome resistances, and produce
                    effects which could never have been accomplished by the original force. So great
                    is this accumulation of power, that a force equivalent to twenty pounds applied
                    for the space of thirty-seven seconds to the circumference of a cylinder twenty
                    feet diameter, which weighs 4713 pounds, would, at the distance of one foot from
                    the centre, give an. impulse to a musket-ball equal to what it receives from a
                    full charge of gunpowder. In the space of six minutes and ten seconds, the same
                    effect would be produced if the cylinder were driven by a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205269" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5269-0419"/>man who constantly exerted a
                    force of twenty pounds at a winch one foot long.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This has been demonstrated by Mr Atwood. See
                    his Treatise on Rectilineal and Rotatory Motion.</p></note></p>
                <p>This accumulation of power is finely exemplified in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sling.</hi> When the thong which contains the stone is swung round the head of
                    the slinger, the force of the hand is continually accumulating in the revolving
                    stone, till it is discharged with a degree of rapidity which it could never have
                    received from the force of the hand alone. When a stone is projected from the
                    hand itself, there is even then a certain degree of force accumulated, though
                    the stone only moves through the arch of a circle. If we fix the stone in an
                    opening at the extremity of a piece of wood two feet long, and discharge it in
                    the usual way, there will be more force accumulated than with the hand alone,
                    for the stone describes a larger arch in the same time, and must therefore be
                    projected with greater force.</p>
                <p>When coins or medals are struck, a very considerable accumulation of power is
                    necessary, and this is effected by means of a fly. The force is first
                    accumulated in weights fixed on the rim of the fly. This force is communicated
                    to two levers, by which it is farther condensed; and from these levers it is
                    transmitted to a screw, by which it suffers a second condensation. The stamp is
                    then impressed on the coin or medal by means of this force, which was first
                    accumulated by the fly, and afterwards augmented by the intervention of two
                    mechanical powers. Hence it follows, that if the fly-wheel, thus loaded with
                    accumulated power, should be detached from the steam-engine or the first mover,
                    whose power it regulates and accumulates, it will go on for some time to do the
                    work of the machine after the prime mover has ceased to act. This effect is
                    finely illustrated by a fact stated by Mr Babbage:<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Economy of Manufactures, § 20.</p></note>
                    “The powerful effect,” says he, “of a large fly-wheel, when its force can be
                    concentrated in a point, was curiously illustrated at one of the largest of our
                    manufactories. The proprietor was showing to a friend the method of punching
                    holes in iron plates for the boilers of steam-engines. He held in his hand a
                    piece of sheet iron three eighths of an inch thick, which he placed under the
                    punch. Observing, after several holes had been made, that the punch made its
                    perforations more and more slowly, he called to the engine-man to know what made
                    the engine work so sluggishly, when it was found that the fly-wheel and punching
                    apparatus had been detached from the steam engine just at the commencement of
                    the experiment.”</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the great advantage of fly-wheels, both as regulators of machines
                    and collectors of power, their utility wholly depends upon the position which is
                    assigned them relative to the impelled and working points of the engine. For
                    this purpose no particular rules can be laid down, as their position depends
                    altogether on the nature of the machinery. We may observe, however, in general,
                    that when fly-wheels are employed to regulate machinery, they should be near the
                    impelling power; and when used to accumulate force in the working point, they
                    should not be far distant from it. In hand-mills for grinding corn the fly is
                    for the most part very injudiciously fixed on the axis to which the winch is
                    attached, whereas it should always be fastened to the upper millstone, so as to
                    revolve with the same rapidity. In the first position, indeed, it must equalize
                    the varying efforts of the power which moves the winch; but when it is attached
                    to the turning millstone, it not only does this, but contributes very
                    effectually to the grinding of the corn.</p>
                <p>A new kind of fly, called a conical pendulum, has been ingeniously employed by Mr
                    Watt for procuring a determinate velocity at the working point of his
                    steam-engine.</p>
                <p>It is represented in fig. 116, where AB is a vertical axis moving upon pivots,
                    and driven by means of a rope passing from the axis of the large flyover the
                    sheaf EF. The large balls Μ, N are fixed to the rods NG, MH, which have an
                    angular motion round P, and are connected by joints at G and H, with the rods
                    GK, HK attached to the extremity of the lever KL, whose centre of motion is L,
                    and whose other extremity is connected with the cock which admits the steam into
                    the cylinder. The frame CD prevents the balls from receding too far from the
                    axis, or from approaching too near it. Now when this conical pendulum is put in
                    motion, the centrifugal force of the balls Μ, N makes them recede from the axis
                    AB. In consequence of this recession, the points G, H, K are depressed, and the
                    other extremity of the lever is raised, and the cock admits a certain quantity
                    of steam into the cylinder. When the velocity of the fly is by any means
                    increased, the balls recede still farther from the axis, the extremity of the
                    lever is raised higher, and the cock closes a little and diminishes the supply
                    of steam. From this diminution in the impelling power, the velocity of the fly
                    and the conical pendulum decreases, and the balls resume their former position.
                    In this way, when there is any increase or diminution in the velocity of the
                    fly, the corresponding increase or diminution in the centrifugal force of the
                    balls raises or depresses the arm of the lever, admits a greater or a less
                    quantity of steam into the cylinder, and restores to the engine its former
                    velocity.</p>
                <p>In like manner, four iron balls have been applied to the axis of a millstone to
                    regulate its motion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    transmit to any machine whose construction is determinate the action of the
                    first mover, and to fulfil the following conditions:</p>
                <p>1. To vary speedily and easily the resistance which the first mover is intended
                    to overcome.</p>
                <p>2. To preserve the resistance constant till it is proper to increase or diminish
                    it.</p>
                <p>3. To preserve the velocity of the machine constant under the most sudden
                    variations of the first mover.</p>
                <p>The section and plan of a machine for applying his invention to a wind-mill is
                    shown in figs. 6 and 7 of Plate CCCLI. The wind-mill sails, which are not shown
                    in the figures, are supposed to give motion to the vertical arbor 0, which
                    carries a quadrangular frame eeee, at each angle of which is fixed a curved wire
                    of iron or steel <hi rend="italic">bd.</hi> Round the main arbor O are situated
                    several vertical arbors α, «, <hi rend="italic">a, a</hi> (eight being shown in

                    so constructed that when the arbor 0 revolves, all the other arbors <hi

                    same effect may be produced by toothed wheels upon all the arbors, as shown in
                    fig. 2.</p>
                <p>Each arbor α, α, α, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the number of which depends on the
                    circumstances of the case, carries a drum <hi rend="italic">ttrr,</hi> round
                    which is coiled a cord passing over a pulley <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and
                    sustaining a weight Q, which slides upon the lever FG, upon any part <pb

                    be fixed, G being the fulcrum of the lever. The axis <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    passes loosely through the pinion <hi rend="italic">gg,</hi> which carries a
                    click or ratchet bearing against teeth upon the side <hi rend="italic">rr</hi>
                    of the drum, so that when the weight Q tends to rise, the ratchet gives way, <hi
                    rend="italic">gg</hi> is thrown loose, and the weight Q continues to rise. When
                    the arm δ(Zhas ceased to act upon <hi rend="italic">af,</hi> the weight Q rises
                    no further, but tends to descend. The ratchet is then thrown into the teeth of
                    rr, so that, in descending, Q turns the pinion <hi rend="italic">gg</hi> along
                    with the drum <hi rend="italic">ttrr.</hi> The very same thing is going on with
                    all the other arbors, which are raising other weights Q, which re-descend in
                    their turn, and give motion to their corresponding pinions <hi rend="italic"
                    >gg.</hi></p>
                <p>Now <hi rend="italic">gg</hi> drives the wheel AB, which, by means of the
                    bevelled wheel on its lower side GD acting upon the bevelled wheel CF, raises
                    the bucket or weight P, which is the work to be performed. Hence the descent of
                    all the weights Q, Q, &amp;c. will concur in raising P. By regulating the
                    distance of the weights Q, from the centre of motion G, the proper ratio between
                    the power of the work to produce a maximum effect may be obtained.</p>
                <p>Baron Prony justly remarks, that advantage maybe taken of the weakest breezes to
                    obtain a certain effect, when all other wind-mills are inactive.<note

                    rend="italic">same ratio,</hi> and if these wheels have another connection, by
                    means of which an increase in the velocity of the first is accompanied by an
                    increase in the velocity of the second in a higher ratio, then it will be
                    impossible that any increase should take place, as it would require the second
                    to move with two different velocities at once. These conditions may be fulfilled
                    by connecting the wheels in the first instance by common teeth-work, and, in the
                    next place, by another toothed wheel, which slides into different positions as
                    the centrifugal force varies. By these means Mr Cecil gets a regulator which
                    opposes no resistance up to a certain velocity, but which, at all greater
                    velocities, presents an insurmountable resistance to any augmentation of
                    velocity, and which may be readily united to any revolving machinery, whatever
                    be its construction and power, the velocity of which it is required to
                    equalize.</p>
                <p>CHAP. V.—ON THE TEETH OF WHEELS AND THE WIPERS OF</p>
                <p>STAMPERS.</p>
                <p>In the construction of machines, we must not only attend to the form and number
                    of their parts, but also to the mode by which they are to be connected. It would
                    be easy to show, did the limits of this article permit it, that, when one wheel
                    impels another, the impelling power will sometimes act with greater and
                    sometimes with less force, unless the teeth of one or both of the wheels be
                    parts of a curve generated after the manner of an epicycloid, by the revolution
                    of one circle along the convex or concave side of another. It may be sufficient
                    to show that, when one wheel impels another by the action of epicycloidal teeth,
                    their motion will be uniform. Let the wheel CD drive the wheel AB by means of
                    the epicycloidal teeth <hi rend="italic">ιnp, nq, or,</hi> acting upon the
                    infinitely small pins or spindles <hi rend="italic">a, b, c</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and let the epicycloids <hi rend="italic">rnp, nq,</hi>
                    &amp;c. be generated by the circumference of the wheel AB, rolling upon the
                    convex circumference of the wheel CD. From the formation of the epicycloid, it
                    is obvious that the arch <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is equal to <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> and the arch <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> to <hi rend="italic">mο</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for during the formation of the part <hi rend="italic"
                    >nb</hi> of the epicycloid <hi rend="italic">nq,</hi> every point of the arch
                    <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is applied to every point of the arch <hi
                    rend="italic">mn</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the same happens during the
                    formation of the part <hi rend="italic">co</hi> of the epicycloid <hi
                    rend="italic">or.</hi> Let us now suppose that the tooth <hi rend="italic"
                    >mp</hi> begins to act on the pin <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and that <hi
                    rend="italic">b, c</hi> are successive positions of the pin <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> after a certain time; then <hi rend="italic">nq, or</hi> will be the
                    positions of the tooth <hi rend="italic">rnp</hi> after the same time; but <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">= mn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ac =
                    mo,</hi> therefore the wheels AB, CD, when the arch is driven by epicycloidal
                    teeth, move through equal spaces in equal times, that is, the force of the wheel
                    CD, and the velocity of the wheel AB, are always uniform.</p>
                <p>In illustrating the application of this property of the epicycloid, which was
                    discovered by Olaus Roemer, the celebrated Danish astronomer, we shall call the
                    small wheel the <hi rend="italic">pinion,</hi> and its teeth the <hi
                    rend="italic">leaves</hi> of the pinion. The line which joins the centre of the
                    wheel and pinion is called the <hi rend="italic">line of centres.</hi> There are
                    three different ways in which the teeth of one wheel may drive another, and each
                    of these modes of action requires a different form for the teeth.</p>
                <p>1. When the action is begun and completed after the teeth have passed the line of
                    centres.</p>
                <p>2. When the action is begun and completed before they reach the line of
                    centres.</p>
                <p>3. When the action is carried on, on both sides of the line of centres.</p>
                <p>1. The first of these modes of action is represented in fig. 118, where B is the
                    centre of the wheel,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In
                    figs. 109, 110, 111, 112, the letter B is supposed to be placed at the centre of
                    the wheels.</p></note> A that of the pinion, and AB the line of centres. It is
                    evident from the figure, that the part <hi rend="italic">b</hi> of the tooth <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi> of the wheel does not act on the leaf <hi rend="italic">m
                    of</hi> the pinion till they arrive at the line of centres AB, and that all the
                    action is carried on after they have passed this line, and is completed when the
                    leaf <hi rend="italic">m</hi> comes into the situation <hi rend="italic"
                    >n.</hi></p>
                <p>When this mode of action is adopted, the. acting faces of the leaves of the
                    pinion should be parts of an <hi rend="italic">interior epicycloid,</hi>
                    generated by a circle of any diameter rolling upon the concave superficies of
                    the pinion, or within the circle <hi rend="italic">adh</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and the faces <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> of the teeth of the wheel should
                    be portions of an <hi rend="italic">exterior epicycloid,</hi> formed by the <hi
                    rend="italic">same</hi> generating circle rolling upon the convex superficies
                    <hi rend="italic">οdp</hi> of the wheel.</p>
                <p>But when one circle rolls within another whose diameter is double that of the
                    rolling circle, the line generated by any point of the latter is a <hi
                    rend="italic">straight line</hi> tending to the centre of the larger circle.
                    Therefore, if the generating circle above mentioned should be taken with its
                    diameter equal to the radius of the pinion, and be made to roll upon the concave
                    superficies <hi rend="italic">adh</hi> of the pinion, it will generate a
                    straight line tending to the pinion’s centre, which will be the form of the
                    faces of its leaves; and the teeth of the wheel will be exterior epicycloids,
                    formed by a generating circle whose diameter is equal to the radius of the
                    pinion, rolling upon the convex superficies <hi rend="italic">odρ</hi> of the
                    wheel. This rectilineal form of the teeth is exhibited in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205295" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5295-0421"/>fig. U9,and is perhaps the
                    most advantageous, as it requires less trouble, and may be executed with greater
                    accuracy, than if the epicyeloidal form had been employed, though the teeth are
                    evidently weaker than those in fig. 118. It is recommended both by De la Hire
                    and Camus as particularly advantageous in clock and watch work.</p>
                <p>The attentive reader will perceive from fig. 118, that in order to prevent the
                    teeth of the wheel from acting upon the leaves of the pinion before they reach
                    the line of centres AB, and that one tooth of the wheel may not quit the leaf of
                    the pinion till the succeeding tooth begins to act upon the succeeding leaf,
                    there must be a certain proportion between the number of leaves in the pinion
                    and the number of teeth in the wheel, or between the radius of the pinion and
                    the radius of the wheel, when the distance of the leaves AB is given. But in
                    machinery the number of leaves’and teeth is always known from the velocity which
                    is required at the working point of the machine; it becomes therefore a matter
                    of great importance to determine with accuracy the relative radii of the wheel
                    and pinion.</p>
                <p>For this purpose, let A, fig. 119, be the pinion having the acting faces of its
                    leaves straight lines tending to the centre, and B the centre of the wheel. AB
                    will be the distance of their centres.</p>
                <p>Then, as the tooth C is supposed not to act upon the leaf <hi rend="italic"
                    >Am</hi> till it arrives at the line AB, it ought not to quit <hi rend="italic"
                    >Am</hi> till the following tooth F has reached the line AB. But since the tooth
                    always acts in the direction of a line drawn perpendicular to the face of the
                    leaf <hi rend="italic">Am</hi> from the point of contaet, the line CH, drawn at
                    right angles to the face of the leaf <hi rend="italic">Am,</hi> will determine
                    the extremity of the tooth CD, <hi rend="subscript"> -</hi> or the last part of
                    it which should act upon the leaf <hi rend="italic">Am,</hi> and will also mark
                    out CD for the depth of the tooth. Now, in order to find AH, HB, and CD, put <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> for the number of teeth in the wheel, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> for the number of leaves in the pinion, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> for the
                    distance of the pivots A and B, and let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be the radius
                    of the wheel, and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> that of the pinion. Then, since the
                    circumference of the wheel is to the circumference of the pinion as the number
                    of teeth in the one to the number of leaves in the other, and as the
                    circumferences of circles are proportional to their radii, we shall have <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">b = x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">: y</hi>; then, by composition (Euch V. 18), <hi rend="italic">a +
                    b</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">b =</hi><hi rend="italic">c:
                    y</hi> (c being equal to <hi rend="italic">χ + y∖</hi> and consequently the
                    radius of the pinion, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">cb</hi><hi rend="italic">y— -jr-</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> j</hi><hi rend="italic">S</hi> then, by inverting the first analogy,
                    we have <hi rend="italic">(Jν</hi> τ* <hi rend="italic">D</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >b∙.α = y :x,</hi> and consequently the radius of the wheel, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">ay</hi><hi rend="italic">x—~;</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi> being
                    now a known number.</p>
                <p>Now, in the triangle AHC, right-angled at C, the side All is known, and likewise
                    all the angles (HAC being equal <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> hθ side AC,
                    therefore, may be found by plain trigonometry. Then, in the triangle ACB, the Z
                    CAB, equal to HAC, is known, and also the sides AB, AC, which contain it; the
                    third side, therefore, viz. CB, may be determined; from which DB, equal to HB,
                    already found, being subtracted, there will remain CD for the depth of the
                    teeth. When the action is carried on after the line of centres, it often happens
                    that the teeth will not work in the hollows of the leaves. In order to prevent
                    this, the ZCBH must always be greater than half the ZHBP. The ZHBP is equal to
                    360 degrees, divided by the number of teeth in the wheel, and CBH is easily
                    found by plane trigonometry.</p>
                <p>If the teeth of wheels and the leaves of pinions be formed according to the
                    directions already given, they will act upon each other, not "only with uniform
                    force, but nearly without friction. The one tooth rolls upon the other, and
                    neither slides nor rubs to such a degree as to retard the wheels or wear their
                    teeth. But as it is impossible in practice to give that perfect curvature to the
                    faces of the teeth which theory requires, a quantity of friction will remain
                    after every precaution has been taken in the formation of the communicating
                    parts.</p>
                <p>2. The second mode of action is not so advantageous as that which we have been
                    considering, and should, if possible, always be avoided. It is represented in
                    fig. 120, where A is the centre of the pinion, B that of the wheel, and AB the
                    line of the centres. It is evident from the figure, that the tooth C of the
                    wheel acts upon the leaf D of the pinion before they arrive at the line BA; that
                    it quits the leaf when they reach this line, and have assumed the position of E
                    and F; and that the tooth C works deeper and deeper between the leaves of the
                    pinion, the nearer it comes to the line of centres.</p>
                <p>From this last circumstance a considerable quantity of friction arises, because
                    the tooth C does not, as before, roll upon the leaf D, but slides upon it; and
                    from the same cause the pinion soon becomes foul, as the dust which lies upon
                    the acting faces of the leaves is pushed into the interjacent hollows. One
                    advantage, however, attends this mode of action: it allows us to make the teeth
                    of the large wheel rectilineal, and thus renders the labour of the mechanic
                    less, and the accuracy of his work greater, than if they had been of a
                    curvilineal form. If the teeth C, E therefore of the wheel BC are made
                    rectilineal, having their surfaces directed to the wheel’s centre, the acting
                    faces of the leaves D, F, &amp;c. must be epicycloids formed by a generating
                    circle whose diameter is equal to the radius Bo of the circle <hi rend="italic"
                    >op,</hi> rolling upon the circumference <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> of the pinion
                    A. But if the teeth of the wheel and the leaves of the pinion are made
                    curvilineal as in the figure, the faces of the teeth of the wheel must be
                    portions of an interior epicycloid formed by any generating circle rolling
                    within the concave superficies of the circle <hi rend="italic">op,</hi> and the
                    faces of the pinion’s leaves must be portions of an exterior epicycloid produced
                    by rolling the same generating circle upon the convex circumference <hi
                    rend="italic">mn</hi> of the pinion.</p>
                <p>3. The third mode of action, which is represented in fig. 121, is a combination
                    of the first two modes, and consequently partakes of the advantages and
                    disadvantages of each. It is evident from the figure that the portion <hi
                    rend="italic">eh</hi> of the tooth acts upon the part <hi rend="italic">bc</hi>
                    of the leaf till they reach the line of centres AB, and that the part <hi
                    rend="italic">ed</hi> of the tooth acts upon the portion <hi rend="italic"
                    >ba</hi> of the leaf after they have passed this line. Hence the acting parts
                    <hi rend="italic">eh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">be</hi> must be formed according
                    to the directions given for the first mode of action, and the remaining parts
                    <hi rend="italic">ed, ba,</hi> must have that curvature which the second mode of
                    action requires; consequently <hi rend="italic">eh</hi> should be part of an
                    interior epicycloid formed by any generating circle rolling on the concave
                    circumference <hi rend="italic">rnn</hi> of the wheel, and the corresponding
                    part <hi rend="italic">bc</hi> of the leaf should be part of an exterior
                    epieyeloid formed by the same generating circle rolling upon Z&gt;Eo, the convex
                    circumference of the pinion; the remaining part <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> of the
                    tooth should be a portion of an exterior epieveloid, engendered by any
                    generating circle rolling upon <hi rend="italic">eL,</hi> the concave
                    superficies of the wheel; and the corresponding part <hi rend="italic">ba</hi>
                    of the leaf should be part of an interior epicycloid described by the same
                    generating circle, rolling along the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205308"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5308-0422"/>concave side 6Eo of the pinion. As it would be
                    extremely troublesome, however, to give this double curvature to the acting
                    faces of the teeth, it will be proper to use a generating circle, whose diameter
                    is equal to the radius of the wheel BC, for describing the interior epicycloid

                    found, the triangle EAB, or IAB, which is almost equal to it, is known, because
                    AB is given, and likewise Al, which is equal to the cosine of the angle IAB, AC
                    being radius, and AIC being a right angle, consequently IB the radius of the
                    wheel may be found by trigonometry. It was formerly shown that AC, the radius of
                    what is called the primitive <hi rend="italic">cb</hi> pinion, was equal to ~-,,
                    and that BC the radius of the <hi rend="italic">CL</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    rend="superscript"> a</hi>. If then we subtract AC or AS from AP, we shall have
                    the quantity SP, which must be added to the radius of the primitive pinion; and
                    if we take the difference of BC (or BL) and DE, the quantity LE will be found,
                    which must be added to the radius of the primitive wheel. We have all along
                    supposed that the wheel drives the pinion, and have given the proper form of the
                    teeth upon this supposition. But when the pinion drives the wheel, the form
                    which was given to the teeth of the wheel in the first case must in this be
                    given to the leaves of the pinion; and the shape which was formerly given to the
                    leaves of the pinion must now be transferred to the teeth of the wheel.</p>
                <p>Another form for the teeth of wheels, different from any which we have mentioned,
                    has been recommended by Dr Robison. He shows that a perfect uniformity of action
                    may be secured, by making the acting faces of the teeth involutes of the wheel’s
                    circumference, which are nothing more than epicycloids, the centres of whose
                    generating circles are infinitely distant. Thus, in fig. 122, let AB be a
                    portion of the wheel on which the tooth is to be fixed, and let <hi
                    rend="italic">Αpa</hi> be a thread lapped round its circumference, havinga
                    loophole at its extremity <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> In this loop-hole fix the
                    pin <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and with it describe the curve or <hi
                    rend="italic">involute abcdch,</hi> by unlapping the thread gradually from the
                    circumference <hi rend="italic">Αpm.</hi> This curve will be the proper shape
                    for the teeth of a wheel whose diameter is AB. Dr Robison observes, that as this
                    form admits of several teeth to be acting at the same time (twice the number
                    that can be admitted in Μ. de la Hire’s method), the pressure is divided among
                    several teeth, and the quantity upon any one of them is so diminished, that
                    those dents and impressions which they unavoidably make upon each other are
                    partly prevented. He candidly allows, however, that the teeth thus formed are
                    not completely free from sliding and friction, though this slide is only ⅛th of
                    an inch when a tooth three inches long fixed on a wheel ten feet in diameter
                    drives another wheel whose diameter is two feet. (Append, to Ferguson’s <hi

                <p>Nothing can be of greater importance to the practical mechanic, than to have a
                    method of drawing epicycloids with facility and accuracy: the following, we
                    trust, is the most simple mechanical method that can be employed.—Take a piece
                    of plain wood GH, fig. 123, and fix upon it another piece of wood E, having its
                    circumference <hi rend="italic">mb</hi> of the same curvature as the circular
                    base upon which the generating circle AB is to roll. When the generating circle
                    is large, the segment B will be sufficient: in any part of the circumference of
                    this segment fix a sharp-pointed nail <hi rend="italic">α,</hi> sloping in such
                    a manner that the distance of its point from the centre of the circle may be
                    exactly equal to its radius; and fasten to the board GH a piece of thin brass,
                    or copper, or tin plate, <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> distinguished by the dotted
                    lines. Place the segment B in such a position that the point of the nail <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> may be upon the point <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and roll
                    the segment towards G, so that the nail <hi rend="italic">a</hi> may rise
                    gradually, and the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205321"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5321-0423"/>point of contact between the two circular segments
                    may advance towards <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the curve
                    <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> described upon the brass plate will be an accurate
                    exterior epieyeloid. In order to 'prevent the segments from sliding, their
                    peripheries should be rubbed with rosin or chalk, or a number of small iron
                    points may be fixed on the circumference of the generating segment. Remove, with
                    a file, the part of the brass on the left hand of the epicycloid, and the
                    remaining concave arch or gage <hi rend="italic">αb</hi> will be a pattern
                    tooth, by means of which all the rest may be easily formed. When an <hi
                    rend="italic">interior epicycloid</hi> is wanted, the concave side of its
                    circular base must be used. The method of describing it is represented in fig.
                    124, where CD is the generating circle, F the concave circular base, MN the
                    piece of wood on which this base is fixed, and <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> the
                    interior epicycloid formed upon the plate of brass by rolling the generating
                    circle C, or the [generating segment D, to wards the right hand. The <hi
                    rend="italic">cycloid,</hi> which is useful in forming the teeth of <hi
                    rend="italic">rack-work,</hi> is generated precisely in the same manner, with
                    this difference only, that the base on which the generating circle rolls must be
                    a straight line.</p>
                <p>In order that the teeth may not embarrass one another before their action
                    commences, and that one tooth may oegin to act upon its corresponding leaf of
                    the pinion before the preceding tooth has ceased to act upon the preceding leaf,
                    the height, breadth, and distance of the tecth :nust be properly proportioned.
                    For this purpose the pitch-line or circumference of the wheel, which is
                    represented in fig. 119 and 120, by the dotted arches, must be livided into as
                    many equal spaces as the number of teeth which the wheel is to carry. Divide
                    each of these spaces .nto 16 equal parts; allow 7 of these for the greatest
                    ιreadth of the teeth, and 9 for the distance between cach; ιr the distance of
                    the teeth may be made equal to their ιreadth. If the wheel drive a trundle, cach
                    space should ιe divided into 7 equal parts, and 3 of these allotted for ;he
                    thickness of the tooth, and 3⅛ for the diameter of the cylindrical stave of the
                    trundle. If cach of the spaces already mentioned, or if the distance between the
                    centres if each tooth, be divided into three equal parts, the height if the
                    teeth must be equal to two of these. These distances and heights, however, vary
                    according to the mode if action which is employed. The teeth should be round-id
                    off at the extremities, and the radius of the wheel made ι little larger than
                    that which is deduced from the rules n p. 421-22. But when the pinion drives the
                    wheel, a iinall addition should be made to the radius of the pinion.</p>
                <p>On <hi rend="italic">the Nature of Bevelled Wheels, and the Method of giving an
                    Epicycloidal Form to their Teeth.</hi></p>
                <p>The principle of bevelled wheels was pointed out by De a Hire, so long ago as the
                    end of the seventeenth century, t consists in one fluted or toothed cone acting
                    upon an-ιther, as is represented in' fig. 125, where the cone OD lrives the cone
                    OC, conveying its notion in the direction OC. If these ιones be cut parallel to
                    their bases, is at A and B, and if the two small unes between AB and 0 be remov-
                    :d, the remaining parts AC and BD nay be considered as two bevelled rheels, and
                    BD will act upon AC in he very same manner, and with the same effect, that the
                    vhole cone OD acted upon the whole cone OC. If the ection be made nearer the
                    bases of the cones, the same effect will be produced. This is the ease in fig.
                    126, wher <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> CD and DE are but very small portions
                    of the imaginary cones ACD and ADE.</p>
                <p>In order to convey motion in any given direction, and determine the relative size
                    and situation of the wheels for this purpose, let AB, fig. 127, be the axis of a
                    wheel, and CD the given direction in which it is required to convey the motion
                    by means of a wheel fixed upon the axis AB, and acting upon another wheel fixed
                    on the axis CD; and let us suppose that the axis CD must have four times the
                    velocity of AB, or must perform four revolutions while AB performs one. Then the
                    number of teeth in the wheel fixed upon AB must be four times greater than the
                    number of teeth in the wheel fixed upon CD, and their radii must have the same
                    proportion. Draw <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> parallel to CD at any convenient
                    distance, and draw <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> parallel to AB at four times that
                    distance, then the lines <hi rend="italic">im</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
                    drawn perpendicular to AB and CD respectively will mark the situation and size
                    of the wheels required. In this ease the cones are Om and <hi rend="italic"
                    >C)mi,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">srni, rpmi</hi> are the portions of them that
                    are employed.</p>
                <p>The formation of the teeth of bevelled wheels is more difficult than one would at
                    first imagine. The teeth of such wheels, indeed, must be formed by the same
                    rules which have been given for other wheels; but since different parts of the
                    same tooth are at different distances from the axis, these parts must have the
                    curvature of their acting surfaces proportioned to that distance. Thus, in fig.
                    127, the part of the tooth at <hi rend="italic">r</hi> must be more incurvated
                    than the part at <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> as is evident from the inspection of
                    fig. 126; and the epieyeloid for the part <hi rend="italic">i</hi> must be
                    formed by means of circles whose diameters are≡ and F£ while the epicycloid for
                    the part <hi rend="italic">r</hi> must be generated by circles whose diameters
                    are <hi rend="italic">Cn</hi> and D√.</p>
                <p>Let us suppose a plane to pass through the points 0, A, D; the lines AB, AO will
                    evidently be in this plane, which may be called the <hi rend="italic">plane of
                    centres.</hi> Now, when the teeth of the wheel DE, which is supposed to drive CD
                    the smallest of the two, commence their action on the teeth of CD when they
                    arrive at the plane of centres, and continue their action after they have passed
                    this plane, the curve given to the teeth CD at C, should be a portion of an
                    interior epicycloid formed by any generating circle rolling on the concave
                    superficies of a circle whose diameter is twice C« perpendicular to CA, and the
                    curvature of the teeth at <hi rend="italic">i</hi> should be part of a similar
                    epicycloid formed upon a circle whose diameter is twice <hi rend="italic"
                    >im.</hi> The curvature of the teeth of the wheel DE, at D, should be part of an
                    exterior epicycloid formed by the same generating circle rolling upon the
                    concave circumference of a circle whose diameter is twice D&lt;√ perpendicular
                    to DA; and the epicycloid for the teeth at F is formed in the same way, only,

                    >Vf.</hi> When any other mode of action is adopted, the teeth are to be formed
                    in the same manner that we have pointed out for common wheels, with this
                    difference only, that different epicyeloids are necessary for the parts F and D.
                    It may be sufficient, however, to find the form of the teeth at F, as the
                    remaining part of the tooth may be shaped by directing a straight ruler from
                    different points of the epicycloid at F to the centre A, and filing the tooth
                    till every <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205334" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5334-0424"
                    />part of its acting surface coincide with the side of the ruler. The reason of
                    this operation will be obvious by attending to the shape of the tooth in fig.
                    125. When the small wheel CD impels the large one DÈ, the epicycloids which were
                    formerly given to CD must be given to DE, and those which were given to DE must
                    be transferred to CD.</p>
                <p>The wheel represented in fig. 128 is sometimes called a crown wheel, though it is
                    evident from the figure that it belongs to that species of wheels which we have
                    just been considering; for the acting surfaces of the teeth both of the wheel MB
                    and of the pinion EDG are directed to C the common vertex of the two cones CMB,
                    CEG. In this case the rules for bevelled wheels must be adopted, in which AS is
                    to be considered as the radius of the wheel for the profile of the tooth at A,
                    and MN as its radius for the profile of the tooth at Μ; and the epicycloids thus
                    formed will be the sections or profiles of the teeth in the direction MP, at
                    right angles to MC the surfaces of the cone. When the vertex C of the cone MCG
                    approaches to N till it be in the same place with the points Μ, G, some of the
                    curves will be cycloids and others involutes, as in the case of rack-work, for
                    then the cone CEG will revolve upon a plane surface. (Appendix to Ferguson’s <hi

                <p>In fig. 129 let AB be the wheel which is employed to elevate the rack C, and let
                    their mutual action not commence till the acting teeth have reached the line of
                    centres AC. In this case C becomes as it were the pinion or wheel driven, and

                <p>Fig. 129 likewise represents a wheel depressing the rack C ’ when the third mode
                    of action is used. In this case also C' becomes the pinion, and DE the wheel;
                    <hi rend="italic">eh</hi> therefore must be part of an interior epicycloid
                    formed by any generating circle rolling on the concave side <hi rend="italic"

                    epicycloid produced by the same generating circle rolling upon the circumference
                    of the rack. The remaining part <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> of the teeth of the
                    wheel must be an exterior epicycloid described by any generating circle moving
                    upon the convex side <hi rend="italic">ex,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ba</hi>
                    must be an interior epicycloid engendered by the same generating circle rolling
                    within the circumference of the rack. But as the circumference of the rack is in
                    this case a straight line, the exterior epicycloid <hi rend="italic">bc</hi> and
                    the interior one <hi rend="italic">ba</hi> will be cycloids formed by the same
                    generating circles which are employed in describing the other epicycloids. Since
                    it would be difficult, however, as has already been remarked, to give this
                    compound curvature to the teeth of the wheel and rack, we may use a generating
                    circle whose diameter is equal to Da; the radius of the wheel, for describing
                    the interior epicycloid <hi rend="italic">eh,</hi> and the exterior one <hi
                    rend="italic">bc</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and a generating circle whose
                    diameter is equal to the radius of the rack, for describing the interior
                    epicycloid <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> and the exterior one <hi rend="italic"

                    be a cycloid and <hi rend="italic">de</hi> an involute of the circle <hi
                    rend="italic">ex,</hi> the radius of the wheel being infinitely great.</p>
                <p>In the same manner may the form of the teeth of rackwork be determined when the
                    second mode of action is employed, and when the teeth of the wheel or rack are
                    circular or rectilineal. But if the rack be part of a circle, it must have the
                    same form for its teeth as that of a wheel of the same diameter with the circle
                    of which it is a part.</p>
                <p>In machinery, where large weights are to be raised, such as fulling-mills, mills
                    for pounding ore, &amp;c. or where large pistons are to be elevated by the arms
                    of levers, it is of the greatest consequence that the power should raise the
                    weight with an uniform force and velocity; and this can be effected only by
                    giving a proper form to the wiper.</p>
                <p>Now there are two cases in which this uniformity of motion may be required, and
                    each of these demands a different form for the communicating parts: 1. When the
                    weight is to be raised vertically, as the piston of a pump, &amp;c.; 2. when the
                    weight to be raised or depressed moves upon a centre, and rises or falls in the
                    arch of a circle, such as the sledge-hammer in a forge, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>1. Let AH be a wheel moved by any power which is sufficient to raise the weight
                    MN by its extremity 0, from 0 to <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> in the same time that
                    the wheel moves round one fourth of its circumference; it is required to fix
                    upon its rim a wing OBCDEH, which shall produce this effect with an uniform
                    effort. Divide the quadrant OH into any number of equal parts <hi rend="italic"
                    >Om, mn, &amp;c.</hi> the more the better, and <hi rend="italic">0e</hi> into
                    the same number <hi rend="italic">Ob, be, cd,</hi> &amp;c.; and through the
                    points <hi rend="italic">m, n, p,</hi> H draw the indefinite lines AB, AC, AD,
                    AE, and make AB equal to Aδ, AC to Ac, AD to <hi rend="italic">Ad,</hi> and AE
                    to Ac; then through the points O, B, C, D, E, draw the curve OBCDE, which is a
                    portion of the spiral of Archimedes, and will be the proper form for the wiper
                    or wing OHE. It is evident, that when the point <hi rend="italic">m</hi> has
                    arrived at 0, the extremity of the weight will have arrived at <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> because AB is equal to <hi rend="italic">Ab;</hi> and, for the same
                    reason, when the points <hi rend="italic">n, p,</hi> H have successively arrived
                    at 0, the extremity of the weight will have arrived at the corresponding points
                    <hi rend="italic">c, d, e.</hi> The motion, therefore, will be uniform, because
                    the space described by the weight is proportional to the space described by the
                    moving power, <hi rend="italic">Ob</hi> being to Oc as <hi rend="italic">0m</hi>
                    to <hi rend="italic">On.</hi> If it be required to raise the weight MN with an
                    accelerated or retarded motion, we have only to divide the line OE according to
                    the law of acceleration or retardation, and divide the curve OBCDE as
                    before.</p>
                <p>2. When the lever moves upon a centre, the weight will rise in the arch of a
                    circle, and consequently a new form must be given to the wipers or wings. Let
                    AB, fig. 131, be a lever lying horizontally, which it is required to raise
                    uniformly through the arch BC into the position AC, by means of the wheel BFH
                    furnished with the wing BNOP, which acts upon the extremity C of the lever; and
                    let it <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205347" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5347-0425"/>be
                    required to raise it through BC in the same time that the wheel BFH moves
                    through one half of its circumference; that is, while the point Μ moves to B in
                    the direction MFB. Divide the chord CB into any number of equal parts, the more
                    the better, in the points 1, 2, 3, and draw the lines <hi rend="italic">la 2b,
                    3c,</hi> parallel to AB, or a horizontal line passing through the point B, and
                    meeting the arch CB in the points <hi rend="italic">a, b,c.</hi> Draw the
                    lines-CD, αD, 6D, cD, and BD, cutting the circle BFH in the points <hi
                    rend="italic">m, n, o, p.</hi></p>
                <p>Having drawn the diameter BM, divide the semicircle BFM into as many equal parts
                    as the chord CB, in the points <hi rend="italic">q, s, u∙</hi> Take Braz, and
                    set it from <hi rend="italic">q</hi> to <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> take Bn and set it from s to <hi rend="italic">t;</hi> take
                    Bo and set it from <hi rend="italic">u</hi> to <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and, lastly, set <hi rend="italic">Bp</hi> from Μ to E.
                    Through the points <hi rend="italic">r, t, v,</hi> E, draw the indefinite lines
                    DN, DO, DP, DQ, and make DN equal to De, DO equal to <hi rend="italic">Ðb,</hi>
                    DP equal to Dα, and DQ equal to DC. Then through the points Q, P, O, N, B, draw
                    the spiral BNOPQ, which will be the proper form for the wing of the wheel when
                    it moves in the direction EMB.</p>
                <p>That the spiral BNO will raise the lever AC, with an uniform motion, by acting
                    upon its extremity c, will appear from the slightest attention to the
                    construction of the figure. It is evident, that when the point <hi rend="italic"
                    >q</hi> arrives at B, the point r will be in rn, because <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brn</hi> is equal to <hi rend="italic">qr,</hi> and the point N will be at <hi
                    rend="italic">c,</hi> because DN is equal to De; the extremity of the lever
                    therefore will be found in the point <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> having moved
                    through Be. In like manner, when the point <hi rend="italic">s</hi> has arrived
                    at B, the point <hi rend="italic">t</hi> will be at <hi rend="italic">n,</hi>
                    and the point 0 in <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> where the extremity of the lever
                    will now be found; and so on with the rest, till the point Μ has arrived at B.
                    The point E will then be in <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and the point Q in C; so
                    that the lever will now have the position AC, having moved through the equal
                    heights Be, <hi rend="italic">cb, ba, ac,</hi> ’ in the same time that the powèr
                    has moved through the equal spaces yB, <hi rend="italic">sq, us,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mzí.</hi> The lever therefore has been raised uniformly, the
                    ratio between the velocity of the power and that of the weight remaining always
                    the same.</p>
                <p>If the wheel D turn in a contrary direction, according to the letters MHB, we
                    must divide the semicircle BHEM, into as many equal parts as the chord cB, viz.
                    in the points <hi rend="italic">e, y, h.</hi> Then, having set the arch Brra
                    from <hi rend="italic">e</hi> to <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the arch Bra from <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">tof</hi> and the rest in a similar manner,
                    draw, through the points <hi rend="italic">d, ,</hi><hi rend="italic">h,</hi> E,
                    the indefinite lines DR, DS, DT, DQ: make DR equal to De, DS equal to Dó, DT
                    equal to Dα, and DQ equal to DC; and through the points B, R, S, T, Q, describe
                    the spiral BRSTQ, which will be the proper form for the wing when the wheel
                    turns in the direction MEB. For, when the point <hi rend="italic">e</hi> arrives
                    at B, the point <hi rend="italic">d</hi> will be in <hi rend="italic">m,</hi>
                    and R in <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> where the extremity of the lever will now be
                    found, having moved through Be in the same time that the power or wheel has
                    moved through the division eB. In the same manner it may be shown, that the
                    lever will rise through the equal heights <hi rend="italic">eb, ba, aC,</hi> in
                    the same time that the power moves through the corre sponding spaces <hi
                    rend="italic">eg, gi,</hi> z’M. The motion of the lever, therefore, and also
                    that of the power, are always uniform. Of all the positions that can be given to
                    the point B, the most disadvantageous are those which are nearest the points F,
                    H; and the most advantageous position is when the chord Be is vertical, and
                    passes, when prolonged, through D, the centre of the circle. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> In this particular case, the two curves have equal
                    bases, though they differ a little in point of curvature. The farther that the
                    centre A is distant, the nearer do these curves resemble each other; and if it
                    were infinitely distant, they would be exactly similar, and would be the spirals
                    of Archimedes, as the extremity <hi rend="italic">c</hi> would in this case rise
                    perpendicularly.</p>
                <p>It will be easily perceived that four, six, or eight wings may be placed upon the
                    circumference of the circle, and may be formed by dividing into the same number
                    of equal parts as the chord BC, ½th, ½th, or ½th of the circumference, instead
                    of the semicircle BFM.</p>
                <p>That the wing BNO may not act upon any part of the lever between A and C, the arm
                    AC should be bent; and that the friction may be diminished as much as possible,
                    a roller should be fixed upon its extremity C. When a roller is used, however, a
                    curve must always be drawn parallel to the spiral described according to the
                    preceding method, the distance between it and the spiral being everywhere equal
                    to the radius of the roller.</p>
                <p>• If it should be required to raise the lever with an accelerated or retarded
                    motion, we have only to divide the chord BC, according to the degree of
                    retardation or acceleration required, and the circle into the same number of
                    equal parts as before.</p>
                <p>As it is frequently more convenient to raise or depress weights by the extremity
                    of a constant radius, furnished with a roller, instead of wings fixed upon the
                    periphery of a wheel, we shall now proceed to determine the curve which must be
                    given to the arm of the lever which is to be raised and depressed, in order that
                    this elevation or depression may be effected with an uniform motion.</p>
                <p>Let AB, fig. 132, be a lever, which it is required to raise uniformly through the
                    arch BC, into the position AC, by means of the arm or constant radius DE, moving
                    upon D as a centre, in the same time that the extremity E describes the arch

                <p>It is evident, that when the extremity E of the handle DE has run through the

                <p>The powers which are generally employed as the first movers of machines are,
                    water, wind, steam, and animal exertion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The elastic power of heated air has been ingeniously
                    employed as the first mover of machines by the Reverend Mr Stirling; and the
                    still more intense power of liquefied carbonic acid has been tried, though
                    unsuccessfully, by Mr Brunel; but our limits will not allow us to give any
                    description of the mechanism by which these powers are applied. (See page 436,
                    column second.)</p></note> The mode of employing water as an impelling power has

                <p>According to Amontons, a man weighing 133 pounds French ascended sixty-two feet
                    French, by steps, in thirty-four seconds, but was completely exhausted. The same
                    author informs us that a sawer made 200 strokes of eighteen inches French each,
                    with a force of twenty-five pounds, in 145 seconds; but that he could not have
                    continued the exertion above three minutes.</p>
                <p>It appears from the observations of Desaguliers, that an ordinary man can, for
                    the space of ten hours, turn a winch with a force of thirty pounds, and with a
                    velocity of two feet and a half per second; and that two men working at a
                    windlass with handles at right angles to each other can raise seventy pounds
                    more easily than one man can raise thirty. The reason of this is, that when
                    there is only one man, he exerts variable efforts at different positions of the
                    handle, and therefore the motion of the windlass is irregular; whereas, in the
                    case of two men, with handles at right angles, the effect of the one man is
                    greatest when the effect of the other is least, and therefore the motion of the
                    machine is more uniform, and will perform more work. Desaguliers also found,
                    that a man may exert a force of eighty pounds with a fly when the motion is
                    pretty quick; and that, by means of a good common pump, he may raise a hogshead
                    of water ten feet high in a minute, and continue the exertion during a whole
                    day.</p>
                <p>According to Dr Robison, a feeble old man raised seven cubic feet of water, =
                    437∙5 pounds avoirdupois, 11½ feet high, in one minute, for eight or ten hours a
                    day, by walking backwards and forwards on a lever; and a young man weighing 135
                    pounds, and carrying thirty pounds, raised θ½ cubic feet of water, = 578T pounds
                    avoirdupois, 11½ feet high, for ten hours a day, without being fatigued.</p>
                <p>From the experiments of Mr Buchanan, it appears that the forces exerted by a man
                    pumping, acting at a winch, ringing, and rowing, are as the numbers 1742,
                    2856,3883, and 4095.</p>
                <p>The most interesting experiments on the strength of men were made by Μ. Coulomb;
                    and as they are highly valuable, we shall endeavour to give a condensed account
                    of them.</p>
                <p>1. His first object was to ascertain the quantiy tof action which a man furnished
                    while ascending a stair unloaded.</p>
                <p>A man whose weight may be taken at seventy kilogrammes ascended the stairs of a
                    dwelling-house at the rate of fourteen metres, provided he did not ascend more
                    than twenty or thirty metres. His quantity of action is therefore 980 <hi
                    rend="italic">kilogrammes raised one metre in one minute;</hi> and if he
                    continue at the work four hours, it will be 235,200 <hi rend="italic"
                    >kilogrammes raised one metre in four hours.</hi></p>
                <p>The party of sailors who accompanied the Clιevalier Borda to the top of the Peak
                    of Teneriffe ascended 2923 metres in 7⅛ hours. Hence their quantity of action in
                    a day was 204,610 <hi rend="italic">kilogrammes raised one metre in</hi> 7f <hi
                    rend="italic">hours.</hi></p>
                <p>Coulomb therefore considers 205 <hi rend="italic">kilogrammes raised one
                    kilometre</hi> as the quantity of action furnished by a man ascending a
                    stair.</p>
                <p>2. When a man, loaded with firewood, ascended a stair, his quantity of action was
                    109 <hi rend="italic">kilogrammes raised one kilometre.</hi> Another man of
                    unusual strength furnished 129 <hi rend="italic">kilogrammes through one
                    kilometre;</hi> but he had overexerted himself.</p>
                <p>But even taking this extreme result, it follows <hi rend="italic">that the
                    quantity of action of a man unloaded is to that when he is loaded as</hi> 205
                    <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 129, <hi rend="italic">or as</hi> 16 <hi rend="italic"
                    >to</hi> 10.</p>
                <p>3. In order to determine the load which a man ought to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205373" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5373-0427"/>carry in order to produce a
                    maximum <hi rend="italic">useful effect,</hi> Coulomb remarks, that the only
                    useful effect furnished by a man when loaded is the conveyance of the load. If
                    his load was nothing, his actual quantity of action would be a maximum, but the
                    useful effect would be nothing; and in like manner, if his load was 150
                    kilogrammes, he could scarcely move it, and the useful effect would also be
                    nothing. Between 0 and 150 kilogrammes there will be some load by which the
                    useful effect will be a maximum. Now, since a man unloaded raised 205
                    kilogrammes through one kilometre in a day, while a man loaded with 68
                    kilogrammes raised only 109 kilogrammes through one kilometre, it follows that
                    68 kilogrammes diminished his quantity of daily work 205 — 109 = 96 kilogrammes
                    through one kilometre.</p>
                <p>Let us now, as Coulomb has done, suppose the quantities of action lost
                    proportional to the loads; then, calling P the load, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >q</hi> the quantity of action lost, we shall have P: <hi rend="italic"
                    >q</hi></p>
                <p>96</p>
                <p>= 68:96, and <hi rend="italic">q</hi> = P — = 1∙41 P, or 1∙41 kilometres

                    measure of the useful effect of a man when carrying a load up a stair.</p>
                <p>Hence this mode of employing the strength of a man consumes nearly ¾ths of his
                    real action, his useful effect being only 56, while his total effect is 205;
                    and, therefore, the expense of employing him will <hi rend="italic">⅛efowr</hi>
                    times more than that of a man who, having ascended the stair unloaded, raises a
                    weight (by his own descent by gravity) through the height to which he
                    ascended.</p>
                <p>If we suppose the man to be so loaded as to perform no (work, a case which
                    happens when he bears the greatest weight he can carry, then 205— 1∙41 P = 0,
                    and P= 145 kilogrammes, which is the weight which an ordinary man can barely
                    carry.</p>
                <p>Hence, the formulae of Coulomb above given correspond to the maximum of the total
                    action of a man ascending a stair unloaded, to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >minimum</hi> of action when he is loaded with a weight which he can barely

                <p>4. Sir David Brewster has greatly simplified the formulae given by Coulomb, by
                    considering, what Coulomb found to be nearly the case, that the quantity of
                    useful effect is only jd of the total quantity of action, and making 1∙41 = 1½,

                    when P = W (√3— 1) = 0∙732 W.</p>
                <p>When P = 2W, we obtain 3W — 1½ P = 0, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> 0; from which it follows, that when P or the load is equal
                    to 2W, or twice the weight of the man, or = 2 × 70 = 140 kilogrammes, he loses
                    the power of ascending.</p>
                <p>When P = W, or when the load is equal to the weight of the man, the mean quantity
                    of action will be reduced one half. This agrees with the observation made by
                    Coulomb, that the reduction of action was in this case from 205 to 96 when the
                    load was 68, the value of <hi rend="italic">w</hi> being 70 kilogrammes.</p>
                <p>5. The next case discussed by Coulomb is that of a man walking along a horizontal
                    road either unloaded or loaded.</p>
                <p>A man walking <hi rend="italic">unloaded</hi> for several days in succession can
                    accomplish easily 50 kilometres in a day, which gives a quantity of action equal
                    to 3500 <hi rend="italic">kilogrammes carried</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic"
                    >kilometre.</hi></p>
                <p>Porters <hi rend="italic">loaded</hi> with 58 kilogrammes of furniture had a
                    quantity of action of 2048 <hi rend="italic">kilogrammes carried</hi> 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">kilometre.</hi> Hence the quantity of action in these two cases,
                    <hi rend="italic">without</hi> and <hi rend="italic">with</hi> a load of 58
                    kilogrammes, is as 7 to 4.</p>
                <p>When the load was 44 kilogrammes, the quantity of action was 2166 kilogrammes
                    carried 1 kilometre.</p>
                <p>When the load is 58 kilogrammes, Coulomb assumes as the best measure of the
                    quantity of action 2000 <hi rend="italic">kilogrammes carried</hi> 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">kilometre.</hi></p>
                <p>But the quantity of action <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> in carrying a load is 3500
                    — 2000 = 1500 <hi rend="italic">kilogrammes carried</hi> I <hi rend="italic"
                    >kilometre ∙</hi> and assuming as before that the losses <hi rend="italic"
                    >q</hi> are proportional to the loads P, we shall have 58: P = 1500: <hi
                    rend="italic">q,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q</hi> = P 1500</p>
                <p>-jrğ- = 25∙86 P, and the real quantity of action will be</p>
                <p>3500 — 25∙86 P; and making this equal to 0, we have P = 135∙4 kilogrammes, which
                    coincides nearly with 140, the result of our simplified formula, as the greatest
                    load which a man can carry.</p>
                <p>Hence Coulomb obtains his general formula in the following manner :—</p>
                <p>Calling <hi rend="italic">d</hi> the distance through which a man can carry the
                    load P, and W the weight of the man, we have (P + W)tZ for his quantity of
                    action. Hence we obtain (P + W)√ = 3500 - 25∙8β P, and P&lt;∕ = &lt;≡=∞¾ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0r</hi>,</p>
                <p>1 + W</p>
                <p>making 3500 = <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> 25∙86 = <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> we have
                    <hi rend="italic">Pd =</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> which becomes a maximum when
                    P=W (*∕1 —1) ’ or P = 0∙72 W.</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster has simplified these formulae, and reduced them to the very
                    same as those formerly given, by considering that 3500 = 50 × 70, that is, <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> = 50 W, and by making the co-efficient of P 25 instead of
                    25*86. By <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> V ∙ . 1 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>

                <p>P + W</p>
                <p>= W(v ʹ 3— 1) = 0∙732 W, the very same result as when the man ascended
                    stairs.</p>
                <p>When P = 2W, then 50 W — 25 P = 0, and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> = 0; which shows
                    that when the load is equal to twice the weight of the man, he can no longer
                    carry it through any distance. The following is a comparison of these results
                    with one another and with those of Coulomb:</p>

                <p>The preceding formulae have likewise been simplified by Sir David Brewster, by
                    considering that WD = 50 W, that D = 50, and by taking <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 25 in place of 25∙86, so that <hi rend="italic"

                <p>which becomes a maximum when P = 280 (√l½ — 1). Hence</p>
                <p>P = 62∙928 kilogrammes, or = 0∙8989 W; a load very nearly equal to that which
                    porters are in the practice of carrying under similar circumstances.</p>
                <p>If we substitute different values ofP in Coulomb’s formulae from 58 to 65, we
                    shall find that P&lt;r, the maximum of useful effect, varies from 690 to 691,
                    which shows that a variation of several kilogrammes in the load occasions a very
                    trifling change in the useful, effect.</p>
                <p>From a comparison of the preceding results, it follows that the quantity of
                    action of a man travelling unloaded is to that when he travels loaded, under the
                    circumstances of the present case, as 505 to 100, or as 5 to 1 nearly.</p>
                <p>Coulomb has made a very interesting comparison of the quantity of fatigue
                    undergone by a man ascending a stair and travelling along a horizontal road. The
                    quantity of action in these two cases has been shown to be as 205 to 3500, or 1
                    to 17. Now, the ordinary height of a step is about 135 millimetres, or 5∣
                    English inches, and its width thrice as great, or about 16½ English inches.
                    Hence 17 × 135 = 2295 millimetres, is the length of a horizontal road on which
                    the man can walk with the same fatigue as in ascending 135 millimetres. But the
                    force of a man is 650 millimetres, or twenty-six inches, consequently the man
                    experiences the same fatigue in ascending 135 millimetres (5£ inches) as in

                <p>Among the various ways of applying the strength of men to produce great
                    mechanical effects, the following method of weighing anchors, used by the
                    natives of the coast of Coromandel, is extremely interesting and instructive. It
                    was communicated to the writer of this article many years ago, by a celebrated
                    naval officer, who himself witnessed the process of raising the anchor of his
                    majesty’s ship Minden, in September 1814.</p>
                <p>The natives, who had been permitted by Sir Samuel Hood to show their method of
                    weighing anchors, formed a raft about three or four feet in diameter, by lashing
                    together, in the form of a rude cylinder, a number of spars, such as top-masts,
                    jib-booms, &amp;c. The buoy-rope of the anchor was wound round the middle of
                    this, and made fast. Thirty small ropes having been fixed to the raft, were
                    coiled round it several times in an opposite way to the buoy rope, so as to form
                    “slew-ropes,” or turning ropes. Sixty natives then got upon the spar, and pulled
                    by the ropes so as to turn the raft of spars round. The buoyrope soon became
                    tight, and any farther rotation of the spar was prevented. The natives now held
                    the slew-ropes tight and firm in both hands, and, standing erect and in a line
                    on the top of the spar, the whole sixty, at the word of command, threw
                    themselves suddenly backwards, so that they all fell flat on the surface of the
                    water at the same instant. By this act the raft of spars turned round one
                    quarter of a circle from the vertical to the horizontal position of the men.
                    This operation did not, of course, start the anchor, but it tightened the
                    buoy-rope to such a degree as to require considerable force to prevent the raft
                    from turning back again. The next turn was made by alternate pairs of the men
                    keeping their horizontal position on the water, while the intermediate pairs
                    climbed up by means of their slew-ropes to the top of the raft. When there, they
                    again tightened their ropes, threw themselves on their backs as before, and then
                    turned the raft another quarter of a circle, the other men “taking in the
                    slack,” or tightening their slew-ropes, during the operation. The same operation
                    was repeated by the other half of the party, till the anchor was fairly lifted
                    off the ground. All the natives then continued stretched on the water till the
                    boats towed the raft and the anchor into deep water, when it was hove in the
                    usual way. The anchor was three tons in weight.</p>
                <p>When the anchor is lifted off the ground the raft has a tendency to turn back
                    again. This actually took place, in consequence of some of the natives getting
                    tired and letting go their hold; and the rest not being able to overcome the
                    additional load thus suddenly thrown upon them, the anchor sunk to the bottom,
                    and gave such a rapid whirl to the raft, that some of the natives were actually
                    carried round along withit. This might be prevented, as our correspondent
                    suggests, by having <hi rend="italic">two</hi> buoy-ropes in place of one, and
                    coiling them round the raft in <hi rend="italic">opposite directions,</hi> the
                    rope that slackens or uncoils itself by each quarter turn of the raft being
                    again tightened. This too would allow the whole strength of the party, in place
                    of half of it, to be employed in the operation. A water windlass, to be worked
                    by men in boats, might, as the narrator suggests, be contrived so as to be used
                    when amphibious workmen, such as those of the coast of Coromandel, cannot be

                <p>In the above process the cylindrical raft is the axle, the men the handspikes,
                    and their weight the moving power. The less the diameter of the spar round which
                    the rope coils, the greater is the power'; and, the greater the diameter of the
                    part upon which the men stand, the larger is the lever by which they act. The
                    raft should therefore be constructed to give this advantage; and there might be
                    two cylinders of different diameters for the two buoyropes, upon the principle
                    of the wheel and axle, shown in fig <hi rend="subscript">;</hi> 27.</p>

                    the same kind of work by troops; and I am assured that under the 14th degree of

                <p>Very few accurate observations have been made on the quantity of work done by
                    different quadrupeds, and it would therefore be desirable if the subject were

                <p>The comparative strength of horses and men has been variously given by different
                    authors, and the discrepancy is so great as to render more necessary the
                    experimental inquiry which we have above recommended. The following table will
                    justify this observation:</p>
                <p>One horse is equal to 14 men. Schulze.</p>
                <p>One horse is equal to 7 men. Bossut.</p>

                <p>The following results have been given by Desaguliers.</p>
                <p>One horse can draw 200 pounds two and a half miles per hour for eight hours a
                    day. If the load is 240 pounds, he can work only six hours.</p>
                <p>One horse can draw from 450 to 750 pounds up a steep hill, which is more than <hi

                <p>One powerful horse can draw 2000 pounds up a short and steep hill.</p>
                <p>One horse has been known to carry 650 or 700 pounds for seven or eight miles
                    without a rest, and to continue this as its ordinary work.</p>
                <p>One horse carried 1232 pounds, or eleven hundredweight, of iron, for eight
                    miles.</p>
                <p>In these, as well as in the following results taken from different authors,
                    nothing is said of the nature of the road, which is an essential element in the
                    consideration of this subject.</p>
                <p>Two horses, according to Amon tons, when ploughing, can exert a force of 150
                    pounds, or seventy-five pounds each.</p>
                <p>One horse, according to Smeaton, can raise 250 hogsheads of water in an hour by
                    means of pumps.</p>
                <p>One horse, according to Mr Fenwick, can raise 1000 pounds avoirdupois thirteen
                    feet per minute for twelve hours, the horse moving about two miles an hour, by
                    means of a wheel and axle.</p>
                <p>One horse, according to Mr Fenwick, can exert a force of seventy-five pounds,
                    moving thirteen feet per minute, and for nine and a half hours.</p>
                <p>Four horses, according to Regnier, had a mean draught of thirty-six myriogrammes
                    in 794 hours.</p>
                <p>One <hi rend="italic">mule,</hi> according to Cazand, can, in the West Indies,
                    exert a force of 150 pounds, walking three feet in a second, and working two
                    hours out of about eighteen.</p>
                <p>One horse is supposed to be able to drive 1000 spindles with preparation of

                <p><hi rend="italic">Methods of applying the Power of Men and Horses to drive
                    Machinery.</hi></p>
                <p>The methods of applying the power of men and horses to drive ordinary machines is
                    so familiar to every person, that it Would be unprofitable to give any
                    particular description of it. Nothing is more familiar to us than a man working
                    at a pump, either by a lever or by a winch turning an axle, or driving round a
                    vertical axis by a lever, and continually walking in a circle. The application
                    of one or more horses to a thrashing-mill, where the horses walk round in a
                    circle, yoked to the extremities of levers which drive a vertical axis, is
                    equally familiar. There are some methods, however, of applying animal power,
                    which, though now little used, are historically interesting, and may in some
                    cases be still resorted to with advantage.</p>
                <p>The simplest of these is the <hi rend="italic">tread-mill</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">tread-wheel,</hi> which has within the last twenty years become
                    common in our jails and bridewells, as an instrument of punishment as well as of
                    useful labour. It is shown in the annexed figure, where one or more men are seen
                    climbing as it were up steps on the circumference of a large wheel, whose axis
                    is thus put in motion. The men hold by a fixed rail, and as their weight presses
                    down the step upon which they tread, they ascend the next step, and thus drive
                    the wheel. The muscular force used by the men re-acts principally on the
                    horizontal bar on which they rest, and therefore their weight is the principal
                    source of the moving force.</p>
                <p>Another method of applying the force of a man is shown in fig. 134, where the man
                    climbing on a rope employs both his weight and his muscular force in turning
                    round the pulleys round which the rope passes. The re-action of his muscular
                    force is certainly in this case borne by the machine, as Professor Moseley
                    remarks; but notwithstanding this, we cannot agree with him in the conclusion,
                    that it “appears to possess great advantages over the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tread-wheel,</hi> in the economy of force, space, and materials.” In the first
                    place, the weight of the man does not act vertically, and a considerable part of
                    it is injuriously employed in bending the rope and increasing the friction, by
                    pressing it against the rims of the pulley. The friction of two axles is also a
                    disadvantage, and even though the mechanical force of the man were greater
                    during a short time than on the tread-wheel, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205425"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5425-0431"/>∕e are quite convinced that his daily labour would
                    be less, rom his experiencing more fatigue in the one case than he other.</p>
                <p>A very excellent way of employing the power of a man, '; to make him ascend steps
                    on the inside of a large ver-cal wheel, a method which we saw in action not many
                    ears ago in London, where the force of the man was thus mployed to work a
                    crane.</p>
                <p>An ancient method of employing horses or oxen to ork a crane is shown in the
                    annexed figure, where the fimal constantly ascends the inclined plane of a wheel
                    laced obliquely to the horizon, and drives it by the action <hi
                    rend="superscript">?</hi> its feet against low steps of wood crossing its
                    path.</p>
                <p>Another method is shown in fig. 136,'where a horse tied a post has its hind feet
                    sting on low steps on the ιtside of a wheel, while fore feet rest upon a :ed
                    plank beside the post.</p>
                <p>this case, both the fight of the horse and the jscular force of its legs <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">í3</hi> combined in giving a tatory motion to the ιeel or
                    cylinder.</p>
                <p>It is a remarkable fact, at so recently as Novem-r 1830, Mr Bramley and
                    Lieutenant Parker took out a ; <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> tent for various
                    contrivances for applying the power of jpn and horses to impel carriages on
                    railways. Their first πn is to place a horse upon two tread-wheels or drivers,
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> ving raised edges or ribs on their circumferences,
                    against uch the fore and hind feet of the horse are intended to r ess when in
                    the act of stepping, in order to make the ιeels revolve by the weight of his
                    body, and by trains of )thed wheels to the running wheels of the carriage.</p>
                <p>ιe horse being harnessed to the sides of the frame in which íe wheels are
                    mounted, it is intended that he shall impel: 3 wheel also by his muscular
                    power.</p>
                <p>The next contrivance is more novel and. grotesque, and &lt; <hi rend="subscript">
                    l</hi> en if it had more merit than it has, we should be asham-I to see our
                    fellow-creatures lying prostrate on the ground I perform the functions of the
                    beasts that perish. In or- &lt;r to impel a railway carriage, a man is placed in
                    a ho-lontal position in the carriage, supported by his body 1 aring upon a rest.
                    His feet are connected to stirrups, i∣d his legs being put in motion, as in the
                    act of swim-rng, he communicates a reciprocating motion, which, by h
                    intervention of rods and cranks, turns the running ] ιeels. But while our
                    unfortunate friend is labouring with I feet, some occupation is found also for
                    his head, and he ι entrusted with the duty of directing with his hands the s
                    ering apparatus in front.</p>
                <p>A third plan of these gentlemen is to unite with the hois ontal man a
                    perpendicular one, who is to aid his neigh-lur by stepping upon treadles
                    connected by rods and cinks with the running wheels. Such contrivances might
                    sometimes be useful as supplementary ones, when the moving power fails; and the
                    passengers might in turn assist in driving the carriage to its destination.</p>
                <p>When horses are yoked in thrashing-mills, they generally pull with unequal force,
                    and too much work is done by those which are best disposed for their work. A
                    very ingenious contrivance for regulating the action of horses under these
                    circumstances, was invented by Mr Walter Samuel, blacksmith at Niddry, in
                    Linlithgowshire, and is now in actual use in many parts of Scotland. In the
                    annexed figure, it is represented as applied to <hi rend="italic">four</hi>
                    horses, but it may readily be applied to any other number. The figure is a plan
                    of the vertical axis AA of the thrashingmill, and the levers B, B, &amp;c. by
                    which that axis is driven, and supporting the great wheel which drives the
                    horizontal axis that enters the mill. Upon two frames C, C, fixed to A, and
                    supported on the arms B, B, are fixed two pulleyblocks with running sheaves,
                    which shift either inward to the axis or outward from it. Over these sheaves, at
                    the ends 12 and 13, passes an endless rope or chain DEDE, which also goes over
                    two sheaves E, F, to keep the rope or chain clear of the revolving axle A.</p>
                <p>Two ropes FF, FF, pass over the sheaves 11 and 14, and to each end of them is
                    fastened a block C with running sheaves, over which pass the double ropes GLK1
                    and G2, which the horses pull when driving the machine, the ropes for each horse
                    being fastened to hooks 1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6; 7, 8; after passing through running
                    sheaves in the limbers H, I; K, L; Μ, N; and O, P.</p>
                <p>By this mechanism, any tendency of the horses to pull inwards or outwards is
                    corrected, and the strain of the draught presses fairly on their shoulders; an
                    advantage which, in the ordinary way of yoking horses, cannot be obtained
                    without a particular contrivance.</p>
                <p>As all the horses, when yoked, are now connected together, it will be seen, that
                    when any one horse relaxes from his labour, the action of the other horses will
                    instantly press the collar to his shoulders, and excite him to exertion. If the
                    horse at 1, 2, for example, relaxes, the one at 5, 6 would instantly take up his
                    rope, and either cause the horse 1, 2 to exert himself, or be pulled backwards.
                    The same thing would happen with any or all of the other horses, so that all of
                    them are as it were united into one power driving the machine. If it is
                    necessary to take out <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205438"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5438-0432"/>one horse, as that at 7, 8, an iron hook upon the
                    rope F is hooked into the eye of a bolt fastened to the arm, as at R.</p>
                <p>Another contrivance connected with the draught of horses deserves a place in this
                    chapter. It is an invention of Baron de Prony for unyoking horses, to prevent
                    them from injuring the machine when its motion is accidentally obstructed. It
                    may also be employed for limiting the efforts of horses thus employed. In the
                    annexed figure, ropes <hi rend="italic">a, a, a</hi> pass over friction-pulleys
                    in the openings <hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi rend="italic">b of</hi> the frame
                    <hi rend="italic">dd,</hi> which is attached to the end of the lever <hi
                    rend="italic">cc</hi> fixed to the vertical axis which gives motion to the
                    machine. Each rope terminates in an eye, which lays hold of a pin on an arbor
                    <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which revolves upon pivots. A rope coiled round this
                    arbor passes over pulleys <hi rend="italic">pp,</hi> and suspends along the
                    vertical axis the weight <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> which forms the resistance
                    which we wish to oppose to the efforts of the horse. Let it be twenty lbs. and
                    let a stick obstruct the machine. The horse acts against it, and might break the
                    machine; but the instant his effect exceeds <hi rend="italic">w</hi> or tw enty
                    lbs. the arbor <hi rend="italic">e</hi> will describe a quarter of a circle, and
                    the pins having quitted their vertical position, the ends of the ropes which
                    were there united escape from one another, the animal is fixed, and the machine
                    stops.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                <p>CHAP. VΠ. ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF WIND-MILLS.</p>
                <p>A wind-mill is represented in fig. 139, where MN is the circular building that
                    contains the machinery, E the extremity of the wind-shaft or principal axis,
                    which is generally inclined from 8 to 15 degrees to the horizon; and EA, EB,</p>
                <p>EC, ED, EF five rectangular frames, upon which sails of cloth of the same form
                    are stretched. At the lower extremity</p>
                <p>G of the sails their surface is inclined to the axis 72°; and at their farthest
                    extremities A, D, &amp;c. the inclination of the sail is about 83°. Now, when
                    the sails are adjusted to the wind, which happens when the wind blows in the
                    direction of the wind-shaft E, the impulse of the wind upon the oblique sails
                    may be resolved into two forces, one of which acts at right angles to the
                    wind-shaft, and is therefore employed solely in giving a motion of rotation to
                    the sails, and the axis upon which they are fixed. When the mill is used for
                    grinding corn, a crown-wheel, fixed to the principal axis E, gives motion to a
                    lantern or trundle, whose axis carries the moveable millstone.</p>
                <p>That the wind may act with the greatest efficacy upon the sails, the wind-shaft
                    must have the same direction as the wind. But as this direction is perpetually
                    changing, some apparatus is necessary for bringing the wind-shaft and sails into
                    their proper position. This is sometimes effected by supporting the machinery on
                    a strong vertical axis, whose pivot moves in a brass socket firmly fixed into
                    the ground, so that the whole machine, by means of a lever, may be made to
                    revolve upon this axis, and be properly adjusted to the direction of the wind.
                    Most wind-mills, however, are furnished with a moveable roof, which revolves
                    upon friction-rollers inserted in the fixed kerb of the mill; and the adjustment
                    is effected by the assistance of a simple lever. As both these methods of
                    adjustment require the assistance of men, it would be very desirable that the
                    same effect should be produced solely by the action of the wind. This may be
                    done by fixing a large wooden vane or weather-cock at the extremity of a long
                    horizontal arm which lies in the same vertical plane with the wind-shaft. By
                    this means, when the surface of the vane, and its distance from the centre of
                    motion, are sufficiently great, a very gentle breeze will exert a sufficient
                    force upon the vane to turn the machinery, and will always bring the sails and
                    windshaft to their proper position. This weather-cock, it is evident, may be
                    applied either to machines which have a moveable roof, or which revolve upon a
                    vertical arbor.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Form and Position of Wind-mill Sails.</hi></p>
                <p>From an examination of more than fifty wind-mills in the vicinity of Lille,
                    Coulomb has furnished us with the dimensions of the sails of the best Dutch
                    mills. As these mills performed nearly the same amount of work when the velocity
                    of the wind was about 19 feet per second, although there were slight differences
                    in the arrangement of their sails, as well as in the inclination of their
                    wind-shafts, Coulomb concluded that they were so constructed as to produce
                    nearly a maximum effect.</p>
                <p>In these mills the distance of the extremities of two opposite sails was
                    sixty-six feet. The form of the sails was that of a rectangle, and their width
                    was six feet, five feet of which was covered with cloth stretched on a frame,
                    the remaining foot being a light board. The sail commenced 6 feet from the
                    wind-shaft, so that the length AG was — 6 = 27 feet. The junction of the board
                    with the cloth formed, on the side which faces the wind, a curve perceptibly
                    concave at the commencement of the sail, and the curvature gradually diminished
                    to-vyards the extremity, where it vanished. Although every· line of the surface
                    of the cloth is curved, yet we may consider the surface of the sail as
                    consisting of straight lines having different inclinations to the plane of the
                    sail s motion. The inclination of these lines to this plane is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">angle of weather ∙</hi> and in Dutch sails this <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205451" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5451-0433"/>angle is 30° at the
                    commencement G of the sail, diminishing gradually to the extremity D, where in
                    some cases it is ]2°, and in others 6°; the inclination of the wind-shaft
                    varying from 8° to 15°.</p>
                <p>It appears from the investigations of Parent and Belidor, that a maximum effect
                    will be produced when the sails are inclined 54° 44' 13" to the axis of
                    rotation, or when the angle of weather is 35° 15' 47". In obtaining this
                    conclusion, however, Μ. Parent has assumed data which are inadmissible, and has
                    neglected several circumstances which must materially affect the result of his
                    investigations. The angle of inclination assigned by Parent is certainly the
                    most efficacious for giving motion to the sails from a state of rest, and for
                    preventing them from stopping when in motion; but he has not considered that the
                    action of the wind upon a sail at rest is different from its action upon a sail
                    in motion; for, since the extremities of the sail move with greater rapidity
                    than the parts nearer the centre (in the Dutch mills as 33 to 6), the angle of
                    weather should be greater towards the centre than at the extremity, and should
                    vary with the velocity of each part of the sail. The reason of this is very
                    obvious. It has been demonstrated by Bossut, and established by experience, that
                    when any fluid acts upon a plain surface, the force of impulsion is always
                    exerted most advantageously when the impelled surface is in a state of rest, and
                    that this force diminishes as the velocity of the surface increases. Now, let us
                    suppose, with Parent and Belidor, that the most advantageous angle of weather
                    for the sails of windmills is 35½° for that part of the sail which is nearest
                    the centre of rotation, and that the sail has everywhere this angle of weather;
                    then, since the extremity of the sail moves with the greatest velocity, it will
                    in a manner withdraw itself from the action of the wind, or, to speak more
                    properly, it will not receive the impulse of the wind so advantageously as those
                    parts of the sail which have a less degree of velocity. In order, therefore, to
                    counteract this diminution of force, we must make the wind act more
                    perpendicularly upon the sail, by diminishing its obliquity or its angle of
                    weather. But since the velocity of every part of the sail is proportional to its
                    distance from the centre of motion, every elementary portion of it must have a
                    different angle of weather diminishing from the centre to the extremity of the
                    sail. The law or rate of diminution, however, is still to be discovered, and we
                    are fortunately in possession of a theorem of Euler’s, afterwards given by
                    Maclaurin, which determines this law of variation. Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    represent the velocity of the wind, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the velocity of
                    any given part of the sail; then the effort of the wind upon that part of the
                    sail will be greatest when the tangent of the angle of the wind’s incidence, or
                    of the sail’s inclina-</p>

                <p>4αα <hi rend="italic">2α</hi></p>
                <p>In order to apply this theorem, let us suppose that the radius or whip ED of the
                    sail <hi rend="italic">aβδγ,</hi> is divided into six equal parts; that the
                    point <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is equidistant from E and D, and is the point of
                    the sail which has the same velocity as the wind; then, in the preceding
                    theorem, we shall have <hi rend="italic">c = a</hi> when the sail is loaded to a
                    maximum; and therefore the tangent of the angle which the surface of the sail at

                    and since c is proportional to the distance of the corresponding part of the
                    sail from the centre, we will have, at</p>
                <p>⅜ of the radius, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> = ∣; at f of the radius, <hi

                    must be given to different parts of the sails.</p>

                <p>Mr Smeaton found, from a variety of experiments, that the common practice of
                    inclining plane sails from 72° to 75° to the axis, was much more efficacious
                    than the angle assigned by Parent, the effect being as 45 to 31. When the sails
                    were weathered in the Dutch manner, that is, when their surfaces were concave to
                    the wind, and when the angle of inclination increased towards their extremities,
                    they produced a greater effect than when they were weathered either in the
                    common way, or according to Euler’s theorem. But when the sails were enlarged at
                    their extremities, as represented at <hi rend="italic">αβ</hi> in fig. 140, so
                    that <hi rend="italic">aβ</hi> was one third of the radius ED, and αD to D/3 as
                    5 to 3, their power was greatest of all, though the surface acted upon by the
                    wind remained the same. If the sails be farther enlarged, the effect is not
                    increased in proportion to the surface; and besides, when the quantity of cloth
                    is great, the machine is much exposed to injury by sudden squalls of wind. In Mr
                    Smeaton’s experiments, the angle of wea-. ther varied with the distance from the
                    axis; and it appeared from several trials, that the most efficacious angles were
                    those in the following table.</p>

                <p>If the radius ED of the sail be 30 feet, then the sail will commence at ½ED, or 5
                    feet from the axis, where the angle of inclination will be 72°. At ðED, or 10
                    feet from the axis, the angle will be 71°, and so on.</p>

                <p>The following very important results were obtained by Μ. Coulomb, in examining
                    the wind-mills at Lille, in the Netherlands. These mills were made for the
                    manufacture of oil of rape-seed, and were constructed in the following manner:
                    <hi rend="italic">Seven</hi> stampers for bruising the seeds were raised by
                    means of an arbor carrying 14 wipers. <hi rend="italic">Five of</hi> the
                    stampers were of oak, each from 20 to 22 feet long, and from 9 to 11 inches
                    square; their lower ends were shod with iron, weighing from 50 to 60 lbs.; and
                    each stamper weighed about 1020 lbs. The other <hi rend="italic">two</hi>
                    stampers were of the same length, but only from 6 to 7 inches square, and
                    weighed about 500 lbs. each: their purpose was to lock and unlock the wedges
                    used in expressing the oil. One of these <hi rend="italic">two</hi> only acted
                    at once, but the rest acted together.</p>

                <p>By taking an average of the work performed during several years, Coulomb found
                    that each wind-mill manufactured annually 400 tons of oil. About one sixth of
                    the force communicated to the stampers he conceives to be absorbed by their
                    blows and the action of the wipers, including friction. Hence he calculates that
                    100 kilogrammes or one ton of oil requires for its manufacture 12,500 dynamical
                    units.</p>
                <p>Μ. Halle at Lille found that a steam-engine of ten-horse power prepared in
                    twenty-four hours 500 kilogrammes of oil, which gives fifty kilogrammes for each
                    horse. But we have already seen that the power of a horse working twenty-four
                    hours is equal to 5974 dynamical units. Hence</p>

                <p>as 50: 5974 = 100:11948 units, agreeing very nearly with 12,500, the result
                    obtained by Coulomb.</p>
                <p>By supposing three tons to be the average work of one mill during an average
                    state of the wind, we have</p>

                <p>— 133 for the number of days of twenty-four hours to which the whole wind of the

                    metres per second.</p>

                <p>From these and various other experiments, Μ. Hachette has drawn the conclusion,
                    that from 500 to 550 dynamical units are required to grind 100 kilogrammes of
                    corn.</p>
                <p>Μ. Lulofs of Leyden examined a Dutch wind-mill that drained marshes, and which
                    had four rectangular sails set at a weather of 17°. It raised 1500 cubic feet of
                    water four feet high in a minute when the velocity of the wind was 30 feet per
                    second.</p>
                <p>Coulomb found that in the Dutch mills, whose dimensions are given in page 432.
                    the effect was 1000 lbs. raised 218 feet in a minute when the wind blew 20 feet
                    in a second. He computed also that the force lost by friction was 1000 lbs.
                    raised 18½ feet per minute; and that the force consumed by the action of the
                    wipers on the stampers was equal to ]000 lbs. raised 16½ feet in a minute. Hence
                    it follows that the total force of the wind was equivalent to 1000 lbs. raised
                    218 + 16½ + 18⅛ = 253 feet in a minute.</p>
                <p>Both Smeaton and Coulomb have attempted to determine the ratio between the
                    velocity of the wind and that <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205477"

                <p>In order to account for the discrepancies between these results and those of
                    Smeaton, we may observe,'that in the two first experiments, where the difference
                    is the greatest, viz. 1∙7 to 1, and 1∙22 to 1, the mill was not doing its full
                    work. The average of the ratios in the other four experiments, where the mill
                    was doing full work, is 1∙07, which is less different from Smeaton’s
                    results.</p>
                <p>The principal cause of the discrepancy, however, is, that the ratio increases, as
                    in all Smeaton’s experiments, with the velocity of the wind; and as Smeaton’s
                    highest velocity was only five miles per hour, whereas the average velocity in
                    the four last experiments of Coulomb was so high as 17∙6 miles per hour, it is
                    not difficult to understand how the ratios deduced from them should be so
                    high.</p>
                <p>A new mode of constructing the sails of wind-mills has been recently given by Mr
                    Sutton, and fully described by Mr Hesleden of Barton, in a work exclusively
                    devoted to the subject.</p>
                <p>The limits of this article will not permit us to enter into any discussion
                    respecting the principles upon which Mr Sutton’s gravi-· tated sails are
                    constructed. It may be proper, however, to remark, that Mr Sutton gives his
                    sails the form represented in fig. 141, and makes the angle of weather at the
                    point Μ, equidistant from A and B, equal to 22° 30'. The inclination of the sail
                    at any other point N of the sail, is an angle whose sine is the distance of that
                    point from the centre of motion A, the radius being the breadth of the sail at
                    that point. Fig. 141. shows the angles at the different points of the sail, and
                    the apparent and absolute breadths of the sail at these points. Mr Sutton’s mode
                    of regulating the velocity of the sails, and of bringing them into a state of
                    rest, is particularly ingenious.</p>
                <p>ON HORIZONTAL WIND-MILLS.</p>
                <p>Various opinions have been entertained respecting the relative advantages of
                    horizontal and vertical wind-mills. Mr Smeaton, with great justice, gives a
                    decided preference to the latter; but when he asserts that horizontal wind mills
                    have only ½ or <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> ⅛ of the power of vertical ones, he
                    certainly forms too low an estimate of their power. Mr Beatson, on the contrary,
                    who has received a patent for the construction of a new horizontal windmill,
                    seems to be prejudiced in their favour, and greatly exaggerates their
                    comparative value. From an impartial investigation, it will probably appear that
                    the truth lies between these two opposite opinions; but before entering on this
                    discussion, we must first consider the nature and form of horizontal
                    wind-mills.</p>
                <p>In fig. 142 CK is the wind-shaft, which moves upon pivots. Four cross bars, CA,
                    CD, IB, FG, are fixed to this arbor, which carry the frames APIB,DEFG. The sails
                    Al, EG, are stretched upon these frames, and are carried round the axis CK, by
                    the perpendicular impulse of the wind. Upon the axis CK a toothed wheel is
                    fixed, which gives motion to the particular machinery that is employed. In the
                    figure only two sails are represented; but there are always other two placed at
                    right angles to these. Now, let the sails be exposed to the wind, and it will be
                    evident that no motion will ensue; for the force of the wind upon the sail Al,
                    is counteracted by an equal and opposite force upon the sail EG. In order, then,
                    that the wind may communicate motion to the machine, the force upon the
                    returning sail EG must either be removed by screening it from the wind, or
                    diminished by making it present a less surface when returning against the wind.
                    The first of these methods is adopted in Tartary, and in some provinces of
                    Spain; but is objected to by Mr Beatson, from the inconvenience and expense of
                    the machinery and attendance requisite for turning the screens into their proper
                    positions. Notwithstanding this objection, however, we are disposed to think
                    that this is the best method of diminishing the action of the wind upon the
                    returning sails, for the moveable screen may be easily made to fol low the
                    direction of the wind, and assume its proper position, by means of a large
                    wooden weathercock, without the aid either of men or machinery It is true,
                    indeed, that the resistance of the air in the returning sails is not completely
                    removed; but it is at least as much diminished as it can be by any method
                    hitherto proposed. Besides, when this plan is resorted to, there is no occasion
                    for any moveable flaps and hinges, which must add greatly to the expense of
                    every other method.</p>
                <p>The mode of bringing the sails back against the wind, which Mr Beatson invented,
                    is, perhaps, the simplest and best of the kind. He makes each sail Al to consist
                    of six or eight flaps or vanes, APZd, <hi rend="italic">blc2,</hi> &amp;c.
                    moving upon hinges represented by the dark lines AP, δl, c2, &amp;c. so that the
                    lower side <hi rend="italic">bl, of</hi> the first flap overlaps the hinge or
                    higher side of the second flap, and so on. When the wind, therefore, acts upon
                    the sail Al, each flap will press upon the hinge of the one immediately below
                    it, and the whole surface of the sail will be exposed to its action. But when
                    the sail Al returns against the wind, the flapswill revolve round upon their
                    hinges, and present only their edges to the wind, as is represented at EG, so
                    that the resistance occasioned by the return of the sail must be greatly
                    diminished, and the motion will be continued by the great superiority of force
                    exerted upon the sails in the position Al. In computing the force of the wind
                    upon the sail Al, and the resistance opposed to it by the edges of the flaps in
                    EG, Mr Beatson finds, that when the pressure upon the former is 1872 pounds, the
                    resistance opposed by the latter is only about thirty-six pounds, or ⅛ part of
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205490" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5490-0436"/>whole
                    force; but he neglects the action of the wind upon the arms CA, &amp;c. and the
                    frames which carry the sails, because they expose the same surface in the
                    position AI, as in the position EG. This omission, however, has a tendency to
                    mislead us in the present case, as we shall now see; for we ought to compare the
                    whole force exerted upon the arms, as well as the sail, with the whole
                    resistance which these arms and the edges of the flaps oppose to the motion of
                    the wind-mill. By inspecting fig. 142 it will appear, that if the force upon the
                    edges of the flaps, which Mr Beatson supposed to be twelve in number, amounts to
                    thirty-six pounds, the force spent upon the bars CD, DG, GF, FE, &amp;c. cannot
                    be less than sixty pounds. Now, since these bars are acted upon with an equal
                    force when the sails have the position AI, 1872 + 60 = 1932 will be the force
                    exerted upon the sail AI and its appendages, while the opposite force upon the
                    bars and edges of the flaps, when returning against the wind, will be 36 + 60 =
                    96 pounds, which is nearly ⅛ of 1932, instead of A, as computed by Mr Beatson.
                    Hence we may see the probable advantages of a screen over moveable flaps, as it
                    will preserve not only the sails, but the arms and the frame which support it,
                    from the action of the wind.</p>
                <p>s A very ingenious method of bringing the sails back against the wind has been
                    invented by Mr G. Buchanan of Edinburgh, and is represented in the annexed
                    figure. The sails are attached, as usual, to the horizontal arms of the vertical
                    axis CBA, and each of them moves horizontally round its own axis, as shown at H,
                    <hi rend="italic">in .</hi><hi rend="italic">an opposite direction</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">to, and with half the angular direction of, thιι horizontal
                    arms.</hi> In order to effect this, a toothed wheel <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is
                    attached to the frame EF, and is therefore stationary while the mill revolves;
                    <hi rend="italic">bc</hi> is a toothed pinion working in <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab,</hi> and moved by its axis <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> while this axis,
                    fixed to the arm HI, revolves with the principal axis CBA, through which it
                    passes at <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> Two pinions <hi rend="italic">f g,</hi> are
                    fixed to the ends of the axis <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> and work in the two
                    wheels <hi rend="italic">h, i,</hi> which are attached to the axis of the sails.
                    They will, therefore, move round these sails in the same time, and with a
                    velocity depending on the relative number of teeth in the wheels and pinions,
                    and so adjusted as to give them half the angular velocity of the principal axis
                    CBA. The wheel <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is made moveable round its axis, so
                    that it may be shifted into any position, and keep the sails always to the
                    wind.</p>
                <p>By these means, when one of the sails Μ, is fully exposed to the action of the
                    wind, the opposite one N, will only present its edge to the wind. As Μ advances,
                    it gradually turns itself away from the wind, till it comes round into the
                    position N, when the wind ceases to have any power over it. All the other sails
                    do the same, and it will readily be seen, by constructing a diagram of the
                    relative position of the sails at any point of their revolution, that the area
                    of the returning sails exposed to the wind is always much less than the area of
                    the sails urged forward by the wind.</p>
                <p>We shall now conclude this chapter with a comparison of the power of horizontal
                    and vertical wind-mills. It has been already stated, that Mr Smeaton rather
                    underrated the former, when he maintained that they have only one eighth or one
                    tenth the power of the latter. He observes, that when the vanes of a horizontal
                    and a vertical mill are equal in dimensions, the power of the latter is four
                    times that of the former, because, in the first case, only one sail is acted
                    upon at once by the wind, while, in the second, all the four receive its
                    impulse. This, however, is not strictly true, since the vertical sails are
                    oblique to the direction of the wind. Let us suppose that the area of each sail
                    is 100 square feet; then the power of the horizontal one will be 1 <hi
                    rend="underline">00, and th</hi> e power of a vertical one may be called 100 ×
                    sine 70° <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> (70° being the common angle of
                    inclination) = 88 nearly; but since there are four vertical sails, the power of
                    them all will be 4 χ 88 = 352; so that the power of the horizontal sail is to
                    that of the four vertical ones as 1 to 3∙52, and not as 1 to 4, according to Mr
                    Smeaton. But Mr Smeaton likewise observes, that if we consider the disadvantage
                    which arises from the difficulty of getting the sails back against the wind, we
                    need not wonder if horizontal wind-mills have only about one eighth or one tenth
                    the power of the common sort. We have already seen, that the resistance
                    occasioned by the return of the sails amounts to one twentieth of the whole
                    force which they receive; by subtracting therefore, from ğūjğ’ we shall find
                    that the power of horizontal wind-mills l ’ 03</p>
                <p>is only -j-r∩, or little more than one fourth that of vertical ones. This
                    calculation proceeds upon a supposition that the whole force exerted upon
                    vertical sails is employed in turning them round the axis <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> motion, whereas a considerable part of this force is lost in pressing
                    the pivot of the axis or wind-shaft against its gudgeon. Mr Smeaton has
                    overlooked this circumstance, otherwise he could never have maintained that the
                    power of four vertical sails was quadruple the power of one horizontal sail, the
                    dimensions of each being the same. Taking this circumstance into the account, we
                    cannot be far wrong in saying, that, in theory at least, if not in practice, the
                    power of a horizontal wind-mill is about one third or one fourth of the power of
                    a vertical one when the quantity of surface and the form of the sails is the
                    same, and when every part of the horizontal sails has the same distance from the
                    axis of motion as the corresponding parts of the vertical sails. But if the
                    horizontal sails have the position Al, EG, in fig. 142, instead of the position
                    <hi rend="italic">CAdm, CDon,</hi> their power will be greatly increased, though
                    the quantity of surface is the same, because the part CP3<hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi>, being transferred to BI3&lt;7, has much more power to turn the
                    sails.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mechanical Agents not generally introduced.</hi></p>
                <p>In giving an account of the mechanical agents which are or may be employed to
                    move machinery, we must enumerate <hi rend="italic">elastic springs, heated air,
                    explosive mixtures,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">carbonic acid gas.</hi></p>
                <p>The spring is so common a first mover in our watches and clocks, and the method
                    of rendering its varying force uniform by the fusee so well known, that it would
                    be a waste of time to describe it here, and the more so as it will be referred
                    to in another part of the work. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Scholium,</hi> p. 365.
                    Heated air has been occasionally employed as a source of mechanical power. We
                    have seen the model of a pump, in which the air in the barrel was rarefied by
                    burning wood shavings at the top of the barrel, an airtight cap being put on
                    when the rarefaction was supposed to be a maximum. A certain quantity of water
                    was thus raised above the valve at the bottom of the barrel, and the operation
                    was repeated till the water rose to the desired height.</p>
                <p>About ten or fifteen years ago a patent was taken out <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205503" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5503-0437"/>for a heated air-engine, by
                    the Rev. Mr Stirling; and we believe that several such engines were actually
                    constructed, and performed useful work, at Perth, Glasgow, and other places. The
                    air was heated in an iron cylinder kept at a red heat, and after acting
                    mechanically by its expansive force, it was cooled and returned to the cylinder
                    by a very ingenious contrivance. The practical difficulty, however, which was
                    encountered arose from the speedy destruction of the iron cylinder.</p>
                <p>In the year 1824, Mr Samuel. Brown took out a patent for what be called an
                    atmospherical engine, in which a vacuum was created by burning coal or oil gas
                    within the cylinder, and thus consuming the atmospherical air. The statements of
                    the power of this engine were greatly exaggerated, and high expectations were
                    formed of it, but we believe that it turned out a total failure.<note

                    an engine in 'which the power was obtained by taking advantage of the vacuum
                    created by the explosion of a mixture of hydrogen gas and common air; and he
                    also suggested that the expansive force of this explosion might be employed as
                    the first mover of machinery. A mixture of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> measure of
                    hydrogen with two and a half measures of common air expands to three times its
                    bulk on ignition, and then collapses instantly to about one half of the original
                    volume of the mixture. If, therefore, we take a cylindrical vessel divided at
                    one third of its length into two portions by a throttle valve (one which moves
                    round its axis in the line of its diameter); if there be a solid piston in the
                    shorter portion, and if at the end of the larger portion there is placed a light
                    valve opening easily outward; then, supposing the throttle valve closed, and the
                    piston lying down upon it, if the piston be now raised, and the mixed gases be
                    permitted to flow in to supply the void left by the piston till it reach the end
                    of its stroke; if at this time the valve be opened, and at the same instant a
                    jet of flame be introduced at a touch-hole in the side of the cylinder to fire
                    the explosive mixture, then the explosion will drive out the common air by the
                    end valve from the larger portion, the valve will close, and the pressure of the
                    atmosphere into the rare medium in the cylinder will force down the piston until
                    it reaches nearly to the middle valve, when the mixed gases are again admitted,
                    the middle valve closed, and the end one opened. The ascent of the piston will
                    of course be produced by the action of a fly-wheel put in motion by the downward
                    stroke.</p>
                <p>In this machine the expansive force of the explosion does not produce the moving
                    power, as it might be made to do. It merely drives out the common air, and
                    produces a partial vacuum. The pressure of the atmosphere is in reality the
                    moving power.</p>
                <p>When Mr Faraday had made his beautiful discovery of the liquefaction of chlorine
                    gas, Sir Humphry Davy communicated to the Royal Society of London a paper “<hi
                    rend="italic">On the application of liquids formed by the condensation of gases
                    as mechanical agents”</hi> In this way the attention of Mr Brunel was turned to
                    the application of liquid carbonic acid gas as a first mover of machinery. Its
                    remarkable powers of expansion by small degrees of heat pointed it out as
                    peculiarly adapted for mechanical purposes, and the highest expectations where
                    excited when Mr Brunel directed his great mechanical genius to the subject. He
                    soon contrived a suitable mechanism for the application of this extraordinary
                    agent, and took out a patent for it in England, and another in France in concert
                    with MM. Ternaux and Delessert. In the apparatus which he prepared, the
                    liquefied acid was at the temperature of 50°, and under the pressure of 30
                    atmospheres. The liquid gas was contained in two cylinders placed at the two
                    extremities of the apparatus, and put in communication. The destruction of the
                    equilibrium was effected by varying the temperature of the liquid in one of the
                    condensers. Such, however, was the effect of the heat upon the liquid, that for
                    a rise of temperature of 180° we obtain a pressure of 90 atmospheres, an
                    enormous power, which having no resistance but that of the gas in the other
                    condenser, tends to displace a piston with a force of90 — 30 = 60 atmospheres.
                    Of this engine Mr Brunel constructed a working model, and he afterwards began a
                    machine with a power of eight horses. In the course of his experiments, however,
                    with this machine, he met with anomalies in the law of expansion of the
                    liquefied gas which seemed to throw insuperable difficulties in his way, and led
                    him to abandon his undertaking.</p>
                <p>At the time that Mr Brunel was occupied with this subject, Mr Faraday had
                    obtained it only in small quantities; but Μ. Thilorier has lately discovered a
                    new process, by which it may be obtained in quantities in a very few moments.
                    From this cause Μ. Thilorier has had an opportunity of studying its properties;
                    and we hope it may yet be found to realise at least some of the anticipations of
                    earlier chemists. He found that the pressure of the vapour formed by the
                    liquefied gas from 32° to 86° Fahr, amounts to from 36 to 73 atmospheres, and
                    its volume from 20 to 29, the pressure being equal to an increase of one
                    atmosphere to every centigrade degree, and the expansion being four times
                    greater than that of atmospheric air. At 86° its specific gravity is 0∙60, at
                    32° it is 0∙83, and at — 68° it is 0∙90.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>When a horse is employed in raising coals by means of a wheel and axle, and moves
                    at the rate of about two miles an hour, Mr Fenwick found that he could continue
                    at work 12 hours each day, two and a half of which were spent in short intervals
                    of rest, when he raised a load of 1000 pounds avoirdupois, with a velocity of 13
                    feet per minute; and that he will exert a force of 75 pounds for nine hours and
                    a half when moving with the same velocity. Mr Fenwick • also found that 230 ale
                    gallons of water delivered every minute on an overshot water-wheel, 10 feet in
                    diameter; that a common steam-engine, with a cylinder 8 inches in diameter, and
                    an improved engine with a cylinder 6∙12 inches in diameter, will do the work of
                    one horse, that is, will raise a weight of 1000 pounds avoirdupois through the
                    height of 13 feet in a minute. It appears from Mr Smeaton’s experiments, that
                    Dutch sails in their common position with a radius of nine feet and a half, that
                    Dutch sails in their best position with a radius of eight feet, and that his
                    enlarged sails with a radius of seven feet, perform the same work as one man, or
                    perform one fifth part of the work of a horse. Upon these facts we have
                    constructed the following table, the first four columns of which are taken from
                    Mr Fenwick’s Essays on Practical Mechanics.</p>

                <p>Dutch sails are always constructed so that the angle of weather may diminish from
                    the centre to the extremity of the sail. They are concave to the wind, and are
                    in their <hi rend="italic">common position</hi> when their extremities are
                    parallel to the plane in which they move, or perpendicular to the direction of
                    the wind. Dutch sails are in their <hi rend="italic">best position</hi> when
                    their extremities make an angle of seven degrees with the plane of their motion.
                    Mr Smeaton’s enlarged sails are Dutch sails in their best position, but enlarged
                    at their extremities.</p>

                    sails, that when the distance between the extremities of two opposite sails is
                    66 feet French, and the breadth of each sail six feet, a wind moving at the rate
                    of 20 feet per second will produce an effect equivalent to 1000 pounds raised
                    through the space of 218 feet in a minute.</p>
                <p>It will be seen in our article <hi rend="smallcaps">Steam-Engine,</hi> that the
                    efficiency of a steam-engine is equal to the column of water in pounds raised at
                    each stroke, multiplied by the length of the stroke and the number of strokes in
                    a given time; and that what is called the <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> of a
                    steam-engine is equal to the same quantity divided by the number of bushels of
                    coal consumed in the same time.</p>
                <p>One of the old standard engines, as they were made in 1778, wrought pumps 17
                    inches in diameter at the depth of 58 fathoms, at the rate of six strokes in a
                    minute, each stroke being 5½ feet long. Its consumption of coal was 14,080
                    bushels in 61 days, hence its duty was 6,901,753.</p>
                <p>In the year 1793, the improvements of Messrs Boulton and Watt were so important,
                    that the average duty of 17 engines of their construction was 19,569,000, being
                    an increase of duty in the ratio of 28 to 10.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to Watt and Boulton, one of their
                    steam-engines, with a cylinder 31 inches in diameter, and which makes 17 double
                    strokes per minute, is equivalent to 40 horses working day and night; that is,
                    to 101 horses working nine hours and a half, the time of constant exertion in
                    the preceding table. When the cylinder is 19 inches in diameter, and the engine
                    makes 25 strokes of four feet each per minute, its power is equivalent to twelve
                    horses working constantly, or thirty horses working nine hours and a half; and
                    when the cylinder is 24 inches in diameter, and the engine makes 22 strokes of
                    five feet each in a minute, its power is equal to that of 20 horses working
                    constantly, or 50 horses working nine hours and a half.</p></note></p>
                <p>Since that time the use of steam of high temperature, the construction of
                    fire-places with superior drafts, or iron tubes passing through the boiler, and
                    other improvements in the execution of the machinery, have given such additional
                    power to the steam-engine, that in 1829 the highest monthly average duty of one
                    of the engines was 79,000,000, surpassing in duty the engine of 1778 in the
                    ratio of 11½ to 1, and those of 1793 as 4 to 1.</p>
                <p>Mr Taylor expresses the improvement on steam-engines by the number of bushels of

                    about eight miles. It will be observed, that in the above statement the inherent
                    power of fuel is, of necessity, greatly underrated. It is not pretended by
                    engineers that the economy of fuel is yet pushed to its utmost limit, or that
                    the whole effective power is obtained in any application of fire yet devised; so
                    that were we to say 100 millions instead of 70, we should probably be nearer the
                    truth.”</p>
                <p>CHAP.VIII.—ON THECONSTRUCTION OF WHEEL-CARRI AGES.</p>
                <p>It is evident, from Cor. 8, p. 360, that when a wheel sur- • mounts an obstacle,
                    it acts as a lever of the first kind, and that its power to overcome such
                    resistances increases with its diameter. The power of the force P, for example,
                    to raise the wheel NB over the eminence C, is proportional to the vertical lever
                    FC, which increases with the diameter of the wheel, while the lever of
                    resistance FA, by which the weight of the wheel acts, remains unchanged; hence
                    we see the advantages of large wheels for overcoming such obstacles as generally
                    resist the motion of wheel-carriages. There are some circumstances, however,
                    which, independent of the additional weight and expense of large wheels,
                    prescribe limits to their size. If the radius AC of the wheel exceeds the height
                    of that part of the horse to which the traces are attached, the line of traction
                    DA will be oblique to the horizon, and part of the power P will be employed in
                    pressing the wheel upon the ground. A wheel exceeding four and a half feet
                    radius, which is the general distance from the ground of that part of the horse
                    to which the traces are attached, has still the advantage of a smaller wheel;
                    but when we consider that the traces or poles of the cart will, in this case,
                    rub against the flanks of the horses, so that the power of the wheel is
                    diminished by the increase of its weight, we shall be convinced that no power is
                    gained by making the radius of the wheels greater than four and a half feet.
                    Even this size is too great, as shall be afterwards shown when we treat of the
                    line of traction, so that we may safely assert that the diameters of wheels
                    should never be greater than six feet. The fore-wheels of our carriages are
                    still unaccountably small, and it is not uncommon to see carts moving upon
                    wheels scarcely fourteen inches in diameter. The convenience of turning is urged
                    as the reason for diminishing the fore-wheels of carriages, and the facility of
                    loading the cart is considered as a sufficient reason for using wheels so small
                    as fourteen inches. The first of these advantages, however, may be obtained by
                    going to the end of a street, or to a proper place for turning the carriage; and
                    a few additional turns of a windlass will be sufficient to convey the heaviest
                    loads into carts mounted on high wheels.</p>
                <p>The next thing to be determined is the shape of the wheels. A cylindrical wheel,
                    with the spokes perpendicular to the naves, is perhaps the form which every
                    mechanic would give to his wheels, before he had heard of the advantages of
                    concave or dishing wheels, or those which have inclined spokes and conical rims.
                    It has been alleged, indeed, and with truth, that the form represented in fig.
                    145, where Ar, B.s ’ is the conical rim, and oA, pB the inclined spokes, renders
                    the wheel stronger than it would otherwise be; that by extending the base of the
                    carriage it prevents it from being overturned; that it hinders the fellies from
                    rubbing against the load or the sides of the cart; and that when one wheel falls
                    into a rut, and therefore supports more than one half of the load, the spokes
                    are brought into a vertical position, which renders them more capable of
                    sustaining the additional weight.</p>
                <p>Two of these advantages exist only in very bad roads; and if they are necessary,
                    in a country like this, where the roads are so excellently made and so regularly
                    repaired, they can easily be procured, by making the axle-tree a few inches
                    longer, and increasing the strength of the spokes. But it is allowed on all
                    hands that perpendicular spokes are preferable on level ground. The inclination
                    of the spokes, therefore, which renders concave wheels advantageous in rugged
                    and unequal roads, renders them disadvantageous when the roads are in good
                    order; and where the good roads are more numerous than the bad ones, as they
                    certainly are in this country, the disadvantages of concave wheels must
                    overbalance their advantages. It is true, indeed, that in concave wheels the
                    spokes are in their strongest position when they are exposed to the severest
                    strains, that is, when one wheel is in a deep rut, and sustains more than one
                    half of the load; but it is equally true, that on level ground, where the spokes
                    are in their weakest position, a less severe strain, by continuing for a much
                    longer time, may be equally if not more detrimental to the wheel.</p>
                <p>We shall now endeavour to show that concave dishing wheels are more expensive,
                    more injurious to the roads, and more liable to be broken by accidents, than
                    those wheels in which the spokes are perpendicular to the naves. By inspecting
                    fig. 145, it will appear that the whole of the pressure which the wheel AB
                    sustains is exerted along the inclined spoke <hi rend="italic">ps,</hi> and
                    therefore acts obliquely on the level ground <hi rend="italic">nD,</hi> whether
                    the rims are conical or cylindrical. This oblique action must necessarily injure
                    the roads, by loosening the stones more between B and D than between B and <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and if the load were sufficiently
                    great, the stones would start up between <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and D. The
                    texture of the roads, indeed, is sufficiently firm to prevent this from
                    taking<pb break="no" facs="nls:194205542" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5542-0440"/> place;
                    but, in consequence of the oblique pressure, the stones between s and D will at
                    least be loosened, and, by admitting the rain, the whole of the road will be
                    materially damaged. But when the spokes are perpendicular to the nave, as <hi
                    rend="italic">pn,</hi> and when the rims <hi rend="italic">m</hi> A, nB are
                    cylindrical, or parallel to the ground, thç weight sustainecĭ by the wheel will
                    act perpendicularly upon the road; and however much that weight is increased,
                    its action can have no tendency to derange the materials of which it is
                    composed, but is rather calculated to consolidate them, and render the road more
                    firm and durable.</p>
                <p>It was observed that concave wheels are more expensive than plane ones. This
                    additional expense arises from the greater quantity of wood and workmanship
                    which the former require; for in order that dishing wheels may be of the same
                    perpendicular height as plane ones, the spokes of the former must exceed in
                    length those of the latter, as much as the hypothenuse oA of the triangle oAm
                    exceeds the side <hi rend="italic">om</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and therefore
                    the weight and the resistance of such wheels must be proportionably great. The
                    inclined spokes, too, cannot be formed nor inserted with such facility as
                    perpendicular ones. The extremity of the spoke which is fixed into the nave is
                    inserted at right angles to it, in the direction <hi rend="italic">op</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and if the rims&gt;are cylindrical, the other spoke should
                    be inserted in a similar manner, while the intermediate portion has an inclined
                    position. There are therefore two flexures or bendings in the spokes of concave
                    wheels, which requires them to be formed out of a larger piece of wood than if
                    they had no such flexures, and renders them liable to be broken by any sudden
                    strain at the points of flexure.</p>
                <p>The obstacles which carriages have to encounter are a!most never spherical
                    protuberances, that permit the elevated wheel to resume by degrees its
                    horizontal position. They are generally of such a nature that the wheel is
                    instantaneously precipitated from their top to the level ground. Now the
                    momentum with which the wheel strikes the ground is very great, arising from a
                    successive accumulation of force. The velocity of the elevated wheel is
                    considerable when it reaches the top of the eminence; and while it is tumbling
                    into the level ground it is receiving gradually that proportion of the load
                    which was transferred to the other wheel, till, having recovered the whole, it
                    impinges against the ground with great force. But in concave wheels the spoke
                    which then strikes the ground is in its weakest position, and therefore much
                    more liable to be broken by the impetus of the fall than the spokes of the
                    lowest wheel by the mere transference of additional weight; whereas, if the
                    spokes be perpendicular to the nave, they receive this sudden shock in their
                    strongest position, and are in no danger of giving way to the strain.</p>
                <p>In the preceding observations we have supposed the rims of the wheels to be
                    cylindrical. In concave wheels, however, the rims are uniformly made of a
                    conical form, as Ar, Bs, fig. 145, which increases the disadvantages which we
                    have ascribed to them. Mr Cumming, in a late Treatise on Wheel-Carriages, points
                    out the disadvantages of conical rims, and the propriety of making them
                    cylindrical; but we are of opinion that he has ascribed to conical rims several
                    disadvantages which arise chiefly from an inclination of the spokes. He insists
                    much upon the injury done to the roads by the use of conical rims; yet though we
                    are convinced that they are more injurious to pavements and highways than
                    cylindrical rims, we are equally convinced that this injury is occasioned
                    chiefly by the oblique pressure of the inclined spokes. The defects of conical
                    rims are numerous and obvious. Every cone that is put in motion upon a plane
                    surface will revolve round its vertex, and if force is employed to confine it to
                    a straight line, the smaller parts of the cone will be dragged along the ground,
                    and the friction greatly increased. Now when a carriage moves upon conical
                    wheels, one part of the cone rolls while the other is dragged along, and though
                    confined to a rectilineal direction by external force, their natural tendency to
                    revolve round their vertex occasions a great and continued friction upon the
                    linch-pin, the shoulder of the axle-tree, and the sides of deep ruts.</p>
                <p>Mr Edgeworth made some interesting experiments on this subject. He compared a
                    pair of conical wheels, whose inside diameter was thirty-three, while their
                    outside diameter was twenty-seven, with a pair of cylindrical ones, the diameter
                    of which was as thirty-four. When they moved on smooth deal-boards, the <hi
                    rend="italic">conical wheels required an addition of</hi> 50 <hi rend="italic"
                    >per cent, to the moving power</hi> in order to make their velocity equal to
                    that of the cylindrical ones. On a fine gravel road, the addition required was
                    only eight per cent, while on a newly-made coarse road there was a perceptible
                    difference between the two kinds of wheels, although they were only eight inches
                    high and four broad.</p>

                    smooth, and the motion of the carriage regular, and without any tendency to
                    strain in a lateral direction, he considers the cylindrical wheel as decidedly
                    the best, “because the power of the spokes of the wheel to oppose such a
                    pressure is greater when they are perfectly upright under their load, and
                    because the joints, being square, can be made with greater care and accuracy
                    than bevelled ones.” As roads, however, are not of this description, he
                    considers the cylindrical wheel as deficient in bracing; and he remarks, “that
                    wheels so constructed soon get loose at their joints; that the whole wheel gets
                    crippled in consequence; and that, for <hi rend="italic">durability under heavy
                    work and rough roads,</hi> such wheels will not answer the purpose.” Besides the
                    strength arising from the bracing of the conical wheel and bent axle, Mr Walker
                    ascribes to it the following advantages. As these wheels project outwards at
                    top, the rims of carriage-wheels coming into collision with each other in
                    passing will meet in an oblique direction; and unless the wheels get locked, the
                    lightest of the two carriages is pushed off laterally, and the abrasion of the
                    fellies may be the only damage. With cylindrical wheels, on the contrary, he
                    conceives that the effect of a collision would be much more serious, one of them
                    being either brought to a dead stand, or some part of it or of the harness
                    broken. Mr Walker remarks also, that in light carriages the dished wheels throw
                    off the mud from the traveller. When the tire of the wheel consists of a single
                    hoop of iron, Mr Walker states that it increases in length by beating against
                    the road; that in cylindrical wheels the result of this will be, either that the
                    iron rim will get loose upon the fellies, or the spokes will be loose in the
                    nave; whereas, in dished wheels, the only effect of an expansion of the tire
                    will be that the spokes will become more upright, or the wheel a little less
                    dishing. This argument, however, we must observe, falls to the ground when the
                    tire consists of separate segments.</p>
                <p>The amount of Mr Walker’s argument in favour of dished wheels is, that such
                    wheels are a firmer and more durable piece of carpentry. This argument, however,
                    loses all its force if cylindrical wheels could be made as strong as dished ones
                    by any new combination of spokes and fellies, which have the effect of bracing.
                    That such a combination is possible we cannot doubt; and when we consider the
                    smooth and level surface which prevails under an improved<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205555" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5555-0441"/> system of road-making, we
                    should be disposed still to adopt the cylindrical wheel for the sake of the
                    horse that is to draw it, or rather for the purpose of obtaining a greater load
                    from the same horse, even though the wheels might not last so long as dished
                    ones. If the fellies were connected with the nave by means of spokes equally but
                    oppositely inclined to the strongest axle, we are persuaded that a cylindrical
                    wheel might be made as firm as a dished wheel, and of even greater strength in
                    resisting any sudden impulse against the road.</p>
                <p>The shape of the wheels being thus considered, we must now attend to some
                    particular parts of their construction. The tire or iron plates of which the
                    rims are composed should never be less than three inches in breadth, as narrow
                    rims sink deep into the ground, and therefore injure the roads and fatigue the
                    horses. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The tire of the

                    each point supports one half of the weight; if the points are increased to four,
                    each will sustain one fourth of the load, and so on; the pressure upon each
                    point of support diminishing as the number of points increases. If a weight
                    therefore is supported by a broad surface, the points of support are infinite in
                    number, and each of them will bear an infinitely small portion of the load; and,
                    in the same way, every finite portion of this surface will sustain a part of the
                    weight inversely proportional to the number of similar portions which the
                    surface contains. Let us now suppose that a cart carrying a load of sixteen
                    hundredweight is supported upon wheels whose rims are four inches in breadth,
                    and that one of the wheels passes over four stones, each of them an inch broad
                    and equally high, and capable of being pulverized only by a pressure of four
                    hundred pounds weight. Then as each wheel sustains one half of the load, and as
                    the wheel which passes over the stones has four points of support, each stone
                    will bear a weight of two hundredweight, and therefore will not be broken. But
                    if the same cart, with rims only two inches in breadth, should pass the same
                    way, it will cover only two of the stones; and the wheel having only two points
                    of support, each stone will be pressed with a weight of four hundredweight, and
                    will therefore be reduced to powder. Hence we may infer that narrow wheels are
                    in another point of view injurious to the roads, by pulverizing the materials of
                    which they are composed.</p>
                <p>As the rims of wheels wear soonest at their edges, they should be made thinner in
                    the middle, and ought to be fastened to the fellies with nails of such a kind
                    that their heads may not rise above the surface of the rims. In some military
                    waggons we have seen the heads of these nails rising an inch above the rims,
                    which not only destroys the pavements of streets, but opposes a continual
                    resistance to the motion of the wheel. If these nails were eight in number, the
                    wheel would experience the same resistance as if it had to surmount eight
                    obstacles, one inch high, during every revolution. The fellies on which the rims
                    are fixed should in carriages be three inches and a fourth deep, and in waggons
                    four inches. The naves should be thickest at the place where the spokes are
                    inserted; and the holes in which the spokes are placed should not be bored quite
                    through, as the grease upon the axle-tree would insinuate itself between the
                    spoke and the naves, and prevent that close adhesion which is necessary to the
                    strength of the wheel.</p>

                    the Wheels.</hi></p>
                <p>It must naturally occur to every person reflecting upon this subject, that the
                    axle-trees should be straight and the wheels perfectly parallel, so that they
                    may not be wider at their highest than at their lowest point, whether they are
                    of a conical or of a cylindrical form. In this country, however, the wheels are
                    always made concave, and the ends of the axle-trees are universally bent
                    downwards, in order to make them spread at the top and approach nearer below. In
                    some carriages which we have examined, where the wheels were only four feet six
                    inches in diameter, the distance of the wheels at top was fully six feet, and
                    their distance below only four feet eight inches. By this foolish practice the
                    very advantages which may be derived from the concavity of the wheels are
                    completely taken away, while many of the disadvantages remain; more room is
                    taken up in the coach-house, and the carriage is more liable to be overturned by
                    the contraction of its base.</p>
                <p>With some mechanics it is a practice to bend the ends of the axle-trees forwards,
                    and thus make the wheels wider behind than before. This blunder has been
                    strenuously defended by Mr Henry Beighton, who maintains that wheels in this
                    position are more favourable for turning, since, when the wheels are parallel,
                    the outermost when turning would press against the linch-pin, and the innermost
                    would rest against the shoulder of the axle-tree. In •rectilineal motions,
                    however, these converging wheels engender a great deal of friction both on the
                    axle and the ground, and must therefore be more disadvantageous than parallel
                    ones.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Line of Traction, and the Method by which Horses exert
                    their Strength.</hi></p>
                <p>Μ. Camus attempted to show that the line of traction should always be parallel to
                    the ground on which the carriage is moving, both because the horse can exert his
                    greatest strength in this direction, and because the line of draught, being
                    perpendicular to the vertical spoke of the wheel, acts with the largest possible
                    lever. Μ. Couplet, however, considering that the roads are never perfectly
                    level, and that the wheels are constantly surmounting small eminences even in
                    the best of roads, recommends the line of traction to be oblique to the horizon.
                    By this means the line of draught HA (which is by far too much inclined in fig.
                    144) will in general be perpendicular to the lever AC which mounts the eminence,
                    and will therefore act with the longest lever when there is the greatest
                    necessity for it. We ought to consider, also, that when a horse pulls hard
                    against any load, he always brings his breast nearer the ground; and therefore
                    it follows, that if a horizontal line of traction is preferable to all others,
                    the direction of the traces should be inclined to the horizon when the horse is
                    at rest, in order that it may be horizontal when he lowers his breast and exerts
                    his utmost force. The particular manner, however, in which living agents exert
                    their strength against great loads, seems to have been unknown both to Camus and
                    Couplet, and to many succeeding writers upon this subject. It is to Μ.
                    Deparcieux, an excellent philosopher and ingenious mechanic, that we are
                    indebted for the only accurate information with which we are furnished; and we
                    are sorry to see that philosophers who flourished after him have overlooked his
                    important instructions. In his memoir on the draught of horses he has shown, in
                    the most satisfactory manner, that animals draw by their weight, and not by the
                    force of their muscles. In four-footed animals, the hinder feet is the fulcrum
                    of the lever by which their weight acts against the load, and when the animal
                    pulls hard, it depresses its chest, and thus increases the lever of its weight,
                    and diminishes the lever by which the load resists its efforts. Thus, in fig.
                    144, let P be the load, AD the line of traction, and let us suppose FC to be the
                    hinder leg of the horse, and AE part of its body, A its <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205568" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5568-0442"/>chest or centre of gravity,
                    and CE the level road. Then AFC will represent the crooked lever by which the
                    horse acts, which is equivalent to the straight one AC. But when the horse’s
                    weight acts downwards at A, so as to drag forward the rope AD and raise the load
                    P, CE will represent the power of the lever in this position, or the lever of
                    the horse’s weight, and CF the lever by which it is resisted by the load,. or
                    the lever of resistance. Now if the horse lowers its centre of gravity A, which
                    it always does when it pulls hard, it is evident that CE, the lever of its
                    weight, will be increased, while CF, the lever of its resistance, will be
                    diminished, for the line of traction AD will approach nearer to CE. Hence we see
                    the great benefit which may be derived from large horses; for the lever AC
                    necessarily increases with their size, and their power is always proportioned to
                    the length of this lever, their weight remaining the same. Large horses,
                    therefore, and other animals, will draw more than small ones, even though they
                    have less muscular force, and are unable to carry such a heavy burden. The force
                    of the muscles tends only to make the horse carry continually forward his centre
                    of gravity; or, in other words, the weight of the animal produces the draught,
                    and the play and force of its muscles serve to continue it.</p>
                <p>From these remarks, thςp, we may deduce the proper position of the line of
                    traction. When the line of traction is horizontal, as AD, the lever of
                    resistance is CF; but if this line is oblique to the horizon, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Ad,</hi> the lever of resistance is diminished to <hi
                    rend="italic">Cf,</hi> while the lever of the horse’s weight always remains the
                    same. Hence it appears, that inclined traces are much more advantageous than
                    horizontal ones, as they uniformly diminish the resistance to be overcome.
                    Deparcieux, however, has investigated experimentally the most favourable angle
                    of inclination, and found, that when the angle DAF made by the trace <hi
                    rend="italic">Ad</hi> and a horizontal line is fourteen or fifteen degrees, the
                    horses pulled with the greatest facility and force. This value of the angle of
                    draught will require the weight of the spring-tree bar, to which the traces are
                    attached in four-wheeled carriages, to be <hi rend="italic">one half of</hi> the
                    height of that part of the horse’s breast to which the fore end of the traces is
                    connected.</p>
                <p>When several horses are yoked in the same carriage, as represented in fig. 146,
                    and when the declivity changes, the length of the traces has a considerable
                    influence upon the draught. From the point E, where the traces are fastened to
                    the horse next the load, draw ER to the same point in the second horse R, and
                    let R' be another position of the second horse; it is required to find the
                    difference of effect that will be produced by placing the second horse at R or
                    at R', or the comparative advantages of short and long traces. From R', the
                    point where the traces are fixed, draw R'F'E; and from E draw <hi rend="italic"
                    >Emn</hi> parallel to the declivity DA. Take EF = EF' to represent the power of
                    the horse in the direction of the traces, which will be the same whether he is
                    yoked at R or at R'; draw EA perpendicular to DA, Fn, <hi rend="italic"
                    >F'rn</hi> parallel to EA, and Fp, <hi rend="italic">Ff</hi> parallel to <hi
                    rend="italic">En.</hi> Then, since the second horse when at R pulls with a force
                    represented by FE, in the direction FE, we may resolve this force into the two
                    forces <hi rend="italic">Eη,</hi> Ep, one of which En is solely employed in
                    dragging the cart up the inclined plane DA, while the other Ep is solely
                    employed in pressing the first horse E to the ground.. Let the horse be now
                    removed from R to R', the direction of the traces becomes RF'F, and F'E = FE is
                    the power exerted by the horse at R' and the direction in which it is exerted.
                    But this force is equivalent to the forces <hi rend="italic">Em, Ef,</hi> the
                    first of which acts directly against the load, while the other presses the horse
                    against the ground. Hence we see the disadvantages of long traces, for the force
                    which draws the load when the horse is at R' is to the force when the horse is
                    at R, as Em to En, and the forces which press the horse upon the ground as <hi

                    feet, ER' = 12 feet, then we shall have, from the preceding formulae, Fp =

                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Position of the Centre of Gravity, and the Manner of
                    disposing the Load.</hi></p>
                <p>If the axle-tree of a two-wheeled carriage pass through the centre of gravity of
                    the load, the carriage will be in equilibrio in every position in which it can
                    be placed with respect to the axle-tree; and in going up and down hill the whole
                    load will be sustained by the wheels, and will have no tendency either to press
                    the horse to the ground or to raise him from it. But if the centre of gravity is
                    above the axle-tree, as it must necessarily be, according to the present
                    construction of wheel-carriages, a great part of the load will be thrown on the
                    back of the horses from <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205581"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5581-0443"/>the wheels when going down a steep road, and thus
                    tend to accelerate the motion of the carriage, which the animal is striving to
                    prevent; while, in ascending steep roads, a part of the load will be thrown
                    behind the wheels, and tend to raise the horse from the ground, when there is
                    the greatest necessity for some weight on his back to enable him to fix his feet
                    in the earth, and overcome the great resistance which is occasioned by the
                    steepness of the road. On the contrary, if the centre of gravity is below the
                    axle, the horse will be pressed to the ground in going up hill, and lifted from
                    it when going down. In all these cases, therefore, where the centre of gravity
                    is either on the axle-tree or directly above it or below, the horse will bear no
                    part of the load in level ground. In some situations the animal will be lifted
                    from the ground when there is the greatest necessity for his being pressed to
                    it, and he will sometimes bear a great proportion of the load when he should
                    rather be relieved of it.</p>
                <p>The only way of remedying these evils is to assign such a position to the centre
                    of gravity, that the horse may bear some portion of the weight when he must
                    exert great force against the load, that is, in level ground, and when he is
                    ascending steep roads; for no animal can pull with its greatest effort unless it
                    is pressed to the ground. Now this may be in some measure effected in the
                    following manner. Let BCN (fig. 144) be the wheel of a cart, AD one of the
                    shafts, D that part of it where the cart is suspended on the back of the horse,
                    and A the axle-tree; then, if the centre of gravity of the load is placed at <hi
                    rend="italic">in,</hi> a point equidistant from the two wheels, but below the
                    line DA, and before the axle-tree, the horse will bear a certain weight on level
                    ground, a greater weight when he is going up hill and has more occasion for it,
                    and less weight when he is going down hill, and does not require to be pressed
                    to the ground: all this will be evident from the figure. When we recollect that
                    the shaft DA is horizontal, the centre of gravity will press more upon the point
                    of suspension D the nearer it comes to it; or the pressure upon D, or the
                    horse’s back, will be proportional to the distance of the centre of gravity from
                    A∙ If <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> therefore, be the centre of gravity, óA will
                    represent its pressure upon D, when the shaft DA is horizontal. When the cart is
                    ascending a steep road, AH will be the position of the shaft, the centre of
                    gravity will be raised to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and αA will be the pressure
                    upon D. But if the cart is going down hill, AC will be the position of the
                    shaft, the centre of gravity will be depressed to <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and
                    cA will represent the pressure upon the horse’s back. The weight sustained by
                    the horse, therefore, is properly regulated by placing the centre of gravity at
                    <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> We have still, however, to determine the proper length
                    of <hi rend="italic">bα</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bm,</hi> the distance of the
                    centre of gravity from the axle, and from the horizontal line DA; but as these
                    depend upon the nature and inclination of the road, upon the length of the shaft
                    DA, which depends on the size of the horse, on the magnitude of the load, and on
                    other variable circumstances, it would be impossible to fix their value. If the
                    load, along with the cart, weighs 400 pounds, if the distance DA be eight feet,
                    and if the horse should bear 50 pounds of the weight; then Z&gt;A should be one
                    foot, which, being one eighth of DA, will make the pressure upon D exactly 50
                    pounds. If the road slopes four inches in a foot, <hi rend="italic">bin</hi>
                    must be four inches, or the angle <hi rend="italic">b∆m</hi> should be equal to
                    the inclination of the road; for then the point <hi rend="italic">m</hi> will
                    rise to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> when ascending such a road, and will press with
                    its greatest force on the back of the horse.</p>
                <p>When carts are not made in this manner, we may in some degree obtain the same end
                    by judiciously disposing the load. Let us suppose that the centre of gravity is
                    at 0 when the cart is loaded with homogeneous materials, such as sand, lime,
                    &amp;c.; then if the load is to consist of heterogeneous substances, or bodies
                    of different weights, we should place the heaviest at the bottom and nearest the
                    front, which will not only lower the point <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> but will
                    bring it forward, and nearer the proper position <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> Part
                    of the load, too, might be suspended below the fore part of the carriage in dry
                    weather, and the centre of gravity would approach still nearer the point rn.
                    When the point <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is thus depressed, the weight on the
                    horse is not only judiciously regulated, but the cart would be prevented from
                    overturning; and in rugged roads the weight sustained by each wheel would be in
                    a great degree equalized.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Composition for diminishing the Friction of the Wheels of
                    Carriages, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>The following composition has been very recently discovered by Mr Partridge, and
                    secured by patent.</p>
                <p>“To about twenty gallons of clear soft water apply three or four pounds of fresh
                    lime, put them into a cask, and stir them well about; then let it stand about
                    twenty-four hours, or until the water is quite clear, when it may be drawn off
                    as wanted. The lime-water should be stirred up every five or six days, that the
                    water may be kept fully impregnated with the lime. To one part or proportion of
                    this solution of lime water add one part or proportion of olive oil. These
                    ingredients are to be placed in an open vessel, and whisked, beat, or stirred
                    well together until they are completely blended; or they may be placed in a
                    bottle or jar, and well shaken, until the same effect takes place. The
                    composition of lime-water and oil will then have the consistency and appearance
                    of thick cream; and if the composition made from the above proportions should be
                    found too thick, it may be thinned or reduced in consistency by adding a little
                    more oil; and I would remark, that the composition should be well shaken or
                    mixed up before using; and the lime-water should be kept free from air, and as
                    cool as possible.</p>
                <p>“For axle-trees and other bearings this composition will be found superior to
                    pure oil, and will not be consumed so rapidly.</p>
                <p>“To render this composition more applicable to the lubrication of cogs or teeth
                    of wheels, Mr Partridge prefers whale or other common oil, which may be used in
                    one part or proportion to two parts or proportions of limewater; and when
                    perfectly commixed, as before stated, to it is to be added palm oil or tallow,
                    or both, and well rubbed or ground therewith until the composition assumes the
                    appearance of thick paste, when a small quantity of carbonaceous matter, such as
                    plumbago, black lead, or soot, may be added, and when incorporated with each
                    other, the composition will be fit for use.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Carriages.</hi></p>
                <p>In figure 147 is represented a carriage invented by Mr Richard, a physician in
                    Rochelle, which moves without horses, merely by the exertion of the passengers.
                    The' machinery by which this is effected is placed in a box behind the carriage,
                    and is shown in fig. 148, where AA is a small axis fixed into the box, and E a
                    pulley over which a rope passes, whose two extremities are tied to the ends of
                    the levers or treddles C, D: the other ends of the levers are fixed by joints to
                    the cross-beam MN. The cranks FF are fixed to the axle KL, and move upon it as a
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205594" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5594-0444"/>centre. Each
                    of them has a detent tooth at F, which catches in the teeth of the wheels H, H,
                    so that they can move from F to H with' out moving the wheel, but the detent
                    tooth catches in the teeth of the wheels when the cranks are brought backward,
                    and therefore bring the wheel along with them. When the foot of the passenger,
                    therefore, is placed upon the treddle D, it brings down the crank F, and along
                    with it the wheel H, so that the large wheels fixed on the same axis perform
                    part of a revolution; but when D is depressed, the rope DA descends, the
                    extremity C of the other treddle rises, and the crank F rising along with it,
                    takes into the teeth of the wheel H, so that when the elevated treddle C is
                    depressed, the wheels H, H, and consequently the wheels I, I, perform another
                    part of a revolution. In this way, by continuing to work at the treddles, the
                    machine advances with a regular pace.</p>
                <p>A carriage of this kind, where the mechanism is much more simple and beautiful
                    than that which we have described, has been lately invented and constructed by
                    Mr Nasmyth of Edinburgh, a gentleman whose mechanical genius is scarcely
                    inferior to his talents as a painter. The pulley E and axle A A. are rendered
                    unnecessary; leather straps are substituted in place of the cranks F, F, and the
                    whole mechanism is contained in two small cylindrical boxes about six inches in
                    diameter and one and a half broad.</p>
                <p>A carriage driven by the action of the wind is exhibited in fig. 149. It is fixed
                    on four wheels, and moved by the impulse of the wind upon the sails C, D, being
                    guided by the rudder E. Carriages of this kind will answer very well in a level
                    country, where the roads are good and the wind fair; and are said to be much
                    used in China. In Holland they sometimes use similar vehicles for travelling
                    upon the ice; but they have a sledge instead of wheels, so that if the ice
                    should happen to break, there will be no danger of sinking. Stephinus, a
                    Dutchman, is said to have constructed one of these carriages with wheels, which
                    travelled at the rate of twenty-one miles an hour with a very strong wind.</p>
                <p>The carriage represented in fig. 150 is made so as to sail against the wind by
                    means of the spiral sails E, F, G, H, one of which, F, is expanded by the wind.
                    The impulse of the wind upon the sails gives a rotatory motion to the axle Μ,
                    furnished with a cog-wheel K, whose trundles act upon teeth placed on the inside
                    of the forewheels.</p>
                <p>A carriage which cannot be overturned is represented in figure 151, where AB is
                    the body of the carriage, consisting of a hollow globe, made of leather or wood,
                    at the bottom of which is placed an immoveable weight proportioned to the load
                    which the carriage is to bear. Two horizontal circles of iron D, E, connected
                    with bars HI, and two vertical circles F, G, surround the globe; and the wheels
                    are fastened by a handle K to the perpendicular bars HL Then, since the body of
                    the carriage moves freely in every direction within the iron circles, the centre
                    of gravity will always be near C, and the carriage will preserve an upright
                    position even if the wheels and frame were overturned.</p>

                <p>As machines for various purposes in the arts have already been described in their
                    appropriate places, we shall confine ourselves, in the present division of this

                    elements which enter into the composition of all machines; of machines which are
                    illustrative of the general doctrines of mechanics; and of a few others which
                    have not been described in any previous part of this work.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I.—ON MECHANICAL NOTATION, OR THE METHOD</p>
                <p>OF EXPRESSING BY SIGNS THE ACTION OF MACHINERY.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> We have already given a general notice of this
                    import- ‘ant method, invented by Mr Babbage, and pointed out its great
                    importance in mechanics. We shall now endeavour to explain it more minutely, and
                    show the method of applying it to a machine of a given structure. The first step
                    in this method consists in drawing, on a sheet of paper, as many vertical lines
                    as there are pieces or moving parts in the machine; to each of these pieces its
                    name must be affixed, and the letter which marks it out in the drawing. These
                    vertical lines must then be crossed with horizontal lines, upon which we must
                    write,</p>
                <p>1. The nature of the motion of each piece, indicated by a conventional sign.</p>

                    machine.</p>
                <p>4. The mode in which the motion is communicated or transmitted.</p>
                <p>5. The modes of adjustment, some of which are permanent and made by the
                    mechanist, while others depend on the nature of the work they are intended to
                    perform, such as the distance between the mill-stones in a flour-mill, on which
                    the finenéès of the flour depends, or such as the winding up of the weight or
                    spring, which may be called a periodic adjustment.</p>
                <p>6. The times or durations of the movements.</p>
                <p>Mr Babbage employs two classes of signs, viz. those for indicating the peculiar
                    nature of the means by which the motion is transmitted, and those which denote
                    the state of motion or rest of every particular part of the machine. The first
                    of those classes are as follows:</p>
                <p>1. When one piece receives its motion from another, in consequence of being
                    permanently fixed to it, such as a pin upon a wheel, or a wheel and pinion on
                    the same axis. This may be indicated by an arrow with a bar at the end,
                    thus,</p>
                <p>2. When one piece is moved by another, so that the motion of the one is the
                    necessary result of the motion of the other, but without any permanent
                    connection, as when a pinion drives a wheel, the motion may be indicated by an
                    arrow without a bar, thus,</p>
                <p>3. When the piece moved is attached to the piece that moves it by stiff friction,
                    the sign is an arrow formed by a line interrupted by dots, thus,</p>
                <p>4. When the piece moved does not always move with the piece that moves it, as in
                    the case of a stent lifting a ball once in the course of its revolution, the
                    sign may be an arrow half full and half dotted, thus,</p>
                <p>5. When one wheel is connected with another by a ratchet, as the great wheel of a
                    clock is attached to the fusee, we may use a dotted arrow with a ratchet-hook at
                    its end, thus,</p>
                <p>The second class of signs are as follows:</p>
                <p>1. Unbroken lines indicate motion.</p>
                <p>2. Lines on the right side indicate motion from right to left.</p>
                <p>3. Lines on the left side indicate motion from left to right.</p>
                <p>4. Parallel straight lines denote uniform motion.</p>
                <p>5. Curved lines denote a variable velocity, and the ordinates of the curve should
                    express the velocity.</p>
                <p>6. When the motion begins at a fixed point, and its termination is uncertain, the
                    line must begin with a small cross, line.</p>
                <p>7. When the commencement of the motion is uncertain, and its termination fixed,
                    the line must end with a small cross line.</p>
                <p>8. Dotted lines imply rest.</p>
                <p>9. If the thing be indicated by a check, bolt, or valve, its dotted line should
                    be on the right side if it is out of action, unbolted, or open, and on the left
                    side if the reverse.</p>
                <p>10. If a bolt can rest in three positions; Isí, bolted on the right side; 2d,
                    bolted on the left side; 3cζ unbolted; the figures are,</p>
                <p>1. Bolted on the right side.</p>
                <p>2. Bolted on the left side.</p>
                <p>3. Unbolted, the two lines being nearer the indicating line.</p>
                <p>As illustrations of the application of this method, Mr Babbage has selected the
                    common eight-day clock and the hydraulic ram; but these examples are a little
                    too complicated, especially that of the clock, which would require several
                    plates to make it intelligible. We have therefore taken the case of an ideal but
                    simple machine, which consists of a large wheel driving a system of levers and
                    stampers, also a large beam driven by a crank. The motion is communicated by
                    means of ropes. The system of signs is shown in Plate CCCXLVIII.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II. ON THE ELEMENTS OF MACHINERY.</p>
                <p>The simple mechanical powers, which we have already fully described, are in
                    reality machines or instruments by which useful mechanical effects are produced;
                    but a <hi rend="italic">machine</hi> is, properly speaking, a combination of the
                    simple mechanical powers, arranged in such a manner as to produce the desired
                    effect. The nature of this combination depends not only on the kind of
                    mechanical agent which is to be the first mover, and on the nature of the work
                    to be performed, but often on the locality of the machine itself, and other
                    accidental causes; and the skill of the engineer is pre-eminently conspicuous in
                    the adaptation of his machinery to these secondary conditions.</p>
                <p>The principal elements of machinery are cylindrical and conical or bevelled
                    wheels and pinions, and rack-work. When an axis is to receive motion from
                    another axis lying parallel to it, the effect is produced by placing a <hi
                    rend="italic">cylindrical</hi> wheel upon each, as in fig. 104, so that half the
                    sum of the diameters of the two wheels may be equal to the distance of the axes,
                    and making the number of teeth in each wheel inversely proportional to the
                    respective velocities <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205620"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5620-0446"/>which are required in the two axes. If the two
                    axes are inclined to each other, then <hi rend="italic">conical</hi> wheels are
                    used, as shown in figs. 125, 126, and 128.</p>
                <p>But it is not always necessary that the wheels move one another by means of
                    teeth. In machines where the resistance of the work is trifling, one wheel may
                    drive another by the <hi rend="italic">mere friction</hi> of their
                    circumferences. This may be done in several ways.</p>
                <p>1. The circumference of the wheels may be faced with buff leather, the friction
                    of which upon itself is considerable. We have seen this plan adopted in a pair
                    of bellows, where the wind is propelled by a revolving vane which is driven by a
                    winch and two intermediate wheels faced with buff. The circumferences of the
                    wheels are pressed against each other by a spring, in order to maintain
                    sufficient contact for the purpose. Rims made of caoutchouc would answer the
                    purpose much better.</p>
                <p>2. The circumference of the wheels may be faced with wood cut across the grain.
                    Dr 0. Gregory informs us that this plan was actually adopted in a saw-mill at
                    Southampton, where all the wheels impelled one another by the contact of the end
                    grain of the wood. The machine did its work with very little noise, and wore
                    very well, having been in use for twenty years.</p>
                <p>The same effect might be produced by putting a circumference of metal containing
                    a great number of small blunt spikes or points upon the impelling wheel, and a
                    rim of hard wood upon the other, upon which these blunt spikes act in turning
                    it.</p>
                <p>When one wheel drives another, they necessarily turn in opposite directions. If
                    it is required that they should move in the same direction, the best way is to
                    unite them by a rope or leather belt which does not cross itself at any point
                    between the wheels, for if the belt crosses, the wheels will move in opposite
                    directions.</p>
                <p>The great use of ropes or belts is to communicate motion from one axle to
                    another, at such a distance that two wheels uniting the axles would be
                    ridiculously large. In belts the motion is conveyed by friction. The friction
                    between the impelling wheel and the belt puts the belt in motion, and the
                    friction of the belt upon the impelled wheel moves it in the same manner.</p>
                <p>The great disadvantage of ropes and belts however is, that they become slack, and
                    thus lose their power of turning the wheel. This evil may be partially removed
                    by increasing the friction by rubbing them with chalk, or, what is still better,
                    by shortening them. Another method equally effectual, is to have upon one of the
                    wheels grooves of different diameters, so that a slack belt maybe tightened by
                    slipping it upon a groove of larger diameter. This however alters the velocity
                    of the axle upon which this change has been made;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In a turning-lathe or an electrical machine,
                    where a change of velocity does no harm, this contrivance answers very
                    well.</p></note> and the only way to remove this evil, or to tighten a belt
                    without altering the relative velocity of the two axles, is to have grooves of
                    corresponding diameters on both wheels, so that the loose belt may be half
                    tightened by shifting it to a groove of larger diameter on one wheel, and the
                    tightening completed by shifting it also to a groove of larger diameter on the
                    other wheel. The best method, however, of effecting the object in question would
                    be to have one or more caoutchouc springs forming part of the belt.</p>
                <p>From these remarks it will be obvious, that in nice machinery, where regular
                    movements are essential to its performance, or in cases where the work occasions
                    a great strain upon the machinery, belts and ropes cannot with propriety or
                    safety be employed. In such cases chains of various forms are substituted in
                    their place. These chains are sometimes jointed like those of a watch, and
                    convey the motion by friction; but in general it is necessary to adopt quite a
                    different kind of chain, and to make them lay hold of pins or hooks projecting
                    from the circumference which they put in motion. Two of these chains are shown
                    in the annexed figures. In fig. 152 the links of the chain AC lay hold of the
                    pins/», <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> projecting from the circumference of the wheel
                    DE.</p>
                <p>In fig. 153, metallic teeth <hi rend="italic">t, t, t,</hi> project from the
                    jointed chain ABC, and enter into grooves or indentations in the circumference
                    of the wheel. Various chains used in machinery are shown in the annexed figure.
                    That marked A was invented and used by the great mechanist Vaucanson.</p>
                <p>One of the simplest and most durable expedients for communicating motion is the
                    <hi rend="italic">crank,</hi> which is nothing more than a lever fixed upon the
                    axis, which is to be moved by a force applied to the end of the lever. This
                    lever may be fixed at the end of the axis, as in the common grindstone, or in
                    the electrical machine, where wheels are not used; or it may be fixed upon a
                    wheel carried by the axle, when the object of the mechanism is to put a wheel in
                    motion. This is the case in the old cylindrical electrical machines, where a
                    handle is fixed upon the face of the largest wheel, employed to give velocity to
                    the cylinder. The crank lever may be fixed in the middle of an axis; but in this
                    case the axis must necessarily be bent, and the force applied at the part
                    projecting from the axle, as shown in fig. 155, where <hi rend="italic">mn</hi>
                    is the axis, bent twice, at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and c, so as to form a
                    double crank. Now if one man were to apply his force at <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    and another at <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> they would work with a lever whose
                    length was equal to the distance of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> from the axle or line <hi rend="italic">mn.</hi> A triple
                    crank is shown at fig. 156; and a variable single crank in fig. 157 where <hi
                    rend="italic">mn</hi> is the axle, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the point where the
                    power is applied, and <hi rend="italic">c, d,e,f,</hi> four parallel bars,
                    which, by pins passing through the small holes, may be fixed in any position, so
                    as to vary the distance of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn.</hi> In place of applying the power of a man at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    the power of any other mechanical agent may be made∣ to turn the axle <hi
                    rend="italic">rnn,</hi> by means of rods <hi rend="italic">ba, de,</hi> fig.
                    155, &amp;c. which have a reciprocating or a backward and forward rectilineal
                    motion. This is exemplified in <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205633"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5633-0447"/>the grind-stone and the turning lathe, where the
                    power is the downward pressure of the foot of a man upon a foot-board, as in
                    fig. 158, where A may be a grindstone, or a wheel driving a pinion.</p>
                <p>When the power applied at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is obtained from the
                    reciprocating motion of a rod, as in the case of a steam-engine, it acts as in
                    the annexed figure, where <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is the crank fixed near the
                    circumference of the wheel A, and MN a vertical rod moving upwards and downwards
                    between the guides c¢f, <hi rend="italic">er,</hi> and connected with the crank
                    by the bar <hi rend="italic">ab.</hi></p>
                <p>When a man and a power moving in a fixed direction are applied to the same crank,
                    the mode of action is in the two cases essentially distinct. In every mode of
                    action both the man and the power push in one semicircumference of the circle,
                    which the end of the crank describes, and pull in the other semicircumference;
                    and it is very obvious, that in every position of the crank, both powers must
                    act with different degrees of effect. When the crank lever is horizontal, and
                    the man pushes it down with the aid of his weight, his force is a maximum; and
                    when he pulls it upwards in the next horizontal position, his force is very
                    great. At all intermediate positions he works to a disadvantage; but there are
                    no positions of the crank in which the man has <hi rend="italic">no power to
                    turn it,</hi> because he is able to apply his power in any direction he chooses.
                    This, however, is impossible when the man worksby a vertical pressure, or a
                    pressure given in direction upon a foot-board, or when the crank is moved by a
                    reciprocating rod. In these cases, as will be seen at A, B, C, D in the annexed
                    figures, there are two opposite positions in which the rod has no power to move
                    the crank. This happens in the positions C and D, where the centre <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> is between <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> or when <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is between <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> In the other positions shown in the figures, the
                    power of the rod <hi rend="italic">ba</hi> to move the crank is proportional to
                    the perpendicular let fall upon <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> from the centre <hi
                    rend="italic">m;</hi> and when that perpendicular coincides with <hi
                    rend="italic">ma,</hi> or when <hi rend="italic">mα</hi> is perpendicular to <hi
                    rend="italic">ba,</hi> the power is a maximum either in pushing or pulling the
                    lever.</p>
                <p>A combination of <hi rend="italic">two cranks</hi> has been used for producing a
                    [high ^degree of pressure. This will be understood from the annexed figure,
                    where the same lever BC unites two crank levers AB, CD, which move round joints
                    or centres at A, B, C, and D. If we suppose a moving force applied to DC, to
                    make it turn round D from right to left, it is obvious that the lever BC will be
                    pulled in the direction BC with the greatest force, when BCD is a straight line.
                    The force thus exerted acts upon the lever AB at B, and it will exert the
                    greatest force when CB is perpendicular to BA. The force therefore originally
                    applied to move CD will be very great when exerted at A. This combination of
                    cranks is used in the Stanhope press, in which' the axle C drives a screw, which
                    presses the paper with great force upon the types.</p>
                <p>Another contrivance similar in principle to the crank is frequently introduced
                    into machinery. It is called the <hi rend="italic">Eccentric,</hi> and is shown
                    in fig. 165, where AB is a rod which is to be raised and depressed between Fig.

                    BED fixed to BA by a joint at B. As the axis C and the circle DE form one piece,
                    and as C is fixed in position, the effect of turning the axis C must be to raise
                    and depress BA between the guides, the power being always proportional, as in
                    the crank, to a perpendicular let fall from C upon BD. When this perpendicular
                    vanishes, which happens when the line CO coincides with BO, the rod A will be at
                    its highest or its lowest point.</p>
                <p>An ingenious contrivance for conveying motion is known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hookds Universal Joint.</hi> The driving axis and the axis to be
                    driven are shown at A, B. Each of them terminates in semicircles, joining two
                    rectangular bars, CD, EF, by means of pivots at their extremities C, D, E, F. It
                    is obvious that when A is made to revolve, B will revolve with the same
                    velocity; for if A moves round without changing its direction, the points C, D
                    must move in a circle round the intersection of the crossed bars, and this
                    motion of the cross will make the points E, F move round the same intersection,
                    in consequence of which the shaft B will revolve, the two shafts turning in the
                    very same manner as if each had a pivot at the intersection, and were impelled
                    with equal velocities. The one axis A will not drive the other B if their
                    vertical inclination is less than 140.</p>
                <p>When the inclination of the axis is between 50° and 90°, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >double universal joint</hi> is used, consisting of <hi rend="italic">four</hi>
                    semicircles and two crosses, and acting in the same manner as theother. It is
                    shown in the annexed figure. Another form of the apparatus is shown in the
                    annexed figure. Universal joints may be constructed by fastening <hi
                    rend="italic">four</hi> pins 90° from one another on the circumference of a hoop
                    or solid ball.</p>
                <p>Universal joints are generally used in cotton-mills, where it is necessary to
                    convey the motion through great distances. In this case it is advisable to
                    divide the rods into lengths, and connect them by these joints. Universal joints
                    are also much used in large telescopes upon equatorial axes, in order to give
                    the vertical and horizontal motions to the tube while the observer continues to
                    look through it.</p>
                <p>Another instrument for connecting the parts of machines is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Carn, or Camb, or Wiper,</hi> and the general object of it is to
                    convert a circular into a rectilineal motion. It is extensively used in the
                    tambouring machinery, and in machines for making lace.</p>

                <p>CHAP. ΠΙ. ACCOUNT OF CONTRIVANCES FOR CHANGING</p>
                <p>ONE KINO OF MOTION INTO ANOTHER.</p>
                <p>The different changes of motion which are most useful in machinery may be
                    classified as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. A continued circular motion into a rectilineal, alternating, or vibrating
                    motion.</p>
                <p>2. A continued circular motion into a circular alternating motion.</p>
                <p>3. A continued rectilineal into a continued circular motion.</p>
                <p>4. A rectilineal alternating into a circular alternating motion.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">A continued circular into a rectilineal alternating
                    motion.</hi></p>
                <p>The simplest of all the contrivances for this purpose is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cam,</hi> already referred to. The cam may have one, <hi rend="italic"
                    >two,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">three,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">more</hi>
                    wipers, according as we wish to have <hi rend="italic">one, two, three</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">more</hi> alternations of the required motion during one
                    revolution of the axis of the cam. If the alternating or vibrating rod stand
                    vertically, it descends by its own weight, and is lifted by each succeeding cam.
                    If a pause is necessary after each descent, then there must be a blank space in
                    the revolving wheel, to allow the necessary time to elapse before the next cam
                    come round to elevate the stamper.</p>
                <p>If the alternating rod be placed horizontally, as <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi>
                    which moves between the guides <hi rend="italic">m, n,</hi> its ' extremity <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> presses against the spring <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> so as
                    to push the rod back again upon the succeeding wiper, which is placed on the
                    lateral face of the wheel AB, which is driven by a handle H. This contrivance is
                    used in the manufacture or fishing nets, and in a machine for pricking holes in
                    leather for making cards. In this last case the prickers will be placed at the
                    end <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and the spring s will bear against some projecting
                    shoulder of the bar. If all the teeth in AB were reduced to <hi rend="italic"
                    >one,</hi> they would form a circular inclined plane, and one vibration of <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi> would be performed during each revolution of the
                    wheel.</p>
                <p>Another contrivance for this purpose, namely, a <hi rend="italic">double rack and
                    pinion,</hi> is shewn in fig. 170. A pinion P, works in the teeth of the rack
                    AB, with circularends. This pinion can move freely in a groove <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> cutout of the cross piece CD. When the end B comes up to the pinion P,
                    by the revolution of the latter, a projecting piece <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    presses against the spring s; and the pinion descending in the groove <hi
                    rend="italic">mn,</hi> enters the lower side of the rack, and carries it back,
                    so that an alternating rectilineal motion is maintained.</p>
                <p>Another ingenious contrivance of the same kind is shewn in the annexed figure. In
                    this case the pinion P, is fixed, and the rack ' is moveable by means of two
                    jointed rods <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">cd.</hi> When the
                    pinion is at the circular end of the rack, the rack receives a small lateral
                    motion from <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> and c <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> which
                    brings forward the other side of the rack within the action of the pinion, in
                    order to produce the returning motion.</p>
                <p>An elegant piece of mechanism, invented by Μ. Zureda,is shewn in the annexed
                    figure. For the purpose of giving an alternating horizontal motion to the roda⅛,
                    a handle H, or any other means, turns the cylinder AB round its axis. Two
                    opposite grooves, like the threads ofafemale screw, are cut in its surface, so
                    as to unite or run into one another at both ends of the cylinder. The end <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> of the rod <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> fits this groove,
                    while the end amoves up and down in a groove in the frame CD. As the cylinder
                    revolves, the end <hi rend="italic">b</hi> follows the spiral direction of the
                    groove, till it reaches the end B, and it then enters the opposite groove, by
                    which it returns to its original place, as in the figure. If a cone be
                    substituted for the cylinder, the path of <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> or the
                    degree of its inclination to the revolving axis, is determined by the angle of
                    the cone.</p>
                <p>Another contrivance for producing a vertical alternating motion is shewn in fig.
                    173, where <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is a rod moving vertically between guides.
                    A wheel AB, put in motion by a handle or other means, carries a projecting pin
                    or cylinder <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which moves with a little play in the
                    curvilineal groove D, pED. As the wheel AB turns, the pin <hi rend="italic"
                    >p,</hi> carried along with it, acts on the under side of the curve, and
                    depresses the rod; and when the pin <hi rend="italic">p</hi> has reached its
                    lowest point, it begins to raise the rod <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> by acting on
                    the upper side D∕&gt;E of the groove. Ifthe groove DE had been a straight line,
                    the ascent or descent of <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> would have been variable,
                    being equal to the versed sine of the arch described by the wheel.</p>
                <p>When a circle revolves in the inside of another of <hi rend="italic">twice</hi>
                    the diameter, any point of the smaller circle will describe a straight line,
                    which is the diameter of the larger circle. This straight line is an epicycloid;
                    and this beautiful property has been embodied as a piece of mechanism, for
                    converting a continuous circular into a rectilineal alternating motion. The
                    mechanical expression of the geometrical property is shewn in <hi
                    rend="subscript"> β</hi> fig. 174, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205659"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5659-0449"/>where AB is a concave toothed wheel, in which
                    another wheel of half its diameter works. If the wheel C is made to revolve
                    within the other by means of a winch, any point in its circumference will
                    describe a straight line, and consequently any rod fixed to that point, and
                    lying in the direction of the diameter which the point describes, will have a
                    rectilineal alternating motion.</p>
                <p>The ingenious method of Μ. Berthelot of obtaining a continued circular from an
                    alternating motion is shewn in fig. 175. The alternating motion is communicated
                    from the frame</p>
                <p>GGGG, to hooks in which are fixed the ends of two ropes XX, YY, which pass round
                    the two wheels A, B, which move freely on the axis <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> in
                    one direction, but carry the axis along with them in another direction. This is
                    effected by ratchet wheels and clicks, one of which is placed on the inner side
                    of A, and the other on the outer side of B. By moving the frame to the right,
                    the wheel A being unable to move upon the axis <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi>
                    carries it round with it, and by moving the frame to the left, the wheel A being
                    no longer fixed by the click and ratchet turns freely on the axle <hi
                    rend="italic">mn,</hi> but the other B being now locked to the axle, carries the
                    axle <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> along with it, and in the same direction as the
                    wheel A did, so that the axle <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> then receives a
                    continued rotatory motion from the reciprocation of the frame <hi

                <p>Μ. Betancourt’s machine for converting continuous circular motions into
                    rectilineal alternating motions <hi rend="italic">of a given length,</hi> is
                    shewn in the annexed figure, where <hi rend="italic">ιb</hi> is the revolving
                    axis, the pivot of which below <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is supported by the
                    piece of wood <hi rend="italic">e</hi> furnished with two rollers which enter
                    into a groove (See fig. 177.) in the box <hi rend="italic">m'n',</hi> so that by
                    the motion of e to the right or the left, the axis <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> can
                    approach one after another to the toothed wheels F,G, and drive them by the
                    endless screw <hi rend="smallcaps">ä.</hi> Two clicks <hi rend="italic">a!b'
                    cd,</hi> turning round their axes <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> are fixed to <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and these clicks
                    carry two arms <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    perpendicular to them. A metallic bar <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> (fig. 177), with
                    a rectangular branch <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is fixed at the end of an axis <hi
                    rend="italic">gf,</hi> which carries a double fork <hi rend="italic">il</hi>; at
                    the end <hi rend="italic">g</hi> of the axis <hi rend="italic">gf,</hi> is fixed
                    a counterweight P. Two square pins <hi rend="italic">xy,</hi> whose projection
                    is equal in thickness to the clicks <hi rend="italic">a'b cd,</hi> are fixed in
                    the box <hi rend="italic">m'n'.</hi> Let us now suppose that the alternating
                    motion to be obtained from the rotation of the axis <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is
                    that of two buckets (one of which is seen at S, fig. 176, the other being down
                    in the welD, suspended at the extremities of a rope passing over the cylindrical
                    portion of the two wheels F,G, and coiled once round each. The action of the
                    machine will be as follows: When the branch <hi rend="italic">u</hi> has pushed
                    the click <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ’ to the left as in fig. 176, the endless
                    screw <hi rend="italic">h</hi> being brought into action with F drives it round,
                    and the click <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> falling by
                    its gravity, engages with the pin <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and presses the axis
                    <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> against the toothed wheel. The rope FS passes through
                    the fork <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> and when a button .s ’ upon the rope near S
                    is engaged in the fork <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> the piece <hi rend="italic"
                    >umn</hi> is made to turn about its axis <hi rend="italic">fg,</hi> and the arm
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> striking the handle <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> unlocks
                    the click <hi rend="italic">a'b'</hi> before taking a horizontal position. But
                    as soon as it passes this position the counterweight P falling on the other
                    side, the branch <hi rend="italic">u</hi> pushes the pin <hi rend="italic"
                    >c,</hi> and carries to the right hand the axis <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> which
                    carries the endless screw <hi rend="italic">h</hi> to engage itself with the
                    wheel G, the click <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> by its own weight engaging with the
                    pin <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> In this way the two cylinders behind F and G tum
                    with these wheels in opposite directions, and the bucket S descends while the
                    other ascends. A piece of iron is placed on the rims of the buckets to make them
                    take a position for discharging the water as at S. The axis <hi rend="italic"

                    the reverse.</hi></p>
                <p>A very ingenious piece of mechanism for converting an alternating circular into a
                    continued circular motion, is shewn in the annexed figure. The axis AB is made
                    to move as if driven by a pendulum swinging at A. This axle carries two ratchet
                    wheels <hi rend="italic">nι n</hi> with their teeth oppositely inclined, and
                    also two bevelled tooth wheels C, D, which are however only slightly fixed to it
                    by friction. These last wheels carry two catches <hi rend="italic">p, q,</hi> so
                    that when one or other falls into the teeth of the ratchet wheels <hi
                    rend="italic">m, η,</hi> this wheel moves round along with the axis, while the
                    other wheel, which is not connected with its catch, moves round by any force
                    greater than its friction. The bevelled wheel E, which is to receive a continued
                    circular motion, is engaged by its teeth both in C and D.</p>
                <p>If we suppose the axis AB to swing so that <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and C are
                    fixed by the catch <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the wheel C will turn with the
                    axle, and the wheel E will move in the same direction; and as the teeth on the
                    right hand side of E are engaged on those of D, the latter will turn round upon
                    the axle AB. WTιen AB returns, or its motion is reversed, the teeth of <hi

                    as before, the wheel C now moving loosely upon AB. By changing the place of the
                    ratchet wheel and catches, the motion of E would be reversed.</p>
                <p>Another example of the change of motion under our consideration is seen when
                    wipers fixed upon a revolving wheel raise a forge hammer moveable about a

                <p>Another contrivance of this kind is shewn in the annexed figure, where AB is a
                    one toothed wheel, the tooth being an inclined plane winding round its axis.
                    This plane presses against the extremity <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of a crooked
                    lever <hi rend="italic">abc,</hi> and gives it an alternating circular motion

                    centre C, a spring s occasioning the return of the lever to receive a new
                    impulse from the revolving plane. By loading the arm <hi rend="italic">cba</hi>
                    the lever would return by the action of gravity alone.</p>
                <p>Μ. St. Cyr has produced an alternating circular motion, so that the velocity may
                    vary according to any required law by the mechanism in fig. 180; and he has
                    employed the principle used in the construction of equation clocks. An equation
                    curve BCD is’fixed on the annual wheel A, and in the curve is formed a groove in
                    which the pivot E can move. This pivot is united with the levers EF, EG, the
                    last being fixed to the cannon H which carries the minute hand HI, so that it
                    follows the vibration of the curve in more than one half of the circumference of
                    the minute dial which is sufficient to mark the inequalities arising from the
                    equation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                <p>Another pretty contrivance is shewn in fig. 181, where A, a wheel partly toothed
                    drives two toothed wheels B, C, on the same axis DE. After the toothed part A
                    has driven B through a certain angle, it quits it and drives C in the opposite
                    direction; thus giving an alternate circular motion to~DE.</p>

                <p>This change of motion is easily effected by means of a rectilineal rack acting
                    upon a toothed wheel; but the continued circular motion of the wheel must
                    terminate when it has made as many revolutions as the number of teeth in the
                    wheel are contained in the number of teeth in the rack.</p>

                    reverse.</hi></p>
                <p>This change of motion is exemplified in the drill-bow of watchmakers and smiths,
                    and in the handles of pumps. In the first the rectilineal alternating motion of
                    the bow gives a circular alternating motion to an axle round which the
                    bow-string is coiled. The extent of angular motion of the axle is determined by
                    the number of times that the circumference of the pulley upon the axle is
                    contained in the length of the stroke of the bow. In pumps the handle moves
                    through an arch of a circle when the piston rises or falls in a straight
                    line.</p>
                <p>The various contrivances used by the early constructors of steam engines, and the
                    more elegant ones invented by Mr. Watt for giving an alternating motion to the
                    beam by the rectilineal movements of the piston belong to this class of
                    contrivances, and will be fully described under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Steam Engine.</hi></p>
                <p>In the simple piece of mechanism shewn in fig. 182; the bar AB attached to the
                    axis C by two ropes AC, BC rises and falls by giving it a circular motion which
                    twists the ropes, and makes it rise towards C. In untwisting them by the
                    opposite motion of AB the bar descends. A drill D may thus be put in motion.</p>
                <p>The mechanism shewn in fig. 183 produces an analogous effect. The lever AB
                    vibrates round C as a centre. The ends of a rope FMLD are fixed at F, and D, and
                    pass over two pulleys Μ, N. By depressing the end B of the lever, ,, the point L
                    of the rope will move towards N; <hi rend="superscript"> and</hi> θϊ <hi

                    pieces which compose it, it is evident that if the ends MN open or shut by a
                    circular motion, the points A, B will approach to, or recede from, one

                <p>THE DOCTRINES OF MECHANICS, OB ARE CONNECTED WITH THEM.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Atwood’s Machine.</hi></p>
                <p>The machine invented by Mr. Atwood for illustrating the doctrines of accelerated
                    and retarded motion, is represented in figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Plate CCCXLIX∙,
                    and enables us to discover, 1st, the quantity of matter moved; 2d, the moving
                    force; 3d, the space described; 4th, the time of description; and, 5 th, the
                    velocity acquired at the end of that time.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Of the quantity of matter moved.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> In order to observe the effects of the moving force, which is the object
                    of any experiment, the interference of all other forces should be prevented; the
                    quantity of matter moved, therefore, considering it before any impelling force
                    has been applied, should be without weight; for though it be impossible to
                    abstract weight from any substance whatever, yet it may be so counteracted as to
                    produce no sensible effect. Thus, in the machine fig. 1, A, B represent two
                    equal weights affixed to the extremities of a very fine silk thread; this thread
                    is stretched over a wheel or fixed pulley <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi> moveable
                    round a horizontal axis: the two weights A, B being equal, and acting against
                    each other, remain in equilibrio; and when the least weight is superadded to
                    either (setting aside the effects of friction), it will preponderate. When AB
                    are set in motion by the action of any weight <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> the sum
                    A + B+<hi rend="italic">m</hi>, would constitute the whole mass moved, but for
                    the inertia of the materials which must necessarily be used in the communication
                    of motion. These materials consist of, 1st, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205685" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5685-0451"/>wheel <hi rend="italic"
                    >abed,</hi> over which the thread sustaining A and B passes; 2d, the four
                    friction wheels on which the axle of the wheel <hi rend="italic">abed</hi>
                    rests; 3d, the thread by which the bodies A and B are connected, so as when set
                    in motion to move with equal velocities. The weight and inertia of the thread
                    are too small to have any sensible effect on the experiments; but the inertia of
                    the other materials constitute a considerable proportion of the mass moved, and
                    must therefore be taken into account. Since, when A and B are put in motion,
                    they must move with a velocity equal to that of the circumference of the wheel
                    <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> to which the thread is applied; it follows, that if
                    the whole mass of the wheels were accumulated in this circumference, its inertia
                    would be truly estimated by the quantity of matter moved; but since the parts of
                    the wheels move with different velocities, their effects in resisting the
                    communication of motion to A and B, by their inertia, will be different; those
                    parts which are furthest from the axis resisting more than those which revolve
                    nearer in a duplicate proportion of those distances. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rotation.)</hi> If the figures of the wheels were regular, the distances of
                    their centres of gyration from their axis of motion would be given, and
                    consequently an equivalent weight, which being accumulated uniformly in the
                    circumference <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi> would exert an inertia equal to that
                    of the wheels in their constructed form, would also be given. But as the figures
                    are irregular, recourse must be had to experiment, to assign that quantity of
                    matter, which being accumulated uniformly in the circumference of the wheel <hi
                    rend="italic">abed,</hi> would resist the communication of motion to A in the
                    same manner as the wheels.</p>
                <p>In order to ascertain the inertia of the wheel <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi> with
                    that of the friction wheels, the weights AB being removed, the following
                    experiment was made :—</p>
                <p>A weight of thirty grains was affixed to a silk thread of inconsiderable weight;
                    this thread being wound round the wheel <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi> the weight
                    thirty grains, by descending from rest, communicated motion to the wheel, and by
                    many trials was observed to describe a space of about 38½ inches in three
                    seconds. From these data the equivalent mass or inertia of the wheels will be
                    known from this rule.</p>
                <p>Let a weight P, fig. 2, be applied to communicate motion to a system of bodies by
                    means of a very slender and flexible thread going round the wheel SLDIM, through
                    the centre of which the axis passes, (G being the common centre of gravity, R
                    the centre of gravity of the matter contained in this line, and 0 the centre of
                    oscillation). Let this weight descend from rest through any convenient space <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> inches, and let the observed time of its descent be <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> seconds; then if <hi rend="italic">l</hi> be the space
                    through which bodies descend freely by gravity in one second, the equivalent
                    weight sought= <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> y <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>,

                    3o5</p>
                <p>grains, or 2^ ounces.</p>
                <p>This is the inertia equivalent to that of the wheel <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi>
                    and the friction wheels together; for the rule extends to the estimation of the
                    inertia of the mass contained in all the wheels.</p>
                <p>The resistance to motion, therefore, arising from the wheel’s inertia, will be
                    the same as if they were absolutely removed, and a mass of 2½ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> ounces uniformly accumulated in the circumference of
                    the wheel <hi rend="italic">abed.</hi> This being premised, let the boxes A and
                    B be replaced, being suspended by the silk thread over the wheel or pulley <hi
                    rend="italic">abed,</hi> and balancing each other; suppose that any weight <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> be added to A, so that it shall descend, the exact
                    quantity of matter moved, during the descent of the weight A, will be
                    ascertained, for the whole mass will be A + B + ?« + 2| oz.</p>
                <p>In order to avoid troublesome computations in adjusting the quantities of matter
                    moved and the moving forces, some determinate weight of convenient magnitude may
                    be assumed as a standard; to which all the others are referred. This standard
                    weight in the subsequent experiments is a quarter of an ounce, and is
                    represented by the letter <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> The inertia of the wheels
                    being therefore =2^ ounces, will be denoted by 11 <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> A
                    and B are two boxes constructed so as to contain different quantities of matter,
                    according as the experiment may require them to be varied; the weight of each
                    box, including the hook to which it is suspended=I½ oz., or, according to the
                    preceding estimation, the weight of each box will be denoted by 6 <hi
                    rend="italic">m;</hi> these boxes contain such weights as are represented by
                    fig. 3, each of which weighs an ounce, so as to be equivalent to 4 <hi
                    rend="italic">m;</hi> other weights of½ oz.=2 <hi rend="italic">m,^-m,</hi> and
                    aliquot parts of <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> such as ½ <hi rend="italic">m, ½
                    m,</hi> may be also included in the boxes, according to the conditions of the
                    different experiments hereafter described.</p>
                <p>If oz. or 19 <hi rend="italic">m</hi>, be included in either box, this, with the
                    weight of the box itself, will be 25 <hi rend="italic">m;</hi> so that when the
                    weights A and B, each being 25 <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> are balanced in the
                    manner above represented, their whole mass will be 50 <hi rend="italic">m,</hi>
                    which being added to the inertia of the wheels 11 rn, the sum will be 61 <hi
                    rend="italic">m.</hi> Moreover, three circular weights, such as that which is
                    represented at fig. 4, are constructed, each of which =½ oz., or <hi
                    rend="italic">m;</hi> if one of these be added to A and one to B, the whole mass
                    will now become 63 <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> perfectly in equilibrio, and
                    moveable by the least weight added to either, (setting aside the effects of
                    friction), in the same manner precisely as if the same weight or force were
                    applied to communicate motion to the mass 63 rn, existing in free space and
                    without gravity.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The moving force.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> It will be
                    convenient here to apply a weight to the mass A as a moving force. When the
                    system consists of a mass=63 <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> according to the
                    preceding description, the whole being perfectly balanced, let a weight ½ oz.,
                    or <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> such as is represented in fig. 5, be applied on the
                    mass A; this will communicate motion to the whole system; by adding a quantity
                    of matter <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to the former mass 63 rn, the whole quantity
                    of matter moved will now become 64 rn; and the moving force being=<hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi>, this will give the force which accelerates the descent of

                <p>By the preceding construction, the moving force may be altered without altering

                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Of the space described.</hi> The body A, fig. 1, descends in
                    a vertical line; and a scale about sixty-four inches in length divided into
                    inches and tenths of an inch is adjusted vertical, and so placed that the
                    descending weight A may fall in the middle of a square stage, fixed to receive
                    it at the end of the descent; the beginning of the descent is esti <pb

                    the scale, when the bottom of the box A is on a level with 0. The descent of A
                    is terminated when the bottom of the box strikes the stage, which may be fixed
                    at different distances from the point 0; so that by altering the position of the
                    stage, the space described from rest may be of any given magnitude less than
                    sixty-four inches.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The time of description</hi> is observed by a seconds
                    pendulum; and the experiments may be so constructed that the time of motion
                    shall be a whole number of seconds. The estimation of the time, therefore,
                    admits of considerable exactness, provided the observer takes care to let the
                    bottom of the box A begin its descent precisely at any beat of the pendulum;
                    then the coincidence of the stroke of the box against the stage, and the beat of
                    the pendulum at the end of the time of motion, will show how nearly the
                    experiment and the theory agree. There might be various devices for letting the
                    weight A begin its descent at the instant of a beat of the pendulum W; for
                    instance, let the bottom of the box A, when at 0 on the scale, rest on a flat
                    rod, held in the hand horizontally; its extremity being coincident with 0, by
                    attending to the beats of the pendulum; and with a little practice, the rod
                    which supports the box A may be removed at the moment the pendulum beats, so
                    that the descent of A shall commence at the same instant.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Of the velocity acquired.</hi> It remains only to describe
                    in what manner the velocity acquired by the descending weight A, at any given
                    point of its path is made evident to the senses. The velocity of A’s descent
                    being continually accelerated will be the same in two points of the space
                    described. This is occasioned by the constant action of the moving force; and
                    since the velocity of A at any instant is measured by the space which would be
                    described by it moving uniformly for a given time with the velocity it had
                    acquired at that instant, this measure cannot be experimentally obtained, except
                    by removing the force by which the descending body’s acceleration was
                    caused.</p>
                <p>In order to shew in what manner this is effected particularly, let us again
                    suppose the boxes A and B=25m each, so as together to be =50m,∙ this with the
                    wheel’s inertia 11m will make 61m; now let m be added to A, and an equal weight
                    m to B. these bodies will balance each other, and the whole mass will be 63m. If
                    a weight m be added to A, motion will be communicated, the moving force being z⅛
                    and the mass moved 64m. In estimating the moving force, the circular weight =m
                    was made use of as a moving force; but for the present purpose of showing the
                    velocity acquired it will be^ convenient to use a flat rod, the weight of which
                    is also =m. Let the bottom of the box A be placed on a level with 0 on the
                    scale, the whole mass being as described above =63m, perfectly balanced. Now let
                    the rod, the weight of which =m, be placed on the upper surface of A; this body
                    will descend along the scale in the same manner as when the moving force was
                    applied in the form of a circular weight∙ Suppose the mass A, fig. 5. to have
                    descended by constant acceleration of the force of m, for any given time, or
                    through a given space: let a circular frame be so affixed to the scale,
                    contiguous to which the weight descends, that A may pass centrally through it,
                    and that this circular frame may intercept the rodanby which the body A has been
                    accelerated from rest. After the moving force m has been intercepted at the end
                    of the given space or time, there will be no force operating on any part of the
                    system which can accelerate or retard its motion; this being the case, the
                    weight A, the instant after m has been removed, must proceed uniformly with the
                    .velocity which it had acquired that instant: in the subsequent part of its
                    descent, the velocity being uniform will be measured by space described in any
                    convenient number of seconds.</p>
                <p>This machine is useful for estimating the velocities communicated by the impact
                    of elastic and nonelastic bodies; the resistance opposed by fluids, as well as
                    for various other purposes. It may be necessary to show in what manner the
                    motion of bodies resisted by constant forces are reduced to experiment by this
                    machine* Suppose the mass contained in the weights A and B, fig. 5, and the
                    wheels to be 61 <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> when in equilibrio; let a weight <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> be applied to B, and let two long weights or rods, each
                    =τn, be applied to A, then will A descend by the action of the moving force <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> the mass moved being 64∕∕z; suppose that when it has
                    described any given space by constant acceleration, the two rods <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi> are intercepted by the circular frame above described,
                    while A is descending through it, the velocity acquired by that descent is
                    known; and when the two rods are intercepted, the weight A will begin to move on
                    with the velocity acquired, being now retarded by the constant force <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and since the mass moved is 62 <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> the force of retardation will be <hi rend="subscript">
                    κ</hi> ⅛ part of that force whereby gravity retards bodies thrown
                    perpendicularly upwards. The weight A will therefore proceed along the graduated
                    scale in its descent, with an uniformly retarded motion, and the spaces
                    described, times of motion, and velocities destroyed by the resisting force,
                    will be subject to the same measures as in the examples of accelerated
                    motion.</p>
                <p>In this description, three suppositions have been assumed, which though <hi
                    rend="italic">physically</hi> are not <hi rend="italic">mathematically</hi>
                    true.</p>
                <p>1. It has been assumed that the force which communicates motion to the system, is
                    constant, which is true only when the line which suspends the weights A and B is
                    without weight. The effect of the string’s weight, however, is so trivial that
                    if, in a particular case, we calculate the time of descent we shall find it to
                    be 3.9896 seconds; and when the string’s weight is considered, 4.0208 seconds,
                    giving a difference of only three hundredths of a second, which is unappreciable
                    by observation.</p>
                <p>2. It has been also supposed that the bodies move in vacuo, but as the greatest
                    velocity is only 26 inches in a second, the time of descent cannot be increased
                    by the air’s resistance, the two hundred and fortieth part of the whole.</p>
                <p>3. The machinery has been supposed without friction, but the effect of the
                    friction is such that 1½ grains will destroy the equilibrium of the weights A
                    and B. In experiments, on retarded motion, where friction does become sensible,
                    it may be corrected by adding 1½ or 2 grains to the descending body, or a little
                    more than will destroy the equilibrium of A and B.</p>
                <p>In constructing one of these machines for the Faculty of Sciences at Paris, Mr.
                    Fortin has made a considerable improvement upon it by adding a detent for
                    causing the weight A to begin its descent at the instant that the second’s hand
                    marks; 0' ’ on the dial plate.</p>
                <p>This contrivance will be understood from the annexed figures. Two pillars of
                    brass e,/"fixed beneath the platform CD support a horizontal axis <hi
                    rend="italic">gh</hi> perpendicular to two arms of a lever, one of which is
                    larger than the other, the use of the shortest being to support the weight A in
                    its first position. (See fig. 186.) The longer lever being at first detained by
                    a catch, disengages <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205711"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5711-0453"/>itself and makes the axis <hi rend="italic"
                    >gh</hi> turn. The short lever turning at the same time leaves its first
                    position, and the weight A, no longer sustained by the short lever, begins to
                    move. In fig. 186, which is a section at right angles, to <hi rend="italic"

                    is fixed on a horizontal axis attached to the platform which supports the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Dunn’s improved Atwood?s Machine.</hi></p>
                <p>Mr. Dunn of Edinburgh has introduced two very valuable improvements into this
                    machine. The first consists in: selecting a line for suspending the weights of
                    as delicate a texture, and possessing as little rigidity as possible. He was led
                    to this improvement in consequence of finding by experiment that the greater
                    proportion of the whole resistance of a well made Atwood’s Machine is to be
                    ascribed to the rigidity of the cord employed; a circumstance which Mr. Atwood
                    had entirely overlooked. The second improvement consists in supporting the axis
                    of the large wheel or pully in the manner shewn infig&lt;6, plate CCCXLIX, which
                    represents the machine removed from the pillar on which it must be raised when
                    used. The mode of supporting the axis will be more readily perceived in the
                    annexed figure, where AB represents the axis terminating in „finely finished
                    conical points of tempered steel resting as represented on the sides of the
                    conical agate caps C, D, care being taken to adapt the form of the points of the
                    axis and the cups to each other, so that the portions of the axis in contact
                    with the agates may be of the smallest possible size.</p>
                <p>The agate caps are inserted into the ends of the large milled screws AB in the
                    frame of the instrument, fig. 6, plate CCCXLIX. When the wheel is put into its
                    place the screws A, B are turned forwards until they approach sufficiently near
                    each other to prevent the wheel being thrown out of its place, but not so near
                    as to force the points of the axis against the bottoms of the caps. In a number
                    of experiments made by a committee of the Society of Arts-for Scotland in 1828,
                    appointed to investigate the merits of Mr. Dunn’s machine, it was found that
                    when the wheel weighed 4458 grains (including the cord) the strings being loaded
                    with 60 grains each, the addition of <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> c</hi> of á grain produced a
                    very sensible motion; and when the load of each string was increased to 2423
                    grains, - <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> σ</hi> of a grain were sufficient. Hence it would appear from
                    these data, that under equal pressures the rigidity was three times the
                    friction.</p>
                <p>These results, however, when used for computing the momentum of the wheel gave an
                    inertia much greater than what its form and weight would have sanctioned, and
                    the experiments were repeated and a few others added. With these the results
                    were still discordant, and it was at last found that they had been materially
                    affected by the vibrations of the floor on which the machine stood. In order to
                    overcome this difficulty another set of experiments was instituted for detecting
                    the amount of resistance by observing its effects upon motions caused by
                    different accelerating forces. In all these the space described was seven feet,
                    and the time was measured by a metronome adjusted to ½ seconds. When one of the
                    ends was loaded with 40, and the other with 37 grains, the time was 26½ seconds;
                    and each end being loaded with 2423 grains, and an additional weight of 10
                    grains superadded to one, the time was 20 seconds, while when the accelerating
                    force was 100 grains, it was only 5½ seconds.</p>
                <p>From these experiments the whole resistance was found to be 2½ grains, (½ grains
                    more than that given by Atwood for the resistance of his machine), and the
                    inertia came out exactly to 2000 grains. It is probable, however, that of the 2
                    grains of friction allowed by Atwood, 1½ was owing to the greater rigidity of
                    his cord, and only ½ grain to real friction. Such a near coincidence in the
                    performance of the two machines, shews that for all practical purposes the
                    simple machine of Mr. Dunn is as good as the more complex one originally
                    invented by Mr. Atwood, and will, from its cheapness, be used in preference,
                    except, perhaps, in the few cases where the machine is desired to be the best
                    possible, and without any regard to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205724"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5724-0454"/>cost. But, even in this case, the greater
                    liability to be affected by dust, may render the advantages of the original form
                    doubtful. The object still to be aimed at is the reduction of the stiffness of
                    the silk line, for till that is still further reduced the diminution of the
                    friction, which is the smaller portion of the whole resistance, is less
                    essential, and Mr. Dunn, in partly disregarding it, has effected an important
                    practical improvement.</p>
                <p>The theory of this machine is a particular one of D’Alembert’s principle of the

                <p>This machine is represented in fig. 7, where KILM and LMNO are two flat pieces of
                    wood joined together by a hinge at LM; P is a graduated arch on which these
                    pieces of wood can be moved so as to subtend any angle not greater than 60°, and
                    <hi rend="italic">a, b</hi> two screws for fixing them at the required angle.
                    The back of the wedge will therefore be represented by IKNO, its sharp edge by
                    LM, and its two sides by KILM, LMNO. The weighty suspended to the wedge by the
                    hook T, and the weight of the wedge itself, may be considered as the force
                    employed to drive the wedge. The wooden cylinders AB, CD, have their extremities
                    made like two flat circular plates to prevent the wedge from slipping off at one
                    side. To the pivots of these cylinders, two of which are represented at <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> arc fastened the cords eW,∕U,
                    CV, AX, which passing over the pulleys U, V, X, W are fastened to the two bars
                    <hi rend="italic">u v, x w,</hi> on which any equal weights Y, Z may be hung at
                    pleasure. The tendency of these weights is evidently to draw the cylinders
                    towards each other, and they may therefore be regarded as the resistance of the
                    wood acting against the sides of the wedge. The cylinders themselves are
                    suspended by their pivots to the threads E, F, G, H, which may be fixed to the
                    ceiling of the room, or to the horizontal beam of a frame made on purpose. By
                    placing various equal weights at Y and Z, it may be easy to determine the
                    proportion between the power and the resistance when the wedge is in equilibrio.
                    In this machine the impelling power is the pressure of the weight <hi

                    had struck the sails at rest with the velocity which was thus given them. In the

                    moves freely along with OP and 00, on the joint 0. An inch, or any part of it,
                    being taken as the unit of length, and an ounce as that of weight, the joint P
                    is made to slide along OP, until OP contains as many inches as there are ounces
                    in the weight W ι; and Q is moved till OQ contains as many inches as Wz contains
                    ounces. By means of other sliding joints, PR and PQ are made equal to OQ and OP.
                    Strings are then fastened to the ends A, B, C of the slips OP, OQ, and R'O, and

                    tending to turn it in the opposite direction. In the present figure, for

                <p>Another property of such forces is deducible from this apparatus. If the forces

                    determine the magnitude and direction of a fifth force Ps, which shall place
                    them in equilibrium. On the surface of the board take any point N, and draw Nn

                <p>We must now find where to apply this balancing force, in order to satisfy the
                    condition expressed in the preceding formula. This will be effected by applying
                    it parallel to Nn, and at such a distance from Μ, that the product of 1 <hi

                    the sum of the similar products of all the other forces. The distance M∞5 may be
                    easily found, by dividing the difference of the sum of the products about Μ by
                    the force P5· If we now draw through Μ a line Mws&gt; equal to the distance

                    Standard Bushel.</hi></p>
                <p>When Captain Kater and Mr. Bate were employed by government in the adjustment and
                    construction of the new standard weights and measures, they were under the
                    necessity of constructing a balance capable of determining a weight equal to
                    that of the standard bushel measure, which was about 170 lbs., together with the
                    eighty lbs. of water it should contain, which made altogether a weight of 250
                    lbs. In this difficult task Mr. Bate has exhibited great skill and sagacity, in
                    combining with strength and solidity of structure that delicacy of adjustment
                    which the object he had in view rendered absolutely necessary.</p>
                <p>Mr. Bate’s balance is represented in the annexed figure.</p>
                <p>In the construction of the beam he first tried cast iron; but though it was as
                    light as was consistent with the required degree of strength, the inertia of the
                    mass was so considerable, that much time would have been lost before the balance
                    would have answered to the small differences he wished to ascertain. Lightness
                    being essentially necessary to the sensibility of the balance, and bulk being
                    also very desirable, in order to preclude such errors as might arise from
                    partial alterations of temperature in the beam, he determined to employ dry
                    mahogany. The beam was therefore made of a plank of this wood, about seventy
                    inches long, twenty-two inches wide, and 2½ thick, tapering from the middle to
                    the extremities. An opening was cut in the centre of gravity of the beam, as at
                    L, and strong blocks screwed to each side of the plank, to form a bearing for
                    the back of a knife edge -which passed through the centre. Similar blocks were
                    likewise screwed to each side of the plank at its extremities, to form
                    abearingfor the knife edgeswhich support the scales or pans.</p>
                <p>In order that the whole weight should not be thrown upon short portions of the
                    knife edges, as was usually the case, by which these edges were exposed to
                    injury, as well as to a change of form, Mr. Bate made his knife edges long, the
                    central one being six inches, and the other two five inches in length. They were
                    triangular prisms, with equal sides, each being 3-4ths of an inch long, very
                    carefully finished.</p>
                <p>The angles were of course 60° each, but they were ultimately wrought to an angle
                    of 120°, which prevented all risk of injury, without impeding the rotation of
                    the beam.</p>
                <p>The central knife edge, and the mode of attaching it, and the plane which
                    supports it to the beam L, and to the frame N, are shewn in the annexed figure.
                    The knife edge F is screwed to a thick plate of brass L, the touching surfaces
                    having been previously ground together.</p>
                <p>The support Μ upon which the knife edge rested, and revolved through its whole
                    length, was formed of a plate of polished hard steel screwed to a block of cast
                    iron; and this block was passed through the opening in the centre of the beam
                    already mentioned, and properly fixed to the frame of cast iron CC, fig. 192. By
                    means of screws <hi rend="italic">s, s,</hi> the knife edge is placed as
                    accurately as possible at right angles to the surface of the beam, and by means
                    of other screws, not seen in the figure, it is adjusted so as to be slightly
                    above the centre of its axis. In the cross horizontal bar, which is sustained by
                    the columns CC, and which carries the steel plane Μ, there is an aperture,
                    through which a fork-shaped piece of brass N passes, forming part of the stand
                    DED. This fork is completely detached from the beam when the balance is in use;
                    and by the motion of the handle H, it can be raised so as to make the fork catch
                    a piece L (see fig. 193), projecting from the piece of brass which carries the
                    knife edge. Two similar hooks are placed at the ends of the frame DED, by which
                    the other two knife edges may be raised above their supporting planes by the
                    motion of the handle H; and by this means the three knife edges are protected
                    from that injury which they would receive from always resting upon the steel
                    planes.</p>
                <p>The mechanism of the ends of the beam for carrying the knife edges and their
                    steel planes, is shewn in the annexed figure. These pieces project from the ends
                    of the beam, and are placed at exactly equal distances from the fulcrum, or
                    central knife-edge. In these pieces the knife edge F has its edge turned
                    upwards. The scales or pans are each attached by a hook to the lower end of
                    stirrups, shewn at S', which receive between their two uppermost branches the
                    extremity F ’ of the beam. The steel plane Μ'is fixed to the upper branches of
                    the stirrup, and rests upon the knife edge when the balance is in use. The knife
                    edges are adjusted, like the central one, by small screws, which give it a
                    horizontal and a vertical motion. The adjustment of the central knife edge to a
                    point a little above the centre of gravity of the beam, is facilitated by means
                    of small weights which screw on the wires seen between S' and N ’, in fig. 192;
                    and by screwing these nearer to or farther from the fulcrum, the centre of
                    gravity s is moved into its required place.</p>
                <p>Since this balance was described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826, Mr.
                    Bate has made a very great improvement upon it. By an ingenious device, the beam
                    and scales are in the first instance suspended on cylindrical axes, and
                    afterwards by continuing the motion of the handle H, they are made to rest upon
                    the knife edges. In this way the weights in the opposite scales may be nearly
                    balanced, while the beam and scales rest upon the cylindrical axis, and the
                    extremely delicate part of the operation will then be completed in a shorter
                    time when the beam and scales are put upon the knife edges.</p>
                <p>The performance of this balance was fully equal to the expectations of Captain
                    Kater and Mr. Bate. With 250 lbs. in each scale, the addition of a <hi
                    rend="italic">single grain</hi> produced an immediate variation in the index of
                    <hi rend="italic">one twentieth of an inch,</hi> to a radius of fifty inches.
                    Hence the balance was sensible to the ¶yfð¢ōü part of the weight.<note

                <p>This simple and accurate instrument which any person may readily construct for
                    himself, was invented by the celebrated Dr. Black, and an account of it
                    communicated to James Smithson, Esq. The beam AB was a thin piece of fir wood
                    not thicker than a shilling, a foot long, 1½-10ths of an inch thick at each end,
                    and twice that thickness at <pb break="no" facs="nls:194205763"

                    twenty parts by transverse lines, and each of these subdivided into <hi
                    rend="superscript"> s</hi> ∙ halves and quarters. One of the smallest needles
                    <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> was <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> fixed across the
                    middle with wax for the horizontal axis.</p>
                <p>A piece of plate brass, CD is bent so as to form three sides of a cube. It rests
                    on its middle side, and the two vertical sides form the fulcrum on which the
                    needle <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> rests. The height of <hi rend="italic">mn</hi>
                    above the table is only 1½ or two-tenths of an inch,’so as to allow only a very
                    limited play to the beam AB. The edges upon which the needle rests are ground at
                    the same time on a plain surface. The weights were one globule of gold weighing
                    one grain, and two or three others one-tenth of a grain each, along with a
                    number of small rings of fine brass wire formed by coiling it round a thicker
                    brass wire into a close spiral. The end of the wire being tied hard with a waxed
                    thread, the coiled wire was put into a vice, and a sharp knife being applied and
                    struck with a hammer, a great number of the coils were cut at one stroke, and
                    were found to be as equal to one another as could be wished. These weights were
                    about the 1-30th of a grain each, and by means of them the weight of any body
                    from one grain to the <hi rend="subscript"> τ2</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript">
                    δ</hi> of a grain could be readily weighed. By using a thinner beam and grinding
                    the needle to an edge, a still more delicate balance could be made, and a paper
                    scale added if necessary.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>This simple and ingenious piece of machinery is represented in fig. 197. which
                    the writer of this article found on a large scale on a series of paper-hangings
                    forrooms. The late Andw. Waddel, Esq. of Hermitage Hill, who had seen it at work
                    at Canton in 1786, had previously furnished us with a drawing of it. On the
                    floor FF, which is paved with tiles, was a concavity C lined with hard wood. A
                    roller R, having the cloth to be mangled wrapped round it, was placed in this
                    concavity. The weight used was a sandstone S of about 11 cwt., and shaped as at
                    A, so as to leave the line of direction from its centre of gravity, falling
                    within either of its two bases. By resting on the timber frame MN, the workman
                    steps on the uppermost end of the stone S, and causes its under surface to
                    descend gently upon the rolled up cloth R. He is then in the position shewn in
                    the figure, and by the alternate pressure of each foot he gives the stone an
                    oscillating motion which moves the roller over the cloth and the whole of the
                    smooth concave surface C, and with any degree of velocity that he chooses, till
                    the mangling of the cloth be completed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Account of the Mechanical Process of cutting Steel with Soft
                    Iron.</hi></p>
                <p>As this process seems to depend on a new principle of mechanical action, it may
                    probably be modified and extended, so as to produce effects which have not
                    hitherto been contemplated. The process to which we allude seems to have been
                    invented by the <hi rend="italic">Shakers</hi> in America. It consists in
                    cutting the hardest steel by means of a <hi rend="italic">buzz,</hi> or wheel of
                    soft iron, made to revolve with great rapidity. By this means a file may be cut
                    in two, while the soft iron plate is not in the least degree impressed by the
                    file. Mr. Barnes cut a saw plate and formed the teeth by the same means. In the
                    process a band of intense fire appeared round the soft iron wheel, which emitted
                    sparks with great and continued violence. Professor Silliman was of opinion that
                    this was nothing more than “a peculiar method of cutting <hi rend="italic">red
                    hot,</hi> or possibly <hi rend="italic">white hot</hi> steel; for the mechanical
                    force produces these degrees of heat, and the steel loses its temper at the
                    place of action.” (Silliman’s <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> vol. viii. p. 342.
                    But it appears from a very careful examination of the process by MM. Darien, and
                    Colladon of Geneva, that the process has a more recondite origin. The following
                    is a general abstract of the results which they obtained:</p>
                <p>1. Having found that the iron wheel was covered with . small fragments of the
                    steel, they could see by a microscope no appearance of softening; on the
                    contrary, they found these fragments as hard as the best tempered steel.</p>
                <p>2. Having fitted up a lathe by which they could give a determinate velocity to
                    the iron wheel, they found that with a velocity of 34 feet per second, an iron
                    wheel was easily cut by a steel graver without any reaction on the graver. With
                    a velocity of 34 feet 9 inches the iron was less attacked, and the graver began
                    to experience the impression from the iron. At a velocity of 35 feet 1 inch, the
                    action of the iron on the graver was decided, and increased with greater
                    velocities, till at a velocity of 76 feet per second, the iron was no longer
                    touched by the steel, while the steel was cut with the greatest violence.</p>
                <p>3. In order to determine the effect of softening or annealing on the steel, our
                    authors examined the fragments of steel detached from the graver at different
                    velocities, from 40 to 100 feet per second; and in every case when the iron was
                    only touched for an instant with the steel graver, the latter exhibited no trace
                    of annealing; but when the graver was long and strongly pressed it sometimes
                    became red hot. In that case, however, the fracture of the steel became quite
                    different, and <hi rend="italic">the action upon it was rather diminished than
                    increased.</hi></p>
                <p>4. Having thus ascertained that the effect is not owing to the annealing of the
                    steel, and found that the effect was not increased by the fragments of steel,
                    which after some time collect on the iron wheel, our authors justly suppose that
                    the whole effect is directly mechanical, arising from the brittleness of the
                    steel, which is torn asunder before it has time to introduce itself amongst the
                    molecules of the soft iron; and they consider it as analogous to the penetration
                    of wood by a ball of tallow.</p>
                <p>5. Upon using wheels made of a mixture of copper and iron, and wheels of pure
                    copper, no effect was produced by them on the graver, though they cut different
                    alloys harder than themselves.</p>
                <p>In these experiments, however, a very remarkable effect occurred. <hi
                    rend="italic">Little or no heat was generated when files and steel springs were
                    held firmly against the revolving copper wheel;</hi> and our authors observed
                    several other curious facts, which they mean to study with greater care,
                    connected with the production of heat by the friction of metals. See <hi

                    Plug, and in the power of Nails.</hi></p>
                <p>The simple instrument called a Lewis for lifting loose stones has been long known
                    and employed in architecture. A much more simple and efficacious contrivance was
                    nearly forty years ago invented by Mr. Richardson of Keswick, and called the
                    lifting plug. It excited little notice till it was made known in Scotland by Mr.
                    Spottiswoode of Spottiswoode, who used it to a greater extent than any other
                    person, and found it an invaluable apparatus for pulling large stones out of the
                    soil.</p>
                <p>A cylindrical hole about two inches deep is cut vertically out of the stone by
                    the steel boring chisel used by masons. A cylindrical plug of common iron, a
                    little less than that of the hole, is then driven into it, about an inch deep,
                    by two or three smart blows of a hammer. By using a common windlass or pulley
                    attached by a hook carried by the plug, the heaviest stones may be raised, and
                    the largest masses of stone torn out of the ground by no other fastening than
                    the adhesion of the plug to the hole. When the stone is raised to its place, the
                    pulley may be detached from it by giving a sharp stroke or two from a hammer
                    upon the stone. The elasticity of the stone is no doubt the cause of the
                    adhesion of the plug, the stone grasping the plug as wood does a polished nail;
                    but another cause undoubtedly is the enormous friction occasioned by the
                    particles of the stone being jammed into the surface of the soft iron plug. It
                    has been thought by some that the first of these causes is the only one, and
                    that the circumstance of the plug being detached by a slight vibratory motion of
                    the stone is a proof of this; but if the two causes which we have mentioned,
                    concur in producing the adhesion of the plug, then it is obvious that when one
                    of these causes of adhesion is removed by the vibrations of the stone, the other
                    being inadequate to sustain the weight, the stone must quit its hold of the
                    plug. Independently of this argument, however, it appears to us that the same
                    cause which releases the plug from the influence of elasticity, tends also to
                    relieve it from the abraded material which unites the surface of the stone with
                    the surface of the iron. In all vibratory movements there is an alternate
                    contraction and extension of the vibrating body, and in one of these phases no
                    doubt the great weight of the stone overcame the diminished force by which it
                    was previously sustained. A drawing and description of the machine for raising
                    stones, by Professor Low, will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Edin. Phil.

                <p>The subject of the adhesion of nails in wood is so intimately connected with the
                    principles of the lifting plug, that our readers will, we are sure, thank us for
                    any information on the subject. The only person who has directly investigated
                    the subject is Mr. B. Bevan,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    who constructed a machine for measuring the force with which nails adhere to
                    wood into which they are driven. He employed it in drawing out nails of
                    different lengths, from a quarter of an inch to 2½ inches long, from dry
                    Christiania deal, at right angles to the grain of the wood. The following table

                <p>When the wood was deal, or any of the softer woods, the force required to draw
                    out the nails was only about one-half of the above weights. The mean of the
                    first six experiments is .762 lbs., and of all the experiments, 719. Hence we
                    may infer that the force required in the softer woods is about 370 lbs.<note

                <p>A side view of this engine is shewn in figs. 5 and 6. It consists of two endless
                    ropes or chains A, connected by cross pieces of iron B, B, &amp;c. (fig. 6.)
                    which pass round the wheel C, the cross pieces falling into corresponding cross
                    grooves, cut in the periphery of the wheel. When the man at S, therefore, drives
                    the wheel <hi rend="italic">nι</hi> by means of the pinion <hi rend="italic"
                    >p,</hi> he moves also the wheel C fixed on the axis of <hi rend="italic"
                    >m,</hi> and makes the double ropes revolve upon the wheels C, D. The wheel D is
                    fixed at the end of a lever DHK, whose centre of motion is H, a fixed point in
                    the beam FT. Now, when the ram L (fig. 5, 6,) is fixed to one of the cross
                    pieces B by the hook Μ, the weight of the ram, acting by the rope, moves the
                    lever D K round H, and brings the wheel D to G, so that, by turning the winch,
                    the ram L (fig. 5.) is raised in the vertical line LRG. But when it reaches R,
                    the projecting piece R disengages the ram from the cross piece B, by striking
                    the bar Q; and as the weight is removed from the extremity D of the lever, the
                    counterpoise I brings it back from G to its old position at F, and the ram falls
                    without interfering with the chain. When the hook is descending, it is prevented
                    from catching the rope by means of the piece of wood N suspended from the hook Μ
                    at O; for being specifically lighter than the iron weight L, and moving with
                    less velocity, it does not come in contact with L till the ram is stopped at the
                    end of its path. When N, therefore, falls upon L, it depresses the extremity Μ
                    of the hook, and therefore brings the hook over one of the cross pieces B, by
                    which the ram is again raised.</p>

                <p>Plate CCCLI. figs. 4 to 7, shew the elevation, plan, section, and outer frame of
                    a fixed iron crane or compound winch, used for raising heavy weights to a
                    considerable h eight, as it is employed at the present day for the erection of
                    buildings, &amp;c. The triangular framings FFF, &amp;c., are of cast iron, and
                    give support to three horizontal revolving shafts of malleable iron running in
                    cylindrical journals. The principal<pb break="no" facs="nls:194205789"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-5789-0459"/> shaft is in the axis AX of the hollow cast iron
                    barrel BB, to which one end of the rope is attached, so as to be coiled and
                    uncoiled by the revolutions of the barrel, in opposite directions. The barrel
                    carries with it a toothed wheel WW, connected with a pinion V placed on a
                    secondary axis QM in such a manner as to revolve freely upon it, or be carried
                    round along with it at pleasure. On the end of this axis QM are placed the crank
                    handles, to which the power may be applied through the pinion V to the wheel W
                    and the barrel B directly. But if a more powerful and slower motion be required,
                    the means of obtaining it are provided in connection with a third axis PN; this
                    axis is immediately connected with the wheel W by the pinion V, which revolves
                    with it, and turns the axle PN, and with it the secondary wheel VV. But the
                    circumference of VV is acted on by the teeth of the pinion TT, which is also
                    made to revolve independently of its own axle, or in connection with it, by
                    means of the lever LL and the clutches CC. The change of power is effected in
                    the following manner: The drawings represent the pinions Y and T both disengaged
                    from their axle, and revolving freely around it in oiled bushes; but if the
                    smaller power is to be used, the attendant lays hold of the lever handle L, and
                    drawing it towards T, engages the clutch towards Y with the pinion Y, and as the
                    clutches C and C are feathered on the axle, they must revolve with it, and carry
                    round that pinion with which they arc engaged. In this way, the pinion Y being
                    made to give the motion of the crank handles directly to the barrel, give the
                    less power; but if the greater power and slower motion are to be used, the
                    clutch at Y is disengaged, the lever is reversed, the pinion T is caught and
                    carried round by the other clutch, and thus the motion of the axis QM is
                    transferred through the wheel VV to the axis PN, and to the pinion V, which
                    works on the primary wheel WW, and the power is increased in the ratio of V to
                    T. When the lever L is placed, as in the figures, so that neither pinion is in
                    gear with its axle, the barrel is free to revolve in the direction of any force
                    applied to it, so that the weight may be run down with great rapidity; and the
                    following contrivance gives a regulating power to this motion: An iron strap SSS
                    embraces closely a wooden drum on the axis of BB, and is attached at both ends
                    to bolts on either side of the fulcrum of the bar HI, which has a handle at H,
                    at a considerable distance from the fulcrum, so that by depressing H, the drum
                    may be firmly embraced by the friction strap SSS, and stopped at any point in
                    its descent, or moderated to the requisite degree. This last appendage is of
                    great consequence in saving time, and preventing the danger attendant on
                    lowering the weights with great velocity.</p>
