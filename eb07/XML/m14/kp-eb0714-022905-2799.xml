                <p><label type="entry">MANDEVILLE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John</hi></label>, a
                    physician celebrated on account of his travels, was born at St Alban’s, about
                    the beginning of the fourteenth century. He received a liberal education, and
                    applied himself to the study of physic; but being at length seized with an
                    invincible desire of visiting distant parts of the globe, he left England in
                    1332, and did not return till thirty-four years thereafter. His friends, who had
                    long supposed him dead, did not know him when he re-appeared amongst them. He
                    had travelled throughout almost all the East, and had made himself master of a
                    great variety of languages. In particular, he had visited Scythia, Armenia,
                    Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Media, Mesopotamia, Persia, Chaldaea, Greece, Dalmatia,
                    and various other countries. He afterwards went to Liège, where he appears to
                    have passed under the name of <hi rend="italic">Joannes de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Barbam,</hi> and died in November 1372. His design seems to have been to commit
                    to writing whatever he had heard, read, or learned, concerning the places which
                    he visited. Hence he has taken descriptions of monsters from Pliny, copied
                    accounts of miracles from legends, and related fabulous stories upon the
                    authority of authors who are now classed as mere romancers; so that many,
                    perhaps most, of the falsehoods in his work properly belong to preceding
                    writers, who, however much they may now be despised or disregarded, were
                    considered as of good credit at the time when he wrote. But there does not
                    appear to be any good reason why be should not be believed in regard to
                    circumstances which he relates from his own observation. Mandeville was a good
                    linguist, and wrote his Travels in Latin, from which he translated them into
                    French, then into English, and lastly into Italian. The English edition is
                    entitled “The Voiyage and Travaile of Ser John Maunde-ville, knight,” London,
                    1568, 4to, reprinted in 1684 in the same form, and again in 1727, 8vo. The
                    original English manuscript is in the Cotton Library. The English editions are
                    the more valuable to us, from having been written in the language used by our
                    countrymen three hundred years ago, when the orthography of English was so
                    little fixed that it seems to have been a fashionable affectation amongst
                    writers to spell the same words in the greatest variety <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> ways imaginable. Addison’s pretended discovery of Sir John Mandeville’s
                    manuscripts, and the pleasant fiction of the freezing and thawing of several
                    short speeches made by Sir John in the territories of Nova Zembla, must be known
                    to most of our readers. (See <hi rend="italic">Tatler,</hi> with annotations,
                    vol. iv. No. 254, edition of 1806.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mandeville,</hi><hi rend="italic">Bernard,</hi> an author of
                    very considerable celebrity in his day, was born about the year 1670, in
                    Holland, where he studied physic, and took the degree of doctor in that faculty.
                    He afterwards came to England, and wrote several works which, though not devoid
                    of ingenuity, inculcate principles little calculated to advance the interests of
                    society. In 1709, he published his Virgin Unmasked, in the form of a dialogue
                    between an old maiden aunt and her niece, upon love, marriage, and other topics
                    therewith connected, which are treated in a manner not calculated to promote
                    female virtue and innocence. In 1711, appeared his Treatise on the Hypochondriac
                    and Hysteric Passions; a work which is divided into three dialogues, and
                    contains some shrewd remarks on the modern practice of physicians and
                    apothecaries. In 1714, he published a poem entitled the Grumbling Hive, or
                    Knaves turned Honest, upon which he afterwards wrote remarks, and enlarged the
                    whole into his well-known publication, The Fable of the Bees, or Private Vices
                    made Public Virtues, which was printed at London in 1723. In the preface to this
                    book be observes that, having met with several who, since the first publication
                    of his poem, had wilfully or ignorantly affirmed that it was intended as a
                    satire upon virtue and morality, and written for the encouragement of vice, he
                    had resolved, whenever it should be reprinted, to apprise the reader of the real
                    intent with which it had been composed, and of the object which he had in view
                    in the composition of the poem. In this, however, he was not by any means
                    fortunate; for the book was in the same year proscribed by the grand jury of
                    Middlesex, and severely animadverted on in a letter printed in the London
                    Journal of the 27th July 1723. Mandeville endeavoured to vindicate his book from
                    the imputations cast upon it both in the letter just mentioned and in the
                    presentment of the grand jury; though, as it appears, with but little success.
                    He was attacked by various writers, who all united in denouncing the principles
                    therein inculcated, and in representing them as equally hostile to morality and
                    pernicious <pb break="no" facs="nls:194202812" xml:id="kp-eb0714-2812-0230"/>to
                    society. To these, however, he made no reply until 1728, when he published, in
                    one volume 8vo, the second part of the Fable of the Bees, intended to illustrate
                    the design and defend the intention of the first. In 1720, appeared his Free
                    Thoughts on Religion, founded on what is called the rational system; and, in
                    1732, came out his Inquiry into the Origin of Honour, and the Usefulness of
                    Christianity in War, a work abounding in questionable doctrines and paradoxical
                    opinions. Mandeville died on the 21st of January 1733, in the sixty-third year
                    of his age. He is said to have been coarse and overbearing in his manners, where
                    he durst be so, yet a flatterer of the great, and also of “some vulgar Dutch
                    merchants who allowed him a pension.” He lived in obscure lodgings in London,
                    and never had much practice as a physician; but he was patronised, it is said,
                    by the first Earl of Macclesfield, at whose table he was a frequent guest, and
                    had there an unlimited license to indulge his wit as well as his appetite, both
                    of which appear to have been sufficiently unscrupulous. In his writings there
                    are many remarks equally ingenious and just; he was a shrewd observer of men and
                    manners, and often singularly happy in recording the results of his experience;
                    but the general principles inculcated in some of his works have been almost
                    universally reprobated, as calculated to depress the standard of morality, if
                    not to encourage vice and irréligion. Amongst the assailants of the Fable of the
                    Bees may be mentioned Dr Fiddes, in the preface to his General Treatise of
                    Morality, printed in 1724; Mr John Dennis, in his Vice and Luxury Public
                    Mischiefs, 1724; Mr William Law, in Remarks upon the Fable of the Bees, 1724; Mr
                    Bluet, in his Inquiry whether the general Practice of Virtue tends to the Wealth
                    or Poverty, Benefit or Disadvantage of a People, 1725; Mr Hutcheson, author of
                    an Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue; and Mr Archibald
                    Campbell, in his ’ <hi rend="italic">Aigiroaoγ∕a.</hi> Mandeville’s notions were
                    likewise animadverted on by Bishop Berkeley in his Alciphron, or the Minute
                    Philosopher, printed in 1732. This drew from Mandeville a reply, which was
                    published the same year in the form of a letter to Dion, occasioned by his book
                    called Alciphron; and there also appeared a pamphlet containing some Remarks on
                    the Minute Philosopher, in a Letter to a Country Clergyman from his friend in
                    London, the anonymous author of which (supposed to have been John Lord Harvey)
                    interposes in the controversy with much apparent impartiality. It is not
                    necessary, however, to multiply details respecting a work which is no longer
                    read except by the learned. The leading error in the Fable of the Bees consists
                    in the author not sufficiently distinguishing between what is and what ought to
                    be; between vices properly so called, and mere superfluities or articles of
                    luxury and refinement, which are the natural and useful accompaniments of
                    certain conditions of life, and, in themselves, neither objects of praise nor of
                    censure. As to his propensity to trace good actions to bad motives, and his
                    disposition to exhibit on all occasions the dark side of human nature, no
                    apology can be offered for it; and the best test of public estimation is the
                    general neglect into which his writings have fallen. (See the <hi rend="italic"
