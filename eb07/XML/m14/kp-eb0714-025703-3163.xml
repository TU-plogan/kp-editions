                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MARQUETRY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Inlaid Work</hi></label>, a
                    curious kind of work, composed of pieces of hard fine wood of different colours,
                    fastened, in thin slices, on a ground, and sometimes enriched with other
                    substances, as tortoise-shell, ivory, tin, and brass.</p>
                <p>There is another kind of marquetry, made of glasses of various colours instead of
                    wood; and a third, where precious stones and the richest marbles are alone used.
                    These, however, are more properly called <hi rend="italic">mosaic work.</hi></p>
                <p>The art of inlaying is very ancient, and is supposed to have passed from the east
                    to the west, as one of the spoils brought to the Romans from Asia. Indeed it was
                    then but a simple thing; nor did it arrive at any tolerable perfection amongst
                    the Italians till the fifteenth century. It seems, however, to have arrived at
                    its height amongst the French in the seventeenth century.</p>
                <p>Till John of Verona, a contemporary of Raffaelle, the finest works of this
                    description were only black and white, or what we now call <hi rend="italic"
                    >morescos</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but that person, who had a genius for
                    painting, stained his woods with dyes or boiled oils, which penetrated them. Yet
                    he went no further than representing buildings and perspectives, which required
                    no great variety of colours. Those who succeeded him not only improved on the
                    invention of dyeing the woods, by a secret they found of burning without
                    consuming them, which served exceedingly well for the shadows, but they had also
                    the advantage of a number of fine new woods of naturally bright colours,
                    obtained in consequence of the discovery of America. With these aids the art is
                    now capable of imitating any thing; and hence some call it the <hi rend="italic"
                    >art of painting in wood.</hi></p>
                <p>The ground on which the pieces are to be ranged and glued is ordinarily of oak or
                    of fir well dried; and, to prevent warping, it is composed of several pieces
                    glued together. The wood to be used, being reduced into leaves of the thickness
                    of a line, is either stained with some colour, or made black for shadow, which
                    some effect by putting it in sand extremely heated over the fire, others by
                    steep-it in lime-water and sublimate, and others again in oil of sulphur. When
                    thus coloured, the contours of the piece are formed according to the parts of
                    the design which they are to represent.</p>
                <p>This last is the most difficult part of marquetry, and that in which the greatest
                    patience and attention are required. The two chief instruments used in the work
                    are the saw and the vice; the one to hold the matters to be formed, and the
                    other to take off from the extremes according to occasion. The vice is of wood,
                    having one of its chaps fixed and the other moveable, and it is opened and shut
                    by the foot, by means of a cord fastened to a treadle. Its structure is very
                    ingenious, yet simple enough.</p>
                <p>The leaves to be formed (for there are frequently three or four of the same kind
                    formed together) are put within the chaps of the vice, after being glued on the
                    outermost part of the design of the. profile of which they are to follow; then
                    the workman pressing down the treadle, and thus holding fast the piece, runs
                    with his saw over all the outlines of the design. By thus joining and forming
                    three or four pieces into one, they not only gain time, but the matter is
                    likewise the better enabled to sustain the efforts of the saw, which, how
                    delicate soever it may be, and how lightly soever the workman may conduct it,
                    without such a precaution would be apt to raise splinters, to the ruin of the
                    beauty of the work.</p>
                <p>When the work is to consist of one single kind of wood, or of tortoise-shell, on
                    a copper or tin ground, <hi rend="italic">or vice versa,</hi> they only form two
                    leaves, one on the other, that is, a leaf of metal and a leaf of wood or shell;
                    and this they call <hi rend="italic">sawing in counterparts</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for by filling the vacuities of one of the leaves by the
                    pieces coming out of the other, the metal serves as a ground to the wood, and
                    the wood as a ground to the metal.</p>
                <p>All the pieces thus formed by the saw, and marked so as to be known again, and
                    the shadow being given in the manner already mentioned, they veneer or fasten
                    each in its place on the common ground, using for that purpose the best English
                    glue. The whole is then put in a press to dry, planed over, and polished with
                    the skin of the sea-dog, wax, and shave-grass, as in simple veneering; with this
                    difference, however, that in marquetry the fine branches, and several of the
                    more delicate parts of the figures, are touched up and finished with the
                    graver.</p>

                <p>It is the cabinetmakers, joiners, and toymen, amongst us, who work in marquetry;
                    and it is the enamellers and stone-cutters who deal in mosaic works. The
                    instruments used by the former are mostly the same with those used by the
                    ebonists.</p>
