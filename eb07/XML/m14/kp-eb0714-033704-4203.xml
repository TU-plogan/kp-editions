                <p><label type="entry">MAYO</label>, a maritime county in the province of Connaught
                    in Ireland, is bounded on the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the cast
                    by the counties of Sligo and Roscommon, and on the south by that of Galway. Its
                    greatest length from north to south is 60 miles, and its greatest breadth,
                    measured from Lough Gara to the western extremity of the Mullet is nearly 75;
                    comprehending a surface of 1,355,048 acres, of which 871,984 are capable of
                    cultivation, 425,124 are bog or irreclaimable mountain, and 57,940 are under
                    water.</p>
                <p>Aceording to Ptolemy the earliest inhabitants of this region were the Nagnatae.
                    It was afterwards divided into districts distinguished by the names of the
                    chieftains or principal settlers, of whom those of greatest note were M‘William
                    Oughter, O’Maley, Μ‘Jordan, O ’ Dondey,and O ’ M‘Phil-ben, to which were
                    subsequently added the Nangles, the Dillons, and others of British descent.</p>
                <p>The whole of Connaught except Roscommon, was considered as one county by the
                    English, until the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, by whom it was made
                    shire ground, and this county then took its name from the monastery of Mayo or
                    Mageo in it. It is now divided into the nine baronies of Burrishoole, Carra,
                    Clanmorris, Costello, Erris, Gallen, Kilmaine, Morrisk, and Tyrawley.</p>
                <p>The appearance of the country varies very much. In the eastern parts it contains
                    extensive plains capable of cultivation, and rising occasionally into hills of
                    moderate height; the western part is wholly mountainous, and covered in most
                    parts with bog, except in some places near the sea, where the soil, unless when
                    covered with drifted sand, is sufficiently fertile. In some parts of the flat
                    country, near Lough Mask, the ground appears like one plain of grey stone, which
                    on a closer examination, is found to consist of parallel layers of rock, rising
                    edgeways out of the ground, and having the intervening furrows filled with a
                    productive soil that throws up an herbage peculiarly grateful to sheep. The
                    principal mountains are Muilrea in the south, 2733 feet high, being the most
                    elevated point in Connaught; andCroagh-patrick,onthe southern shore of Clew Bay,
                    2530 feet high. This mountain is amongst the most celebrated in Ireland, not
                    only for its height and the majestic outline it presents from the various
                    positions whence it can be contemplated, but from the tradition that St. Patrick
                    chose its summit as the place to stand on, when he drove all the venomous
                    reptiles of the island into the sea. Nephin 2640 feet high to the west of Lough
                    Conn, is of a conical form with rugged and steep sides, and is covered with
                    Alpine plants to its summit. Nephin-beg, in its vicinity, is but 1800 feet high.
                    In the same district is the mountain of Berreencurragh 2290 feet high; and more
                    westward Maam-Thomoish and Croughletta, each very lofty, though less elevated
                    than the preceding. The rivers which flow from these mountains are small, unless
                    when their body of waters is encreased by a violent fall of rain. The principal
                    are the Aull, which is navigable for large boats for five miles from Lough Mask;
                    the Castlebar river, in like manner, navigable for four miles from Lough Lorn;
                    the Owenmore that falls into Blacksod bay; the Deel, the Robe, the Errive, and
                    the Carnamart. The Moy, which separates this county from Sligo, is navigable to
                    Killalla for vessels of fifty tons. The Blackwater, which is the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194204216" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4216-0338"/>boundary on the south, is
                    remarkable for having an under- ’ ground course of some miles near its
                    embouchure into Lough Corrib. Amongst the numerous lakes, Lough Mask situated in
                    the south, and separated from Lough Corrib by a narrow isthmus, is the largest.
                    It is ten miles long by four broad, but its southern extremity is included in
                    Galway county. Lough Carra to the north-east of Lough Mask, is a very
                    picturesque sheet of water, as is Lough Raheens, called also Castlebar Lough
                    from the town in its vicinity; and Lough Lorn, still farther north, is a fine
                    sheet of water fifteen miles long, but of very inconsiderable breadth. The minor
                    lakes are numerous, and there are several turloughs in which the water collects
                    in winter but is carried off by a natural drainage at the beginning of
                    summer.</p>
                <p>The western and northern coasts are indented with numerous bays and creeks.
                    Killery bay that separates Mayo from Galway is a great station for the herring
                    fishery. Proceeding northwards, the next inlet in order, and the most worthy of
                    note for extent and grandeur of scenery, is Clew bay, protected at its entrance
                    by Clare island, and having in its interior the two harbours of Newport and
                    Westport, besides many creeks and roadsteads caused by the almost innumerable
                    islets with which its eastern coast is studded. Blacksod bay and Broadhaven form
                    the peninsula of the Mullet, and are prevented from blending their waters only
                    by the very narrow isthmus of Bellmullet. On the northern coast are Dunfinney
                    and Killalla bays. The lesser indentations of the coast affording shelter for
                    small Craft, and therefore of much importance to the fisheries, are too numerous
                    to admit of specific detail.</p>
                <p>The principal island is that of Achill. It is the largest on the Irish coast,
                    containing 28,640 acres, and 3767 souls; and is formed partly of lofty hills and
                    partly of flat bogs. The western side presents a rugged and precipitous line of
                    rock, to resist the violence of the Atlantic, interrupted only by a few small
                    coves scarcely capable of sheltering the small-estboats; the eastern coast
                    affords shelter almost everywhere. Clare island is of a triangular form, and has
                    about 1400 inhabitants. Innisbofin, the most important island on the coast as
                    respects the fisheries, is about four miles from Connemara in Galway; it had a
                    garrison in the time of the republic. The finest cod-bank on the Irish coast
                    lies near it. Ennisturk lies midway between the two last named islands. The want
                    of a landing place renders it nearly useless, notwithstanding its advantageous
                    position for fishing. It comprehends' 3500 acres of poor soil and rock, and 456
                    inhabitants. The lesser islands are scarcely of sufficient consequence to
                    deserve enumeration.</p>

                <p>The civil power for maintaining the peace of the county, and enforcing the
                    decisions of the judicial and magisterial authorities, consists of nine chief
                    and 173 petty constables, and is maintained at an expense of £7707, or at the
                    rate of somewhat less than £40 per man. Under the new constabulary act the

                    sub-constables, and 144 constables and sub-constables.</p>
                <p>The number of resident landed proprietors are few in comparison with the extent
                    of the county. The condition of the peasantry varies considerably, according to
                    their situation. On the sea-coast, where the occupation of fishing can be
                    combined with that of agriculture, the people are tolerably comfortable. This is
                    particularly the case in the district around Killalla, Westflat, Newport, and
                    other places where an export trade is carried on. It is observed that early and
                    improvident marriages are by no means common in those parts. Young men are
                    anxious to be provided with sufficient means before they venture upon the charge
                    of a family. Similar appearances of comfort and prudence are observable in the
                    inland eastern districts where agriculture is attended to. In the mountainous
                    and boggy tracts the state of the peasantry is very deplorable. The houses are
                    of the poorest description, and extremely confined in dimensions. The children
                    are seen about the doors of the hovels in a state of nudity, and apparently
                    regardless of the changes of the weather. But in the agricultural districts the
                    case is different. In these the houses are of stone and mortar, with a chimney,
                    and separate apartments. The men dress in home-made frieze, of a dark colour;
                    and the women mostly in cheap cottons. The fuel is universally turf; the food
                    potatoes, with milk occasionally, and, when near the shore, fish. The Irish
                    language is in general use. In the inland and more retired parts the peasantry
                    prefer collecting thêmselves in closely-built irregular villages to living in
                    detached cottages. The custom of holding large tracts of land in joint-tenancy,
                    which is the favourite tenure in the pasturable regions, may be considered as
                    the chief cause of this practice. The inhabitants of each village form a
                    community amongst themselves, little connected with those around, and regulate
                    their common concerns by a code of laws of their own framing, from which appeals
                    are at times made to the landlord or his agent, or else, though less frequently,
                    to the magistrates at sessions, or to the superior courts.</p>
                <p>The soil in the plain country is chiefly a gravelly loam, on a limestone bottom.
                    Even in the tracts where bog prevails, ridges of limestone gravel, called
                    eskers, of a mile and more in length, several perches broad, and from forty to
                    fifty feet high, are to be met with. The rocky pastures produce a nutritive
                    herbage for sheep and young cattle; and in places from which these are excluded,
                    timber trees throw up their shoots spontaneously. Wheat is grown in <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194204229" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4229-0339"/> large quantities
                    in the southern and eastern baronies; oats, barley, and flax in the hilly
                    country. Where limestone can be had it is the favourite manure, either alone or
                    in a compost with other substances. Where it cannot be procured, recourse is had
                    to burning. Shelly sea-sand, and sea-weed thrown up by the high winds, are much
                    used on the coast. The implements of agriculture are still of a clumsy and
                    coarse make. The spade, here called a loy, having a rest for the right foot
                    only, is substituted for the plough in the mountainous parts. In Erris a spade
                    with a blade forking out into two points, is used where the soil is rocky. The
                    fences are mostly dry-stone walls, formed by collecting the loose stones from
                    the surface, where they are so abundant that the fences made of them present the
                    appearance of ramparts rather than enclosures against trespassing. The cattle
                    are mostly of the long-horned breed. They are seldom congregated in large
                    dairies, but most of the small farmers have one or more cows. The sheep and
                    swine are chiefly of the common country breed. Towards the close of the last
                    century planting, both for ornament in demesnes, and on a more extensive scale
                    for profit, has been much attended to. The base of Croagh-patrick is finely
                    fringed with wood, as is that of Nephin. The neighbourhood of Westport is much
                    improved by the extensive plantations of the proprietor of the soil. The
                    baronies of Tyrawley, Burrishoole, Gallen, and Costello, are mostly destitute of
                    timber.</p>
                <p>The manufactures are almost wholly confined to articles in demand for home
                    consumption, such as linens, furs, flannels, woollen stockings, and straw hats.
                    The chief marts for the sale of the superabundant produce are Castlebar and
                    Westport. Besides these legal sources of profit from manufactures illicit
                    distillation is carried on to a great extent, and is one of the chief causes of
                    the large supplies of grain in the markets of the interior. The exports are
                    grain, fish, and kelp; large quantities of the latter are manufactured on the
                    shores. Fishing banks are numerous. The principal one between Innisbofin and
                    Achil affords an inexhaustible supply of white fish. Near Achil is a sand-bank
                    stocked with quantities of turbot and other flat fish which are also taken in
                    abundance off Killalla bay. Near Innis-kca island is a great ling bank. The
                    sun-fish or basking-shark is taken from five to eight leagues from the coast.
                    The fishery commences in the last week in April. The fish is taken with a
                    harpoon of peculiar construction; butas the success of the season depends on the
                    state of the weather, which is very liable to sudden and violent squalls at that
                    season, and as the fish frequently escapes bearing away with it the harpoon and
                    tackle, the average profits, during a continuance of seasons, seldom compensates
                    the adventurer for his outlay of capital and labour. The herring fishery also
                    occupies a number of hands. The whole fishing trade is carried on in open boats,
                    as this description of craft is less expensive and better adapted for the
                    costing trade in kelp and turf in which it is employed during the intervals of
                    the fishing seasons. The deep sea fishing begins in May, that of the herring in
                    August. The winter fishing continues from November to Christmas. Pollock,
                    whiting, sand-eels, and shell-fish are caught along the shores, and there are
                    salmon fisheries at Newport, Burrishoole, Killery, Belclare, and Louisburgh.</p>
                <p>The remains of ancient buildings are numerous, and many of them highly worthy of
                    note. There are round or pillar towers at Killalla, Turlogh, Meelcek, and Bal;
                    but the first is the loftiest and best preserved. The abbey of Mayo, which gives
                    name to the county, was once the site of a bishop’s see. Moyne abbey, near
                    Killalla, still exhibits some arches of magnificent size and workmanship. The
                    steeple rises not less than an hundred feet from the top of the centre of the
                    church. The ruins of Rosserick abbey, in the same neighbourhood, are amongst the
                    finest specimens of monastic building in these parts. The workmanship of an arch
                    in the centre of the church is peculiarly admirable. Although Ballyhaunis abbey
                    is much dilapidated, the remains of its ruins shew it to have been, as it were,
                    a minature resemblance of that of Moyne. At Ballinrobe was the abbey De Roba, of
                    which no traces are now visible. Ballintobber abbey, not far distant from it,
                    was founded by Cathal O’Conor, king of Connaught. The abbey of Burrishoole owes
                    its origin to the Bourke family; its site is the place for holding a patron in
                    honour of St. Dominic. The walls of the church of Strade abbey on the Moy still
                    exist; they are singularly beautiful, and near the altar are several curious
                    sculptures. Cross, or Holycross monastery, was in the peninsula of the Mullet.
                    The abbey of Bophin was built in the island of Innisbofin. Many relics of other
                    monastic buildings of inferior note are to be found in various parts. The
                    remains of ancient castles and places of strength are also numerous. At
                    Downpatrick, or Dunbriste, are the ruins of a strong castle on a cliff three
                    hundred feet high projecting into the sea. A rock of equal elevation rises at
                    about the same distance from the shore, on which are also the traces of
                    castellated buildings. The correspondence of the prominences and indentations of
                    the rocks on each side of the cleft that separates these structures prove that
                    they were once united. It is now a place of penance. Rockfleet castle, near
                    Newport, is said to have been built by the celebrated Grace O’Mallay, to whom
                    the erection of several other fortresses along the coast are attributed. This
                    singular woman was so much attached to the sea, the scene of most of her
                    exploits, that when on shore, she is said to have had her bark moored to her
                    bedpost through a window of the castle where she slept. Ballylahan castle was
                    built by one of the Jordan family, who built ten others of similar construction
                    for his ten sons. Deel castle, near Ballina, stands as yet five hundred feet,
                    and inhabitable. In Lough Conn are the ruins of a fort in which O‘ Conor, king
                    of Ireland, is said to have confined his son. The smaller castles, vestiges of
                    which are visible in many parts, arc almost invariably square buildings with a
                    narrow entrance and a few contracted windows, erected solely for security,
                    without any regard to architectural beauty.</p>
                <p>The towns in this extensive county are few and small. The population of
                    Castlebar, in which the assizes are held alternately with Ballinrobe, and which
                    is considered as the county town, amounts only to 6,373 souls. Its situation is
                    central; anditsgeneral appearance indicates wealth and prosperity. A green area
                    studded with trees in the middle of the town forms a mall or public promenade.
                    The great street is nearly a mile long; and two bridges cross the river which
                    flows from Raheenlake. The ancient castle, whence the town derives its name, and
                    which has been converted into a barrack, stands on an eminence. The court house
                    is a respectable structure; and the county jail is in this town. In it is also a
                    charter school built by the Earl of Lucan, the proprietor of the place, whose
                    castle, an antique“edifice of commanding appearance, stands on a neighbouring
                    hill in the middle of a demesne sloping down to the river. The other public
                    buildings are a church, a Catholic chapel, a meeting house, a barrack for
                    cavalry, an infirmary, and a linen hall, in which last named building a good
                    trade is carried on. The market day is held on Saturday. This town was the scene
                    of a battle between the French under Humbert and the king’s forces in 1798,
                    after which the former kept possession of it from the 26th of August to the 4th
                    of September. Ballinrobe, the other assize town, contains only 2,575
                    inhabitants. It takes its name from the river Robe on which it is built. Its
                    only places of note are the castle, formerly the residence of Lord Tyrawley, now
                    a barrack, the new barrack, the ruins of the abbey, and the school house. The
                    population of the other towns, whose numbers exceed 1,000 each, is as
                    follow:</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mayo,</hi> one of the Cape de Verd Islands, situated in the
                    Atlantic Ocean, near 300 miles from Cape Verdin Africa, is about 21 miles in
                    circumference, Long. 23.8. W. Lat. 15.10. N. The shore affords good anchorage in
                    the sandy bays between the promontories; it possesses but one spring which rises
                    near its centre, the water of which runs off in a small stream through a valley
                    confined by hills. The soil is indebted to the nightly dew and the showers that
                    fall in the wet season for the only humidity which it receives, and is
                    consequently dry and barren. There are three small towns in the island, the
                    principal of which is called Pinosa. The chief commodity for extent is salt,
                    great quantities of which are gathered from the bays and ponds during the dry
                    seasons. On the west side of the Island is a large salt pond, two miles long and
                    half a mile in breadth. The surrounding sea abounds in great varieties of fish;
                    the principal fruits are figs, water melons, citrons, and oranges, and a kind of
                    bean which forms a large part of the ordinary diet of the natives. The
                    population is estimated at about 7000.</p>
