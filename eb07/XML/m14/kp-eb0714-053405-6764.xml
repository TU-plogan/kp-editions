                <p><label type="entry">MEKKA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Mecca</hi></label>, a large
                    city of Arabia, and capital of the province of the Hcdjaz, one of the holy
                    cities of the Mahommedans, and the annual retreat of innumerable pilgrims,
                    celebrated all over the east as the birth place of Mahommed, and the first seat
                    of his power. It is situated in a narrow and sandy valley, the main direction of
                    which is from north to south; the valley is from one to seven hundred paces in
                    breadth, and the chief part of the city is situated where the valley is
                    broadest. The town itself covers a space of about 1500 paces in length, from the
                    quarter called El Shebeyka, to the extremity of the Mala. But the whole extent
                    of ground comprehended under the denomination of Mekka, from the suburb called
                    Djeronel, where is the entrance from Djidda to the suburb called Moabede on the
                    Tayf road, is 3500 paces. The valley in which the city is built is enclosed by
                    mountains from 200 to 500 feet in height, and entirely barren and destitute of
                    trees. The town is partly built on the sides of the mountains, principally of
                    the eastern chain, where the primitive habitations of the Koreysh and the
                    ancient town appear to have been placed. The city was formerly protected by
                    three walls at its extremities, but they are now decayed and it is open on every
                    side; though the neighbouring mountains form a barrier of considerable strength
                    against an enemy. Mekka may be styled a handsome town; its streets are in
                    general broader than those of eastern cities, which seldom allow a greater space
                    than is required for two camels to pass. But the numerous visitors who are
                    crowded together in this holy city during the pilgrimage render it necessary to
                    leave afn-ple space in the streets. The houses are lofty, many of them being
                    three stories in height, and they are built of stone; and the numerous windows
                    that command a view of the streets give them a more lively and European aspect
                    than the houses in most of the eastern towns, which present but few windows
                    towards the exterior. Few of the houses are whitewashed as at Djidda, being of a
                    dark-coloured stone which <pb break="no" facs="nls:194206777"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-6777-0535"/>is much preferable to a glaring white. Every house
                    has its terrace, the floor of which, composed of a preparation of lime-stone, is
                    built so as to allow the rain-water to run off through gutters into the street.
                    These terraces are concealed from the view by slight parapet walls, as it js
                    reckoned discreditable in the east that a man should appear upon the terrace,
                    whence he might be accused of looking at women on the terraces of neighbouring
                    houses, where they pass much of their time in various domestic duties, such as
                    drying corn, hanging up linen, &amp;c. Almost all the houses, except those
                    belonging to the principal and richest inhabitants, are constructed for the
                    accommodation of lodgers, being divided into many apartments, separated from
                    each other, and each consisting of a sitting room and a small kitchen. The only
                    public place in the body of the town is the ample square of the great mosque. No
                    trees or gardens are interspersed amongst the houses to cheer the eye; but the
                    scene is enlivened during the pilgrimage by the great number of well-stored
                    shops which are found in every quarter. Mekka is more deficient in public
                    buildings than any other eastern city of the same size; having nothing of this
                    description excepting four or five large houses belonging to the scherif or
                    governor, two colleges, now converted into corn magazines, and the mosque with
                    some buildings and schools attached to it. Neither khans for the accommodation
                    of travellers or for the deposit of merchandise, nor palaces of grandees, nor
                    mosques, which adorn every quarter of other towns in the east, are here to be
                    seen. This want of public edifices Burckhardt the enterprising traveller, to
                    whose work we are indebted for this account of the holy city, ascribes to the
                    veneration which the inhabitants entertain for their temple, to which they are
                    averse to construct any rival edifice. The streets are all nnpaved, in
                    consequence of which the sand and dust are blown about in summer to the great
                    inconvenience of the passengers; and so deep is the mud during the rainy season
                    that they are scarcely passable after a shower, as the water stagnates in the
                    interior of the town until it is dried up. It may also be ascribed to the
                    destructive rains, which, though of shorter duration than in tropical countries,
                    fall with violence, that no ancient buildings are found in Mekka. Burckhardt is
                    of opinion that there are not any houses more than four centuries old; and hence
                    there are here no interesting specimens of architecture or any such beautiful
                    remains of Saracenic structures as are still admired in Syria, Egypt, Barbary,
                    and Spain. No regulations of police are enforced in Mekka as in other eastern
                    cities. The streets are totally dark at night, no lamps of any kind being
                    lighted; and its different quarters are without gates, differing in thisre-spect
                    also from most eastern towns, where each quarter is regularly shut up after
                    evening prayers. The dirt and sweepings of the houses are cast into the streets,
                    where they add to the accumulated mass of dust or mud according to the season.
                    Another great inconvenience, and one great cause of dirtiness and also of
                    disease, is the scarcity of water, which is here fully as much felt as at
                    Djidda. There are but few cisterns for collecting rain, and the well water is so
                    brackish that it is used only for culinary purposes, except during the time of
                    the pilgrimage, when the lowest class of the pilgrims drink it. The famous well
                    of Zemzem in the great mosque is indeed sufficiently copious to supply the whole
                    town, but its water is heavy to the taste and impedes digestion. The best water
                    in Mekka is brought from a conduit in the vicinity of Arafat, about thirty miles
                    distant. This conduit is wholly built of stone, but it is greatly neglected and
                    has fallen into decay, so that most of the water is lost in its passage to the
                    city through apertures, or slowly forces its way through the obstructing
                    sediment; and hence the supply is barely sufficient in ordinary times for the
                    use of the inhabitants, and during the pilgrimage sweet water is so scarce that
                    a small skin pf it is often sold for thç value of a shilling, a very high price
                    amongst the Arabs. At two places the aqueduct runs above ground, and there the
                    water is let off into small channels and fountains, at which a toll is exacted
                    by the slaves of the scherif for liberty to fill the water-skins; and here
                    during the pilgrimage crowds are to be seen day and night quarelling and
                    fighting for access to the water. When the Wahabees besieged the place they cut
                    off this supply of water, and it was not till some time afterwards that the
                    injury was partially repaired. There is a small spring which oozes from under
                    the rocks behind the great palace of the scherif which affords excellent water,
                    but it is wholly appropriated to the use of the scherif’s family. It has been
                    already mentioned that there are few public buildings of any consequence in
                    Mekka. The castle stands nearly on the summit of the range of mountains which
                    enclose the town; it commands the greatest part of the city, but is itself
                    commanded by several higher summits. The building was considerably strengthened
                    and repaired by Ghaleb, a scherif of Mekka, who mounted it with heavy guns. It
                    contains a large cistern and a small mosque, and might accommodate a garrison of
                    1000 men. It is an impregnable fortress against the attacks of Arabs, and might
                    even offer some resistance to Europeans. The approach is by a steep and narrow
                    path. Below the castle hill upon a small plain stands the great palace of the
                    reigning scherif; it has high and solid walls and seems to have been intended
                    for an out-work to the castle above it, with which, according to the reports of
                    the Mekkawy, there is a subterranean communication. It is an irregular pile of
                    building and comprises many spacious courts and gloomy chambers; it is now
                    converted into a magazine of corn. The most remarkable building in Mekka is the
                    mosque, called the Beitullah, which, however, is only remarkable on account of
                    the Kaaba which it encloses; there being several mosques in other places of the
                    East nearly equal to it in size, and much superior in beauty. The Kaaba is
                    contained in an oblong square 250 paces in length, and 200 in breadth; this open
                    square is enclosed by a quadruple row of pillars, some of white marble, granite,
                    or porphery, but the greater part of the common stone of the Mekka mountains;
                    these pillars are united by pointed arches, every four of which support a small
                    dome; from the arches lamps are suspended, some of which burn every night, and
                    the whole are regularly lighted up during the nights of Ramadan. The Kaaba is an
                    oblong massive structure of the grey Mekka stone, eighteen paces in length,
                    fourteen in breadth, and from thirty-five to forty feet in height; seven paved
                    colonnades, of sufficient breadth to admit four or five persons to walk abreast,
                    lead towards the Kaaba in the centre. At the south-east corner of the Kaaba,
                    near the door, is the famous “black stone,” said to have been brought by the
                    angel Gabriel to form the foundation of the edifice. It forms a sharp angle of
                    the building, at four or five feet from the ground. It is an irregular oval,
                    about seven inches in diameter, consisting of a dozen smaller stones cemented,
                    and perfectly smoothed by the millions of touches and kisses which it has
                    received. The grand ceremony through which the pilgrims pass, is to go seven
                    times round the Kaaba, reciting certain appointed verses and prayers, and
                    kissing the sacred stone. In the south-east corner of the Kaaba is another stone
                    which the people, walking round the Kaaba, touch only with the right hand. On
                    the north side there is a hollow in the ground lined with marble; and here it is
                    thought meritorious to pray. The four sides of the Kaaba are covered with a
                    black silk stuff', hanging down and leaving the roof bare. Round the Kaaba there
                    is a good pavement of marble, and opposite the four sides stand four other
                    buildings, where the Imaums of the orthodox Mahommedan sects take their station
                    and guide the congregation in their prayers. The building which encloses the
                    Zemzem, or well of holy water, of which the pilgrims take large draughts, and
                    which <pb break="no" facs="nls:194206790" xml:id="kp-eb0714-6790-0536"/>is
                    supposed to cure all diseases, (besides a thorough ablution in its waters,
                    which, they imagine, purifies from sin), is of a square form with an entrance
                    into the room which contains the well, and which is ornamented with marbles of
                    various colours. Adjoining there is a small stone reservoir which is always full
                    of Zemzem water. This room is constantly filled with visitors from dawn till
                    near midnight. The outside walls of the mosque are those of the houses which
                    surround it on all sides. These houses belonged originally to the mosque, and
                    they are let out as lodgings to the richest hadjis at high prices. The mosque
                    has nineteen gates, and its interior is adorned with seven minarets irregularly
                    distributed. It will be seen that the general plan of the mosque, from the above
                    account, differs but little in its construction from the mosque of Zakania at
                    Aleppo, the large mosque called El Amvay at Damascus, and the greater number of
                    the mosques at Cairo, which are constructed exactly upon the same plan, with an
                    arched colonnade round an open square. For further particulars respecting the
                    ancient and celebrated structure, the reader is referred to Burckhardt’s work on
                    Arabia, which contains ample and interesting details on this subject.</p>
                <p>The population of Mekka may all be styled foreigners, or the offspring of
                    foreigners, except a few Hedjaz Bedouins, or their descendants who have settled
                    here. The most numerous are those whose fathers came from Y emen and Hadramaut;
                    and next to them in numbers are the descendants of Indians, Egyptians, Syrians,
                    Mogrebyns and Turks. There are also Me'kkawys of Persian origin, Tartars,
                    Bokhars, Kurds, Afghans; and, in short, inhabitants from every Mahommedan
                    country in the world. They have but two kinds of employment; trade and the
                    service of the Beitullah or Temple. They are extremely commercial in their
                    habits, and almost all the ole-mas, or persons engaged in the service of the
                    temple, are secretly engaged in trade. With the exception of a few poteries and
                    dyeing houses, Mekka has not a single manufactory, but during the time of the
                    pilgrimage it is the seat of a very extensive trade; the wealthy pilgrims
                    bringing from every Mussulman country its native productions to Djidda, either
                    by sea or across the desert from Damascus, and exchanging them amongst each
                    other, or receiving from the merchants of Mekka the goods of India and Arabia
                    which the latter have accumulated the whole year in their warehouses. Mekka at
                    this time becomes one of the largest fairs in the East, and is interesting from
                    the variety of natives who frequent it. Whilst there is peace with the interior
                    a considerable trade is carried on with the Bedouins, and especially with the
                    inhabitants of the towns of Nedjed, who are in want of India goods, rings, and
                    articles of dress, which they procure either from Medina or at a cheaper rate
                    from Mekka. The rise of the Wahabee power in Arabia was rather unfavourable to
                    Mekka. The pilgrims who visited the holy city were afraid to send their goods
                    lest they should be seized by the Wahabces, and the imports were reduced to what
                    were necessary for the inhabitants. Burckhardt, from all the inquiries he could
                    make, estimated the stationary inhabitants at between 25,000 and 30,000, besides
                    from 3000 to 4000 Abyssinian and black slaves. The climate is sultry and
                    unwholesome; the heat is reflected from the rocks which enclose the narrow
                    valley, and suffocating hot winds occasionally prevail. Inflammatory fevers and
                    dysentery are common and often fatal. Mekka surrendered to the Wahabees in 1803,
                    but was retaken by Ali Pasha’s troop under his son Toussoun Bey in 1813. Long.
