                    occupies an important place amongst the characters which appear in the Old
                    Testament history, as typical of Christ. Very little, however, is said in
                    Scripture regarding him personally; his name occurs only twice in tlιe Old
                    Testament, (in Gen. xiv. 18, and in Ps. ex. 4); and the reference to him in the
                    New, (in Heb. vii. 20. and vii. 1.), has respect only to his typical character.
                    His name is mentioned for the first time in the sacred history, on the occasion
                    of the return of Abraham from the defeat of the four kings or sheikhs who had
                    invaded the district of Sodom, and carried captive his nephew Lot. In the valley
                    of Sha-veh, or “the king ’ s dale,” probably the same valley as that mentioned
                    under the same name in 2 Samuel (xviii. 18), the victor was met by Melchisedec,
                    who is described as “the king of Salem,” and who, with the generous readiness of

                    with the Salem spoken of in Psalm lxxvi. 2, where it is plainly Jerusalem that
                    is referred to, but must have been some city, unknown to general history, which
                    lay somewhere between Damascus and Sodom, to which district the narrative of

                    this capacity he pronounced a benediction on Abraham. In return for his
                    kindness, and especially from reverence to his priestly office, the patriarch
                    gave him a tithe of all the spoil he had taken in that expedition, from which he
                    was then returning.</p>
                <p>This is the sum of what Moses records respecting Melchisedec; and the only
                    addition that can be made to the recital from the other passages above referred
                    to is, that his priesthood was not derived from hereditary descent, but had been
                    conferred on him by the immediate appointment of God.<note anchored="true"

                    something in the character and position of the individual to whom it refers of
                    so singular a nature, as at once to excite curiosity and stimulate further
                    investigation. That in a land inhabited by the accursed race of Canaan, and at a
                    time when the knowledge of the true God was confined apparently to Abraham and

                    type="authorial"><p>Gen. xiv. 19</p></note> and so eminent in dignity and piety,
                    that his blessing was gratefully received by Abraham, and the divinity of his
                    priesthood acknowledged on the part of the patriarch, by an offering to him of
                    tithes, is a circumstance which cannot fail to excite the surprise of every
                    reader of the sacred narrative. It is natural for him to ask, Who or what was
                    this extraordinary character? From what race did he spring? Whence did he derive
                    his knowledge of the true God? Or how came he to be “a king of righteousness,”
                    and “a king of peace,” as well as a priest of God, in the land of Canaan? To
                    these questions the narrative of Moses furnishes no reply, and what is said of
                    him in other parts of Scripture<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    is there assigned to him, as a type of the Messiah. Our only resource in such a
                    case is probable conjecture, and to this it is not surprising that expositors of
                    the Scriptures, both in ancient and modern times, should have had recourse; nor
                    is it to be wondered at that the opinions which they have advocated on the
                    subject have been both numerous and discordant. To recapitulate the whole of
                    these would only be to occupy space which might be far more usefully filled; we
                    shall, therefore, confine ourselves to a statement of one or two of the most
                    prominent, with a brief view of the arguments by which they have been
                    enforced.</p>
                <p>1. By the Jewish expositors generally, Melchisedec is said to have been Shem, the
                    son of Noah, and this, as we learn from Epiphanius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Haeres,</hi> lv. p. 205), was also the opinion entertained by the Samaritans.
                    It has likewise been held by a few Christian interpreters, amongst whom is
                    Luther. The passages from Jewish writers advocating it, have been carefully
                    collected by Bochart, <hi rend="italic">(Phaleg.</hi> lib. ii. c. 1), who has
                    also very satisfactorily shewn its absurdity; apart from the decisive evidence
                    furnished against it by the statement of Paul, that Melchisedec was one whose
                    descent could not be identified with that of the Levites, (<hi rend="italic"
                    >μὴ</hi> γεvε <hi rend="italic">α</hi><hi rend="italic">λ</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >ξ</hi><hi rend="italic">ὐ</hi><hi rend="italic">υτωv,</hi> Heb. vii. 5), a
                    statement which is not true of Shein, who was in the regular line of Levi’s
                    progenitors. It seems highly unreasonable that Moses, who often mentions Shem,
                    should here introduce him under another name, without giving any explanation as
                    to the person really intended; nor is it easily conceivable that Abraham should
                    have been described as “sojourning in g <hi rend="italic">strange</hi> country,”
                    if he had been in the immediate vicinity of his ancestor Shem. The Jews,
                    moreover, are not unanimous in this opinion, for Josephus tells us that
                    Melchisedec was a prince of the Canaanites;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>2. Augustin and Theodoret severally inform us of a class of heretics in the early
                    church, who received the name of Melchisedechians, from their holding the
                    opinion that Melchisedec was a mighty divine power, <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi

                    the model after which Christ was formed. The founder of this sect was one
                    Theodotus, an usurer, who seems to have flourished about the year 174.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Theodoret, <hi rend="italic"

                    learn from Epiphanius, identified this divine power with the Holy Spirit. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Haer.</hi> lv. p. 304). The sect seems to have commanded little
                    attention, and their opinion is worthy of notice only as forming one of the
                    heresies of the early church.</p>
                <p>3. By some of the fathers, and not a few of the more modern expositors,
                    Melchisedec has been regarded as the Logos or second person of the Trinity, who
                    appeared to Abraham, not incarnate, but only, as Epiphanius expresses it, <hi
                    rend="italic">'</hi><hi rend="italic">ε</hi><hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ἰ</hi><hi rend="italic">δ</hi><hi rend="italic">έ</hi><hi

                    the model of man. In defence of this opinion, its advocates adduce, 1st, the
                    acknowledged fact that such appearances were vouchsafed to the patriarchs, as in
                    the case of Abraham, when “the <hi rend="italic">Lord”</hi> communed with him
                    respecting the destruction of Sodom, and of Jacob, when he wrestled with the
                    angel, and saw <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">God</hi> face to face
                    ;” 2dly, the evident mystery attached in Scripture to the person and character
                    of Melchisedec, “of whom,” says Paul, “we have many things to say and hard to be
                    uttered ;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Heb. v.
                    11.</p></note> 3dly, the assertion of the same apostle that Melchisedec was not
                    mortal, implied in his declaration, that'whilst other men who receive tithes
                    die, “it is witnessed of him that he liveth ;”<note anchored="true"

                    > n</hi> 4thly, the strong and unqualified terms in which the unearthly origin
                    of the “order” of his priesthood, and its perpetual duration, are spoken of by
                    the same apostle, as well as by the psalmist;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Heb. vii. 3, &amp;c. Ps. ex. 4.</p></note>
                    5tbly, the language of Paul in regard to the mysterious existence of
                    Melchisedec, as “without father, without mother, without descent, having neither
                    beginning of days nor end of life,” language strikingly applicable to Christ,
                    “whose goings forth have been of old from everlasting,” but hardly tobe
                    understood of a mere man; and, <hi rend="italic">finally,</hi> the circumstance
                    of Melchisedec’s receiving tithes as a free-will offering from Abraham, an
                    homage which was rendered by the pious to none but the Almighty. On the side of
                    this theory are ranked some eminent names both in the early and in the modern
                    church. It is enough to mention those of Ambrose, Damianus, Moulin, Cunaeus,
                    Outrein, Hottinger, Starke, Gaillard, Ridgley, Hunter, Henry, and Brown. A very
                    able defence of this opinion has recently appeared in a work entitled, <hi
                    rend="italic">Melchizedek,</hi> by the author of Balaam, Elijah, &amp;c. London,
                    1834, the production, we believe, of a lady.</p>
                <p>4. By far the most common opinion is, that Melchisedec was a righteous and
                    powerful king, a worshipper and priest <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194206829?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0714-6829-0539"/> of the Most
                    High God, in the land of Canaan, and a type of Jesus Christ. In support of this
                    opinion it is contended,-1st, that the mysterious character attributed to
                    Melchisedec in Scripture, is nothing more than belongs to all the prophetical
                    types; and that when Paul says he has many things to say respecting him which
                    are hard to be uttered, he only means that owing to the carnality of those to
                    whom he was writing, the revelation which he was about to give of the <hi
                    rend="italic">spiritual</hi> character of Melchisedec as a type of Christ, would
                    not be easily apprehended;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    rend="italic">ἀ</hi><hi rend="italic">μ</hi><hi rend="italic">ὴτ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ωp,</hi> implies nothing more than that his descent was not matter
                    of record, in the same way as Sarah is called <hi rend="italic">ἀ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">μ</hi><hi rend="italic">ὴτ</hi><hi rend="italic">ωp</hi> by Philo,
                    because her mother’s name is not known, or as Servius Tullius is said by Livy to
                    have been born <hi rend="italic">patre nullo, matre serva,</hi> because only his
                    mother’s name (Cornicula) was matter of history; 3dly, that what is said of his
                    being “without beginning of days or end of life,” refers merely to our ignorance
                    of the time and manner of his birth and of his death, which are purposely left
                    unrecorded in order that he might serve as a type of Christ “who ever liveth ;”
                    4thly, that in all the <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> instances of divine
                    appearances recorded in the Old Testament, the fact of the Deity’s being present
                    is made apparent in the narrative itself, and that this not being done in the
                    case of Melchisedec renders it unjustifiable, without express authority from
                    some other part of Scripture, to suppose that he was such an appearance; 5thly,
                    that had Melchisedec been himself the Son of God, the apostle would not have
                    said that he was “made like <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic">ἀ</hi><hi

                    to)</hi> the Son of God,” for this would have been to compare him with himself;
                    6thly, that no sufficient reason is apparent from the narrative for so
                    extraordinary a revelation as that of the second person of the Trinity in human
                    shape, nor does any end worthy of such means seem to have been answered by the
                    interview; and, <hi rend="italic">finally,</hi> that Abraham’s offering of a
                    tithe of the spoil might with great propriety be presented to Melchisedec though
                    only a man, as an act of homage not to himself, but to that God whose priest he
                    was and in whose name he had blessed the patriarch. This view of the subject has
                    been adopted by a majority of the fathers as well as of modern divines. It has
                    been strenuously defended by Dr. Owen in his work on the Hebrews, where he
                    denounces the opposite opinion as a series of “groundless fables,” and “woful
                    mistakes,” and has received the suffrages of the greater part of those who have
                    commented upon that epistle, amongst whom may be mentioned the names of Calvin,
                    Cameron, Scott, Blomfield, Stuart, Kuinoel, and Tholuck. It may be regarded as
                    the <hi rend="italic">common</hi> opinion of the orthodox church.</p>
                <p>According to this opinion, the reasoning of St. Paul in the passage referred to
                    goes to establish an analogy between Melchisedec and Christ, in respect of the
