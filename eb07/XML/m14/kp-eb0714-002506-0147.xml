                <p><label type="entry">MAHOMMED, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mohammed</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mahomet</hi></label>, surnamed Abul-Cassem, prophet and
                    legislator of the Moslemins, and founder of the Arabian empire, as well as of
                    the religion to which he has given his name, was born at Mekka on the 10th of
                    November 570 of our era, according to the more probable opinion. He came into
                    the world under considerable disadvantages. His father Abd’allah was a younger
                    son of Abd’almotalleb, and having died young, left his widow and infant son in
                    very mean circumstances, his whole substance consisting only of five camels and
                    one Ethiopian female slave. Abd’almotalleb was, therefore, obliged to take care
                    of his grandchild Mahommed, which he not only did during his own lifetime, but
                    at his death enjoined his eldest son Abu Taleb, who was brother to Abd’allah by
                    the same mother, to provide for him in future, which he very affectionately did,
                    and having instructed him in the business of a merchant, took him into Syria
                    when he was only thirteen, with a view to engage him in that calling. He
                    afterwards recommended him as factor to Khadijah, a noble and rich widow, in
                    whose service he conducted himself so well, that she made him her husband, and
                    thus raised him to an equality with the richest in Mekka.</p>
                <p>Soon afterwards, when he began to live at his ease, in consequence of this
                    advantageous match, he formed the scheme of establishing a new religion; or, as
                    he expressed it, of replanting the only true and ancient faith professed by
                    Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and all the prophets, by destroying the gross
                    idolatry into which the generality of his countrymen had fallen, weeding out the
                    corruptions and superstitions which the Jews and Christians had, as he thought,
                    introduced into their religion, and restoring it to its original purity, which
                    consisted chiefly in the worship of one only God.</p>
                <p>Before he made any attempt abroad, however, he rightly judged that it was
                    necessary for him to begin with the conversion of his own household. Having,
                    therefore, retired with his family, as he had done several times before, to a
                    cave in Mount Hara, he there opened the secret of his mission to his wife
                    Khadijah, and informed her that the angel Gabriel had just before appeared to
                    him, and told him that he was appointed the apostle of God. He also repeated to
                    her a passage which he pretended had been revealed to him by the ministry of the
                    angel, and mentioned those other circumstances of this first appearance which
                    are related by the Mahommedan writers. Khadijah received the news with great
                    joy, swearing by him in whose hands her soul was, that she trusted he would
                    become the prophet of his nation; and she immediately communicated what she had
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200160" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0160-0026"/>heard to her
                    cousin Warakah Ebn Nawfal, who, being a Christian, could write in the Hebrew
                    character, and was tolerably well versed in the Scriptures; whilst he as readily
                    came into her opinion, assuring her that the same angel who had formerly
                    appeared unto Moses was now sent to Mahommed. The first overture made by the
                    prophet was in the month of Ramadan, in the fortieth year of his age, which is
                    therefore usually called the year of his mission.</p>
                <p>Encouraged by so good a beginning, he resolved to proceed, and try for some time
                    what could be done by private persuasion, not daring to hazard the whole affair
                    by exposing it too suddenly to the public. He soon made proselytes of those
                    under his own roof, namely, his wife Khadijah, his servant Zeid Ebn Harctha, to
                    whom he gave his freedom on that occasion, and his cousin and pupil Ali, the son
                    of Abu Taleb, though then very young; but this last, making no account of the
                    other two, used to style himself the “first of believers.” The next person to
                    whom Mahommed applied was Abd’allah Ebn Abi Kohafa, surnamed Abu Bekr, a man of
                    great authority amongst the Koreish, and one whose influence he well knew would
                    be of great service to him. This soon appeared; for Abu Bekr having been gained
                    over, prevailed also on Othman Ebn Affan, Abd’alraham Ebn Awf, Saad Ebn Abbi
                    Wakkas, Al Zobeir Ebn al Awam, and Telha Ebn Obeid’allah, all principal men of
                    Mekka, to follow his example. These were the six chief companions, who, with a
                    few more, were converted in the space of three years; at the end of which,
                    Mahommed having, as he hoped, a sufficient interest to support him, no longer
                    kept his mission a secret, but gave out that God had commanded him to admonish
                    his near relations; and in order to do it more conveniently, and with a greater
                    prospect of success, he directed Ali to prepare an entertainment, and invite the
                    sons and descendants of Abd’almotalleb, intending then to open his mind to them.
                    This was done, and about forty of them came; but Abu Laheb, one of his uncles,
                    making the company break up before Mahomnιed had an opportunity of speaking,
                    obliged him to give them a second invitation the next day, and when they were
                    come he made them the following speech: “I know no man in all Arabia who can
                    offer his kindred a more excellent thing than I now do you; I offer you
                    happiness both in this life and in that which is to come; God Almighty hath
                    commanded me to call you unto him. Who, therefore, amongst you will be assistant
                    to me herein, and become my brother and my vicegerent?” All of them hesitating,
                    and declining the matter, Ali at length rose up, and declared that he would be
                    his assistant, and vehemently threatened those who should oppose him. Upon this
                    Mahommed embraced Ali with great demonstrations of affection, and desired all
                    who were present to hearken to and obey him as his deputy; at which the company
                    broke out into loud laughter, telling Abu Taleb that he must now pay obedience
                    to his son.</p>
                <p>This repulse, however, was so far from discouraging Mahommed, that he began to
                    preach in public to the people, who heard him with some patience, until he came
                    to upbraid them with the idolatry, obstinacy, and perverseness of themselves and
                    their fathers; but this so highly incensed them, that they declared themselves
                    his enemies, and would soon have procured his ruin, had be not been protected by
                    Abu Taleb. The chief of the Korcish warmly solicited this person to desert his
                    nephew, making frequent remonstrances against the innovations which he was
                    attempting to introduce; and when these proved ineffectual, they at length
                    threatened him withan open rupture, if he did not prevail upon Mahommed to
                    desist. At this Abu Taleb was so far moved, that he earnestly dissuaded his
                    nephew from pursuing the affair any farther, representing the great danger which
                    he and his friends must otherwise run. But Mahommed was not to be intimidated,
                    telling his uncle plainly, “that if they set the sun against him on his right
                    hand, and the moon on his left he would not abandon his enterprise and Abu
                    Taleb, seeing him so firmly resolved to proceed, used no further arguments, but
                    promised to stand by him against all his enemies.</p>
                <p>The Koreish, finding that they could not prevail either by fair words or menaces,
                    tried what they could do by force and ill treatment, using Mahommed’s followers
                    so very injuriously, that it was not safe for them to continue any longer at
                    Mekka; whereupon Mahommed gave leave to such of them as had not friends to
                    protect them, to seek refuge elsewhere. And accordingly, in the fifth year of
                    the prophet’s mission, sixteen of them, four of whom were women, fled into
                    Ethiopia; and amongst these were Othman Ebn Affan and bis wife Rakiyah,
                    Mahommed’s daughter. This was the first flight; but afterwards several others
                    followed, his adherents retiring one after another, to the number of
                    eighty-three men and eighteen women, besides children. These refugees were
                    kindly received by the Najashi, or king of Ethiopia, who refused to deliver them
                    up to those whom the Koreish sent to demand them, and, as the Arabian writers
                    unanimously attest, even professed the Mahommedan religion.</p>
                <p>In the sixth year of his mission, Mahommed had the pleasure of seeing his party
                    strengthened by the conversion of his uncle Hamza, a man of great valour and
                    merit; and of Omar Ebn al Kattab, a person highly esteemed, and once a violent
                    opponent of the prophet. As persecution generally advances rather than obstructs
                    the spreading of a religion, Islamism made so great progress amongst the Arabian
                    tribes, that the Koreish, in order, if possible, to suppress it effectually, in
                    the seventh year of Mahommed’s mission, made a solemn league or covenant against
                    the Hashemites and the family of Abd’almotalleb, engaging themselves to contract
                    no marriages with any of them, and to have no communication with them; and, to
                    give this compact the greater sanction, reduced it into writing, and laid it up
                    in the Kaaba. Upon this the tribe became divided into two factions; and the
                    family of Hashem all repaired to Abu Taleb as their head, excepting only Abd’al
                    Uzza, surnamed <hi rend="italic">Abu Laheb, who,</hi> out of inveterate hatred
                    to his nephew and his doctrine, went over to the opposite party, whose chief was
                    Abu Sosian Ebn Harb, of the family of Ommeya.</p>
                <p>The families continued thus at variance for three years; but in the tenth year of
                    his mission, Mahommed told his uncle Abu Taleb, that God had manifestly showed
                    his disapprobation of the league which the Koreish had made against them, by
                    sending a worm to eat cut every word of the instrument except the name of God.
                    Of this accident Mahommed had probably received some private notice; for Abu
                    Taleb went immediately to the Koreish, and acquainted them with it, offering, if
                    it proved false, to deliver his nephew up to them; but in case it were true, he
                    insisted that they ought to lay aside their animosity, and annul the league
                    which they had entered into against the Hashemites. To this they acquiesced,
                    and, going to inspect the writing, to their great astonishment found it to be as
                    Abu Taleb had said; upon which the league was declared void.</p>
                <p>In the same year Abu Taleb died, at the age of above fourscore; and it is the
                    general opinion that he died an infidel, though others say, that when he was at
                    the point of death he embraced Mahommedanism, and produce some passages from his
                    poetical compositions to confirm their assertion. About a month, or, as some
                    state, only three days, after the desth of this great benefactor and patron,
                    Mahommed had the additional mortification to lose his wife Khadijah, who had so
                    generously made his fortune; for which reason this year is denominated the “year
                    of mourning.”</p>
                <p>On the death of these two persons, the Koreish began <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200173" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0173-0027"/>to be more troublesome than
                    ever to the prophet, and especially some who had formerly been his intimate
                    friends; insomuch that he found himself obliged to seek shelter elsewhere, and
                    first pitched upon Tayer, about sixty miles east from Mekka, as the place of his
                    retreat. Thither therefore he went, accompanied by his servant Zeid, and applied
                    himself to two of the chief of the tribe of Thakif, who were the inhabitants of
                    that place; but they received him very coldly. However, he staid there a month,
                    and some of the more considerate and better sort of men treated him with a
                    little respect; but the slaves and inferior people at length rose against him,
                    and bringing him to the wall of the city, obliged him to depart and return to
                    Mekka, where, on his arrival, he put himself under the protection of Al Motaam
                    Ebn Adi.</p>
                <p>This repulse greatly discouraged his followers. However, Mahommed was not wanting
                    to himself, but boldly continued to preach to the public assemblies at the
                    pilgrimage, and gained several proselytes, amongst whom were six of the
                    inhabitants of Yathreb, of the Jewish tribe of Khazraj, who, on their return
                    home, failed not to speak much in commendation of their new religion, and
                    exhorted their fellow-citizens to embrace the same.</p>
                <p>It was in the twelfth year of his-mission that Mahommed gave out that he had made
                    his night journey from Mekka to Jerusalem, and thence to heaven. Dr Prideaux
                    thinks he invented this fable, either to answer the expectations of those who
                    demanded some miracle as a proof of his mission, or else, by pretending to have
                    conversed with God, to establish the authority of whatever he should think fit
                    to leave behind by way of oral tradition, and make his sayings to serve the same
                    purpose as the oral law of the Jews. But it does not appear that Mahommed
                    himself ever expected that so great respect should be paid to his sayings as his
                    followers have since shown; and seeing that he all along disclaimed any power of
                    performing miracles, it seems rather to have been a fetch of policy to raise his
                    reputation, by pretending to have actually conversed with God in heaven, as
                    Moses had heretofore done in the mount, and to have received several
                    institutions immediately from Him, whereas before he contented himself with
                    persuading them that he had received all by the ministry of Gabriel.</p>
                <p>However, this story seemed so absurd and incredible, that several of his
                    followers left him on its promulgation; and it would probably have ruined the
                    whole design, had not Abu Bekr vouched for bis veracity, and declared, that if
                    Mahommed affirmed it to be true, he verily believed the whole. This happy
                    incident not only retrieved the prophet’s credit, but increased it to such a
                    degree that he was secure of being able to make his disciples swallow whatever
                    he pleased in future to impose on them. And this fiction, notwithstanding its
                    extravagance, was one of the most artful contrivances Mahommed ever put in
                    practice, and what chiefly contributed to raise his reputation to the great
                    height to which it afterwards attained.</p>
                <p>In this year, called by the Mahommedans the “accepted year,” twelve men of
                    Yathreb or Medina, of whom ten were of the tribe of Kahzraj, and the other two
                    of that of Aws, came to Mekka, and took an oath of fidelity to Mahommed at Al
                    Akaba, a hill on the north of that city. This oath was called the “women’s oath
                    not that any women were present at this time, but because a man was not thereby
                    obliged to take up arms in defence of Mahommed or his religion. In fact, this
                    was the same oath that was afterwards exacted of the women, the form of which we
                    have in the Koran, and it is to this effect: That they should renounce all
                    idolatry; that they should not steal nor commit fornication, nor kill their
                    children (as the Pagan Arabs used to do when they apprehended they should not be
                    able to maintain them), nor forge calumnies; and that they should obey the
                    prophet in all things that were reasonable. When they had solemnly engaged to
                    all this, Mahommed sent home with them one of his disciples, named Masab Ebn
                    Omair, to instruct them more fully in the grounds and ceremonies of his new
                    religion. Masab being arrived at Medina, by the assistance of those who had been
                    formerly converted, gained several proselytes, particularly Osaid Ebn Hodeira, a
                    chief man of the city, and Saad Ebn Moadh, prince of the tribe of Aws; and
                    Mahommedanism spread so fast, that there was scarcely a house in which there
                    were not some who had embraced it.</p>
                <p>The next year, being the thirteenth of Mahommed’s mission, Masab returned to
                    Mekka, accompanied by seventy-three men and two women of Medina who had
                    professed Islamism, besides some others who were as yet unbelievers. On their
                    arrival they immediately sent to Mahommed, and offered him their assistance, of
                    which he was now in great need; for by this time his adversaries were grown so
                    powerful in Mekka, that he could not stay there much longer without imminent
                    danger. Wherefore he accepted their proposal, and met them one night, by
                    appointment, at Al Akaba above mentioned, attended by his uncle Al Abbas, who,
                    though he was not then a believer, wished his nephew well, and made a speech to
                    those of Medina, in which he told them, that as Mahommed was obliged to quit his
                    native city, and seek an asylum elsewhere, and they had offered him their
                    protection, they would do well not to deceive him; that if they were not firmly
                    resolved to defend, and not betray him, they had better declare their minds, and
                    let him provide for his safety in some other manner. Upon their protesting their
                    sincerity, Mahommed swore to be faithful to them, on condition that they should
                    protect him against all insults as heartily as they would their own wives and
                    families. They then asked him what recompense they were to expect if they should
                    happen to be killed in his quarrel; to which he answered, Paradise. They then
                    pledged their faith to him, and so returned home, after Mahommed had chosen
                    twelve out of their number, who were to have the same authority amongst them as
                    the twelve apostles of Christ had amongst his disciples.</p>
                <p>Hitherto Mahommed had propagated his religion by fair means, so that the whole
                    success of his enterprise, prior to his flight to Medina, must be attributed to
                    persuasion only, and not to compulsion. For, before the second oath of fealty or
                    inauguration at Al Akaba, he had no permission to use any force at all: and in
                    several places of the Koran, which he pretended were revealed during his stay at
                    Mekka, he declares that his business was only to preach and admonish; that he
                    had no authority to compel any person to embrace his religion; and that, whether
                    people believed or not was no concern of bis, but belonged solely unto God. And
                    he was so far from allowing his followers to use force, that he exhorted them to
                    bear patiently those injuries which were offered them on account of their faith;
                    and, when persecuted himself, he chose rather to quit the place of his birth and
                    retire to Medina, than to make any resistance. But this passiveness and
                    moderation seem to have been entirely owing to his want of power, and the great
                    superiority of his opponents for the first twelve years of his mission. For no
                    sooner was he enabled, by the assistance of those of Medina, to make head
                    against his enemies, than he gave out that God had allowed him and his followers
                    to defend themselves against the infidels; and at length, as his forces
                    increased, he pretended to have the divine permission to attack them, destroy
                    idolatry, and set up the true faith by the sword. Finding, by experience, that
                    his designs would proceed very slowly if they were not utterly overthrown, and
                    knowing that innovators, when they depend solely on their own strength, and can
                    employ compulsion, seldom run any risk, he scrupled not to do so; and hence
                    Machiavelli has observed, that all the armed <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200186"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-0186-0028"/>prophets have succeeded, and the unarmed ones have
                    failed. Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus, would not have been able to
                    establish the observance of their institutions ſoi any length of time, had they
                    not been armed. The first passage of the Koran which gave Mahommed the
                    permission of defending himself by arms, is said to have been that in the
                    twenty-second chapter; after which a great number to the same purpose were
                    opportunely revealed.</p>
                <p>That Mahommed had a right to take up arms in his own defence against his unjust
                    persecutors, may perhaps be allowed; but whether he ought afterwards to have
                    made use of them for the establishing of his religion, it is not so easy to
                    determine. How far the secular power may or ought to interpose in affairs of
                    this nature, mankind are by no means agreed. The method of converting by the
                    sword gives no very favourable idea of the faith which is so propagated, and is
                    disallowed by everybody in those of another religion, though the same persons
                    are willing to admit of it for the advancement of their own, supposing that,
                    though a false religion ought not to be established by authority, yet a true one
                    may; and accordingly force is almost as constantly employed in these cases by
                    those who have the power in their hands, as it is constantly complained of by
                    the parties who suffer the violence. It is certainly one of the most convincing
                    proofs that Mahommedanism was no other than a human invention, that it owed its
                    progress and establishment almost entirely to the sword; and it is one of the
                    strongest demonstrations of the divine origin of Christianity, that it prevailed
                    against all the force and powers of the world by the mere efficacy of its own
                    truth, after having stood the assaults of all manner of persecutions, as well as
                    other oppositions, for three hundred years together, and at length made the
                    Roman emperors themselves submit to its authority. After this time, indeed, the
                    proof seems to fail; Christianity being then established and Paganism abolished
                    by public authority, a circumstance which has had great influence in the
                    propagation of the one and the destruction of the other.</p>
                <p>Mahommed having provided for the security of his companions as well as his own,
                    by the league offensive and defensive which he had now concluded with those of
                    Medina, directed them to repair thither, which they accordingly did; but he
                    himself, along with Abu Bekr and Ali, staid behind, having not yet received the
                    divine permission, as he pretended, to leave Mekka. The Koreish fearing the
                    consequences of this new alliance, began to think it absolutely necessary to
                    prevent Mahommed’s escape to Medina; and having held a council thereon, after
                    several milder expedients had been rejected, they came to a resolution that he
                    should be killed, and agreed that a man should be chosen out of every tribe for
                    the execution of this design, and that each man should have a blow at him with
                    his sword, in order that the guilt of his blood might fall equally upon all the
                    tribes, to whose united power the Hashemites were much inferior, and therefore
                    durst not attempt to revenge their kinsman’s death.</p>
                <p>This conspiracy was scarcely formed, when, by some means or other, it came to
                    Mahommed’s knowledge; and he gave out that it had been revealed to him by the
                    angel Gabriel, who had also ordered him to retire to Medina. Wherefore, to amuse
                    his enemies, he directed Ali to lie down in his place, and wrap himself up in
                    his green cloak, which he did; and Mahommed escaped, miraculously as they
                    pretend, to Abu Bekr’s house, unperceived by the conspirators, who had already
                    assembled at the prophet’s door. The latter, in the mean time, looking through
                    the crevice, and seeing Ali, whom they took to be Mahommed himself, asleep,
                    continued watching there till morning, when Ali arose, and they found themselves
                    deceived.</p>
                <p>From Abu Bekr’s house Mahommed and he went to a cave in Mount Thur, to the
                    south-east of Mekka, accompanied only by Amer Ebn Foheirah, Abu Bekr’s servant,
                    and Abdallah Ebn Oreitah, an idolater whom they had hired as a guide. In this
                    cave they lay concealed three days, to avoid the search of their enemies, which
                    they very narrowly escaped, and not without the assistance of more miracles than
                    one; for some say that the Koreish were struck with blindness, so that they
                    could not find the cave, and others, that after Mahommed and his companions had
                    got in, two pigeons laid their eggs at the entrance, and a spider covered the
                    mouth of the cave with her web, which made them look no farther. Abu Bekr seeing
                    the prophet in such imminent danger, became very sorrowful; upon which Mahommed
                    comforted him with these words, recorded in the Koran, “Be not grieved, for God
                    is with us.” Their enemies having retired, they left the cave, and set out for
                    Medina by a by-road; and having fortunately, or, as the Mahommedans tell us,
                    miraculously, escaped some who were sent to pursue them, arrived safely at that
                    city, whither Ali followed them in three days, after he had settled some affairs
                    at Mekka.</p>
                <p>The first thing Mahommed did after his arrival at Medina, was to build a temple
                    for his religious worship, and a house for himself, which he did upon a piece of
                    ground that had before served to put camels in, or, as others tell us, for a
                    burying-ground, and belonged to Sahal and So-heil, the sons of Amru, who were
                    orphans. This action Dr Prideaux exclaims against, representing it as a flagrant
                    instance of injustice; for, says he, Mahommed violently dispossessed these two
                    orphans, the sons of an inferior artificer, of this ground, and so founded the
                    first fabric of his worship with the same wickedness as he did his religion.
                    But, to say nothing of the improbability that Mahommed should act in so
                    impolitic a manner at such a time, and in such circumstances, the Mahommedan
                    writers set this affair in a quite different light. One tells us that he treated
                    with the youths about the price of the ground, but they desired he would accept
                    it as a present; whilst other historians of good credit assure us that he
                    actually bought it, and that the money was paid by Abu Bekr. Besides, had
                    Mahommed accepted it as a present, the orphans were in circumstances sufficient
                    to afford it; for they were of a very good family, of the tribe of Najjer, one
                    of the most illustrious amongst the Arabs, and not the sons of a carpenter, as
                    Dr l ’ rideaux imagines, taking the word <hi rend="italic">Najjer,</hi> which
                    signifies a carpenter, for an appellative, whereas it is a proper name.</p>
                <p>Mahommed, being securely settled at Medina, and able not only to defend himself
                    against the insults of his enemies, but to attack them, began to send out small
                    parties to make reprisals on the Koreish. The first party, consisting of no more
                    than nine men, intercepted and plundered a caravan belonging to that tribe, and
                    in the action took two prisoners. But what established his affairs, and proved
                    the foundation on which he built all his succeeding greatness, was the gaining
                    of the battle of Bedr, which was fought in the second year of the Hejira, and is
                    so famous in the Mahommedan history. Some reckon no less than twenty-seven
                    expeditions in which Mahommed was personally present, in nine of which he gave
                    battle, besides several other expeditions in which he was not present. His
                    forces he maintained partly by the contributions of his followers for this
                    purpose, which he called by the name of <hi rend="italic">zacat</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">alms,</hi> the payment of which he very artfully made one main
                    article of his religion; and partly by ordering a fifth part of the plunder to
                    be brought into the public treasury for that purpose, in which matter he also
                    pretended to act by the divine direction.</p>
                <p>In a few years, by the success of his arms, he raised considerably his credit and
                    power. In,the sixth year of the Hejira he set out with fourteen hundred men to
                    visit <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200199" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0199-0029"/>the
                    temple of Mekka, though not with any intent of committing hostilities. However,
                    when he came to Al Ho-deibiya, which is situated partly within and partly
                    without the sacred territory, the Koreish sent to let him know that they would
                    not permit him to enter Mekka unless he forced his way; upon which he called his
                    troops around him, and they having all taken a solemn oath of fealty or homage
                    to him, he resolved to attack the city; but those of Mekka sending Arwa Ebn
                    Masun, prince of the tribe of Thakif, as their ambassador, to desire peace, a
                    truce was concluded between them for ten years, by which any person was allowed
                    to enter into a league either with Mahommed or with the Koreish, as he thought
                    fit</p>
                <p>It may not be improper, in order to show the inconceivable veneration and respect
                    the Mahommedans by this time had for their prophet, to mention the account which
                    the above-mentioned ambassador, at his return, gave the Koreish of their
                    behaviour. He said he had been at the courts both of the Roman emperor and of
                    the king of Persia, and never saw any prince so highly respected by his subjects
                    as Mahommed was by his companions; for, whenever he made the ablution, in order
                    to say his prayers, they ran and caught the water which he had used; and
                    whenever he spit, they immediately licked it up, and gathered every hair that
                    fell from him, with the most eager superstition.</p>
                <p>In the seventh year of the Hejira, Maliommed began to think of propagating his
                    religion beyond the limits of Arabia, and sent messengers to the neighbouring
                    princes, with letters to invite them to espouse Mahommedanism. Nor was this
                    project without some success. Khosru Parviz, then king of Persia, received his
                    letter with great disdain, and tore it in a passion, sending away the messenger
                    very abruptly; which, when Mahommed heard, he said, “God shall tear his
                    kingdom.” And soon afterwards a messenger came to Mahommed from Badhan king of
                    Yemen, who was a dependent on the Persians, to acquaint him that he bad received
                    orders to send him to Khosm. Mahommed put off his answer till the next morning,
                    and then told the messenger that it had been revealed to him during the night
                    that Khosru was slain by his son Shiruych; adding, that he was well assured his
                    new religion and empire would rise to as great a height as that of Khosru; and
                    therefore bade him advise his master to embrace Mahommedanism. The messenger
                    having returned, Badhan in a few days received a letter from Shiruych, informing
                    him of his father’s death, and ordering him to give the prophet no further
                    disturbance; upon which Badhan and the Persians along with him turned
                    Mahommedans.</p>
                <p>The Emperor Heraclius, as the Arabian historians assure us, received Mahommed’s
                    letter with great respect, laying it on bis pillow, and dismissed the bearer
                    honourably; and some pretend that he would have professed this new faith, had he
                    not been afraid of losing his crown.</p>
                <p>Mahommed wrote to the same effect to the king of Ethiopia, though, according to
                    the Arabian writers, he had been concerted before; and to Mokawkas, governor of
                    Egypt, who gave the messenger a very favourable reception, and sent several
                    valuable presents to Mahommed, and amongst the rest two girls, one of whom,
                    named Mary, became a great favourite with him. He also sent letters of similar
                    au∣∙port to several Arabian princes, particularly one to Al areth Ebn Abi
                    Shamar, king of Ghassan, who returning for answer that he would go to Mahommed
                    himself, the prophet said, “May his kingdom perish ;” another to Hawd-ha Ebn
                    Ali, king of Yemanah, who was a Christian; and a third to Al Monder Ebn Sawa,
                    king of Bahrein, who embraced Mahommedanisra, and all the Arabians of that
                    country followed his example.</p>
                <p>The eighth year of the Hejira proved very fortunate for Mahommed. In the
                    beginning of it, Khaled Ebn al Walid and Amru Ebn al As, both excellent
                    soldiers, the former of whom afterwards conquered Syria and other countries, and
                    the latter Egypt, became proselytes to Mahom∙∙ medanism. And soon afterwards the
                    prophet sent three thousand men against the Grecian forces, to revenge the death
                    of one of his ambassadors, who, being sent to the governor of Bosra, upon the
                    same errand as those who went to the above-mentioned princes, was slain by an
                    Arab of the tribe of Ghassan, at Muta, a town in the territory of Balka in
                    Syria, about three days’journey eastward from Jerusalem, near which they
                    encountered. The Grecians being vastly superior in number (for, including the
                    auxiliary Arabs, they had an army of a hundred thousand men), the Mahommedans
                    were repulsed in the first attack, and lost successively three of their
                    generals, Zeid Ebn Haretha, Mahommed’s freedman, Jaafar the son of Abu Taleb,
                    and Abdallah Ebn Rawaha; but Khaled Ebn al Walid succeeding to the command,
                    overthrew the Greeks with great slaughter, and brought away abundance of spoil.
                    On occasion of this action Mahommed gave him the title of <hi rend="italic">Seif
                    min soynf Allah,</hi> one of the swords of God.</p>
                <p>In this year also Mahommed took the city of Mekka, the inhabitants of which had
                    broken the truce concluded two years before. For the tribe of Bekr, who were
                    confederates with the Koreish, attacking those of Khozaah, who were allies of
                    Mahommed, killed several of them, being supported in the action by a party of
                    the Koreish themselves. The consequence of this violation was soon apprehended,
                    and Abu Sosian himself made a journey to Medina on purpose to heal the breach
                    and renew the truce; but in vain. Mahommed, glad of this opportunity, refused to
                    see him; upon which he applied to Abu Bekr and Ali, but they gave him no answer,
                    and he was obliged to return to Mekka as he came.</p>
                <p>Mahommed immediately gave orders for preparations to be made, that he might
                    surprise the Mekkans whilst they were unprovided to receive him. In a little
                    time he began his march thither; and by the time he came near the city, his
                    forces were increased to about ten thousand men. Those of Mekka, not being in a
                    condition to defend themselves against so formidable an army, surrendered at
                    discretion; and Abu Sosian saved his life by turning Mahommedan. About
                    twenty-eight of the idolaters were killed by a party under the command of
                    Khaled; but this happened contrary to Mahommed’s orders, who, when he entered
                    the town, pardoned all the Koreish on their submission, except only six men and
                    four women, who were more obnoxious than the rest, some of them having
                    apostatized, and been solemnly proscribed by the prophet himself; but of these
                    no more than three men and one woman were put to death, the rest obtained pardon
                    on their embracing Mahommedanism, and one of the women made her escape· The
                    remainder of this year Mahommed employed in destroying the idols in and around
                    Mekka, at the same time sending several of his generals on expeditions for that
                    purpose, and to invite the Arabs to espouse Islamism; in which also they now met
                    with great success.</p>
                <p>The next year, being the ninth of the Hejira, the Mahommedans call “the year of
                    embassies for the Arabs had been hitherto expecting the issue of the war between
                    Mahommed and the Koreish; but as soon as that tribe, the principal of the whole
                    nation, and the genuine descendants of Ishmael, whose prerogatives none offered
                    to dispute, had submitted, they were satisfied that it was not in their power to
                    oppose Mahommed, and therefore began to come in to him in great numbers, and to
                    send embassies to make their submission to him, both at Mekka, whilst he staid
                    there, and also at Medina, whither he returned this year. Amongst the rest, five
                    kings of the tribe of Hamyar professed Mahommedanism, and sent ambassadors to
                    notify their conversion.</p>
                <p>In the tenth year, Ali was sent into Yemen, there to propagate<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200212" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0212-0030"/> the Mahommedan faith; and,
                    it is said, he converted the whole tribe of Hamdan in one day. Their example was
                    quickly followed by all the inhabitants of that province, excepting only those
                    of Najran, who, being Christians, chose rather to pay tribute. Thus was
                    Mahommedanism established, and idolatry rooted out, even in Mahommed’s lifetime,
                    throughout all Arabia, excepting only Yemanah, where Mosaïlamah, who had set up
                    also for a prophet as Mahommed’s competitor, had formed a great party, and was
                    not reduced until the caliphate of Abu Bekr. The Arabs being then united in one
                    faith, and under one prince, found themselves in a condition to make those
                    conquests which extended the Mahommedan faith over so large a portion of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>Until his sixty-third year, Mahommed had sustained with undiminished vigour all
                    the fatigues of his extraordinary mission. The infirmities of age had not
                    impaired his constitution, and though his health had suffered a decline, he
                    still continued equal to the duties which he found himself called upon to
                    perform. But though master of Arabia, dreaded by the Greeks and the Persians,
                    and respected by his disciples as a tutelar divinity, this famous legislator did
                    not long enjoy the empire of which he had just laid the foundation. Two months
                    after his return to Medina, whilst in the house of Zainab, one of his wives, he
                    was attacked with a violent pain in the head, accompanied with fever, the cause
                    of which he attributed to poison, which he had taken three years before. He
                    immediately caused himself to be removed to the house of Aichah, another of his
                    wives, to whom he was strongly attached. But his malady was increased by the
                    intelligence he received of the progress of two apostates from his religion, who
                    had revolted on two different points; namely, Mosaïlamah, in the province of
                    Yemanah, and Aswad-el-Ansi, in that of Yemen. Mahommed did not see the end of
                    the first of these rebellions; but before closing his career he had the
                    consolation to ascertain that the second of these revolts had been suppressed by
                    the death of him who was at its head. To allay the heat which consumed him,
                    Mahommed ordered his women to pour a large quantity of cold water on his body.
                    The affusion afforded him immediate relief, and he found himself so well in
                    consequence, that next day, supported by Ali, and by Fadhl the son of Abba, he
                    went to the mosque, where he celebrated the praises of God, humbly asked pardon
                    of his sins, and expressed his readiness to make reparation to such as he might
                    have unconsciously wronged. He prayed God for the Moslemins who had perished
                    combating for the faith; and then gave his last orders to the most zealous and
                    faithful of his disciples, recommending to them to expel all idolaters from
                    Arabia, to grant to proselytes all the privileges enjoyed by natural-born
                    Moslemins, and to be constant and regular in prayer. Notwithstanding his
                    weakness, he continued to repair daily to the mosque; but on the Friday before
                    his death, being no longer in a condition to perform the functions of imam, he
                    ordered Abu Bekr to supply his place. One day, in an access of delirium, he
                    demanded a pen and paper, in order to write a book which might serve as a guide
                    to his disciples; but Omar opposed his request, because, said he, the Koran,
                    which is the book of God, ought to be sufficient for this purpose. At length,
                    after fifteen days of severe suffering, Mahommed having thrown a little water on
                    his countenance, said, “Lord, be merciful to me, and place me amongst the number
                    of those whom thou hast distinguished by thy grace and favour and immediately
                    after expired. According to the most accurate computation, his death took place
                    on the 13th of raby 1st, in the eleventh year of the Hejira (corresponding to
                    the 8th of June 632 of the Christian era), after he had lived sixty-three years,
                    prophecied twenty-three, commanded the Arabs about ten, and laid the foundations
                    of an empire which, aggrandized by his successors, comprehended, in less than a
                    century, more countries than the Romans had conquered during eight centuries;
                    and also after he had seen established a religion which still predominates over
                    the half of the ancient hemisphere. The death of Mahommed caused a great tumult
                    at Medina. The people who besieged his door refused to believe that he was
                    mortal, and pretended that he had been taken up into heaven like Jesus Christ;
                    and this notion was espoused by Omar, who threatened to exterminate all those
                    who should maintain the contrary opinion.</p>
                <p>The personal appearance and private life of the prophet have been minutely
                    described by the Arabian writers. He was of the middle height, and of a sanguine
                    temperament; his head was large, and his complexion dark, but animated by ruddy
                    hues; his features were regular and strongly formed, his eyes black, and full of
                    fire; he had a prominent forehead, an aquiline nose, full cheeks, and
                    well-proportioned jaws; his mouth, though rather wide, was well formed, and his
                    teeth white but not closely set; his hair, before he had it shaved off, was
                    black, and his thick bushy beard had scarcely begun to blench at the time of his
                    death; on the lower lip he had a small black mark, and between his eyebrows a
                    vein which swelled under the excitement of choler. His physiognomy was at once
                    mild and majestic, and his gait free notwithstanding his stoutness. His bones
                    were thick and solid; the soles <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his feet and the palms
                    of his hands were strong and coarse; his ear was acute, his voice fine and
                    sonorous; and between the shoulders he had an excrescence or wen, which the
                    Mahommedans called “the seal of the prophecy,” and which disappeared after his
                    death. Such is the portrait which the Arabian authors have left us of Mahommed,
                    and of which the exactness seems to be attested by the minuteness of the
                    details.</p>
                <p>From the same source may also be collected the principal traits of his character.
                    They dwell upon his penetration and prudence, as well as the equity and severe
                    impartiality of his judgments; his love for the poor; his constant endeavours to
                    revive the worship of the true God; his aversion to futile conversation; the
                    gentleness and safety of his intercourse; his manners noble and polished with
                    strangers, gay and familiar with his friends, affable and indulgent with his
                    domestics. Simple and moderate in his habits, he did not hesitate to milk his
                    own goats, and also to repair his dress and his sandals when they required it.
                    His sobriety was so great, that he lived on barley-bread, abstained from
                    entirely satisfying his appetite, and frequently, to overcome the sensation of
                    hunger, compressed his stomach with a stone strongly attached to it. His family,
                    imitating his temperance, abstained from all luxuries, living on dates and pure
                    water. Endowed with admirable fortitude and patience, he received the favours of
                    fortune and the frowns otadversity with equal resignation. During his first
                    compaign, having losthis daughter Rakiyah, who had been married to Othman, he
                    learned the tidings of her death without emotion, and said without a tear, “Let
                    us render thanks to God, and receive as a blessing even the death of our
                    children.” Mahommed was not insensible to gratitude, and constant in his
                    friendships; he knew how to preserve his friends in adversity,and howto win his
                    enemies in prosperity. He was religious in the observance of treaties, and
                    seldom abused the privilege of victory; unless when, compelled by necessity to
                    provide for his own safety, he thought it his duty to strike terror into a
                    perfidious tribe by a terrible example. His natural clemency rarely belied
                    itself, and there is no instance of his having committed in cold blood any of
                    those horrible atrocities which sully so many pages in the history of the best
                    governed nations. Whatever Mahommed may be reproached withal, the impartial
                    judgment of history must assign a distinguished place to that extraordinary man,
                    who, by his genius alone, caused the most astonishing revolution recorded in the
                    annals of the world; who not only exercised <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200225"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-0225-0031"/>the greatest influence upon the age in which he
                    lived, but has preserved it during the twelve centuries which have since
                    elapsed; and whose doctrine, notwithstanding all its errors and imperfections,
                    conveys noble ideas of the divinity, and recalls to man the dignity of his
                    nature, and his final destination. The principal vice with which Mahommed is
                    chargeable, is that of incontinence; a vice indeed of which his countrymen, and
                    even the Koran itself, furnish indubitable proofs, and which, strange as it may
                    appear, he first exhibited about the age of fifty, after the death of Khadijah,
                    his first wife. It was then that he espoused successively some twelve or fifteen
                    wives, although the Koran had only authorized four, and thus, by his example,
                    gave great scandal to his followers.</p>
                <p>To form a sound estimate of the character of Mahommed as the founder of a new
                    religion and a new empire, we would require to know whether, from the
                    commencement of this enterprise, he was moved by ambition, and the desire of
                    conquest and domination; or whether, from the first, the only object whichhe
                    proposed to himself was to substitute, for the idolatrous worship of his
                    countrymen, a religion more worthy of the divinity, and more conformable to the
                    interests of society and the nature of man. If attention be given to the conduct
                    which he observed until the moment when the persecutions of his countrymen and
                    neighbours forced him to seek ah asylum at Medina, it will not be difficult to
                    admit the second supposition as the more probable; and if he cannot be freed
                    from the reproach of having deceived men by attributing to himself a divine
                    mission which he had not received, it may perhaps be conceded that the end which
                    he contemplated gives to his imposture a character less odious than would
                    otherwise belong to it. The history, and the text even, of the Koran may satisfy
                    us, that if, instead of abolishing a multitude of absurd or ridiculous practices
                    which were in use amongst the Arabian idolaters, he had consecrated some of
                    these by connecting them with the religion he preached, this would only have
                    been an act of policy on his part, a species of condescension or accommodation
                    which could not have entered into the plan of the religion he had at first
                    formed, and which was but little removed from Judaism. We know not, it is true,
                    what, upon this supposition, the public worship might have been; and it is
                    possible that Mahommed, who had seen the Jews without altars, without priests,
                    without victims, and without a ritual, might not at first have been disposed to
                    think that a distinct scheme of worship, and ceremonies which speak to the
                    senses, were necessary to form a national religion. But, however this may be, it
                    should always be remembered that he abolished a great number of practices
                    revolting to reason and humanity, and which ancient usage had naturalized
                    amongst the inhabitants of Arabia. It is generally believed that Mahommed had
                    declared that he had not received the power of working miracles in proof of the
                    truth of his mission; and many passages of the Koran seem to justify this
                    opinion. It was, in fact, the best means which Mahommed could employ to escape
                    the importunity of the Jews, and particularly of the Christians, who were
                    accustomed to consider supernatural works as the only irrefragable proof of an
                    extraordinary mission. But it must not be concluded from this that Mahommed
                    never supposed that God had wrought wonders in his favour, and that he disdained
                    this means of making proselytes, or confirming the confidence of his followers.
                    Not to mention the divine origin claimed for his pretended revelation, and the
                    frequent defiance addressed to his adversaries, whom he challenged to compose
                    any thing equal to the Koran in miraculous eloquence, and without adverting to
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">prodigies</hi> or <hi rend="italic">signs</hi>
                    given to each of the verses of that book; it is sufficient to observe, that the
                    miraculous voyage of Mahommed to Jerusalem, and his nocturnal ascension into
                    heaven, form the subject of an entire chapter, and that more than once he speaks
                    of the divine succours which he received from heaven in different encounters
                    with the infidels, especially on the sanguinary day of Bedr. There is reason to
                    believe, then, that the recitals to be found in the most accredited writers, of
                    the marvellous circumstances in the life of Mahommed, were circulated amongst
                    the Moslemins even during his life; and that if he himself did not invent these
                    miracles, he at least permitted some of his first disciples to take advantage of
                    the credulity of the people, in order to persuade them that at his voice the
                    moon was cleft in twain, that the trees and the rocks had saluted him, and that
                    the entrance of the cave where he lay concealed with Abu Bekr, after he had
                    quitted Mekka to repair to Medina, was immediately covered by a spider’s web, to
                    screen from his pursuers the place of his retreat. It is no doubt true that
                    these recitals were afterwards surcharged with a multitude of circumstances
                    still less credible, and altogether unknown to the first Moslemins, and that new
                    prodigies were hatched by fanaticism and the love of the marvellous; but this
                    affords no reason for absolving Mahommed from a species of artifice so powerful
                    over the multitude, or for acquitting his first disciples of a credulity which
                    accords so well with their enthusiasm. And why should he who feigned divine
                    revelations to excuse or to palliate the scandal of his incontinence, and to
                    cloak the turpitude of his family, refuse or hesitate to employ also pretended
                    prodigies to facilitate the success of his enterprise? Mahommed did not arrogate
                    to himself the power of working miracles at pleasure, because such a part would
                    have been too difficult to sustain; but he supposed miracles wrought in his
                    favour, as he invented revelations, because his plan could only be realized by
                    the concurrence of both these means. He also affected, though rarely, a
                    knowledge of futurity; but he' often boasted of having received from heaven the
                    knowledge of ancient things, and, under this pretence, he employed a great part
                    of the facts of sacred history, and of the Jewish traditions which he had
                    collected in the conversations he held with both Jews and Christians.</p>
                <p>We cannot conclude this account of the life of Mahommed without some notice of
                    the Koran; that prodigy always subsisting, according to the Moslemins,—that
                    irresistible proof of the divinity of Islamism,—that book, in short, which,
                    according to them, displays a sublime and truly celestial eloquence, that no man
                    has ever been, or ever will be, able to reach. In support of this opinion, they
                    have related a multitude of conversions operated by some verses of the Koran
                    (amongst which that of Omar is the most celebrated), and the ecstacy of the poet
                    Lebid at the reading of the second chapter, the most fanciful of all. But it has
                    met with contradiction even in the bosom of Islamism itself; and it must be
                    confessed that none but a Moslemin could in good faith subscribe to this
                    pretended excellence of the Koran. That it contains some passages truly sublime
                    cannot be disputed; but these are of very rare occurrence, and in order to find
                    them it is necessary to wade through masses of dulness and absurdity. The
                    language of the Koran is said to be the purest Arabic; although, to say the
                    truth, neither we nor the Arabs themselves can now pretend to judge of the
                    matter, seeing that there remain but few monuments contemporary with the Koran;
                    and that all those who have written since the time of Mahommed have considered
                    the style of the Koran as the model which they ought to imitate. But as
                    Mahomnιed himself lays great stress on the elegance of the language in which the
                    Koran is written, it may be allowed to possess this merit. Elegance, however, is
                    not that which essentially constitutes eloquence; and, assuredly, if clearness
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200238" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0238-0032"/>be the first
                    merit in any composition, the Koran cannot pretend to a high degree of
                    estimation, since a multitude of passages are so obscure that they admit of
                    different and even contradictory interpretations. The slightest study of a
                    commentary on the Koran, that of Beidhawi for instance, will be sufficient to
                    establish the truth of what is here stated. Another cause of obscurity
                    recognised by the commentators themselves is, that the Koran contains a number
                    of expressions peculiar to the dialect of the Hedjaz, which, even at the period
                    when it was composed, were unintelligible to the Arabians of other countries,
                    and of which the true signification was early lost, or at least had become very
                    problematical. In fine, it is only necessary to open the Koran, in order to be
                    struck with the incoherence of the matters contained in a single chapter, the
                    tedious repetition of the same narratives, and the vagueness which predominates
                    in the legislative dispositions, not to mention contradictions and absurdities
                    almost without number. These defects, however, may, in part at least, be
                    ascribed to the manner in which the collection of the pretended revelations of
                    Mahommed was made under Abu Bekr, by Zaïd ben Thabet. Fanaticism rather than
                    good taste presided in this undertaking. Every thing was religiously collected;
                    fragments written on various substances, or preserved in the memory of those
                    persons who alleged that they had received them mediately or immediately from
                    the prophet; and when one and the same fragment was produced by several persons
                    with certain differences, Zaïd appears to have adopted all the variations, and
                    distributed them in different chapters. This is very clearly and strikingly
                    exemplified by the Baron de Sacy in his Life of Mahommed.</p>

                    whom Gibbon has characterized as half a Moslemin. “Mahomet” is also the title of
                    one of the dramatic productions of Voltaire; but in this “tragedy,” which
                    embraces the truce and capitulation of Mekka, the poet has disfigured the
                    history and character of the Arabian legislator. Sacrificing truth to scenic
                    effect, and perhaps also to the pleasure of declaiming against what he calls
                    fanaticism, he has represented his hero as a man of obscure origin, and a
                    monster of cruelty and injustice, in order to present the contrast of extreme
                    baseness with the most undeserved elevation. The poet’s theory is “que celui qui
                    fait la guerre à sa patrie au nom de Dieu est capable de tout.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mahommed,</hi> the name of several emperors of the Turks, of
                    whom the most celebrated was, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mahommed</hi> II. surnamed
                    the Great, their seventh sultan. He was born at Adrianople on the 24th of March
                    1430, and is chiefly remembered for having taken Constantinople in 1453, and
                    thereby driven many learned Greeks into the west, which was one great cause of
                    the restoration of learning in Europe, into which the Greek literature was then
                    introduced. He was one of the greatest men upon record, as far as regarded the
                    qualities necessary to a conqueror; for he conquered two empires, twelve
                    kingdoms, and two hundred considerable cities. He was ambitious of the title of
                    Great, which the Turks gave to him; and even the Christians have not disputed
                    it; for he was the first of the Ottoman emperors whom the western nations
                    dignified with the title of Grand Signier, or Great Turk, which posterity has
                    preserved to his descendants. Italy had suffered greater calamities, but she had
                    never felt terror equal to that which this sultan’s victories inspired. The
                    inhabitants seemed already condemned to wear the turban. It is certain that Pope
                    Sixtus IV. represented to himself Rome as about to be involved in the dreadful
                    fate of Constantinople, and thought of nothing but escaping into Provence, and
                    once more transferring the holy see to Avignon. Accordingly, the news of
                    Mahommed’s death, which happened on the 3d of May 1481, was received at Rome
                    with the greatest joy. Sixtus caused all the churches to be thrown open, made
                    the trades-people leave off their work, ordered a feast of three days, with
                    public prayers and processions, commanded a discharge of the whole artillery of
                    the castle of St Angelo, and put a stop to his journey to Avignon.</p>
                <p>He appears to have been the first sultan who was a lover of arts and sciences,
                    and who also cultivated polite letters. He often read the History of Augustus,
                    and the other Caesars; and he perused those of Alexander, Constantine, and
                    Theodosius, with more than ordinary pleasure, because these had reigned in the
                    same country with himself. He was fond of painting, music, and sculpture, and he
                    applied himself to the study of agriculture. He was much addicted to astrology;
                    and used to encourage his troops by giving out that the motion and influence of
                    the heavenly bodies promised him the empire of the world. Contrary to the genius
                    of his country, he delighted so much in the knowledge of foreign languages, that
                    he not only spoke the Arabian, to which the Turkish laws, and the religion of
                    their legislator Mahommed, are appropriated, but also the Persian, the Greek,
                    and the Lingua Franca, a species of corrupted Italian. Landin, a knight of
                    Rhodes, collected several letters which this snltan wrote in the Syriac, Greek,
                    and Turkish languages, and translated them into Latin. Where the originals are,
                    nobody knows; but the translation has been several times published, as at Lyons
                    1520, in 4to; at Basil, 1554, 12mo; in a collection published by Oporinus, at
                    Marpurg, 1604, in 8vo; and at Leipzig, 1600, in 12mo. Melchior Junius, professor
                    of eloquence at Strasburg, published at Montbéliard, 1595, a collection of
                    letters, in which there are three written by Mahommed II. to Scanderbeg. One
                    cannot discover the least symptom of Turkish ferocity in these letters. They are
                    written in as civil terms, and as obliging a manner, as the most polite prince
                    in Christendom could have employed.</p>
