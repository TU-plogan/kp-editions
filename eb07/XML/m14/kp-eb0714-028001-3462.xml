                <p><label type="entry">MASONRY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Free</hi></label>, denotes the
                    rule or system of mysteries and secrets peculiar to the society of free and
                    accepted masons.</p>
                <p>One of the first objects of man, in a rude state of being, is to screen himself
                    and his family from the heat of the tropical sun, from the inclemency of the
                    polar regions, or from the sudden changes of more temperate climates. If be has
                    arrived at such a degree of improvement as to live under the dominion of a
                    superior, and under the influence of religious belief, the palace of his king
                    and the temple of his gods will be reared in the most magnificent style which
                    his skill can devise and his industry accomplish, and will be decked with those
                    false ornaments which naturally catch the eye of unpolished men. From that
                    principle which impels the lower orders to imitate the magnificence and
                    splendour of their superiors, a foundation will be laid for improvement in the
                    art of building; and it is extremely probable, from those circumstances which
                    have been mentioned, as well as from others which the slightest reflection will
                    suggest, that building or architecture will be the first profession to which men
                    will exclusively devote their attention, and for which they will be trained by
                    an established course of preparatory education.</p>
                <p>But there is another consideration which entitles architecture to a decided
                    pre-eminence amongst the other arts. It is itself the parent of many separate
                    professions, and requires a combination of talents, and an extent of knowledge,
                    for which other professions have not the smallest occasion. An acquaintance with
                    the sciences of geometry and mechanical philosophy, with the arts of sculpture
                    and design, and ôther abstruse and elegant branches of knowledge, are
                    indispensable requisites in the education of a good architect, and raise his art
                    to a vast height above those professions which practice alone can render
                    familiar, and which consist in the mere exertion of muscular force. From these
                    considerations, it appears that there is some foundation in the very nature of
                    architecture for those extraordinary privileges to which masons have always laid
                    claim, and which they have almost always possessed; privileges which no other
                    artists could have confidence to ask or liberty to enjoy: and there appears also
                    to be some foundation for that ancient and respectable order of free masons,
                    whose history we are now to investigate.</p>
                <p>But, that we may be enabled to discover free masonry under those various forms
                    which it has assumed in different countries and at different times, before it
                    received the name which it now bears, it will be necessary to give a short
                    description of the nature of this institution, without developing those
                    mysteries, or revealing those ceremonial observances, which are only known to
                    the brethren of the order.</p>
                <p>Free masonry is an ancient and respectable institution, embracing individuals of
                    every nation, of every religion, and of every condition in life. In order to
                    confirm this institution, and attain the ends for which it was originally
                    formed, every candidate comes under a solemn engagement never to divulge the
                    mysteries of the order, nor communicate to the uninitiated the secrets with
                    which he may be intrusted, and the proceedings and plans in which the fraternity
                    may be engaged. After the candidate has undergone the necessary ceremonies, and
                    received the usual instructions, appropriate words and significant signs are
                    imparted to him, that he may be enabled to distinguish his brethren of the order
                    from the uninitiated vulgar, and convince others that he is entitled to the
                    privileges of a brother, should he be visited by distress or by want in a
                    distant land. If the newly-admitted member be found qualified for a higher
                    degree, he is promoted, after due intervals of probation, till he has received
                    that masonic knowledge which enables him to hold the highest offices of trust to
                    which the fraternity can raise its members. At regular and appointed seasons,
                    convivial meetings of the fraternity are held in lodges constructed for this
                    purpose; and temperance, harmony, and joy characterise these mixed assemblies.
                    All distinctions of rank seem to be laid aside, all differences in religious and
                    political sentiments are forgotten; and those petty quarrels which disturb the
                    quiet of private life cease to agitate the mind. Every one strives to give
                    happiness to his brother; and men seem to recollect, for once, that they are
                    sprung from the same origin, that they are possessed of the same nature, and are
                    destined for the same end.</p>
                <p>Such are the prominent features of an institution which has produced a great
                    division in the sentiments of the learned respecting its origin and tendency.
                    Whilst a certain class of men,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    to prove that free masonry arose during the crusades; that it was a secondary
                    order of chivalry; that its forms originated from that warlike institution, and
                    were adapted to the peaceful, orderly habits of scientific men.<note

                    to be a continuation of the society of knights templars; whilst others have
                    imputed its origin to secret associations, averse to the interests of true
                    government, and pursuing the chimerical project of levelling the distinctions of
                    society, and freeing the human mind from the obligations of religion and
                    morality. But without adopting any of these untenable opinions, or attempting to
                    discover the precise period when free masonry arose, it may be sufficient to <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> establish its claim to an early origin, and to show
                    that it has existed in different ages of the world under different forms and

                    observes, that if the order of free masons had existed amongst the ancients, it
                    would have been mentioned by contemporary writers. This argument, however, for
                    the recency of their origin, is far from being conclusive. For though it is
                    allowed by all that free masonry has existed in this country for at least 300
                    years, yet the association is never <hi rend="italic">once</hi> mentioned in any
                    of the histories of England.</p></note></p>

                <p>In Egypt, and in those countries of Asia which lie contiguous to that favoured
                    kingdom, the arts and sciences were cultivated with success, whilst other
                    nations were involved in ignorance. It is here, therefore, that free masonry
                    would flourish, and here only can we discover marks of its existence in the
                    remotest ages. It is extremely probable that the first and the only object of
                    the society of masons, was the mutual communication of knowledge connected with
                    their profession; and that those only would gain admittance into their order
                    whose labours were subsidiary to those of the architect. But when the ambition
                    or vanity of the Egyptian priests prompted them to erect huge and expensive
                    fabrics for celebrating the worship of their gods, or perpetuating the memory of
                    their kings, they would naturally desire to participate in that scientific
                    knowledge which was possessed by the architects they employed; and as, amongst a
                    superstitious people, the sacerdotal order seldom fail to gain the objects of
                    their ambition, they would, in this case, succeed in their attempts, and be
                    initiated into the mysteries, as well as instructed in the science, of free
                    masons. These remarks will not only assist us in discovering the source from
                    which the Egyptian priests derived that knowledge for which they have been so
                    highly celebrated; but they will also aid us in accounting for those changes
                    which were superinduced on the forms of free masonry, and for the admission of
                    men into the order whose professions had no connection with the royal art.</p>
                <p>When the Egyptian priests had in this manner procured admission into the society
                    of free masons, they connected the mythology of their country, and their
                    metaphysical speculations concerning the nature of God and the condition of man,
                    with an association formed for the exclusive purpose of scientific improvement,
                    and produced that combination of science and theology which, in after ages,
                    formed such <hi rend="italic">a</hi> conspicuous part of the principles of free
                    masonry. The knowledge of the Egyptians was carefully concealed from the vulgar;
                    and when the priests did condescend to communicate it to the learned men of
                    other nations, it was conferred in symbolsand hieroglyphics, accompanied with
                    particular rites and ceremonies, marking the value of the gift they bestowed.
                    What those ceremonies were which were performed at initiation into the Egyptian
                    mysteries, we are unable, at this distance of time, to determine. But as the
                    Eleusinian and other mysteries had their origin in Egypt, we may be able perhaps
                    to discover the qualities of the fountain, by examining the nature of the
                    stream.</p>
                <p>The immense population of Egypt, conjoined with other causes, occasioned frequent
                    emigrations from that enlightened country. In this manner it became the centre
                    of civilization, and introduced into the most distant and savage regions the
                    sublime mysteries of its religion, and those inventions and discoveries which
                    originated in the ingenuity of its inhabitants. The first colony <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the Egyptians which arrived in Greece was conducted by
                    Inachus, about 1970 years before the Christian era; and about three centuries
                    afterwards, he was followed by Cccrops, Cadmus, and Danaus.<note anchored="true"

                    astonishment the magical tricks of the Egyptians; and regarded as gods those
                    skilful adventurers, who communicated to them the arts and sciences of their
                    native land.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Herodotus,
                    lib. i. cap. 58.</p></note> In this manner were sown those seeds of improvement
                    which in future ages exalted Greece to such pre-eminenceamongst the nations.</p>
                <p>After the Egyptian colonies had obtained a secure settlement in their new
                    territories, and were freed from those uneasy apprehensions which generally
                    trouble the invaders of a foreign land, they instituted, after the manner of
                    their ancestors, particular festivals or mysteries, in honour of those who had
                    benefited their country either by arts or by arms. In the reign of Ericthonius
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 1500), the mysteries of the Egyptian Isis were
                    established at Eleusis, under the name of the Eleusinia. They were instituted in
                    honour of Ceres, who having come to Greece in quest of her daughter Proserpine,
                    resided with Triptolemus at Eleusis, and instructed him in the knowledge of
                    agriculture, and in the still more important knowledge of a future state.<note

                <p>About the same time the Panathenaea were instituted in honour of Minerva; and the
                    Dionysian mysteries in honour of Bacchus, who invented theatres,<note

                    Dionysian mysteries were intimately connected with the progress of the arts and
                    sciences, is manifest from the very end for which they were formed; and that
                    they were modelled upon the mysteries of Isis and Osiris, celebrated in Egypt,
                    is probable from the similarity of their origin, as well as from the consent of
                    ancient authors.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>En

                    reasoning concerning the origin of knowledge in Egypt, it will follow that the
                    Dionysia and the mysteries of Eleusis were, like the societies of free masons,
                    formed for scientific improvement, though no doubt tinctured with the doctrines
                    of the Egyptian mythology.</p>
                <p>But it is not from conjecture only that this conclusion may be drawn. The
                    striking similarity amongst the external forms of these secret associations, and
                    the still more striking similarity of the objects which they had in view, arc
                    strong proofs that they were only different streams issuing from a common
                    fountain. Those who were initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, were bound by
                    the most awful engagements to conceal the instructions they received, and the

                <p>It may, however, be objected here, that there were circumstances in the
                    celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries which have no counterpart in the
                    ceremonies of free masonry. The sacrifices, the purifications, the hymns, and
                    the dances, which were necessary in the festival of Ceres, have indeed no place
                    in the society of free masons. But these points of dissimilarity, instead of
                    weakening, rather strengthen our opinion. It cannot be expected that, in the
                    reign of Polytheism, just sentiments of the Deity should be entertained; and
                    much less that the adherents of Christianity should bend their knees to the gods
                    of the heathens. The ancients worshipped those beings who conferred on them
                    signal benefits, with sacrifices, purifications, and other tokens of their
                    humility and gratitude. But when revelation had disclosed to man more amiable
                    sentiments concerning the Divine Being, the society of free masons banished from
                    their mysteries those useless rites with which the ancient brethren of the order
                    attempted to appease and requite their deities; and they modelled their
                    ceremonies upon this foutidation, that there is but one God, who must be
                    worshipped in spirit and in truth.</p>
                <p>The mysteries of Ceres were not confined to the city of Eleusis; they were

                    contracted impurities, however, from the length of their duration, and the
                    corruption of their abettors; and though the forms of initiation were still
                    symbolical of the original and noble objects of the institution, yet the
                    licentious Romans mistook the shadow for the substance, and, whilst they
                    underwent the rites of the Eleusinian mysteries, they were strangers to the

                    stripped of their original purity and splendour. We are certain, at least, that
                    many rites of the Pagan religion were performed, under the dissembled name of
                    convivial meetings, long after the publication of the emperor’s edicts;<note

                    informs us, that the mysteries of Ceres subsisted in Athens till the eighth
                    century of the Christian era, and were never totally suppressed.</p>
                <p>We shall now endeavour to exhibit a rapid sketch of the progress of free masonry
                    after the abolition of the heathen rites in the reign of Theodosius; and, though
                    the friends and enemies of the order seem to coincide in opinion upon this later
                    part of its history, the materials are as scanty as before, and the incidents
                    equally unconnected. In those ages of ignorance and disorder which succeeded the
                    destruction of the Roman empire, the minds of men were too much debased by
                    superstition, and contracted by bigotry, to enter into associations for
                    promoting mental improvement and mutual benevolence. The spirit which then raged
                    was not a spirit of inquiry. The motives which then influenced the conduct of
                    men were not those benevolent and correct principles of action which once
                    distinguished their ancestors, and which still distinguish their posterity.
                    Sequestered habits and unsocial dispositions characterized the inhabitants of
                    Europe, in this season of mental degeneracy; whilst free masons, actuated by
                    very different principles, inculcate on their brethren the duties of social
                    intercourse, and communicate to all within the pale of their order the knowledge
                    which they possess and the happiness which they feel. But if science had existed
                    in these ages, and if a desire of social intercourse had animated the minds of
                    men, the latter must have languished for want of gratification, as long as the
                    former was imprisoned within the walls of a convent, by the tyranny of
                    superstition, or by the jealousy of power. Science was in those days synonymous
                    with heresy; and had any bold and enlightened man ventured upon philosophical
                    investigations, and published his discoveries of the world, he would have been
                    regarded by the vulgar as a magician, and punished as a heretic by the church of
                    Rome. These remarks may be exemplified and confirmed by an appropriate instance
                    of the interfering spirit of the church of Rome, even in the sixteenth century,
                    when learning had made considerable advancement in Europe. The celebrated
                    Baptista Porta having, like the sage of Samos, travelled into distant countries
                    for scientific information, returned to his native country, and established a
                    society which he denominated the Academy of Secrets. He communicated the
                    information which he had collected to the members of this association, who, in
                    their turn, imparted to their companions the knowledge which they had
                    individually obtained. But this little fraternity, advancing in respectability
                    and science, soon trembled under the rod of ecclesiastical oppression, and
                    experienced in its dissolution, that the Romish hierarchy was determined to
                    check the ardour of investigation, and retain the human mind in its former
                    fetters of ignorance and superstition. .How then could free masonry flourish,
                    when the minds of men had such an unfortunate propensity to monkish retirement,
                    and when every scientific and secret association was overawed and persecuted by
                    the rulers of Europe?</p>
                <p>But, though the political and intellectual condition of society was unfavourable
                    to the progress of free masonry, and though the secret associations of the
                    ancients were dissolved in the fifth century by the command of the Roman
                    emperor, yet there are many reasons for believing that the ancient mysteries
                    were observed in private long after their public abolition, by those enemies of
                    Christianity who were still attached to the religion of their fathers. Some
                    authors<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gibbon, 8vo,
                    vol. v p. 110. <hi rend="superscript"> H Ĵ</hi> ’</p></note> even inform us that
                    this was actually the case, and that the Grecian rites existed in the eighth
                    century, and were never completely abolished. These considerations enable us to
                    connect the heathen mysteries with that trading association of architects which
                    appeared <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203501" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3501-0283"
                    />during the middle ages, under the special authority of the see of Rome.</p>
                <p>The insatiable desire for external finery and gaudy ceremonies which was
                    displayed by the Roman Catholic priests in the exercise of their religion,
                    introduced a corresponding desire for splendid monasteries and magnificent
                    cathedrals. But as the demand for these buildings was urgent, and continually
                    increasing, it was with great difficulty that artificers could be procured, even
                    for the erection of such pious works. In order to encourage the profession of
                    architecture, the pontiffs of Rome, and the other potentates of Europe,
                    conferred on the fraternity of free masons the most important privileges, and
                    allowed them to be governed by laws, customs, and ceremonies, peculiar to
                    themselves. The association was composed of men of all nations, of Italian,
                    Greek, French, German, and Flemish artists, who were denominated free masons,
                    and who, ranging from one country to another, erected those elegant churches and
                    cathedrals which, though they once gratified the pride and sheltered the rites
                    of a corrupted priesthood, now excite the notice of antiquaries, and administer
                    to the grandeur of kingdoms. The government of this association was remarkably
                    regular. Its members lived in a camp of huts, reared beside the building in
                    which they were employed. A surveyor or master presided over and directed the
                    whole. Every tenth man was called a warden, and overlooked those who were under
                    his charge; and such artificers as were not members of this fraternity were
                    prohibited from engaging in those buildings which free masons alone had a title
                    to rear.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wren’s <hi

                    21.</p></note> It may seem strange, and perhaps inconsistent with what we have
                    already said, that the fraternity of free masons should have been sanctioned,
                    and even protected, by the bishops of Rome. Secret associations, indeed, are
                    always a terror to temporal and to spiritual tyranny. But the church of Rome,
                    instead of approving of the principles of free masonry, by the encouragement and
                    patronage which they gave to architects, only employed them as instruments for
                    gratifying their vanity and satiating their ambition. For in after ages, when
                    masons were much more numerous, and when the demand for religious structures was
                    less urgent, than before, the pontiffs of Rome deprived the fraternity of those
                    very privileges which had been conferred upon them without solicitation, and
                    persecuted, with unrelenting rage, the very men whom they had voluntarily taken
                    into favour, and who had contributed to the grandeur of their ecclesiastical
                    establishment</p>
                <p>Wherever the Roman Catholic religion was taught, the meetings of free masons were
                    sanctioned and patronized. The principles of the order were even imported into
                    Scotland,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A. B. 1140.

                    simplicity, long after they had been extinguished in the continental kingdoms.
                    In this manner, Scotland became the centre from which these principles again
                    issued, to illuminate, not only all the nations of the continent, but every
                    civilized portion of the habitable world. What those causes were which continued
                    the societies of free masons longer in Britain than in other countries, it may
                    not, perhaps, be easy to determine; but as the fact itself is unquestionable, it
                    must have arisen, either from some favourable circumstances in the political
                    state of Britain, which did not exist in the other governments of Europe, or
                    from the superior policy by which the British masons eluded the suspicion of
                    their enemies, and the superior prudence with which they maintained the
                    primitive simplicity and respectability of their order. The former of these
                    causes had, without doubt, a considerable share in producing the effect under
                    consideration; and we know for certain that, in our own days, the latter has
                    preserved free masonry in a flourishing condition throughout these united
                    kingdoms, whilst, in other countries, the imprudence and foolish innovations of
                    its members have exposed it to the most severe and just censure, and, in many
                    cases, to the most violent persecutions. It is a fact requiring no confirmation,
                    and resulting from the most obvious causes, that free masonry never flourishes
                    in seasons of public commotion; and even in Great Britain, though the seat of
                    war is commonly in foreign countries, it has universally declined. But in those
                    lands which are the theatre of hostilities, it will be neglected in a still
                    greater degree; and, if these hostilities are long continued, or frequently
                    recur, the very name and principles of the order must soon be extinguished.
                    Amidst those continual wars, therefore, which, during the middle ages,
                    distracted and desolated the continent of Europe, the association of architects
                    would soon be dissolved; whilst in the humble village of Kilwinning, on the
                    western coast of Scotland, they found a safe retreat from the violent
                    convulsions of continental wars.</p>
                <p>That free masonry was first introduced into Scotland by those architects who
                    built the abbey of Kilwinning, is manifest, not only from authentic documents,
                    by means of which the existence of the Kilwinning lodge has been traced back as
                    far as the end of the fifteenth century, but by other collateral arguments,
                    which amount almost to a demonstration. In every country where the temporal and
                    spiritual jurisdiction of the pope was acknowledged, there was a continual
                    demand, particularly during the twelfth century, for religious structures, and
                    consequently for operative masons, proportional to the piety of the inhabitants,
                    and the opulence of their ecclesiastical establishment; and there existed no
                    kingdom in Europe where the zeal of the inhabitants for popery was more ardent
                    than in Scotland, where the kings and nobles were more liberal to the clergy,
                    and where, of consequence, the church was more richly endowed.<note

                    for elegant cathedrals and ingenious artists must have been proportionally
                    greater than in other countries, and that demand could be supplied only from the
                    trading association on the continent. When we consider, in addition to these
                    facts, that this association monopolized the building of religious structures in
                    Christendom, we are authorized to conclude, that those numerous and elegant
                    ruins which still adorn various parts of Scotland were erected by foreign
                    masons, who introduced into this island the customs of their order.</p>
                <p>It was probably about this time, also, that free masonry was introduced into
                    England; but whether the English received it from the Scottish masons at
                    Kilwinning, or from other brethren who had arrived from the continent, there are
                    now no means of determining. The masonic fraternity in England, however,
                    maintain, that St Alban, the protomartyr, who flourished about the end of the
                    third century, was the first who brought masonry to Britain; that the brethren
                    received a charter from King Athelstane, and that his brother Edwin summoned to
                    meet at York all the lodges which formed the first grand lodge of England.<note

                    support of these opinions, indeed, it is alleged that no other lodge has laid
                    claim to greater antiquity than that of York, and that its jurisdiction over the
                    other lodges in England has been invariably acknowledged by the whole
                    fraternity. But this argument only proves that York was the birth-place of free
                    masonry in England. It brings no additional evidence in support of the
                    improbable stories about St Alban, Athelstane, and Edwin; and if the antiquity
                    of free masonry in Britain can be defended only by the forgery of silly and
                    uninteresting stories, it does not deserve to be defended at all. Those who
                    invent and propagate such tales, do not, surely, consider that they bring
                    discredit upon their order by the warmth of their zeal; and that, by supporting
                    what is false, they prevent thinking men from believing what is true.</p>
                <p>After the establishment of the Kilwinning and the York lodges, the principles of
                    free masonry were rapidly diffused throughout both kingdoms, and several lodges
                    were erected in different parts of the island. As all these derived their
                    existence and authority from the two mother lodges, they were likewise under
                    their jurisdiction and control; and when any differences arose that were
                    connected with the art of building, they were referred to the general meetings
                    of the fraternity, which were always held at Kilwinning and at York. In this
                    manner did free masonry flourish for a while in Britain, after it was completely
                    abolished in every other part of the world. But even here it was doomed to
                    suffer a long and serious decline, and to experience those successive
                    alternations of advancement and decay which mark the history of every human
                    institution. And although, during several centuries after the importation of
                    free masonry into Britain, the brethren of the order held their public
                    assemblies, and were sometimes prohibited from meeting by the interference of
                    the legislature, it can scarcely be said to have attracted general attention
                    till the beginning of the seventeenth century. The causes of this remarkable
                    retardation which the progress of masonry experienced, it is by no means
                    difficult to discover. In consequence of the important privileges which the
                    order received from the church of Rome, many persons chose the profession of
                    architect, which, though at all times an honourable employment, was in
                    particularly high request during the middle ages. On this account, the body of
                    operative masons increased to such a degree, and the rage as well as the
                    necessity for religious edifices was so much diminished, that a more than
                    sufficient number of hands could at any time be procured for supplying the
                    demands of the church and those of pious individuals. There being now no
                    scarcity of architects, the very reason which prompted the church to protect the
                    fraternity ceased to exist; they, therefore, withdrewfrom them that patronage
                    which they had spontaneously proffered, and denied them even the liberty of
                    holding their secret assemblies. But these were not the only causes which
                    produced such a striking change in the conduct of the church towards the masonic
                    order. As we have already stated, the spirit of free masonry was hostile to the
                    principles of the church of Rome. The intention of the one was to enlighten the
                    mind; the object and policy of the other were to retain it in ignorance. When
                    free masonry flourished, the power of the church must have decayed. The jealousy
                    of the latter was therefore aroused; and, as the civil power in England and
                    Scotland was almost always in the hands of ecclesiastics, the church and the
                    state were combined against the principles and the practice of free
                    masonry.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As a proof of
                    the hostility of the church of Rome to secret associations which pretended to
                    enlighten the mind, we may mention its treatment of the Academy of Secrets,
                    instituted in the sixteenth century for the advancement of physical science.
                    When a local and temporary institution drew down the vengeance of the Roman see,
                    what must have been its conduct to a lodge of masons? A further account of the
                    Academy of Secrets may be found in Priestley’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Vision,</hi> vol. ii.</p></note> But besides the causes here specified, the
                    domestic and bloody wars which convulsed the two kingdoms from the thirteenth to
                    the seventeenth century conspired, in a great degree, to produce that decline of
                    the fraternity for which we have been attempting to account.</p>
                <p>Yet notwithstanding these unfavourable circumstances, free masonry seems to have
                    flourished, and attracted the attention of the public in the reign of Henry VI.
                    who, when a minor, ascended the throne of England in 1422. In the third year of
                    his reign, indeed, the parliament passed a severe act against the fraternity, at
                    the instigation of Henry Beaufort, bishop of Winchester, who was then intrusted
                    with the education of the young king. They enacted that the masons should no
                    longer hold their chapters and annual assemblies; that those who summoned such
                    chapters and assemblies should be considered as felons; and that those who
                    resorted to them should be subjected to fine and imprisonment.<note

                    never put in execution; for, in the year 1429, about five years after it was
                    framed, a most respectable lodge was held at Canterbury under the patronage of
                    the archbishop himself.## <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> When King Henry was
                    able to take into his own hands the government of his kingdom, and to form an

                    in order to atone for the rigorous conduct of his parliament, he not only
                    permitted the order to hold their meetings without molestation, but even
                    honoured the lodges by his presence as a brother. Before he was initiated,
                    however, into the mysteries of the order, he seems to have examined, with
                    scrupulous care, the nature of the institution, and to have perused the charges
                    and regulations of the fraternity, which had been collected from their ancient
                    records.</p>
                <p>Whilst free masonry was flourishing in England under the auspices of Henry VI.,
                    it was at the same time patronised, in the sister kingdom, by King James I. By
                    the authority of this monarch, every grand master who was chosen by the
                    brethren, either from the nobility or clergy, and approved of by the crown, was
                    entitled to an annual revenue of four pounds Scots from each master mason, and
                    likewise to a fee at the initiation of every new member. He was empowered to
                    adjust any differences which might arise amongst the brethren, and to regulate
                    those affairs connected with the fraternity which it was improper to bring under
                    the cognizance of the courts of law. The grand master also appointed deputies or
                    wardens, who resided in the chief towns of Scotland, and managed the concerns of
                    the order when it was inconvenient to appeal to the grand master himself.<note

                <p>In the reign of James II. free masonry was by no means neglected. The office of
                    grand master was granted by the crown to William St Clair, earl of Orkney and
                    Caithness, baron of Roslin, and founder of the much-admired chapel of Roslin. On
                    account of the attention which this nobleman paid to the interests of the order,
                    and the rapid propagation of the royal art under his administration, King James
                    II. made the office of grand master hereditary to his heirs and successors in
                    the barony of Roslin; in which family it continued till the institution of the

                    of hereditary grand masters, held their principal annual meetings at Kilwinning,
                    the birth-place of Scottish masonry, whilst the lodge of that village granted
                    constitutions and charters of erection to those brethren of the order who were
                    anxious that regular lodges should be instituted in different parts of the
                    kingdom. These lodges all held of the lodge of Kilwinning; and, in token of
                    their respect and submission, they joined to their own name that of their mother
                    lodge, from which they derived their existence as a corporation.<note

                <p>During the reigns of the succeeding Scottish monarchs, free masonry still
                    flourished, though very little information can be procured respecting the state
                    of the fraternity. In the records of the privy seal, however, there exists a
                    letter dated at Holyroodhouse, the 25th September 1590, and granted by King

                    that these provincial masters, or wardens as they were then called, administered

                    lodges had been established in all parts of Scotland, even in those remote, and,
                    at that time, uncivilized counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Kincardine ;—and it
                    completely overturns the unfounded assertion of Dr Robison, who maintains<note

                    who was initiated in the year 1646, is the only distinct and unequivocal
                    instance of a person being admitted into the fraternity who was not an architect
                    by profession.</p>
                <p>The records of St Mary’s chapel, which is the oldest lodge in Edinburgh, extend
                    as far back as the year 1598; but as they contain only the ordinary proceedings
                    of the lodge, we can derive from them no particular information respecting the
                    customs and conditions of the fraternity. It appears, however, from these
                    minutes, that Mr Thomas Boswell of Auchinleck was made a warden of the lodge in
                    the year 1600; and that the Honourable Robert Moray, quartermaster-general to
                    the army in Scotland, was created a master mason in 1641. These facts are
                    deserving of notice, as they show, in opposition to Dr Robison, that persons
                    were early admitted into the order who were not architects by profession.</p>
                <p>When James VI. ascended the throne of England, he seems to have neglected his
                    right of nominating the officebearers of the craft. In Hay’s manuscript in the
                    Advocates’ Library, there are two charters granted by the Scottish masons,
                    appointing the St Clairs of Roslin their hereditary grand masters. The former of
                    these is without a date, but is signed by several masons who appoint William St
                    Clair of Roslin, his heirs and successors, their “patrons and judges.” The
                    latter is in some measure a ratification of the former, and dated 1630, in which
                    they appoint Sir William St Clair of Roslin, his heirs and successors, to be
                    their “patrons, protectors, and overseers, in all time coming.” In the first of
                    these deeds, which seems to have been written a little after the union of the
                    crowns, it is stated, that for some years the want of a protector had engendered
                    many corruptions amongst the masons, and had considerably retarded the progress
                    of the craft; and that the appointment of William St Clair was by the advice and
                    consent of William Shaw, master of work to his majesty. After presiding over the
                    order for many years, William St Clair went to Ireland, where he continued a
                    considerable time; and, in consequence of his departure, the second charter was
                    granted to his son Sir William St Clair, investing him with the same powers
                    which his father enjoyed. It deserves also to be remarked, that in both these
                    deeds, the appointment of William Sinclair, earl of Orkney and Caithness, to the
                    office of grand master, by James II. of Scotland, is spoken of as a fact well
                    known and universally admitted. These observations will set in a clear point of
                    view what must hitherto have appeared a great inconsistency in the history of
                    Scottish masonry. In the deed by which William St Clair of Roslin resigned the
                    office of hereditary grand master in 1736, it is stated that his ancestors
                    William and Sir William St Clair of Roslin had been constituted patrons of the
                    fraternity by the Scottish masons themselves; whilst it is well known that the
                    grant of hereditary grand master was originally made by James II. of Scotland,
                    to their ancestor, William Sinclair, earl of Orkney and Caithness. But when we
                    consider that James VI. by not exercising his power, virtually transferred to
                    the craft the right of electing their own office-bearers, the inconsistency
                    vanishes; for Sinclair and his predecessors, as far back as the date of these
                    charters, held their office by the appointment of the fraternity itself. Lest
                    any of Sinclair’s posterity, however, might, after his resignation, lay claim to
                    the office of grand master, upon the pretence that this office had been
                    bequeathed to them by the grant of James II. to the Earl of Caithness and his
                    heirs, he renounced not only the right to the office which he derived from the
                    brethren, but any right also which, as a descendant of the Earl of Caithness, he
                    might claim from the grants of the Scottish monarchs.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding those civil commotions which disturbed Britain in the seventeenth
                    century, free masonry flourished in Scotland under the auspices of the St Clairs
                    of Roslin. No particular event worthy of notice, however, occurred during that
                    time, or even during the remainder of the century. The annual assemblies of the
                    fraternity were still held at Kilwinning, and many charters and constitutions
                    were granted by the lodge of that village, for the erection of other lodges in
                    different parts of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>In the year 1736, William St Clair of Roslin, who was then grand master of
                    Scotland, was under the necessity of disposing of his estate, and, as he had no
                    children of his own, he was anxious that the office of grand master should not
                    become vacant at his death. Having, therefore, assembled the Edinburgh and
                    neighbouring lodges, he represented to them the utility which would result to
                    the order from having a gentleman or nobleman of their own choice as grand
                    master of masonry in Scotland; and, at the same time, he intimated his intention
                    to resign into the hands of the brethren every title to that office which he
                    then possessed, or which his successors might claim from the grants of the
                    Scottish kings and the kindness of the fraternity. In consequence of this
                    representation, circular letters were despatched to all the lodges of Scotland,
                    inviting them to appear, eitherby themselves or their proxies, on next St
                    Andrew’s day, to concur and assist in the election of a grand master. When that
                    day arrived, about thirty-two lodges assembled, and, after receiving the deed of
                    resignation from William St Clair, proceeded to the election of another grand
                    master; when, on account of the zeal which W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    illiam St Clair of Roslin had always shown for the honour and prosperity of the
                    order, he was unanimously elected to that high office, and proclaimed grand
                    master mason of all Scotland. And thus was instituted the grand lodge of
                    Scotland, an event memorable in the annals of free masonry, but beyond which it
                    would be unprofitable and uninteresting to continue the history of the
                    institution.</p>
