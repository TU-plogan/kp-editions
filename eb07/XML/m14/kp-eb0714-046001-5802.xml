                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MECHANICS’ INSTITUTIONS</label> have for their object the
                    instruction of the working classes in those branches of science and art, which
                    are of practical application in the exercise of their several occupations.</p>
                <p>It has been a subject of very considerable controversy to whom the honour of
                    having originated those institutions ought to be attributed. Some have contended
                    that to Professor Anderson, the founder of the institution in Glasgow, which
                    bears his name, it is alone due; because in addition to the clauses in his will,
                    which especially provide for the formation of a class of <hi rend="italic"
                    >manufacturers</hi> and <hi rend="italic">artificers,</hi> he had for a period
                    of thirty years, whilst professor of natural philosophy in the university of
                    that city, opened a class to which manufacturers and others had access, for the
                    purpose of becoming acquainted with the fundamental principles of experimental
                    physics. Others, again, have affirmed that although Professor Anderson had such
                    an intention in view when he framed his will, it was only through the exertions
                    of Dr. Birckbeck, the second professor of the Andersonian Institution, that the
                    project was carried into complete and practical effect. Without going into the
                    merits of this question, however, it appears to us that to Professor Anderson is
                    certainly due the merit of having originated the <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> of
                    instructing that previously neglected but valuable portion of the community. But
                    whilst we give all the weight to which that admission is entitled, we are of
                    opinion that in as far as regards the usefulness of the idea when carried into
                    effect, the merit is due to Dr. Birckbeck. Professor Anderson<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Professor John Anderson was
                    the eldest son of the Rev. James Anderson, minister of the parish of Roseneatħ,
                    in Dumbartonshire, and was born there in 1726.</p></note> was in the frequent
                    habit of visiting and spending several hours in the workshops of the mechanics
                    of Glasgow, and freely entering into conversation with them; amongst others he
                    was often found at the workshop of our illustrious countryman James Watt, then a
                    watchmaker in Glasgow; and it was in consequence of the avidity with which the
                    workmen, availed themselves of the theoretical information which on these visits
                    he was in the constant practice of imparting, that he first conceived the idea
                    of bringing within their reach those principles of science, the attainment of
                    which had hitherto been confined to the higher and wealthier classes.</p>
                <p>He then commenced within the walls of the university a course of lectures on
                    natural philosophy, for the especial benefit of that class of society, and
                    divided the course into two branches; one meeting four times a-week, in which
                    the mathematical principles of the science were considered apart from
                    experimental illustration; and the other, which met twice a-week, consisting
                    entirely of those branches which admitted of such illustration, and in which the
                    principles of mathematics were less called into operation. This latter class was
                    regularly and numerously attended by a great many manufacturers and others
                    engaged in operative occupations, and was continued for several years with great
                    success; and he called it his <hi rend="italic">antitoga</hi> class, in
                    contradistinction to his regular academic attendance, which was denominated the
                    <hi rend="italic">toga</hi> class. It was in consequence of the decided
                    improvement in the arts and manufactures of Glasgow, which from that time became
                    very evident, and which Professor Anderson justly attributed to his
                    instructions, that he conceived the truly philanthropic intention of bequeathing
                    his ample fortune for “the good of mankind and the improvement of science.” In
                    the provisions of his will there was an especial reference to the formation of
                    classes upon the principle of that which he had himself so successfully taught
                    within the walls of the university.</p>
                <p>Professor Anderson died on the 16th of January 1796; and at a meeting of his
                    executors, held on the 23d of March following, it was resolved to carry his
                    intentions into immediate effect. Accordingly on the 21st of September of the
                    same year, Dr. Thomas Garnett was elected first professor of natural
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>The lectures however were at first only popular. Dr. Garnett, in 1800, was
                    appointed to the chair of natural philosophy in the Royal Institution of Great
                    Britain, founded at the suggestion of Count Rumford and Sir Joseph Banks; and
                    Dr. George Birckbeck was elected in his stead. It was then, <hi rend="italic"
                    >upon the suggestion of Or. Birckbeck,</hi> that the trustees were enabled to
                    give full effect to Professor Anderson’s favourite idea, as expressed in his
                    will, of affording instruction in experimental philosophy to the artizans of
                    Glasgow. Such was the origin of the first mechanics’ class, which has now been
                    taught for upwards of thirty-six years with increasing success and advantage to
                    this interesting class of students.</p>
                <p>But important as was this era in the history of the class which was thus
                    instituted, it was not until upwards of twenty years afterwards that the example
                    was followed by any other city in the kingdom. At length, however, in 1821, the
                    School of Arts for the instruction of mechanics was formed in Edinburgh; and
                    within a year or two afterwards, the example was followed, and another
                    institution of the same nature was originated in Glasgow, in consequence of some
                    differences which had arisen between Dr. Ure, (Dr. Birckbeck’s successor in the
                    Andersonian Institution), and the students who attended his operative class. A
                    great many of these left the Andersonian and founded the Mechanics’ Institution,
                    of which Dr. Birckbeck, at their solicitation, consented to become the patron.
                    About the same time the London Mechanics’ Institution was instituted, and within
                    a very few years after this period there was hardly a city of any note in the
                    kingdom which had not institutions of a kindred description.</p>
                <p>As might have been expected, there exists a variety of opinions both as to the
                    precise kind of instruction which these institutions ought to afford in order to
                    carry their objects into the most complete effect, and also in regard to the
                    manner in which they ought to be governed. Some conceive that the course of
                    instruction ought to be of a popular nature, admitting amongst the lectures upon
                    the graver and more abstruse sciences, prelections of a lighter and more
                    attractive kind; whilst others are of opinion that the course ought to be
                    strictly confined to those branches of physical science alone which are of
                    practical application in the arts or manufactures. The management of several,
                    indeed of the greater number, is entirely in the hands of the mechanics
                    themselves; some have an admixture of these with the upper classes of society,
                    whilst in others of a third description, the government is entirely vested in
                    the latter, or wealthier classes.</p>
                <p>Favourable as we are to the universal diffusion of knowledge amongst the great
                    mass of the people, we conceive, that the paramount object which these
                    institutions have in view, namely, the advancement of the arts and manufactures,
                    will be most decidedly and advantageously promoted, by confining the attention
                    of the student to those branches of the physical sciences which bear more
                    especially on the great majority of the useful arts. We have seen and examined
                    carefully the plans of study as followed by most of the leading institutions of
                    this kind throughout the kingdom; but, whilst we generally approve of them all,
                    we shall confine ourselves to a more extended outline of the course followed by
                    the Edinburgh School of Arts, as being that which seems to us most likely to
                    promote the great objects they all have in view. It being self-evident that the
                    elements of mathematics, mechanical philosophy, and chemistry, are of the most
                    general application to the useful arts, it has been the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194205815" xml:id="kp-eb0714-5815-0461"/>principal aim of the
                    directors of that institution to urge the necessity of acquiring a knowledge of
                    these upon the notice of the student by every possible means; and especially
                    that they should thoroughly understand the fundamental principles of
                    mathematics, both from the intimate connexion these have with all the physical
                    sciences, and as supplying a course of mental discipline, highly favourable to
                    the successful prosecution, at any after period of life, of those studies the
                    principles of which are more immediately involved in the ordinary occupations of
                    life, and by the application of (which alone any decided improvements in the
                    arts may reasonably be looked for. And in order to encourage the student to
                    adhere steadily to a certain course of study, an honorary certificate or diploma
                    was instituted, conferring on the successful candidate the privilege of availing
                    himself gratuitously, during his life, of all advantages of the institution.
                    That course of study is as follows :—</p>
                <p>I. A junior class of mathematics meeting twice a-week, in which the following
                    branches are taught: Arithmetic, including vulgar and decimal fractions;
                    Algebra, as far as simple and quadratic equations; Geometry, first and second
                    books of Euclid. In this class, a portion of each hour of teaching is devoted to
                    exercises and examinations.</p>
                <p>II. A senior class of mathematics meeting once a-week, in which the following
                    branches are taught: Geometry, the remaining books of Euclid; Logarithms;
                    Mensuration and Trigonometry, with their various practical applications. In this
                    class, also, a portion of each hour of teaching is devoted to exercises and
                    examinations.</p>
                <p>III. A class of Natural Philosophy, illustrated by experiments, meeting once
                    a-week, in which the following branches are taught: Mechanics, including statics
                    and dynamics; Hydrostatics, Hydraulics, Pneumatics, and Optics, with such
                    additional matter as time may permit of. A part of every fourth lecture of this
                    course is devoted to examinations on the subjects treated of in the three
                    preceding lectures.</p>
                <p>IV. A class of Theoretical Chemistry, in which the principles of the science are
                    taught, together with their application to the principal arts and manufactures
                    in the processes of which chemical principles are involved. This class meets
                    oncea-week; and apart of every fourth lecture of this course is devoted to
                    examinations upon the subjects of the three preceding lectures.</p>
                <p>V. It is of course left optional to the students to attend as many of the classes
                    in one session as they please, and also to attend them separately in whatever
                    order they prefer. But the directors, impressed with the benefits which may
                    arise from such a course of study, earnestly recommend those who desire fully to
                    avail themselves of the benefits of the institution, to pursue their studies on
                    the following plan, viz. During the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> year, to attend
                    the junior mathematical class alone; during the <hi rend="italic">secorid</hi>
                    year, to attend the senior mathematical and the chemistry classes; and during
                    the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> year, to attend the natural philosophy and the
                    chemistry classes.</p>
                <p>It was therefore with the view of encouraging students to pursue this regular and
                    systematic plan of education, that the directors instituted the honorary
                    certificate above mentioned.</p>
                <p>This course of study has for the last four years been most steadily persevered
                    in, and the acquirements of the students who obtained the certificates after the
                    most searching examinations, have completely satisfied the directors and other
                    competent judges who were present on these occasions, that the great object of
                    the institution had, in their case at least, been attained, and that the
                    information acquired by them was sound and practical.</p>
                <p>Within the last year an addition to the course of study afforded by this
                    institution has been made, and it promises to have the most beneficial effect on
                    the advancement of those branches of art, in which the principles of <hi
                    rend="italic">Design</hi> are in any way involved, viz. a class for Ornamental
                    Modelling. It is by no means intended in this class to open a nursery for
                    artists, but only to teach those engaged in trades where ornament is in the
                    least concerned, such as silver-chasers, jewellers, plasterers, glass-cutters,
                    brassfounders, smiths, die-sinkers, and a variety of others, to form their ideas
                    of design on the most approved models of ancient and modem excellence; to enable
                    them, instead of servilely imitating existing patterns, with a vague uncertainty
                    and want of acquaintance with the laws which regulate art, to classify their
                    labours, and, by accustoming their minds to contemplate and imitate acknowledged
                    excellence, gradually to lead the way to that <hi rend="italic">creative
                    skill</hi> in the execution of designs, which may eventually lead to the
                    commencement of a new era in such departments ofart.</p>
                <p>The fee for each of the four classes above mentioned separately, the junior
                    mathematics, the senior mathematics, the natural philosophy, and the chemistry,
                    is five shillings. A ticket which gives admission to all the lectures, twelve
                    shillings. The privileges of the library is extended to all students, whether
                    attending one or more classes.</p>
                <p>When these institutions were first originated, a great many excellent persons
                    were led to withhold from them their countenance and support, fearing that the
                    moral effect which they might have on the minds of the working classes would be
                    unfavourable to the reception of those great and fundamental principles of
                    religion, without which all human acquirements sink into insignificance; and
                    that they would only fit their pupils .more thoroughly for becoming the dupes
                    and tools of designing men. Our opinion, however, of their effects upon society
                    at large, is very different indeed; for by invigorating the faculties and
                    enlarging the information of the student, this training serves the double
                    purpose of enabling them to understand the evidences and truths of religion more
                    easily and more thoroughly than they could otherwise have done, and of
                    fortifying them more strongly against those sophistries by which its enemies so
                    often and so fatally perplex the ignorant and the simple. It is true that
                    knowledge is not always accompanied with such results; but its natural tendency
                    is to counteract and prevent the very evils which have been apprehended as
                    likely to result from it. Proceeding on the supposition that the young men who
                    attend these institutions have previously, under the parental roof and at the
                    schools where they obtained their elementary education, been taught the
                    principles of religion, the mental discipline which they receive therein, and
                    the course of study they are encouraged to pursue, furnish them with the means
                    of cherishing a more enlightened, vigorous, and steady attachment to those great
                    doctrines, which constitute the perfection and the glory of all science; and as
                    industry is one of the best safeguards of moral conduct, they will operate most
                    beneficially in that respect on those whose chief danger arises from the
                    temptations which beset them at their leisure hours. Being necessarily so much
                    occupied with objects of sense, and so little accustomed to purely mental
                    exercises, when they seek for enjoyment, they are apt to look for it in the
                    indulgence of mere appetite. Now these institutions are calculated to rescue
                    them from the power of such temptations, not only by filling up their spare time
                    with innocent and laudable pursuits, and providing them with occupations which
                    elevate them far above the grossness of sensuality, but by training them up to
                    habits of purity, sobriety, and correct deportment.</p>
                <p>It is pleasing, therefore, to be enabled to say that the progress and advancement
                    of the arts since the commencement of these institutions, has been most
                    striking. They have attained an elevation, and partaken of a character which was
                    formerly unknown; and since that period we may date the discovery and
                    improvement of several of the most widely useful inventions, and the consequent
                    dissemination of those comforts and elegancies of life, which have had such an
                    influence on the whole social system.</p>
