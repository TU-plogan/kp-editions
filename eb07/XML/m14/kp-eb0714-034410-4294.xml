                <p><label type="entry">MEASURE</label>, in a legal and commercial sense, denotes a
                    certain quantity or proportion of any thing bought, sold, valued, or the like.
                    See <hi rend="smallcaps">Weights and Measures.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Measure</hi> is also used to signify the cadence and time observed in poetry,
                    dancing, and music, in order to render them regular and agreeable.</p>
                <p>The different measures or metres in poetry, are the different manners of ordering
                    and combining the quantities, or the long and short syllables. Thus, hexameter,
                    pentameter, iambic, sapphic, and other verses, consist of different
                    measures.</p>
                <p>In English verses, the measures are extremely various and arbitrary, every poet
                    being at liberty to introduce any new form that he pleases. The most usual are
                    the heroic, generally consisting of five long and five short syllables; verses
                    of four feet; and verses of three feet and a caesura, or single syllable.</p>
                <p>The ancients, by variously combining and transposing their quantities, made a
                    vast variety of different measures. Of words, or rather feet of two syllables,
                    they formed a spondee, consisting of two long syllables; a pyrrhic, of two short
                    syllables; a trochee, of a long and a short syllable; and an iambic, of a short
                    and a long syllable.</p>
                <p>Of their feet of three syllables they formed a molossus, consisting of three long
                    syllables; a tribrachys, of three short syllables; a dactyl, of one long and two
                    short syllables; and an anapaest, of two short and one long syllable. The Greek
                    poets contrived one hundred and twenty-four different combinations or measures;
                    under as many different names, from feet of two syllables to those of six.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Measure</hi><hi rend="italic">of an angle,</hi> is an arch
                    described from the vertex in any place between its legs. Hence angles are
                    distinguished by the ratio of the arches, described from the vertex between the
                    legs to the peripheries. Angles, then, are distinguished by those arches; and
                    the arches are distinguished<pb break="no" facs="nls:194204307"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-4307-0345"/> by their ratio to the periphery. Thus an angle is
                    said to be as many degrees as there are in the said arch.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Measure</hi><hi rend="italic">of a solid,</hi> is a cube,
                    the side of which is an inch, a foot, or a yard, or any other determinate
                    length. In geometry it is a cubic perch, divided into cubic feet, digits,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Measure</hi><hi rend="italic">of velocity,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mechanics,</hi> is the space which is passed over by a moving body
                    in a given time. To measure a velocity, therefore, the space must be divided
                    into as many equal parts as the time is conceived to be divided into; and the
                    quantity of space answering to such a part of time is the measure of the
                    velocity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Measure,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Geometry,</hi> denotes
                    any quantity assumed as one, or unity, to which the ratio of the other
                    homogeneous or similar quantities is expressed, numerically or otherwise.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Measure,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Music,</hi> the interval
                    or space of time which the person who beats time takes between the rising and
                    falling of his hand or foot, in order to conduct the movement, sometimes
                    quicker, and sometimes slower, according to the kind of music, or the subject
                    which is sung or played. The measure is that which regulates the time we are to
                    dwell on each note.</p>
                <p>The ordinary or common measure is one second, or the sixtieth part of a minute,
                    which is nearly the space between the beats of the pulse or heart; the systole,
                    or contraction of the heart, answering to the elevation of the hand; and its
                    diastole, or dilatation, to the letting it fall. The measure usually takes up
                    the space which a pendulum of two feet and a half long employs in making a swing
                    or vibration. The measure is regulated according to the different quality or
                    value of the notes in the piece, by which the time that each note is to occupy
                    is expressed. The semibreve, for instance, holds one rise and one fall; and this
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> or <hi rend="italic">whole
                    measure,</hi> sometimes the <hi rend="italic">measure note</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">time note;</hi> the minim, one rise, or one fall; and the
                    crotchet, half a rise, or half a fall, there being four crotchets in a full
                    measure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Measure</hi><hi rend="italic">Einary,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Double,</hi> is that in which the rise and fall of the hand are
                    equal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Measure</hi><hi rend="italic">Ternary,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Triple,</hi> is that in which the fall is double of the rise; or
                    where two minims are played during a fall, and but one in the rise. To this
                    purpose, the number 3 is placed at the beginning of the lines, when the measure
                    is intended to be triple; and a C, when the measure is to be common or
                    double.</p>
