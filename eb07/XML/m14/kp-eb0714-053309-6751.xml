                    criticism, and hence cannot lay claim to any higher merit than that of a mere

                    preceding, was born at Lubeck in 1638. After acquiring the elements of
                    literature in his native place, he went, in 1655, to the university of
                    Helmstadt, where he applied himself to philosophy and medicine, and afterwards
                    studied at Groningen, Franeker, and Leyden. On his return to Germany, he
                    undertook a tour through Italy, France, and England; contracted an acquaintance
                    with the learned wherever he went; and took his degree in physic as he passed
                    through Angers, in 1663. In 1664, he obtained a professorship of physic at
                    Helmstadt, to which, in 1678, were joined the professorships of history and
                    poetry, which he held until the time of his death, in March 1700. Besides a
                    number of works relating to his own profession, he published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scriptores Rerum Germanicarum,</hi> 1688, in three vols. folio; an useful
                    collection which had been commenced but not completed by his father.</p>

                    of the same family as the two preceding, was born in 1611. He early devoted
                    himself to literature and criticism, particularly the learning of the ancients,
                    and became eminently skilled in archaeology. In 1652he published a collection of
                    seven Greek authors, who had written upon music, to which he added a Latin
                    version by himself. It was entitled <hi rend="italic">Antiquae Musicae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Auctores Septem</hi><hi rend="italic">Graece</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et Patine,</hi><hi rend="italic">Marcus Meibomius</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >restituit et notis explicavit,</hi> and forms the most celebrated of all his
                    critical works. From these commentaries on the Greek musical writers,
                    particularly Alypius, we can almost decipher the characters used by the Greeks
                    in their musical notation; characters which, before the time of Meibomius, had
                    been so altered, corrupted, and disfigured, by the ignorance or negligence of
                    the transcribers of ancient manuscripts, that they had become nearly, if not
                    altogether, unintelligible. The Queen of Sweden, to whom this publication was
                    dedicated, invited Meibomius to her court; but his stay there was abridged by an
                    occurrente equally ridiculous and extraordinary. He became the victim of one of
                    those malicious tricks called practical jokes. The queen having imbibed somewhat
                    of his enthusiasm in favour of the music of the ancients, was easily persuaded
                    by Bourdelot, a physician in attendance on her person, to desire Meibomius to
                    sing an ancient Grecian air, whilst an old Frenchman, named Naudet, should dance
                    <hi rend="italic">a la Grec</hi> to the sound of his voice. Meibomius of course
                    complied with the royal request; but the performance, instead of exciting
                    admiration, produced loud bursts of laughter, in which her majesty heartily
                    joined. Meibomius, enraged beyond measure at this reception, chanced to espy
                    Bourdelot in the gallery amongst the scoffers, and having no doubt that it was
                    he who had maliciously instigated the queen to desire this performance,
                    immediately flew thither, and unrestrained by the presence of her majesty,
                    floored the luckless physician by a terrible facer, delivered with all the
                    energy of passion. In consequence of this summary proceeding, the expounder of
                    ancient music found it necessary to quit Sweden without the ceremony of asking
                    leave, or waiting to be called to account <pb break="no" facs="nls:194206764"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-6764-0534"/>for his conduct. He went to Copenhagen, where he
                    was well received, and soon afterwards appointed professor in a college
                    instituted for the instruction of the young Danish nobility. He was also
                    honoured with the title of aulic counsellor, and advanced to the dignity of
                    president of the board of maritime customs at Elsinore; but having neglected his
                    duty, he was dismissed from his office, and obliged to quit Denmark in disgrace.
                    He then proceeded to Amsterdam, where he settled, and became professor of
                    history in the college of that place. But his evil fortune still pursued him;
                    for having refused to give instructions to the son of a burgomaster, upon the
                    ground that he was not accustomed to teach boys the elements of knowledge, but
                    to direct the studies of young men advanced in learning, he was deprived of his
                    situation, and forced to quit Amsterdam. Being again thrown upon the world, he
                    visited France and England; after which he returned to Holland, where he led a
                    private and studious life until 1711, when he died, at a very advanced age,
                    having nearly completed a century. Meibomius pretended that the Hebrew Bible was
                    full of errors, and undertook to correct them by means of a metre which he
                    fancied he had discovered in the books of the Old Testament. But the whole
                    scheme was an illusion, and drew upon the author the unsparing ridicule of the
                    learned. Nevertheless, he was a scholar of no mean order, as is proved by his
                    edition of Diogenes Laertius, Amsterdam, 1692, in two vols. 4to.; his <hi

                    which he endeavours to explain how the ancients disposed their bancs of oars;
                    his edition of the ancient Greek Mythologists; and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dialogues on Proportions,</hi> in which Euclid, Archimedes, Appollonius,
                    Pappus, Eutocius, Theon, and Hermotinus are the interlocutors. <hi
