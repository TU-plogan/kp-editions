                    type="authorial"><p>This treatise was written for and published in the third
                    edition of this work. Though the greater part of it is, notwithstanding the
                    title, devoted to the <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of the Mind,</hi> it does not
                    adequately appreciate or discuss the doctrines of the Scottish School— that
                    School in which this important branch of Philosophy has been, as we think, most
                    soundly and persuasively taught, and best illustrated. It however presents a
                    collection and collation of opinions so extensive and elaborate as fully to
                    justify its republication. It had the disadvantage, we may observe, of having
                    been at least <hi rend="italic">partly</hi> written before the publication of
                    even the first volume of Mr Stewart’s invaluable <hi rend="italic">Elements of
                    the Philosophy of the Mind.</hi> Had circumstances permitted the change, we
                    should have separated this subject from <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics,</hi>
                    confining the article on the latter to that science alone, in as far as any
                    appropriate or definite meaning can now be assigned to its name, and discussing
                    the former, of new, under its proper head. But not being able, consistently with
                    other considerations, to accomplish this, we here reprint the Treatise nearly as
                    it originally appeared. The reader will be the better able to judge of its
                    compass by being informed, that it not only includes a view of the principal
                    speculations respecting the Intellectual Powers, and respecting Body or Matter
                    and its adjuncts, but also discusses some fundamental portions of Moral
                    Philosophy and Natural Religion,—such as Libertv and Necessity, the
                    Immateriality and Immortality of the Soul, and the Existence and Attributes of
                    the Deity.</p></note> has been defined, by a writer deeply versed in the ancient
                    philosophy, “the science of the principles and causes of all things existing.”
                    This definition we think extremely proper; and hence it is, that mind or
                    intelligence, and especially the Supreme Intelligence, which is the cause of the
                    universe, and of every thing which it contains, is the principal subject of this
                    science; and hence, too, the science itself has received its name. Aristotle,
                    indeed, who, of all the ancient metaphysicians whose works have come down to us,
                    was unquestionably the greatest, calls this science the First Philosophy, as
                    being not only superior, but also prior in the order of nature, to the whole
                    circle of the arts and sciences. But what is first in nature is not first to
                    man. Nature begins with causes, which produce effects. Man begins with effects,
                    and by them ascends to causes. Thus all human study and investigation proceed of
                    necessity in the reverse of the natural order of things, from sensible to
                    intelligible, from body the effect, to mind, which is both the first and the
                    final cause. Now Physics being the name given by the Stagyrite to the philosophy
                    of body, some of his interpreters, from this necessary course of human studies,
                    called that of mind Metaphysics; implying by that term not only that its subject
                    is more sublime and difficult, but also that the study of it would be most
                    properly and successfully entered upon <hi rend="italic">after that of
                    physics.</hi> To this name, which, though it has sometimes been treated with
                    ridicule, is abundantly significant, the followers of Aristotle were led by
                    their master, who, to the books in which he pretends to elevate the mind above
                    things corporeal to the contemplation of God and things spiritual, prefixed the
                    Greek words <hi rend="italic">μετα τα</hi><hi rend="italic">φ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">υσι</hi><hi rend="italic">ϰ</hi><hi rend="italic">α.</hi></p>
                <p>The science of Metaphysics has been divided, according to the objects which it
                    considers, into six principal parts, which are denominated, 1. Ontology; 2.
                    Cosmology; 3. Anthroposophy; 4. Psychology; 5. Pneumatology; and, 6.
                    Metaphysical Theology.</p>
                <p>That part of the science which is named Ontology investigates and explains the
                    nature and essence of all beings, as well as the qualities and attributes which
                    essentially pertain to them. Hence it has been said that ontology should proceed
                    in its operations from the most simple ideas; such as do not admit of any other
                    qualities of which they may be compounded. These simple ideas are, those of
                    being, of essence, of substance, of mode, of existence as well with regard to
                    time as place, of a necessary cause of unity; the idea of negation; the
                    difference between a being that is simple or compound, necessary or accidental,
                    finite or infinite; the ideas of essential and abstract properties, such as of
                    the greatness, perfection, and goodness of beings, &amp;c. The business,
                    therefore, of ontology is to make us acquainted with every kind of being in its
                    nature and essential qualities, by which it is distinguished from all other
                    beings. This knowledge being once established on simple principles, just
                    consequences may thence be drawn, and those things proved into which the
                    metaphysician inquires, and which it is the business of his science to
                    prove.</p>
                <p>It is easy to conceive, that even a clear knowledge of beings, and their
                    essential properties, would be still defective and useless to man, if he did not
                    know how to determine and fix his ideas by proper denominations, and
                    consequently to communicate his perceptions to those whom he would instruct, or
                    against whom he is obliged to dispute. To render our ideas intelligible to
                    others, therefore, we must have determinate words or denominations for each
                    being, and the qualities of each being; and ontology teaches us those terms
                    which are so necessary to fix our ideas, and to give them the requisite
                    perspicuity and precision, that when we endeavour to extend the sphere of our
                    knowledge, we may not waste our time in disputes about words.</p>
                <p>Metaphysics having, in as solid a manner as possible, explained and established
                    the principles above mentioned, continues its inquiries into the second part,
                    which is called Cosmology, and examines into the essence of the world and all
                    that it contains; its eternal laws; the nature of matter and of motion; the
                    nature of tangible bodies, their attributes and adjuncts; and all that can be
                    known by reasoning and experience. It is also in cosmology that the
                    metaphysicians of this school examine the Leibnitzian system; that is, whether
                    God, in creating the world, must necessarily have created the best world; and if
                    this world be so in fact. In this manner they pursue the argument, from
                    consequence to consequence, to its last resort, frequently with very little
                    advantage to truth and science.</p>
                <p>Anthroposophy, or the knowledge of man, forms the third branch of metaphysics. It
                    is subdivided into two parts. The first, which consists in the knowledge of the
                    exterior parts of the human frame, belongs not to this science, but to anatomy
                    and physiology. The business of the metaphysician is here to ascertain the
                    nature of those powers by which all the motions essential to life are produced;
                    and to discover, if possible, whether they be corporeal or spiritual. This
                    inquiry leads at the same time to psychology.</p>
                <p>Psychology consists in the knowledge of the intellectual soul in particular;
                    concerning which the most profound, the most subtile, and most abstract
                    researches have been made that human reason is capable of; and concerning the
                    sub stance of which, in spite of all these efforts, it is yet extremely
                    difficult to support any positive opinion with conclusive or probable
                    arguments.</p>
                <p>The fifth part√of metaphysics is called Pneumatology. By this term, which has not
                    been long in use, metaphysicians mean the knowledge of all spirits, angels,
                    &amp;c. It is easy to conceive what infinite art is necessary to give an account
                    of that of which nothing positive can ever be known in the present state of
                    human existence. But the metaphysician of this school readily offers to show us
                    what is the idea of a spirit, and the effective existence of a spirit; what are
                    its general qualities and properties; that there <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194207622" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7622-0600"/>are rational spirits, and
                    that these rational spirits have qualities which are founded in the moral
                    attributes of God; for this is in so many words what is attempted to be taught
                    in pneumatology.</p>
                <p>Metaphysical Theology, which Leibnitz and some others call Theodicy, is the sixth
                    and last branch of the science of metaphysics. It teaches us the knowledge of
                    the existence of God; to make the most rational suppositions concerning his
                    divine essence; to form a just idea of his attributes and perfections, and to
                    demonstrate them by abstract reasoning. Theodicy differs from natural theology,
                    inasmuch as this last borrows, in fact, from theodicy, proofs and demonstrations
                    to confirm the existence of a Supreme Being; but after having solidly
                    established that great truth, natural theology, by extending its consequences,
                    teaches us what are the relations and connexions which subsist between the
                    Supreme Being and men, and what are the duties which result from these
                    relations.</p>
                <p>We have briefly mentioned these divisions of the science, because they were once
                    prevalent in the schools. The greater part of them, however, appears tous to be
                    not only superfluous, but such as can serve no other purpose than to perplex the
                    mind. The only beings of which we know any thing are mind and body; and we have
                    no reason to think that there are any other beings in the universe. Of bodies
                    indeed there are various kinds, endowed with different properties; and it is
                    also extremely probable, that, of minds endowed with different powers, the
                    variety maybe equally great. Our own minds we know to be united in one system
                    with bodies by which they perform all their operations; and we can demonstrate
                    that there is another mind, which is independent of all body, and is the cause
                    of all things. Between these there may be numberless orders of minds; but their
                    energies are wholly unknown to us, and therefore they can never become the
                    objects of science.</p>
                <p>Mind and body, therefore, that is, the minds and bodies which we know to exist,
                    together with their powers and properties, essential and accidental, can alone
                    be the subjects of rational inquiry. We may inquire into the essence of mind and
                    the essence of body, and endeavour to ascertain in what respects they differ; we
                    may examine the nature of different bodies, in order to discover whether all
                    bodies, however modified, have not something in common; and we may consider the
                    properties, relations, and adjuncts of bodies, and endeavour to distinguish
                    those which are accidental from such as appear to be so necessary that without
                    them body itself could not exist. But of minds we cannot make the same
                    comparison. In this part of the science we have not sufficient data for an
                    accurate and complete induction. We can only examine the powers of our own mind,
                    and by probable analogy make some estimate of the powers of superior minds, as
                    observation will help us to guess at the powers of those which are placed
                    beneath us in the scale of existence.</p>
                <p>If this be so, cosmology, as distinguished from ontology, cannot properly be a
                    branch of metaphysics; for if mind and body, with their several powers,
                    properties, and adjuncts, compose the universe, it is obvious, that when we have
                    ascertained, as well as we are able, the essence of mind and the essence of
                    body, together with the powers and properties of each, and have traced them all
                    to the first cause, we have done every thing in the science of the universe, if
                    we may use the expression, which belongs to the province of the metaphysician.
                    The particular laws of motion on the earth and in the planetary system belong to
                    the natural philosopher and the astronomer.</p>
                <p>In like manner, anthroposophy, psychology, or pneuιna-tology, if these be not
                    words expressive of distinctions where there is no difference, appear to be at
                    least very needlessly disjoined from one another. Of the nature of spirits we
                    can know nothing but from contemplating the powers of our own minds; and the
                    body of man is in the province, not of the metaphysician, but of the anatomist
                    and physiologist. Anthroposophy, psychology, and pneumatology, if they be used
                    to denote our knowledge of all minds except the Supreme, are words of the same
                    import; for of no created minds except our own can we acquire such knowledge as
                    deserves the name of science.</p>
                <p>Ontology has sometimes been defined the science of <hi rend="italic">being in the
                    abstract</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in the course of our inquiries it will
                    be seen, that <hi rend="italic">being in the abstract</hi> is a phrase without
                    meaning. Considered as the science of real beings and their properties, ontology
                    is a very significant word, of the same import with metaphysics, and
                    comprehending in itself the knowledge of the nature of all things existing. Or
                    if it be thought proper to make a distinction between ontology and theology, the
                    former branch of the science will teach the knowledge of body and created minds,
                    whilst it is the province of the latter to demonstrate the existence and
                    attributes of that mind which is uncreated.</p>
                <p>Body and mind, therefore, with their properties, adjuncts, and powers, comprehend
                    the whole subject of the science of metaphysics; and as we are more early
                    acquainted with body than with mind, the natural order of conducting our
                    inquiries seems to be, to begin with the former, and thence proceed to the
                    latter. It is obvious, however, that if we would pursue these inquiries with any
                    hopes of success, we must first trace human knowledge from its source; ascertain
                    the nature of truth; and show what kind of evidence on each topic to be treated
                    ought to enforce conviction. In this view of the science, metaphysics appears to
                    be divided into three parts; the first treating of Human Understanding; the
                    second of Body, with its adjuncts; and the third of Mind, withits powers.</p>
                <p>Previously to entering upon such inquiries, some philosophers of great merit have
                    thought it expedient to explain the terms which they might have occasion to use.
                    Their conduct is judicious, and worthy of imitation; for the objects of
                    metaphysics being, for the most part, such as do not fall under the cognizance
                    of the senses, are liable to be differently apprehended by different men, if the
                    meanings of the words by which they are expressed be not ascertained with the
                    utmost precision. We intend, however, to use very few words except in the common
                    acceptation; and we therefore hope, that as terms of science are explained under
                    different words in the dictionary, to which references are made, we shall have
                    little or no occasion for swelling the article by previous definitions. There
                    are indeed two words which have given rise to much useless disputation, which
                    yet cannot be banished from speculative philosophy, and which it will therefore
                    be proper here to define. The words to which we allude are <hi rend="italic"
                    >idea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">notion.</hi> These are very generally
                    considered as synonymous; but we think that much logomachy might have been

                    philosopher who made much use of the word <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> before
                    Plato; but with his mysterious doctrine concerning ideas we have here nothing to
                    do. Our present business is to ascertain the precise meaning of the word, which

                    but that at first the word <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> was employed to denote
                    only those forms of external objects which men contemplate in their
                    imaginations, and which are originally received through the sense of sight. Its
                    signification was afterwards extended to the relicts of every sensation, of
                    touch, taste, sound, and smell, as well as of sight; and at last it was
                    confounded with <hi rend="italic">notion,</hi> which denotes the mental
                    apprehension of whatever may be known. In our use of the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >idea,</hi> except when we quote from others, we shall employ it only to denote
                    that appearance which absent objects of sense make in the memory or imagination;
                    and by the word <hi rend="italic">notion</hi> we shall denote our apprehension
                    or knowledge of spirits, and all such things as, though they be the objects of
                    science, cannot be perceived by the external senses. Having said this, we

                    Notions.</hi></p>
                <p>That the mind of man has no innate ideas or notions, but comes into the world
                    ignorant of every thing, is a truth which, since the days of Locke, has been
                    very little disputed. In the first book of his Essay on Human Understanding,
                    that very acute philosopher has demonstrated, that the rudiments or first
                    principles of all our knowledge are communicated to us by sensation; and he has
                    compared the mind, previously to the operation of external objects upon the
                    senses, to a <hi rend="italic">tabula rasa,</hi> or sheet of white paper. To
                    repeat his arguments would swell this article to no purpose. There is not a man
                    capable of attending to his own ideas, who can entertain a doubt in what manner
                    he received them. Without the sense of sight, we could never have known colours;
                    nor sound, without hearing; nor hardness, softness, smoothness, bodily pain or
                    pleasure, without touch; nor odours, without smell, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Self-evident as these facts arc, objections have been started to the inferences
                    drawn from them; and Locke has been accused of advancing principles subversive
                    of all distinction between truth and falsehood, and favourable of course to
                    universal scepticism. “The first book of his Essay, which, with submission,”
                    says Dr Beattie,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Essay
                    on the Nature and Immutability of Truth.</p></note> “I think the worst, tends to
                    establish this dangerous doctrine, that the human mind, previous to education
                    and habit, is as susceptible of one impression as of another; a doctrine which,
                    if true, would go near to prove that truth and virtue arc no better than human
                    contrivances; or at least that they have nothing permanent in their nature, but
                    may be as changeable as the inclinations and capacities of men; and that there
                    is no such thing as common sense in the world. Surely this is not the doctrine
                    which Mr Locke meant to establish.” We are so thoroughly satisfied that it is
                    not, that we cannot help wondering how such inferences could, by a man of
                    learning, genius, and candour, be drawn from any thing which is to be found in
                    the Essay on Human Understanding.</p>
                <p>But the doctor thinks Mr Locke’s “simile of the mind to white paper one of the
                    most unlucky allusions that could have been chosen; because the human soul, when
                    it begins to think, is not extended, nor of a white colour, nor incapable of
                    energy, nor wholly unfurnished with ideas, nor as susceptible of one impression
                    or character as of any other.” And it has been observed by another
                    objector,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Usher, author
                    of <hi rend="italic">Clio.</hi> See a volume of Fugitive Pieces, printed for J.
                    Davies, London, 1774.</p></note> that “on a sheet of white paper you may write
                    that sugar is bitter, wormwood sweet, fire and frost in every degree pleasing
                    and sufferable; that compassion and gratitude arc base; treachery, falsehood,
                    and envy, noble; and that contempt is indifferent to us.”</p>
                <p>All this is true, but we apprehend it is not to the purpose. Mr Locke has nowhere
                    expressed himself in such a manner as to lead us to suppose that he believed the
                    soul to be extended or coloured, or, when it begins to think, incapable of
                    energy, and wholly unfurnished with ideas; but he certainly did believe that it
                    does not begin to think at the first instant of its existence, and that it
                    acquires all the ideas of which it is ever possessed. We may undoubtedly write
                    upon a piece of white paper that sugar is bitter, and that wormwood is sweet;
                    but how the capacity of paper to receive the symbols of false propositions
                    should make Mr Locke’s comparison improper or dangerous, we cannot comprehend.
                    Mr Usher <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> indeed says, that it is improper on this
                    account, “that no human art or industry is able to make those impressions upon
                    the mind; in respect of them, the mind discovers not a passive capacity, but
                    resists them with the force of fate.” Does it indeed? Does the mind reject the
                    idea of sugar or of bitterness, of contempt or of indifference? May not any man
                    have the idea of sugar, and at the same time the idea of bitterness, and compare
                    the one with the other in his mind, as well as the word sugar may be written
                    beside the word bitter, and connected with it on the same piece of paper? In all
                    this we perceive nothing that is impossible, nor even difficult. The mind cannot
                    indeed be made to feel that sugar has the same taste with wormwood; but who ever
                    thought that it could? Not Mr Locke, we shall be bold to say; nor does his
                    simile give the smallest countenance to such an absurdity. The great author of
                    the Essay on Human Understanding understood his subject too well to imagine that
                    either truth or falsehood could be communicated to paper, or that paper is
                    capable of comparing ideas. Paper is capable of receiving nothing but lines or
                    figures, and it passively receives whatever lines or figures we may choose to
                    inscribe upon it; yet if a pen be carried over it in a circular direction, the
                    figure impressed will not be a square; just as, to the mind of one eating sugar,
                    the taste communicated is not that of wormwood.</p>
                <p>On a piece of paper a circle may be described, and close beside it a square; in
                    like manner an agreeable sensation may be communicated to the mind, and
                    immediately afterwards a sensation that is disagreeable. These two sensations,
                    or the ideas which they leave behind them, may be compared together; and it is
                    certainly true that no art or industry can make them appear similar in the mind.
                    But is it not equally true that no art or industry can make the circle and the
                    square similar on the paper? The paper ií susceptible of any sort of plain
                    figures, and the mind is equally susceptible of any sort of ideas or sensations;
                    but figures dissimilar cannot be made to coincide, neither can discordant ideas
                    be made to agree. Again, one may write upon paper that a circle <hi
                    rend="italic">is</hi> a square, and likewise that a circle <hi rend="italic">is
                    not</hi> a square; and both these propositions may be communicated to the mind
                    by the organs of sight or of hearing. The paper receives the words expressive of
                    the false as well as those expressive of the true proposition; and the mind
                    receives the ideas and relations signified by the one cluster of words as well
                    as those signified by the other; but in the mind the idea of a square is very
                    different <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207648" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7648-0602"/>from
                    that of a circle, and on the paper the figure of a square is very different from
                    the figure of a circle. The great difference between the mind and the paper is,
                    that the former is conscious of its ideas, and perceives their agreement or
                    disagreement; whereas the paper is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> conscious of the
                    figures drawn upon it, nor perceives any thing about them. But still these
                    figures are what they are; they either agree or disagree on the paper, as well
                    as the ideas either agree or disagree in the mind. It is not in the power of the
                    mind to alter the ideas of the square and the circle, nor in the power of the
                    paper to alter the forms of these figures.</p>
                <p>It appears, then, that the principles of Mr Locke, and the comparison by which he
                    illustrates them, have no more tendency to subvert the difference between truth
                    and falsehood, right and wrong, than the passiveness of paper has to subvert the
                    difference between a straight line and a crooked, a circle and a square; and
                    with a view to establish the doctrine of innate ideas and instinctive principles
                    of knowledge, we might with as much propriety ask, whether it be possible to
                    imagine that any mode of manufacture could make paper of such a nature as that a
                    pen drawn over it in a circular direction would leave the figure of a square,
                    as, whether it be possible to imagine that any course of education could ever
                    bring a rational creature to believe that two and two are equal to three.</p>
                <p>The mind being thus, as we may say, originally white paper, void of all
                    characters, without ideas or notions of any kind, the first question which we
                    have to consider is, whence and in what manner it derives the materials of all
                    its knowledge? To this question the only answer which can be given is, that it
                    derives them from observation and experience; from observation, either employed
                    upon external objects of sense, or turned inwardly upon its own operations. Our
                    senses, conversant about particular external objects, convey into the mind
                    several distinct perceptions; such as those of colour, figure, heat, cold,
                    bitterness, sweetness, and all those things which are usually called sensible
                    qualities. The notions, ideas, or whatever else they may be called, which are
                    acquired in this manner, may be called sensible knowledge; and the source of
                    that knowledge is termed sensation.</p>
                <p>The other fountain from which experience furnishes the understanding with
                    knowledge, is that attention which we are capable of giving to the operations of
                    our own minds when employed about those ideas which were originally suggested by
                    objects of sense. These operations, when the soul comes to reflect on them,
                    furnish us with a set of notions entirely different from the ideas of sense;
                    such as the notions of perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning,
                    knowing, willing, and all the different energies and passions of our own minds.
                    Of these operations we are always conscious when we are awake; but it requires,
                    as shall be shown afterwards, no inconsiderable effort to set them, as it were,
                    at a distance, to reflect on them, and consider what they are. When we have made
                    this effort, however, we acquire notions as distinct, and perhaps more
                    important, than those ideas which we receive through the medium of the
                    senses.</p>
                <p>Sensation and reflection, then, furnish mankind with the first materials of all
                    their knowledge. The mind seems not to have ideas or notions of any kind which
                    it did not receive by one or other of these modes. By means of the senses it
                    perceives external objects; and by that power which it has of turning its
                    attention upon itself, it discovers the nature and manner of its own
                    operations.</p>
                <p>Although the knowledge which we acquire from reflection be of equal importance,
                    and perhaps of greater certainty than that which we receive through the medium
                    of the senses, it comes into the mind at a much later period; both because it is
                    impossible that the faculties of the mind should operate without materials, and
                    because it is much more difficult to attend to these operations, even whilst
                    they are going on, than to the objects of sense which solicit our attention. It
                    is for this reason pretty late before children have any notions whatever of the
                    operations of their own minds; and of the greater part of these operations the
                    bulk of mankind have no clear or accurate notions during the whole of their
                    lives. On the other hand, every human being is so surrounded with bodies, which
                    perpetually and variously affect his senses, that a variety of sensible ideas
                    force an entrance even into the minds of children. In order therefore to trace
                    the procedure of the understanding, and to ascertain the extent and limits of
                    human knowledge, it should seem that we must begin with considering the external
                    senses, that we may discover the manner in which we receive knowledge by means
                    of them, the objects of that knowledge, and its certainty. It is to be observed,
                    however, that though we consider the mind as possessed of many powers or
                    faculties, and inquire first into the nature of that faculty which we conceive
                    to be first exerted, this is done merely for the sake of proceeding in our
                    subject with method and perspicuity. The mind is one simple and undivided being;
                    and in every mental energy it is the whole mind, and not any part or portion of
                    it, that is energetic. On this account it is impossible to explain even the
                    nature of sensation and perception to him who knows not what is meant by will or
                    understanding; but to every one who is acquainted with the common import of
                    these words, and who has read the treatise on <hi rend="smallcaps">Logic</hi>
                    inserted in this work, we hope that our theory of perception will be
                    intelligible and convincing.</p>

                <p>The Supreme Being, who made us and placed us in this world, has given us such
                    powers of mind as he saw to be suited to our state and rank in his creation. He
                    has given us the power of perceiving many objects around us; but that power is
                    limited in various ways, and particularly in this, that without the organs of
                    the several senses we perceive no external object. The senses, as every one
                    knows, are five in number, and each communicates its proper sensation. It is by
                    the eyes alone that we see, by the ears that we hear, by the nose that we smell,
                    and by the tongue and palate that we taste; the sense of feeling or touch is
                    spread over the whole body, for we feel equally by our hands and by our feet,
                    &amp;c. To the powers of perception by the senses it is necessary not only that
                    we have all the organs enumerated, but that we have them also in a sound and
                    natural state. There are many disorders of the eye which cause total blindness,
                    as well as others which impair without destroying the power of vision. The same
                    thing is true of the organs of all the other senses. ’</p>
                <p>All this is so well known from experience, that it needs no proof; but it may be
                    worth while to observe, that it is known from experience only.<note

                    certain that he himself perceives every thing more perfectly than we do without
                    bodily organs. For it is to be observed, that the organs of sense are different
                    from the being which is sentient. It is not the eye which sees, nor <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194207661" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7661-0603"/> the ear which
                    hears; these are only the organs by which we see and hear. A man cannot see the
                    satellites of Jupiter except by means of a telescope, nor hear a low voice
                    except by means of an ear-trumpet. Does he from this conclude that it is the
                    telescope which sees those satellites, or the trumpet which hears that voice?
                    Such a conclusion would be evidently absurd. It is no less absurd to conclude
                    that it is the eye which sees, or the ear which hears. The telescope and the
                    trumpet are artificial organs of sight and of hearing, of which the eye and ear
                    are natural organs; but the natural organs see and hear as little as the
                    artificial.</p>
                <p>That this is the case with respect to the eye and the ear, is so obvious, that,
                    as far as we know, it has never been denied. But'with respect to the senses of
                    touch, taste, and smell, the truth at first view does not appear so evident. A
                    celebrated writer has observed,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Kames’s Elements of Criticism.</p></note> that “after the
                    utmost efforts, we find it beyond our power to conceive the flavour of a rose to
                    exist in the mind; we are necessarily led to conceive that pleasure as existing
                    in the nostrils, along with the impression made by the rose upon that
                    organ;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Another eminent
                    writer thinks very differently on this subject, and in our opinion much more
                    justly. “Suppose,” says Dr Reid, “a person who never had this sense <hi
                    rend="italic">(smelD</hi> before, to receive it ail at once, and to smell a
                    rose; can he perceive any similitude or agreement between the smell and the
                    rose, or indeed between it and any other object whatever? Certainly he cannot.
                    He finds himself affected in a new way, he knows not why, or from what cause. He
                    is conscious that he is not the cause of it himself; but he cannot, from the
                    nature of the thing, determine whether it be caused by body or spirit, by
                    something near or by something at a distance. He cannot give it a <hi
                    rend="italic">place,</hi> any more than he can give a place to melancholy or
                    joy; nor can he conceive it to have any existence but when it is smelled.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Inquiry into the Human Mind,</hi> ch. ii. sect, ii.) .</p></note>
                    and the same will be the result of experiments with respect to every feeling of
                    taste, touch, and smell. Touch,” he says, “affords the most satisfactory
                    evidence, and philosophy detects the delusion.” To detect this delusion
                    requires, indeed, no great depth in philosophy; for it is so far from being true
                    that we are necessarily led otherwise than by association, of which the laws
                    shall afterwards be explained, to conceive the pleasure or pain of touch as
                    existing at that part of our body upon which the impression is made, that, as
                    every man must have observed, children, previously to experience, cannot
                    distinguish the precise place of their bodies which is affected by the touch of
                    any external object» Nay, we believe it will be found upon trial, that if a
                    full-grown man, with all the experience of age to guide him, be pricked with a
                    pin on any part of his body which he has seldom handled, and never seen, he will
                    not readily, norat first, put his finger upon the wound, nor even come very <hi
                    rend="italic">near</hi> to the wound. This, however, he would certainly and
                    infallibly do were the sense of touch necessarily conceived as existing in the
                    organ. To these observations objections may perhaps be made, which we cannot
                    stay to obviate; but the following, we think, will admit of none. We appeal to
                    every man who has experienced that particular sensation of touch which Scaliger
                    has dignified with the name of a sixth sense, whether, whilst those sensations
                    were new to him, he was necessarily led to conceive them as existing in any
                    particular organ. If he was not, it then follows undeniably that the organs of
                    sensation are different from the being which is sentient; that it is not the eye
                    which sees, the ear which hears, the nostrils which smell, the tongue which
                    tastes, nor any part of the body which feels; and that it is by experience alone
                    that we learn to associate our several sensations with those organs upon which
                    the impressions are made.</p>
                <p>It is, however, certain that we receive no sensation from external objects,
                    unless when some impression is made upon the organ of sense, either by the
                    immediate application of the object itself, or by some medium which passes
                    between the object and the organ.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Reid’s Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man, and
                    Hartley’s Observations on Man.</p></note> In two of our senses, viz. touch and
                    taste, there must be an immediate application of the object to the organ. In the
                    other three the sensation is occasioned by the impression of some medium passing
                    from the object to the organ. The effluvia of bodies drawn into the nostrils
                    with the breath are the medium of smell; the undulations of the air are the
                    medium of hearing; and the rays of light passing from visible objects to the eye
                    arc the medium of sight. These are facts known from experience to hold
                    universally both in men and in brutes. It is likewise a law of our nature
                    perfectly known to all who know any thing of anatomy, that, in order to actual
                    sensation, the impressions made upon the external organs must be communicated to
                    the nerves, and from them to the brain. First, the object, either immediately,
                    or by some medium, makes an impression upon the organ; the organ serves as a
                    medium by which the impression is communicated to the nerves; and the nerves
                    serve as a medium to carry it on to the brain. Here the corporeal part ends; at
                    least we can trace it no farther. The rest of the process is purely
                    intellectual. The proof of these impressions upon the nerves and brain in
                    sensation is this, That from many observations and experiments it is found, that
                    when the organ of any sense is perfectly sound, and has the impression made upon
                    it by the object ever so strongly, yet if the nerve which serves that organ be
                    cut or tied hard, there is no sensation; and it is well known that disorders in
                    the brain deprive us of sensation, whilst both the organ and its nerve remain
                    sound.</p>
                <p>There is sufficient reason, therefore, to conclude, that in sensation the object
                    produces some change in the organ; that from the organ the change proceeds to
                    the nerve, and from the nerve to the brain. Hence it is that we have positive
                    sensations from negative objects or mere nonentities, such as darkness,
                    blackness, and vacuity. For, sensation resulting from changes in the brain,
                    whatever produces any change must of course occasion a new sensation; but it is
                    obvious that the mere absence of any impression, by the removal of the object
                    which produced it, must as necessarily cause a change in the organ, nerves, and
                    brain, as the presence of a new impression from a new object. To these changes,
                    or that which immediately produces them, we give the name of impressions;
                    because we know not how, in a general manner, to express more properly any
                    change produced by an external cause, without specifying the nature of that
                    cause. Whether it be pressure, or attraction, or repulsion, or vibration, or
                    something unknown, for which we have no name, still it may be called an
                    impression.</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton was perhaps the first who supposed that the rays of light
                    falling upon the bottom of the eye excite vibrations in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tunica retina;</hi> and that these vibrations, being propagated along the solid
                    fibres of the optic nerves into the brain, cause the actual sensation of seeing.
                    This hypothesis was adopted by Dr Hartley, applied to the other senses, and
                    shown to be at least as probable as any which has yet been invented to account
                    for the perception of external objects by means of the organs of sense. Be this
                    as it may, experience informs us, that whatever be the nature of those
                    impressions and changes which are made by external objects upon the senses,
                    nerves, and brain, we have without them no actual sensation, and of course
                    perceive <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207674" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7674-0604"
                    />nothing <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">extra.</hi> Hence it has
                    been supposed that the mind is wholly passive in sensation, and that sensation
                    is necessarily produced by those impressions. But this we believe to be a
                    mistake. Every man who has been attentive to his own thoughts and actions, must
                    know instances of impressions having been certainly made upon his organs of
                    sense without producing any sensation, or suggesting to his mind the perception
                    of the particular objects by which the impressions were caused. He whose mind is
                    intensely employed in any particular pursuit may have his eyes open upon an
                    object which he does not see, or he may not hear the sound of a clock striking
                    within two yards of him; nay, we will venture to affirm, that there is hardly
                    one reader of this article to whom such absences of sensation have not often
                    occurred. Now, as there is no reason to suppose, that in the one case the
                    undulations of the air caused by the striking of the clock did not reach his
                    cars, or that in the other the rays of light reflected from the object did not
                    fall upon his eyes, which were open to receive them, the only reason which can
                    be assigned for his not having, in these instances, had audible and visible
                    sensations, is, that his mind was so engaged in something else as not to pay to
                    the vibrations in his brain that attention, if we may so express it, without
                    which impressions <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">extra</hi> can
                    produce no sensation. There are, indeed, some impressions on the organs of sense
                    so violent and so sudden as to force themselves upon the mind, however employed.
                    Such are those made on the ear by thunder, and on the eye by strong light. In
                    these cases, sensation is involuntary and unavoidable; whence we conclude, not
                    that in such instances the mind is passive or destitute of energy, but that, by
                    the violent agitation given to the brain, it is roused from its reverie, and
                    compelled to give attention. It appears, therefore, that in sensation the mind
                    exerts some kind of energy; for in nothing but in the sentient being itself can
                    we seek for the cause why, when all external circumstances are the same,
                    organical impressions sometimes produce sensations and sometimes not; and that
                    cause can only be the energy of the mind, though of what kind that energy is we
                    pretend not to say.</p>

                <p>How the correspondence is carried on between the thinking principle within us and
                    the material world without us, has always, as Dr Reid observes, been found a
                    very difficult problem to those philosophers who consider themselves as obliged
                    to account for every phenomenon in nature. It is, indeed, a problem of which we
                    do not expect ever to see a complete solution. A few steps beyond the vulgar we
                    may certainly go; but the nature of that connection by which the mind and body
                    are united will probably remain for ever unknown. One question, however, which
                    has employed much of the attention of philosophers, both ancient and modern,
                    appears to be not wholly unanswerable. It is, whether, by means of our senses,
                    we perceive external objects mediately or immediately; or, in other words,
                    whether sensation and pereeption be one and the same thing, or two things
                    succeeding each other? On this subject, till of late, there appears to have been
                    in the main a great uniformity in the sentiments of philosophers,
                    notwithstanding their variations respecting particular points. Of some of the
                    most eminent of them we shall give the opinions, as we find them collected by
                    one<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Reid in his
                    Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man.</p></note> who was well acquainted
                    with their writings, who was thoroughly qualified to estimate their respective
                    merits, and who cannot be suspected of partiality to that theory which we feel
                    ourselves compelled to adopt.</p>
                <p>“Plato illustrates our manner of perceiving external objects thus: He supposes a
                    dark subterraneous cave, in which men lie bound in such a manner as that they
                    can direct their eyes only to one part of the cave. Far behind there is a light,
                    of which some rays come over a wall to that part of the cave which is before the
                    eyes of our prisoners. A number of men variously employed pass between them and
                    the light, whose shadows are seen by the prisoners, but not their persons
                    themselves. In this manner did that philosopher conceive that by our senses we
                    perceive not things themselves, but only the shadows of things; and he seems to
                    have borrowed his notions on this subject from the disciples of Pythagoras.</p>
                <p>“If we make due allowance for Plato’s allegorical <hi rend="italic">genius,</hi>
                    his sentiments with respect to sensation and perception correspond very well
                    with those of the Peripatetics. Aristotle, the founder of that school, seems to
                    have thought that the soul consists of two or three parts; or rather that we
                    have three souls, the vegetable, the animal, and the rational. The animal soul
                    is held to be a certain form of the body, which is inseparable from it, and
                    perishes at death. To this soul the senses belong; and he defines a sense to be
                    that which is capable of receiving the sensible forms, or species of objects,
                    without any of the matter of them; as wax receives the form of the seal without
                    any of its matter. Of this doctrine it seems to be a necessary consequence, that
                    bodies are constantly sending forth, in all directions, as many different kinds
                    of forms without matter as they have different sensible qualities. This was
                    accordingly maintained by the followers of Aristotle, though not, as far as we
                    know, taught by himself They disputed concerning the nature of these forms or
                    species, whether they were real beings or nonentities; but of matter and form we
                    shall have occasion to speak afterwards.</p>
                <p>“After Aristotle had kept possession of the schools for more than a thousand
                    years, his authority, which had often supplied the place of argument, was called
                    in question by Lord Bacon and others. Descartes, however, was the first
                    philosopher who, convinced of the defects of the prevailing system, attempted to
                    form another entirely new; but on the nature of perception by means of the
                    senses he differs little or nothing from those who had preceded him in that
                    department of science. He denies, indeed, and refutes by solid reasoning, the
                    doctrine which maintains that images, species, or forms of external objects,
                    come from the objects themselves, and enter into the mind by the avenues of the
                    senses. But he takes it for granted, as all the old philosophers had done, that
                    what we immediately perceive must be either in the mind itself, or in the brain,
                    in which the mind is immediately present. The impressions made upon our organs,
                    nerves, and brain, can be nothing, according to his philosophy, but various
                    modifications of extension, figure, and motion. There can be nothing in the
                    brain like sound or colour, taste or smell, heat or cold. They are sensations in
                    the mind, which, by the laws of the union of the soul and body, are raised on
                    occasion of certain traces in the brain; and although he sometimes gives the
                    name of ideas to these traces, he does not think it necessary that they should
                    be perfectly like the things which they represent, any more than that words and
                    signs should resemble the things which they signify.</p>
                <p>“According to this system, it would appear that we perceive not external objects
                    directly by means of our senses; but that these objects, operating either
                    mediately or immediately upon the organs of sense, and they again upon our
                    nerves and brain, excite in the mind certain sensations; whence we infer the
                    existence of external objects from our sensations, of which they are the cause.

                    external objects, therefore, according to Descartes, is not one simple original
                    act of the mind, but may be resolved into a process of reasoning from effects to
                    causes.”</p>
                <p>The doctrines of Malebranche, Locke, and Hartley, respecting perception, differ
                    not essentially from that of Descartes. Malebranche, indeed, supposes that
                    external objects are not themselves the causes of perceptions; but that the
                    Deity, being always present to our minds more intimately than any other being,
                    does, upon occasion of the impressions made upon our organs of sense, discover
                    to us, as far as he thinks proper, and according to fixed laws, his own ideas of
                    the object; and thus, according to him, we see all things in God, or in the
                    divine ideas. He agrees, however, with Descartes and the ancient philosophers,
                    in considering it as a truth which it is impossible to refute, that we perceive
                    not the objects without us, the sun, moon, and stars, &amp;c., because it is not
                    likely that the soul sallies out of the body, and takes a walk, as it were,
                    through the heavens to contemplate these objects. She sees them not therefore by
                    themselves; and the immediate object of the mind, when it sees the sun, is not
                    the sun itself, but something which is intimately united to the mind, and is
                    that which he calls an <hi rend="italic">idea.</hi></p>
                <p>Locke, speaking of the reality of our knowledge, says: “It is evident the mind
                    knows not things immediately, but only by the intervention of the ideas it has
                    of them. Our knowledge, therefore, according to him, is real only so far as
                    there is a conformity between our ideas and the things which they represent.”
                    And the manner of our perceiving external objects he illustrates by the
                    following similitude: “Methinks the understanding is not much unlike a closet
                    wholly shut from light, with only some little opening left, to let in external
                    visible resemblances, or ideas of things without. Would the pictures coming into
                    such a dark room but stay there, and he so orderly as to be found upon occasion,
                    it would very much resemble the understanding of a man in reference to all
                    objects of sight, and the ideas of them.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    elsewhere<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Book ii. chap.
                    viii.</p></note> defined an idea thus: “Whatsoever the mind perceives in itself,
                    or is the immediate object of perception, thought, or understanding, that I call
                    an <hi rend="italic">idea</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the power to produce
                    any idea in our mind I call <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> of the subject
                    wherein the power is.” He likewise thinks it easy to draw this observation, that
                    the ideas of what he calls primary qualities of bodies, viz. extension,
                    solidity, figure, mobility, &amp;c. are resemblances of these qualities as they
                    really exist in the bodies themselves.</p>
                <p>This unguarded expression, which affirms that ideas in the mind are the
                    resemblances of external things, has brought upon Mr Locke much undeserved
                    ridicule. That upon this and other occasions he uses the word idea with too
                    great latitude, and that he often confounds ideas with sensations, and even with
                    the causes of sensation, must be admitted by his warmest admirers; but we
                    believe that by an attentive reader, who peruses his whole work, and compares
                    such passages as are obscure with those which are clearer, his meaning may
                    always be discovered, and, with respect to sensation and perception, will
                    generally be found just. That by calling the ideas of primary qualities
                    resemblances of the qualities themselves, he meant nothing more than that bodies
                    in all possible states impress the senses, nerves, and brain, in such a manner
                    as to produce in the mind certain sensations, between which and those
                    impressions there is an inseparable though unknown connection, is evident from
                    the account which he gives of the manner of perception. “Our senses,” says he,
                    “conversant about particular sensible objects, do convey into the mind several
                    distinct perceptions of things, according to those various ways in which these
                    objects affect them; and thus we come by those ideas we have of yellow, white,
                    heat, cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all those which we call sensible
                    qualities; which, when I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean they, from
                    external objects, convey into the mind what produces those perceptions.” And as
                    bodies can act only by impulse, he adds, that “those perceptions can be produced
                    only by an impression made upon the senses, and some motion thence continued by
                    our nerves to the brain or seat of perception.”</p>
                <p>Dr Hartley was the pupil of Locke and Newton; and, in a more satisfactory manner
                    than all who had preceded or have since followed him, explained the material
                    part of the process of perception. His principles we shall have occasion, during
                    the course of this article, to develope pretty fully. For our present purpose it
                    is sufficient to say, that all his observations and arguments evidently suppose,
                    that nothing distant from the mind can be perceived in the immediate act of
                    sensation; but that the apparently immediate perception of external objects is
                    an instance of early and deep-rooted association.</p>
                <p>In this sentiment Mr Hume agrees with his predeces-. sors; but he obscures his
                    philosophy, and misleads his reader, by confounding sensations with the
                    impressions from which they proceed. “Every one,” says he,<note anchored="true"

                    iii.</p></note> “will allow that there is a considerable difference between the
                    perceptions of the mind when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or the
                    pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he afterwards recalls to his memory this
                    sensation, or anticipates it by his imagination.” The less forcible and lively
                    of these perceptions he with great propriety calls <hi rend="italic"
                    >ideas</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it is either through wilful
                    perverseness, or confusion of intellect, that he chooses to call the others <hi

                    rend="italic">impressions</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but they are no more
                    impressions themselves than the pain occasioned by the stroke of a bludgeon is
                    the stroke itself, or the bludgeon with which it was struck. But more of this
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>Thus far, then, that we perceive not external objects directly, but infer their
                    existence from certain sensations' excited in our minds by the operation of
                    these objects upon our senses, nerves, and brain, seems to have been the opinion
                    of almost every philosopher from Pythagoras<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Hume. For an opinion so universal, and at the same time so contrary to the
                    persuasion of the multitude, some cogent reason must have been assigned. That
                    reason has been given by many philosophers, but by none with greater perspicuity
                    than Dr Porterfield, in his Essay concerning the Motion of the Eyes. “How body
                    acts upon the mind, or mind upon body,” says he, “I know not; but this I am very
                    certain of, that nothing can act, or be acted upon, where it is not; and
                    therefore our mind can never perceive any thing but its own proper
                    modifications, and the various states of the sensorium to which it is present.
                    So that it is not the external sun and moon, which are in the heavens, that our
                    mind perceives, but only their image or representation impressed on the
                    sensorium. How the soul of a seeing man sees those images, or how it receives
                    those ideas from such agitations in the sensorium, I know not; but I am sure it
                    can never perceive the external bodies themselves, to which it is not
                    present.”</p>
                <p>This reasoning appears to have force, and perhaps the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194207700" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7700-0606"/>unanimous agreement of
                    thinking men in all ages has still greater force; yet the doctrine which
                    prevailed so long, and which to Locke appeared so evident as to need no proof,
                    has since been called in question by some eminent philosophers in our own
                    country, who, though they allow that we cannot perceive external objects except
                    by means of the senses, yet affirm that they are the objects themselves which we
                    perceive directly, and that in perception there is no association which can be
                    resolved into a process of reasoning from sensations the effects, to external
                    objects the causes. Dr Reid, who was perhaps the first of this class of
                    philosophers, had expressed himself distinctly on this subject.</p>
                <p>“If we attend to the act of our mind which we call the perception of an external
                    object of sense, we shall find it in these three things: <hi rend="italic"
                    >First,</hi> some conception or notion of the object perceived; <hi
                    rend="italic">secondly,</hi> a strong and irresistible conviction and belief of
                    its present existence; and, <hi rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> that this conviction
                    and belief are immediate, and not the effect of reasoning.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man,
                    essay ii. chap. v.</p></note> To the first and second of these propositions we
                    are persuaded that Descartes and Locke would readily have assented; nor do we
                    imagine that they would have denied the third, had the author allowed that this
                    strong and irresistible conviction is the consequence of an early and
                    deep-rooted association, resolvable into <hi rend="italic">a</hi> process of
                    reasoning. This, however, the learned professor does not allow, for he
                    repeatedly affirms that it is instinctive and original, and that “the
                    constitution of our power of perception determines us to hold the existence of
                    what we distinctly perceive as a first principle, from which other truths may be
                    deduced, but it is deduced from none.” With this view of the matter, he could
                    with no propriety attempt to support his own opinion by argument; but to the
                    reasonings of Dr Porterfield and others in defence of the Cartesian theory, he
                    replies in the following words: “That nothing can act immediately where it is
                    not, I think must be admitted; for I agree with Sir Isaac Newton, that power
                    without substance is inconceivable. It is a consequence of this, that nothing
                    can be acted upon immediately where the agent is’not present; let this,
                    therefore, be granted. To make the reasoning conclusive, it is farther
                    necessary, that when we perceive objects, either they act upon us, or we act
                    upon them. This does not appear self-evident, nor have I ever met with any proof
                    of it.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ibid,</hi> essay ii. chap. ∑iv.</p></note></p>
                <p>Of the profundity of Dr Reid’s understanding we have the most firm conviction;
                    nor is there any metaphysician, ancient or modern, from whom we differ with
                    greater reluctance; but we cannot help thinking this a rash assertion, as his
                    own works appear to us to afford complete proof that, in perception, the mind
                    both acts and is acted upon. Let us attend, however, to the reasons which, on
                    this occasion, induced him to think that in perception there is no action either
                    of the object on the mind or of the mind on the object.</p>
                <p>“When we say that one being acts upon another, we mean that some power or force
                    is exerted by the agent which produces, or has a tendency to produce, a change
                    in the thing acted upon. If this be the meaning of the phrase, as I conceive it
                    is, there appears no reason for asserting that, in perception, either the object
                    acts upon the mind or the mind upon the object. An object, in being perceived,
                    does not act at all. I perceive the walls of the room where I sit; but they are
                    perfectly inactive, and therefore act not upon the mind. To be perceived, is
                    what logicians call an external denomination, which implies neither action nor
                    quality in the object perceived.”</p>
                <p>This last sentence we do not pretend to understand. Substance without qualities
                    is to us inconceivable, and certainly is no object of perception; for Dr Reid
                    himself has told us, and told us truly, that “the objects of perception are the
                    various qualities of bodies.” That an object, in being perceived, does not act
                    at all, is directly contrary to what the ingenious author has taught us, both in
                    his Inquiry and in his Essays, viz. that “it is a law of our nature that we
                    perceive not external objects, unless certain impressions be made by the object
                    upon the organ, and, by means of the organ, upon the nerve and brain for if the
                    external object, in being perceived, make impressions, it is certainly not true
                    that it does not act at all. It is indeed readily acknowledged, that when one
                    perceives the walls of the room where he sits, these walls do not act
                    immediately upon the organs of sight; but it does not therefore follow that they
                    are perfectly inactive; for it is known to all mankind, that from every point of
                    the wall which is seen, rays of light are reflected to the eye; that these rays
                    make upon the <hi rend="italic">retina tunica</hi> an impression, which is
                    conveyed by the optic nerve to the brain; and that this impression on the brain
                    is one of the immediate causes of vision. In what particular manner it causes
                    vision, we shall never be able to discover, till we know more of the laws which
                    unite mind and body, and by which one of these is qualified to act upon the
                    other; but, because we know not the manner of this operation, to affirm that
                    there is no operation at all, seems to be as absurd as it would be to affirm,
                    because we perceive no necessary connection between a stroke and the sensation
                    of sound, that the sound of a musical string is not caused by the· stroke of a
                    plectrum. That God might have given us powers of perception of a different kind
                    from those which we possess, there can be no doubt; but with what we might have
                    been we have no concern. As we are, we know perfectly that the eye is an
                    instrument of vision, because without it nothing can be seen; we know also that
                    the retina and optic nerves are equally necessary, because, if they be
                    disordered, vision is still wanting; we know likewise that the brain is
                    necessary to all perception, because, when it is disordered, thinking either
                    entirely ceases or is proportionably disturbed. Aird, lastly, we are not more
                    certain of our own existence, than that actual perception does not take place
                    except when the object makes an impression upon some organ of sense; for when no
                    rays of light fall upon the eye, we see nothing; when no sapid body is applied
                    to the tongue and palate, we taste nothing; and if we could be removed from
                    every thing solid, we should feel nothing.</p>
                <p>These are conclusions which cannot be controverted. They are admitted equally by
                    the philosopher and by the plain unlettered man of common sense; nor are they
                    rendered one whit less certain by our not being able to go a step farther, so as
                    to discover in what manner the brain or the affections of it can be the
                    immediate instrument of sensation and perception. For, as Dr Reid observes, in
                    the spirit of true philosophy,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Inquiry into the Human Mind, 4th edit. p. 258.</p></note> in
                    the operation of mind, as well as in those of bodies, we must often be satisfied
                    with knowing that certain things are connected and invariably follow one
                    another, without being able to discover the chain that connects them. It is to
                    such connections that we give the name of <hi rend="italic">laws of
                    nature</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and when we say that one thing produces

                    energy; and therefore as, upon every hypothesis, perception is a consequence of
                    sensation, it follows, that in perception the mind cannot be wholly inactive. Dr
                    Reid, in his Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man, seems to affirm that it
                    is. “I see no reason,” says he, “to believe that in perception the mind acts
                    upon the object. To perceive an object is one thing, to act upon it is another.
                    Nor is the last at all included in the first. To say that I act upon the wall by
                    looking at it, is an abuse of language, and has no meaning.” This is indeed
                    true; it would be a great abuse of language to say that by looking at the wall a
                    man acts upon it; but we do not believe that any man ever said or supposed such
                    a thing. The philosophers whose opinion he is combating might argue in this
                    manner: We arc conscious that in perception the mind is active; but nothing can
                    act immediately where it is not; the mind cannot act immediately upon external
                    existence; external existence therefore is not the immediate object of that
                    energy which is exerted in perception. As Dr Reid affirms that external
                    existence is the immediate object of perception, he must deny the first
                    proposition in this argument; for if it be granted, as we have just seen, that
                    in his reply to Dr Porterfield he admits the second, the laws of reasoning will
                    compel him to admit the third.</p>
                <p>To say that in perception the mind acts not upon external objects, is a truth in
                    which all mankind are agreed; and it is the very principle from which his
                    antagonists infer that the conviction of the present existence of external
                    objects is not an original and instinctive consequence of sensation, but an
                    early and deep-rooted association, which may be resolved into a process of
                    reasoning. His meaning therefore must be, that in perception the mind does not
                    act at all. But this is directly contrary to his definition of perception, which
                    he calls an act of the mind; and it is likewise contrary to his theory of
                    perception, as it is detailed in the Inquiry into the Human Mind on the
                    Principles of Common Sense. We are there taught, with equal elegance and
                    perspicuity, “that an impression made by an external object upon the organ,
                    nerves, and brain, is followed by a sensation, and that this sensation is
                    followed by the perception of the object.” We are likewise taught, that
                    “although the Peripatetics had no good reason to suppose an active and passive
                    intellect, they yet came nearer the truth in holding the mind to be, in
                    sensation, partly passive and partly active, than the moderns in affirming it to
                    be purely passive. Sensation, imagination, memory, and judgment, have, by the
                    vulgar, in all ages, been considered as acts of the mind. The manner in wh’ich
                    they are expressed in all languages shows this; for when the mind is much
                    employed in them, we say it is very active, whereas if they were impressions
                    only, we ought to say that the mind is very passive.” All this is undeniable;
                    but if sensation necessarily precede perception, and if in sensation the mind be
                    active, what becomes of the assertion that in perception it does not act at all?
                    Indeed we may appeal to the common sense of mankind, whether any thing can be
                    perceived without some mental energy of the percipient. For when the impressions
                    made upon the external senses are faint, in order to be conscious of them an
                    evident exertion is requisite, not of the organ only, but also of the mind, as
                    in perceiving very remote objects and sounds; but when the impressions arc
                    stronger, the perception is involuntary and unavoidable, as has been already
                    explained in the preceding section.</p>
                <p>It being thus certain that in perception the mind both acts and is acted upon,
                    and it being universally acknowledged that nothing can act where it is not, we
                    feel ourselves compelled to admit, with the Cartesians, that in perception the
                    conviction of the present existence of external objects is not original and
                    instinctive, but the consequence of an early and unavoidable association of
                    certain sensations with the causes which produce them. In this opinion we are
                    still more confirmed by the well-known fact, that particular pressures upon the
                    organ, nerves, and brain, excite not only sensations, but even <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> perceptions of objects apparently external, when no
                    such objects are within the reach of our senses. Thus,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hartley’s Observations on Man.</p></note> if
                    a man in the dark press either corner of his eye with his finger, he will see a
                    circle of colours like those in the feather of a peacock’s tail, though no such
                    external object be before him, and though the room be so dark that nothing
                    external could possibly be discerned. Again, if a burning coal be nimbly moved
                    round in a circle, with gyrations continually repeated, the whole circumference
                    of the circle will at once appear on fire, though it is certain that there can
                    really be no fire but in one portion of that circumference, equal in length to
                    the diameter of the coal. These are facts known to all mankind, and they are
                    perfectly irreconcileable with the supposition, that the perception of external
                    objects by the sense of sight is original and instinctive; but they are at once
                    accounted for, if it be true that rays of light falling from external objects
                    upon the <hi rend="italic">tunica retina</hi> agitate the optic nerves and
                    brain, and that such agitations excite sensations in the mind which experience
                    has taught us to refer to external objects, as, under God, their ultimate
                    cause.</p>
                <p>But although we have declared ourselves to be in this instance Cartesians, we do
                    not admit all the absurdities which have sometimes been imputed to that system
                    of perception. We do not believe that external objects are perceived by means of
                    images of them in the mind or the brain; nor do we think that Descartes or Locke
                    has anywhere affirmed that they are, otherwise than by an expression obviously
                    figurative, denoting, not that the actual shapes of things are delineated in the
                    brain or upon the mind, but only that impressions of some kind or other are
                    conveyed to the brain by means of the organs of sense and their corresponding
                    nerves; and that between these impressions and the sensations excited in the
                    mind, there is a real, and in our present state a necessary, though unknown,
                    connection.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As the view
                    here given of the opinions entertained by Descartes and Locke in regard to the
                    nature of <hi rend="italic">Ideas</hi> is altogether erroneous, we think it
                    right to refer, for sounder information, to the profound and elaborate article
                    on the <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Perception,</hi> contained in the52d

                    Edition.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>Upon the whole, we think that there is good evidence for believing, that in
                    perception the process of nature is the following: First, if the object be not
                    in contact with the organ of sense, there must be some medium which passes
                    between them; as, in vision, the rays of light; in hearing, the vibrations of
                    elastic air; and in smelling, the effluvia of the body smelled; otherwise we
                    have neither sensation nor perception. Secondly, there must be some action or
                    impression upon the organ of sense, either by the immediate application of the
                    object, as in the two senses of touch and taste; or by the medium interposed
                    between them, as in the other three senses. Thirdly, the nerves which go from
                    the brain to the organ must receive some impression by means of that which was
                    made upon the organ; and by means of these nerves that impression must be
                    carried to the brain. Fourthly, the impression made upon the organs, nerves, and
                    brain, rouses the dormant energy of the mind; and this double action of the mind
                    and the object produces a sensation. And, lastly, as we know by experience that
                    the mind alone cannot, by any exertion of its own, produce one sensation, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194207726" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7726-0608"/> and are
                    intuitively certain that nothing can begin to exist without a cause, we infer
                    from the existence of any new sensation the existence of some other cause than
                    the internal energy of the mind from which that sensation proceeds; and this
                    cause experience teaches us to be the external object. This process is carried
                    on so rapidly, and the several parts of it, by being continually repeated, are
                    so closely associated, that, except by a reflex act of the mind, we do not
                    distinguish them from one another, and therefore denominate the whole <hi

                <p>It is with extreme diffidence that we advance a doctrine which Dr Reid has
                    controverted; but he differs from us only in the last stage of the process,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Inauiry into the Human
                    Mind, 4th edit p. 383.</p></note> where he supposes sensation and perception to
                    be two simple and independent acts of the mind. Yet he sometimes expresses
                    himself as if he thought, as we do, that in perception the belief of the present
                    existence of external objects is rather the result of experience, than an
                    instinctive persuasion. Thus, speaking of the perception which we have in
                    smelling a rose, he says,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man, essay ii. chap. xv. and
                    xxi.</p></note> “Perception has always an external object, and the object of my
                    perception in this case is that quality in the rose which I discern by the sense
                    of smell. Observing that the agreeable sensation is raised when the rose is
                    near, and ceases when it is removed, I am led by my nature [we think <hi
                    rend="italic">by experience</hi> would have been more proper] to conclude some
                    quality to be in the rose, which is the cause of this sensation. This quality in
                    the rose is the object perceived; and that act of my mind, by which I have the
                    conviction and belief of this quality, is what in this case I call perception.”
                    Again, he says that “three of our senses, viz. smell, taste, and hearing,
                    originally give us only certain sensations, and a conviction that these
                    sensations are occasioned by some external object. We give a name to that
                    quality of the object by which it is fitted to produce such a sensation, and
                    connect that quality with the object and with its other qualities. Thus we
                    learn, that a certain sensation of smell is produced by a rose; and that quality
                    in the rose by which it is fitted to produce this sensation we call the smell of
                    the rose. Here it is evident that the sensation is original. The perception that
                    the rose has that quality which we call its <hi rend="italic">smell,</hi> is
                    acquired.”</p>
                <p>To this doctrine no Cartesian could reasonably object; for it is the very account
                    which Descartes himself would have given of perception by the organ of smell, as
                    it resolves such a perception into an early association between a certain
                    sensation and that external quality fYom which we know by experience that the
                    sensation proceeds. Indeed this excellent author repeatedly affirms that every
                    different perception is conjoined with a sensation which is proper to it; and
                    that the one is the sign, and the other the thing signified. He likewise
                    douhts<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>E ssays on the
                    Intellectual Powers of Man.</p></note> whether children, from the time that they
                    begin to use their senses, make a distinction between things which are only
                    conceived or imagined, and things which really exist. But if the conviction of
                    the present existence of external objects were in perception <hi rend="italic"
                    >instinctive,</hi> we cannot see how there could be room for such a doubt; for
                    the mere senses of children are as perfect as those of full-grown men, and they
                    know well the difference between actually sucking their nurses and only thinking
                    of that operation, though they be not capable of expressing that difference in
                    language.</p>
                <p>But if in perception our conviction of the present existence of external objects
                    be not instinctive, what, it may be asked, is the evidence that such objects
                    really exist? This question we shall partly answer in the following section, and
                    more completely when we come to examine Berkeley’s theory of the non-existence
                    of matter; but, from what has already been said, it is sufficiently evident,
                    that every sensation compels us to believe in the present existence of something
                    different from ourselves, as well as from our sensations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Objects of each
                    Sense respectively.</hi></p>
                <p>Hitherto we have considered sensation and perception in general, and shown that
                    it is not by instinct that we perceive the existence of external objects. This
                    will appear more clearly, if we can ascertain the precise nature of that
                    information which each sense affords us; and in order to this, we shall begin
                    with the sense of touch, not only because it is that which is certainly first
                    exercised, but also because there is a meaning, in which all the others may be
                    resolved into it.</p>
                <p>By means of touch we perceive many things, of which the chief are, heat and cold,
                    hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, extension, figure, solidity,
                    and motion. Of these perceptions, some are immediate; and others, as we are
                    persuaded, early associations, which may be resolved into a process of
                    reasoning. The perceptions of heat and cold are immediate. When a person for the
                    first time in his life approaches the fire, he feels heat; and when he is first
                    exposed to the frost, he feels cold. What then are heat and cold, and where do
                    they reside? They are obviously the reverse of each other; but are they external
                    objects, or mere sensations in the mind? They are undoubtedly sensations which
                    have no existence but when they are felt. To every man not altogether a stranger
                    to these speculations, this proposition is self-evident; but to the bulk of the
                    people it appears an extravagant paradox. To make it plain, however, to the
                    meanest capacity, it is sufficient to observe, that at a certain distance the
                    fire has no perceptible influence upon any person; if that distance be lessened,
                    we feel an agreeable warmth; approach a little nearer, and the warmth becomes
                    disagreeable; and, still nearer, it will rise to pain. No man supposes the pain
                    inflicted by a sword to exist in the sword, or anywhere else but in a sentient
                    being. It is equally absurd to suppose pain to exist in fire, or anywhere else
                    but in a sentient being. But that which at one ' distance is pain, at another is
                    only agreeable warmth; and since warmth and pain are only different degrees of
                    the same feeling, it is equally absurd to suppose the one, as the other, in the
                    fire. What then is the object of sense when we feel heat? There is obviously no
                    object whatever beyond the present sensation.</p>
                <p>But has the sensation of heat no cause independent of us? Undoubtedly it has, and
                    experience teaches ns that the cause is in the fire. We know that we cannot
                    produce the sensation of heat in ourselves by any mental energy of our own; and
                    we are intuitively certain that nothing can begin to exist without some cause. A
                    man upon the top a mountain covered with snow may imagine or remember what he
                    felt when in the neighbourhood of fire, and thus have in his mind what is called
                    an idea of heat; but that idea will not warm him like the actual sensation,
                    which no exertion of his own can in such circumstances produce. When he leaves
                    the mountain, however, and approaches the fire, he feels the sensation actually
                    produced as often as he makes the experiment. He is, therefore, under the
                    necessity of inferring, that in the fire there is some power or quality which,
                    acting either mediately or immediately upon his sense of touch, excites the
                    feeling <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207739" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7739-0609"/>which
                    is called <hi rend="italic">heat.</hi> What that power is, we shall perhaps
                    never be able to discover; but it is self-evident, that it is neither heat nor
                    the resemblance of heat, though in vulgar language it is known by that name.</p>
                <p>The same reasoning holds good with respect to cold. There is at certain times,
                    and in certain countries, some power in the air which congeals water and causes
                    cold; but that power is as different from the sensation of cold, as the power of
                    fire is different from the sensation of heat, or the point of a sword from a
                    flesh wound..</p>
                <p>By the sense of touch we perceive extension, figure, ‘solidity, &amp;c.; but we
                    do not perceive them immediately, as we perceive heat and cold, for extension,
                    figure, and solidity are not sensations. Those perceptions, then, must be
                    acquired; and to ascertain more clearly the manner in which we acquire them, let
                    us suppose a man from his birth destitute of the sense of sight and the power of
                    local motion, but possessed of intellect and every other faculty which we enjoy.
                    Such a person, it is obvious, would be capable of every sensation and perception
                    which is original to us, except the perception of colours; but we doubt whether
                    it would be possible to give him perceptions of extension, figure, and solidity.
                    Let us try; and as he cannot move a single limb or member of himself, let us
                    suppose a solid substance of small dimensions to be gently pressed against any
                    part of his body. What would such pressure communicate to him? We think it could
                    communicate nothing but a new sensation, to which, as it is neither pleasing nor
                    painful, no name has hitherto been given, except the general one of <hi
                    rend="italic">feeling.</hi> This sensation he would not know whether to refer to
                    an external or internal cause, or rather he could have no notion whatever of an
                    external cause, though he would at the same time be conscious that the new
                    sensation was not excited by any energy of his own will. Were the pressure to be
                    gradually increased till it rose to pain, our blind man would still be conscious
                    of nothing but a sensation, which could not lead him to the notion of extension,
                    figure, or solidity, because mere sensations cannot be conceived as either solid
                    or extended. Let us next suppose the pressure to be applied successively to
                    different parts of his body; he would now indeed be conscious of successive
                    sensations, but he could not assign to them either extension or place; for it
                    has been already shown that the external parts of the body are not themselves
                    sentient, and it shall be shown afterwards, that to a man who has never
                    perceived motion, place is absolutely inconceivable. Lastly, let us suppose the
                    dimensions of the pressing substance to be greatly enlarged; what would then
                    follow? Nothing, we apprehend, but an increase of pain; for though his whole
                    body were pressed <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">extra,</hi> the
                    pressure could affect the individual being which is sentient, not more
                    extensively, but only more violently. It appears, therefore, that a man blind
                    from his birth, and destitute of the power of local motion, could never be made
                    to perceive extension, figure, or solidity.</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose this man to receive by a miracle the use of his limbs, and to
                    be suddenly prompted, by some instinctive impulse, to arise and walk. As long as
                    he met with no obstacle in his way, he would not, we apprehend, acquire by this
                    exercise any correct notions of extension or figure; but were a stone or log of
                    wood of considerable dimensions to be laid across his usual walk, the case would
                    soon be altered. He would feel himself interrupted in his course, and he would
                    at the same instant recognise his wonted sensations of touch. After being twice
                    or thrice thus interrupted, he would learn from experience that the interruption
                    or resistance proceeded from the same cause which in this instance communicated
                    to him the sensation of feeling; and were he to run his hand along the surface
                    of the los or stone, he would perceive the resistance and the sensation
                    continued. As every effect must have an adequate cause, this continued
                    resistance would compel him to believe the continuity of something external in
                    every direction in which he felt his hand resisted; but such continuity of being
                    is all that is meant by the word extension. At the very same time, and by the
                    very same means, he would gradually acquire the perception of figure; for, by
                    running his hand in every direction over the surface of the obstacle which
                    opposed him, he would soon perceive it on all sides limited; but the limits of
                    extension is a phrase of precisely the same import with figure. It appears,
                    therefore, that without the power of local motion, men could never, by the sense
                    of touch, acquire the notions of extension and figure; and the same will be
                    found to be the case with respect to hardness and softness.</p>
                <p>When we press oπr hand gently against a stock or a stone, we feel a sensation
                    which is neither painful nor pleasing. When we press it more violently, the
                    sensation becomes painful, and we experience in the object a resistance which we
                    have not power to overcome. When we press butter or pomatum very gently, we have
                    a sensation in all respects similar to that which we felt when we gently touched
                    the stock or the stone. But when we press the butter with violence, we feel no
                    pain, and experience little resistance; for the parts of which it is composed
                    give way before the hand, though the parts of the stock or the stone remain
                    fixed and immoveable·. That the parts of one body should thus resist a pressure
                    to which the parts of another so readily yield, must proceed from some
                    difference in the texture of the two bodies; for by the sense of touch we
                    perceive the effects to be different, and are therefore certain that they must
                    proceed either from different causes, or from the same cause operating with
                    different degrees of force. That particular texture which makes the parts of a
                    stone resist the pressure of touch, we call hardness; and the texture which
                    makes the parts of butter or pomatum give way to touch, we call softness. But
                    what hardness and softness are in themselves, touch cannot inform us; for they
                    are neither sensations, nor similar to sensations. We acquire, however, by
                    experience, so complete notions of hardness and softness, that every one who
                    understands the English language perfectly knows the meaning of these words as
                    soon as he hears them; and when he is told that one body is hard and another
                    soft, he knows with absolute certainty that the meaning of the assertion is,
                    that the parts of the body which is said to be hard are held together by some
                    unknown causé operating forcibly, and that the parts of the other are held
                    together by the same or a similar cause operating with less force.</p>
                <p>We acquire the notions of roughness and smoothness in the very same way and by
                    the very same means that we acquire ideas of extension and figure. To describe
                    the process at large would certainly be superfluous; for if what we have said
                    concerning our perceptions of extension and figure be just and intelligible,
                    every one will, without further assistance, discover for himself how he
                    perceives roughness and smoothness. <hi rend="italic">Motion</hi> shall be
                    considered amongst the adjuncts of body; but in order to understand what body
                    itself is, it will be necessary, before we dismiss the sense of touch, to
                    inquire how we come by the notion of solidity.</p>
                <p>Solidity is one of those notions, or, in the language of Locke, one of those
                    ideas, which are commonly said to be acquired by the sense of touch. That touch
                    gives the first hint towards our notion of solidity is certainly true, but that
                    hint must be afterwards improved by the intellect, or we never could have an
                    adequate knowledge of what is meant when any thing is said to be absolutely
                    solid. We know by experience that we can at pleasure open <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194207752" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7752-0610"/>and shut our empty hand
                    without meeting with any resistance. We know likewise, that when we grasp an
                    ivory ball of three or four inches diameter, no force which we can exert will
                    bring together the several parts of the hand, which were easily brought together
                    when we grasped nothing. In this way do we acquire our first notion of solidity,
                    for the word denotes nothing more in this instance than the power or property of
                    the ball by rvhich our fingers are excluded from the place which it occupies.
                    Solidity differs from hardness in this respect, that hardness results from the
                    strong cohesion of the parts of a hard body, which renders it difficult to
                    change the places of those parts, as they respect one another; whereas solidity
                    respects the whole mass, and is as essential a quality of water as of adamant. A
                    drop of water, indeed, placed between two plain surfaces of marble, will not,
                    like adamant, preclude their contact, because the parts of a drop of water,
                    cohering but loosely to one another, give way to the pressure, and escape in
                    every lateral direction. But if a drop of water be confined on all sides, as in
                    a globe of gold, we know from experience that no force will bring the sides of
                    the globe together without forcing the water through the pores of the metal, and
                    hence we infer solidity to be essential to every eorporeal substance.</p>
                <p>Thus, then, it appears, that of the objects perceived by touch, not one is
                    immediately perceived except heat, cold, and other sensations. The sensations,
                    as they are not excited by any internal energy of our own, lead us indeed to
                    something external as their cause; and by comparing the different sensations
                    with each other, and observing what effects their external causes have upon our
                    own motions, we are naturally led to conceive these causes as extended, figured,
                    solid, hard or soft, rough or smooth; but it is obvious that this conception is
                    the result of experience, and a process of mental reasoning.</p>
                <p>On the senses of taste, smell, and hearing, it is needless to say much. The
                    immediate objects of these are· confessedly sensations which have no existence
                    but when they are perceived, though experience teaches us to refer them all to
                    externa] objects as their respective causes. With respect to smell, this has
                    been made sufficiently evident in the preceding section; and it is not less
                    evident with respect to taste and hearing.</p>
                <p>Certain bodies applied to the tongue and the palate, and moistened with the
                    saliva, excite certain sensations, which we call tastes. These sensations,
                    however, are not in the bodies, nor can they have any existence but in a
                    sentient being. They are produced in consequence of impulses on the nerves of
                    the tongue and palate, exciting certain agitations in the brain; but the
                    sensation itself is neither impulse nor agitation. Some substances excite tastes
                    which are agreeable, and others such as are disagreeable, and there are not a
                    few which excite no taste at all. Bodies which applied to the tongue and palate
                    of one man produce tastes that are agreeable, applied to the same organs of
                    another man give him tastes which are disagreeable; and we have all experienced,
                    that the same substance which, when the organs are sound, excites a sweet or
                    pleasant taste, has, when the organs were disordered, excited a taste which was
                    bitter or unpleasant. These facts, which cannot be controverted, afford the
                    fullest evidence, if evidence were rvanted, that taste, as we feel it, is no
                    quality of bodies, nor has any existence out of the mind.</p>
                <p>The organ of hearing is the <hi rend="italic">ear,</hi> and its object is <hi
                    rend="italic">sound.</hi> It is well known that sound is produced by certain
                    vibrations of the air striking the tympanum of the ear, and that these
                    vibrations are caused by the sonorous body. Sound, however, is not vibration,
                    nor the idea of sound the idea of vibration. Sound considered by itself is a
                    mere sensation, which can have no existence but in a sentient being. We know by
                    experience that it is caused by something external, but we know likewise that
                    the effect has no resemblance to the cause. Previously to experience we could
                    not refer sound to any external cause, far less could we discern whether it
                    proceeded from an object above us or below us, on our right hand or on our left.
                    It appears to us self-evident, that if a man born deaf were suddenly made to
                    hear, he would consider his first sensation of sound as originating wholly
                    within himself. Between that sensation and the sensations of touch, taste,
                    smell, and sight, there is no resemblance, nor are there any relations amongst
                    them, which, previously to experience, could induce him to trace them all to
                    external objects as their several causes. Our deaf man might have learned to
                    refer all his other sensations to their true causes, in some such way as we have
                    described under the sense of touch; but sound would be something so new to him,
                    and so totally different from touch, taste, and smell, that he could attribute
                    it to nothing external.</p>
                <p>Experience, however, would soon teach him that the ear is its organ, and the
                    sonorous body its cause; and he would in time learn to distinguish one sound,
                    that of a trumpet, for instance, from another, suppose the sound of a bell, and
                    to attribute each to its proper cause, even when neither the trumpet nor the
                    bell was perceived by his other senses. With respect to sounds which we have
                    been accustomed to hear, this is done so instantaneously, that some philosophers
                    have imagined it to be the effect of an instinctive principle in our nature,
                    totally different from experience, and independent of reason. But the fact is
                    not so. Long before we are capable of making sensation and perception objects of
                    reflection, we have heard the sound produced by the ringing of a bell, and seen
                    the object which produced the sound, so often, that, when we hear a similar
                    sound again, we instantly refer it to a <hi rend="italic">bell,</hi> though we
                    see not the bell from which it proceeds; but this is the effect of habit, and
                    not of instinct. Had we never perceived a bell whilst ringing, by either of our
                    senses of sight or touch, we could not by the sense of hearing acquire any
                    notion of the figure or texture of the body from which the cause of the sound
                    proceeds, though we had heard that sound every day of our lives. It is, indeed,
                    by experience only that we learn to distinguish by the ear whether a sonorous
                    body be before or behind us, on our right hand or on our left; for we find it
                    always difficult to say from what precise quarter a strange sound proceeds, and
                    this difficulty would be heightened to impossibility had not all sounds
                    something in common. Dr Sparrman relates, that when he first heard the roaring
                    of a lion, he did not know on what side of him to apprehend danger, as the sound
                    seemed to proceed from the ground, and to en-elose a circle of which he and his
                    companions stood in the centre. The same thing has happened to every man, when
                    the sound was such as he had never heard before, even though it was neither so
                    loud nor so terrific as the roaring of a lion in a desert wilderness; but with
                    respect to sounds which we are daily hearing on every side of us, we soon learn
                    to distinguish with tolerable accuracy whether they be before or behind us,
                    above or below, on our right hand or on our left. All this, however, is the
                    effect, not of instinct, but of experience improved into habit.</p>
                <p>Sight is justly considered as the noblest and most comprehensive of all our
                    senses. The reason is obvious; for <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> when a
                    full-grown man opens his eyes, he perceives houses, trees, rivers, the earth,
                    sun, moon, stars, &amp;c. and to each of these objects belong figure, extension,
                    colour, &amp;c. which are all perceived instantly by means of this sense. Yet it
                    is certain that the sense of sight does not originally communicate to us so many
                    perceptions; and there is abundant evidence that an infant cannot at first, or
                    for some weeks after its birth, distinguish by vision one object from <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194207765" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7765-0611"/> another. Colour
                    is the proper object of sight, and for some time its only object; but colour, as
                    perceived by us, is a mere sensation, which can have no existence but in a
                    sentient being. If this proposition stood in need of proof, we might observe
                    that there are men, and even whole families, who possess the sense of sight in a
                    degree of perfection sufficient for all the purposes of life, and yet cannot
                    distinguish certain colours from each other, blue, for instance, from green, or
                    perhaps from red; and there is no man who can distinguish between some
                    particular shades of blue and green by the feeble light of a candle. Were
                    colours the real qualities of body, this mistake of one for another could never
                    be experienced. No man who possesses the sense of touch ever confounded hardness
                    with softness, a sphere with a cube, or an ell with an inch. The reason is, that
                    hardness and softness, figure and extension, are the qualities of things
                    external; whereas colour being a mere sensation, is nothing but an affection or
                    modification of the sentient being. But it is obvious that sentient beings,
                    according as they differ from one another, may be differently affected by the
                    same external cause, so that one man may perceive that to be green which all
                    other men perceive to be blue. The immediate external cause of the sensation of
                    colour is the rays of light reflected from the body, which in common language is
                    said to be coloured. These rays, falling upon the pupil of the eye, are
                    refracted differently, according as their incidence is more or less oblique,
                    into points on the retina, where they form a picture of the external object; and
                    from the picture, by means of the optic nerve, is communicated to the brain some
                    impulse or agitation, which produces vision, or the perception of colour. As
                    rays of light are corporeal substances, it is obvious that they can act upon
                    body only by impulse; but between impulse and the various sensations of red,
                    green, blue, yellow, &amp;c. there is no resemblance. (For the laws of
                    reflection and refraction, and for the structure of the eye, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Optics</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy.)</hi> That which
                    we have to inquire into at present is, how we learn, by means of the sense of
                    sight, to perceive the figure, magnitude, motion, and distance of external
                    objects, or indeed to distinguish one object from another.</p>
                <p>A ray of light proceeding, as all rays do, in a straight line, must, however
                    great its length, affect the eye, retina, and optic nerve, as if it were a
                    single point. From this obvious and undeniable fact Bishop Berkeley
                    predicted,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Essay towards
                    a New Theory of Vision.</p></note> that a man born blind, who should be suddenly
                    made to see, would at first perceive nothing without him, would distinguish
                    neither the distance, size, figure, nor situation, of external objects; that he
                    would only see in his eyes themselves, or, to speak more properly, would only
                    experience new modifications in his mind, until, joining touch to sight, he thus
                    formed a communication with the external world, and learned, by the simultaneous
                    exercise of the two senses, that natural language in which the visible is the
                    sign of the tangible. This truth, which was discovered by the bishop merely by
                    contemplating in his own mind the nature of sensation, and the known laws of
                    optics, after having been laughed at for more than twenty years as one of the
                    many dreams of a visionary genius, was completely confirmed by the case of the
                    famous patient whom Cheselden cured of a cataract, and that, too, though the
                    cataract does not produce total blindness; which makes it evident that the first
                    visual perceptions of the patient after his recovery could not be wholly new and
                    unmixed. It may indeed be confirmed at any time by a simple experiment made upon
                    an infant. For several weeks after birth, a child shuts not its eyes upon the
                    sudden approach of an object to them, nor shows the least symptom of
                    distinguishing one distance from another; and it is easy, by a little attention,
                    to observe how it gradually learns to distinguish objects at greater and greater
                    distances. Indeed colour, or the immediate object of sight, being a mere
                    sensation or affection of the mind, can have no natural relation whatsoever to
                    any thing external.</p>
                <p>It is plain, therefore, that distance is in its own nature imperceptible to the
                    eye, and yet it is often perceived by sight. How is this done? We think, in the
                    following manner. Distance is one mode of extension, which, as we have already
                    seen, is perceived by means of touch. Of short distances, our first ideas are
                    doubtless acquired by the stretching out and drawing back of our arms; and these
                    ideas are soon so connected with certain sensations which we have in actual
                    vision, that the latter instantly suggests the former. Thus it is a fact known
                    by experience, that when we look at a near object with both eyes, according as
                    it approaches or recedes from us, we alter the disposition of our eyes, by
                    lessening or widening the interval between the pupils. This disposition or turn
                    of the eye is attended with a sensation of which every man is conscious at the
                    time of vision; and this sensation seems to us to be that which in this case
                    suggests the idea of greater or less distance to the mind. Not that there is any
                    natural or necessary connection between the sensation of which we are conscious,
                    and greater or less distance; for the sensation is wholly internal, and the
                    distance is external: but, because the mind has, by constant experience, found
                    the different sensations occasioned by different dispositions of the eyes to
                    correspond to different degrees of distance in the object, there has grown a
                    habitual or customary connection between those sensations and the notions of
                    greater or less distance. Hence the mind no sooner perceives the sensation
                    arising from the different turn it gives the eyes in order to bring the pupils
                    nearer or farther asunder, than it is instantly impressed with a certain notion
                    of the distance which was wont to be connected with that sensation. Again, an
                    object placed at a certain distance from the eye, to which the breadth of the
                    pupil bears a sensible proportion, being made to approach nearer, is seen more
                    confusedly; and the nearer it is brought, the confusion is always the greater.
                    The reason of all this is known to every optician; but it being constantly
                    experienced by those who never dipped into optics, there arises in the mind of
                    every man an habitual connection between the several degrees of confusion and
                    distance, the greater confusion still implying the less distance, and the less
                    confusion the greater distance. It is of no avail to say, that between confused
                    vision and distance, great or small, there is no necessary connection; for there
                    is as little connection between a blush in the face and the mental feeling of
                    shame, and yet no sooner does a man of observation perceive that particular
                    colour in the face of another, than it suggests to him the notion of that
                    feeling or passion with which he has constantly observed it accompanied.</p>
                <p>In these ways, however, we perceive only small distances. Of distances more
                    remote our judgment is formed from other data, and happily these data are not
                    far to seek. It is a fact known to every man who is not totally ignorant of the
                    science of optics, that a greater number of rays fall upon the eye when
                    reflected from a body near at hand, than can fall from the same body at a
                    distance; and as these rays operate by impulse, it is self-evident that the
                    impression must be stronger, and of course the sensation or colour more vivid,
                    when the body is near than when it is distant. Now, having acquired the notion
                    of the true distance of objects by motion and by the sense of touch, and
                    finding, by an uniform experience, that as they are near or far off, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194207778" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7778-0612"/> the sensation or
                    colour which they excite in the mind through the organ of vision is more or less
                    vivid, these degrees of sensation come to be so closely associated with the
                    respective distances of the object, that the one instantly suggests the
                    other.</p>
                <p>It is just so that we perceive figure by sight. Having experienced by the sense
                    of touch that one surface is a square and another a circle, that one body is a
                    cube and another a sphere; and finding our sense of sight differently affected
                    by the square and the circle, by the cube and the sphere; these different
                    affections come to be so closely connected in our minds with the figures of the
                    respective bodies, that, long before we are capable of reasoning on the subject,
                    the one is never present to us without suggesting the other. Nay, so complete in
                    this case is the connection or association, that we cannot even in idea abstract
                    the colour from the figure, though it is certain that colour is a mere
                    sensation, and figure an external quality; that colour alone is immediately
                    perceivable by the eye, and the notion of figure suggested by the colour. We are
                    aware that it has been affirmed, and affirmed with great vehemence, that figures
                    of two dimensions are immediately perceived by the eye, and perceived with
                    greater accuracy than by the sense of touch. But they who insist upon this
                    doctrine affirm likewise, contrary to experience and the clearest reasoning,
                    that the immediate objects of sight are external, and that colour is a quality
                    of bodies. In the arguments, too, by which they support their hypothesis, they
                    seem to confound sight as an affection of the mind, with the picture on the
                    bottom of the eye, as if the retina were the sentient being; whereas the retina
                    and the picture are no more than instruments of sensation. It is indeed a fact
                    that the picture has the same figure nearly with the plane of the object which
                    is presented to the eye; as when the object seen is a sphere, the picture is a
                    circle variously shaded in colour. It is likewise a fact that the picture is
                    enlarged in proportion as the object is brought near, and diminished as it is
                    carried to a distance. But these facts are known only to persons who are skilled
                    in optics; and therefore it is evident, that though calculations may be raised
                    from them by mathematicians to determine the distance and figure of external
                    objects, they cannot possibly be the data from which distance and figure are
                    inferred by the vulgar, who know not that such pictures on the retina exist. And
                    besides all this, it is universally known that a painter, by laying on his
                    colours properly, can make a plain square surface appear to the eye in certain
                    positions as an oblong or as a cube, and a plain circular surface as a concave
                    or a convex hemisphere. But not one of these things could possibly be done were
                    figure, or indeed any thing else than colour, the immediate object of
                    vision.</p>
                <p>As we see distance and figure, so we see magnitude; and we see both in the same
                    way that we see shame or anger in the looks of a man. The impression made upon
                    the bottom of the eye by rays reflected from a large magnitude, must necessarily
                    be different from the impression made by rays reflected from a magnitude that is
                    less. This is self-evident; and since the impression <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi><hi rend="italic">extra</hi> is in some way or other the cause of that
                    sensation, which is all of which we are originally conscious in vision, it is
                    obvious that the sensation, like every other effect, must correspond to the
                    cause from which it proceeds. Being therefore conscious of different sensations,
                    and having, at an earlier period than we distinctly remember, learned by
                    experience to refer them to different magnitudes, no sooner is each sensation
                    excited than it suggests the notion, or, if you please, the perception, of that
                    magnitude with which it is connected. So completely is this association fixed in
                    the mind, that when we look at a known object, its real magnitude appears to be
                    as instantly observed as its colour, whilst <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> we
                    hardly attend at all to the particularity of the sensation by which the
                    magnitude is suggested. It is, indeed, customary with writers on optics to
                    distinguish between tangible and visible magnitude, as if any kind of magnitude
                    were the immediate object of vision. But this is not so; for magnitude is
                    something external, whereas the immediate object of vision is a mere sensation.
                    What has introduced into science this mode of speaking is probably the fact,
                    that, as we approach a distant object, it appears to the eye larger and larger
                    at every step, and less and less as we recede from it; whereas the tangible
                    magnitude of an object remains always the same. The reason of this apparent
                    change of magnitude to the eye, according to the distance at which any
                    particular object is viewed, is, that from a near object rays of light fall in
                    greater numbers and more diverging than from the same object viewed at a
                    distance. This of course alters the nature of the visible sensation. Each common
                    sensation is in the mind closely linked with a particular notion of magnitude;
                    and by the exercise of sight and touch we have learned from experience that the
                    particular sensation caused by diverging rays must be referred to a larger
                    magnitude than that which is caused by parallel rays proceeding from the same
                    distance.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, then, we think ourselves entitled to conclude, that the proper
                    and original objects of vision constitute an universal language of the Author of
                    Nature, by which we are instructed how to regulate our actions, in order to
                    attain those things which are necessary to the preservation and well-being of
                    our bodies, as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful or destructive to them. It
                    is principally by the information of this language that we are guided in all the
                    transactions and concerns of life; and the manner in which it signifies and
                    marks to us the objects which are at a distance, is similar to that of languages
                    and signs of human appointment, which do not suggest the things signified by any
                    likeness or identity of nature, but only by a habitual connection, which
                    experience has made us to observe, between them. This language of the eye, like
                    the language of the tongue, suggests by one sensation what may be resolved into
                    a variety of perceptions. A tree is composed of a trunk, branches, leaves; it
                    has colour, figure, size; and all these things are at once suggested to the mind
                    by the two words <hi rend="italic">spreading oak.</hi> Just so it is with
                    respect to vision; the sensation received by the eye suggests at once the trunk,
                    branches, leaves, colour, figure, and size of the oak, and suggests them all as
                    the qualities of one object.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II.—OF RETENTION AND IDEAS.</p>
                <p>From the experiment with the burning coal already mentioned, it is apparent the
                    sensations excited through the eye, together with their corresponding
                    perceptions, remain in the mind for a short time after the external exciting
                    cause is removed. The same thing appears from another experiment, which was
                    first made by Sir Isaac Newton, and which every man may repeat for his own
                    satisfaction. It is universally known,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hartley on Man.</p></note> that a proper mixture of the
                    seven original colours, red, yellow, green, blue, &amp;c. constitutes that
                    uniform appearance which we call white. But when these colours are made to pass
                    in rapid succession before the eye, they excite the very same perception as when
                    they are properly mixed, which is a satisfactory proof that the impression made
                    by each separate colour remains in the brain until a revolution of all the
                    colours is completed; <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207791"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7791-0613"/>for nothing but the impression of all the colours
                    at once can produce the sensation and perception of white. Indeed no person
                    capable of paying the proper attention to these things can keep his eye fixed
                    upon a luminous object, and afterwards shut it, without experiencing that the
                    sensation and perception remain for some time after the external object is shut
                    out, and that they go off gradually till they leave behind them the mental
                    appearance, which is properly called an idea of the object.</p>
                <p>The same continuance of the sensation after the removal of its cause is equally
                    observable in the sense of hearing; for every sound which we hear is reflected
                    by the neighbouring bodies, and therefore consists in reality of a variety of
                    sounds succeeding each other at different distances of time, according to the
                    distances of the several reflecting bodies. Yet this causes no confusion or
                    apparent complexity of sound, unless when the distance of the reflecting bodies
                    is very considerable, as in spacious buildings.</p>
                <p>With respect to the continuance of the sensation of touch, doubts have been
                    started; but for these there is as little room as for doubts as to the
                    continuance of the sensations of seeing and hearing. The continuance of heat
                    after the heating body is removed, and of the smart of a wound after the instant
                    of infliction, are proofs that every sensation of touch does not vanish with its
                    cause. A man unused to the motion of a ship or coach, after having been a day at
                    sea or on the road, feels or imagines he feels the rolling of the ship or the
                    jolting of the coach after he is in bed and actually at rest. Of these facts we
                    know not what other account can be given, than that the agitation in the brain,
                    which is the immediate cause of the sensation of touch, remains for some time
                    after the external cause of the agitation is removed.</p>
                <p>As to the senses of taste and smell, Dr Hartley seems to think that there is no
                    clear and direct evidence for the continuance of their sensations after their
                    proper objects are removed; but in this instance the ingenious author does not
                    do justice to his own theory. Let any man eat onions, garlic, or any other thing
                    of a very pungent taste, and immediately wash his mouth with fresh water, so
                    that he may be sure no part of the sapid body remains on his tongue or palate.
                    According to this doctrine, the taste of the onion or garlic should instantly
                    vanish with its object; but the fact is otherwise. Whoever shall make the
                    experiment, will find that the sensation remains a considerable time; not indeed
                    in its original force, but weakened no more than what it must necessarily be by
                    the introduction of a new sensation excited by the water. It is more difficult
                    to ascertain the permanency of smell; but analogy inclines us to believe, that
                    in this particular it resembles the other senses, though we know not how to
                    direct the reader to an experiment which will give him absolute conviction.</p>
                <p>Whether the cause of these continued sensations, after the removal of their
                    objects, be in the brain alone, in the mind alone considered as an immaterial
                    being, or in both together, is of very little importance; because, taking the
                    mind and its internal organs as one metaphysical whole,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See an Essay on the Reduction of the
                    Faculties of the Mind, by Μ. Schwab.</p></note> it matters not to our present
                    inquiry where this retentive power resides, as long as it can be proved to exist
                    within us. For it seems evident, that what has the faculty of retaining a
                    sensation when no longer acted upon by the object which excited it, must also
                    have a power to preserve the vestiges of that sensation, even after the
                    sensation itself shall be entirely obliterated. This is in fact the case with
                    the mind. When an object which we have once perceived is most remote from our
                    thoughts, we are certain that there is within us a capacity, disposition,
                    tendency, or power, by which a representation of that object may be at any time
                    revived and presented to the intellect. Thus the same inherent power of the mind
                    and its internal organs, which retains a sensation and perception in the absence
                    of the object by which they were excited, can also reproduce that perception, or
                    bring into the view of the intellect something exactly similar to it. The
                    reproduction will not indeed be so lively as the original perception when
                    accompanied with its corresponding sensation, because sensation and actual
                    perception are effected by a double cause, the action of the external object
                    upon the organ, nerves, and brain, and the corresponding energy of the mind or
                    sentient principle; whereas, in the reproduction, the mind seems to act solely
                    ,by its own power, and certainly without the assistance of external objects.
                    This reproductive power is commonly called <hi rend="italic">memory.</hi> By
                    many of the ancient philosophers, and by Μ. Schwab with one or two others
                    amongst the moderns, it is called imagination. We do not choose either to revive
                    antiquated modes of expression, or to introduce innovations of our own; but as
                    we cannot disapprove of the ancient phraseology, after the definitions which the
                    reader will by and by find of imagination, and memory, and recollection, as
                    given by Mr Harris, we have prefixed to this chapter the general title of
                    retention, which comprehends them all.</p>
                <p>When one recalls an object of sight by the power of memory, it appears to him
                    precisely the same as in the origi- <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> nal survey,
                    only less distinct, and witha conviction (which is perhaps the result of
                    experience) that the real object is not immediately before him. How is any
                    object recalled by the power of memory? Docs the man endeavour to form in his
                    mind a picture or representative image of the object? Let us listen to the
                    answers given by different philosophers to this question.</p>
                <p>The sentiments of the Peripatetics, as expressed by Alexander Aphrodisiensis, one
                    of the earliest commentators on Aristotle, are thus translated by Mr Harris in
                    his Hermes. “Now, what fancy or imagination is, we may explain as follows: We
                    may conceive to be formed within us, from the operation of the senses about
                    sensible objects, some impression (as it were) or picture in our original
                    sensorium, being a relict of that motion caused within us by the external
                    object; a relict which, when the external object is no longer present, remains,
                    and is still preserved, being as it were its image; and which, by being thus
                    preserved, becomes the cause of our having memory. Now such a sort of relict,
                    (and as it were) impression, they call fancy or imagination.” A passage from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Alcinous</hi> of Plato, as rendered into English by Dr
                    Reid,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Essavs on the
                    Intellectual Powers of Man.</p></note> shows that, in this theory, as well as in
                    that of perception, the Platonists agreed with the Peripatetics. “When the form
                    or type of things is imprinted on the mind by the organs of the senses, and so
                    imprinted as not to be deleted by time, but preserved firm and lasting, its
                    preservation is called <hi rend="italic">memory?</hi></p>
                <p>Mr Harris, who was deeply read in the ancient philosophy, and who considered the
                    authority of Aristotle and Plato as superseding all reasoning and all inquiry,
                    after justly observing, that if the soul had no other faculties than the senses,
                    it could never acquire the least idea of time, expresses himself thus on the
                    subject before us. “But, happily for us, we are not deserted here. We have, in
                    the first place, a faculty called imagination or fancy, which, however as to its
                    energies it may be subsequent to sense, yet is truly prior to it both in dignity
                    and use. This it is which retains the fleeting forms of things, when things
                    themselves are gone, and all sensation is at an end. That this faculty, however
                    connected with sense, is still perfectly different, may be seen from hence. We
                    have an imagination of things that are gone and extinct; but no such things <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194207804" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7804-0614"/> can be made
                    objects of sensation. We have an easy command over the objects of our
                    imagination, and can call them forth in almost what manner we please; but our
                    sensations are necessary when their objects are present, nor can we control them
                    except by removing either the objects or ourselves. As wax would not be adequate
                    to its business of signature, had it not a power to retain as well as receive,
                    the same holds of the <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> with respect to sense and
                    imagination. <hi rend="italic">Sense</hi> is its receptive power; <hi
                    rend="italic">imagination</hi> its retentive power. Had it sense without
                    imagination, it would not be as wax, but as water; where, though all impressions
                    may be instantly made, yet as soon as made they are entirely lost. Thus, then,
                    from a view of the two powers taken together, we may call <hi rend="italic"
                    >sense,</hi> if we please, a kind of transient imagination; and <hi
                    rend="italic">imagination,</hi> on the contrary, a kind of permanent sense.”</p>
                <p>Great part of the office which is here assigned to imagination is in common
                    English attributed to memory; but between these two faculties, as well as
                    between them and recollection, the author accurately distinguishes thus. “When
                    we view some relict of sensation reposed within us, without thinking of its
                    rise, or referring it to any sensible object, this is <hi rend="italic"
                    >fancy</hi> or <hi rend="italic">imagination.</hi> When we view some such
                    relict, and refer it withal to that sensible object which in time past was its
                    cause and original, this is <hi rend="italic">memory.</hi> Lastly, the road
                    which leads to memory through a series of ideas, however connected, whether
                    rationally or casually, this is recollection.”</p>
                <p>Of this theory we shall only remark, that if we could understand the words
                    picture and form in a metaphorical sense, as candour obliges us to understand
                    Locke’s images in the mind, then the doctrine of Alexander Aphrodisiensis would
                    be very little wide of the truth. Experience teaches us that memory as well as
                    perception depends upon the state of the brain; and as it is undeniable, that
                    when a man to-day contemplates an object which he perceived yesterday, or at any
                    former period, he has a view of it in all respects similar to the original
                    perception, only fainter and less distinct, it is extremely probable, that an
                    impression <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">extra,</hi> which produces
                    a sensation and perception, leaves behind it some tendency in the brain to
                    vibrate, as in the actual sensation, and that this tendency is carried into
                    effect by the internal energy of the mind itself. But in the Peripatetic
                    philosophy, pictures and forms in the sensorium were considered as real things,
                    and by no means as metaphorical expressions. This is evident from their being
                    constantly compared to the impression of a seal upon wax, and from their
                    converting the <hi rend="italic">materia</hi><hi rend="italic">prima</hi> from
                    something which can neither be seen nor felt, into visible and tangible body, of
                    which we shall treat afterwards. Now it being certain, that upon a being
                    immaterial no corporeal form can be impressed, and repeated dissections having
                    shown that no such forms are in fact impressed upon the brain, this whole theory
                    is at once overturned.</p>
                <p>Modern philosophers, having denied that there are real images or forms in the
                    mind during the immediate act of perception,cannot, consistently with
                    themselves, admitsuch images in the act of retention, or when those things which
                    were formerly objects of perception are recalled to the mind by the power of
                    memory. Mr Locke’s doctrine is, “that the mind retains these simple ideas which
                    it first received from sensation or reflection, two ways: first, by keeping the
                    idea which is brought into it for some time actually in view, which is called
                    <hi rend="italic">contemplation</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, secondly, by
                    the power which we have to revive again in our minds those ideas which, after
                    imprinting, have disappeared, or have been, as it were, laid out of sight; as
                    when we conceive heat or light, yellow or sweet, the object being removed.
                    This,” he says, “is <hi rend="italic">memory;</hi> which is, as it were, the
                    storehouse of our ideas.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Essay, book ii. chap. x.</p></note></p>
                <p>To explain this more fully, he immediately adds the following observation. “But
                    our ideas being nothing but actual perceptions in the mind, which cease to be
                    any thing where there is no perception of them, this laying up of our ideas in
                    the repository of the memory signifies no more than this, that the mind has a
                    power in many cases to revive perceptions which it has once had, with this
                    additional perception annexed to them, that it has had them before. And in this
                    sense it is that our ideas are said to be in our memories, when indeed they are
                    actually nowhere; but only there is an ability in the mind, when it will, to
                    revive them again, and, as it were, paint them anew on itself, though some with
                    more, some with less difficulty, some more lively and others more obscurely. And
                    thus it is, by the assistance of this faculty, that we are said to have all
                    those ideas in our understandings, which, though we do not actually contemplate
                    them, yet we can bring in sight, and make appear again, and be the objects of
                    our thoughts, without the help of those sensible qualities which first imprinted
                    them there.”</p>
                <p>To attempt a defence of the accuracy of this language would be vain; but as the
                    author’s meaning is sufficiently obvious, his expressions may be easily and
                    certainly corrected. Had Mr Locke said, “But our ideas being nothing but scenes
                    or appearances in the mind, which cease to be any thing when there is no
                    perception of them, thus laying up of our ideas in the repository of the memory
                    signifies no more but this, that the mind has a power, in many cases, to revive
                    scenes which it has once viewed, with this additional perception annexed to
                    them, that it has viewed them before,” there would have been no room for the
                    many petulant remarks which have been made upon the passage. But against this
                    account of memory a much heavier charge has been brought than that which regards
                    the propriety of the language. It has been said, that the additional perception,
                    which, according to Locke, attends the revival of our ideas by the power of
                    memory, “would be a fallacious perception, if it led us to believe that we had
                    them before, since they cannot have two beginnings of existence: nor can we
                    believe them to have two beginnings of existence; we can only believe that we
                    had formerly ideas or perceptions very like to them, though not identically the
                    same.” Let us examine this question somewhat narrowly; for if it be really true,
                    that, in the sense in which the word <hi rend="italic">same</hi> is here used,
                    we cannot twice contemplate the same idea, all confidence in memory would seem
                    to be at an end.</p>
                <p>Suppose a man to stand upon some of the rising grounds about Edinburgh, the
                    Calton Hill, for instance, and from that eminence to view the glorious prospect
                    of the coast of Fife, the ocean, the Frith of Forth, and the little islands
                    scattered in the Frith. Let him go away, and return next day to the same place
                    and look the same way; we would ask whether he has the same view or perception
                    which he had the day before? The man must surely be very captious who would say
                    that he has not; and yet it is certain that the energy of mind by which he
                    perceives on one day cannot be identically the same with that by which he
                    perceived on another; nor are the rays of light which fall upon his eyes on the
                    second day, identically the same with those which fell upon his eyes and
                    occasioned vision on the first day. Let the same man now shut his eyes, and
                    contemplate the various objects at which he had been just looking. They will
                    appear to him in every respect the same as when viewed by means of his organs of
                    sight, only fainter and less distinct, with this additional convic <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194207817" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7817-0615"/> tion, that the
                    immediate objects of his present contemplation are not real external things, but
                    ideas or mental representations of those things which had so lately been the
                    objects of his sight. Let him think no more about the matter for some days, and
                    then exert his powers of memory. We have no hesitation in saying, that, in the
                    sense of the word <hi rend="italic">same,</hi> as used by Mr Locke, the very
                    same ideas will recur and be present to his intellect which were present to it
                    at the former contemplation. The second energy of memory or imagination, or
                    whatever it may be called, is not indeed identically the same with the first;
                    nor is that agitation or motion, or whatever other affection of the brain is
                    necessary to memory, identically the same at the second time as at the first;
                    but the mind, exerting itself in the very same manner at the one time as at the
                    other, produces the same kind of agitation in the brain, and is itself affected
                    in the very same way at the second as at the first exertion. Whence it follows,
                    that the second ideal scene will be as much the same with the first, as the
                    second actual perception is the same with the first; and the two ideal scenes,
                    and the two actual perceptions, are respectively said to be the same with each
                    other, only because they impress the mind with a conviction that they were
                    occasioned by the same external objects.</p>
                <p>But though we think Mr Locke’s doctrine with respect to memory may be thus easily
                    vindicated from the charge of fallaciousness, we must acknowledge that to us it
                    appears not to be of much value. It teaches nothing, but that the mind has a
                    power to retain ideas of those objects which it formerly perceived, and in many
                    instances to recall them as occasion may require. But these are truths known to
                    all mankind, to the clown as well as to the philosopher.</p>
                <p>Philosophers in general have paid less regard to the retentive faculties of the
                    mind than to its original powers of perception. Perhaps they imagined, that as
                    memory depends upon perception, and in some respects appears to resemble it, a
                    competent knowledge of the nature of the former faculty would lead to that of
                    the second. Be this as it may, Mr Hume, who was at some pains to detail his
                    notions of perception, has, in his Philosophical Essays, only dropt, concerning
                    memory and imagination, a few hints, so loosely thrown together, that, if he had
                    not elsewhere expressed himself with more precision, it would have been
                    difficult to discover his real meaning. According to him, that which is commonly
                    called the perception of an external object, is nothing but a strong impression
                    upon the mind; and that which is called the remembrance of a past object, is
                    nothing but a present impression or idea weaker than the former. Imagination is
                    an idea weaker than the idea or impression which he calls memory. This seems to
                    be a wonderful abuse of language. Impressions are not perceptions; and, if
                    possible, they can still less be called ideas, which are but secondary
                    perceptions. It is likewise far from being true, that an idea of imagination has
                    necessarily less vivacity than an idea of memory. We have seen Mr Hume, and have
                    at the present moment an idea of his form and dress. We can likewise imagine to
                    ourselves a centaur; and though a centaur was never seen, and therefore cannot
                    be an impression repeated by memory, our idea of the monster is much more lively
                    and distinct than that of the philosopher.</p>
                <p>Dr Reid, having observed of memory,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man.</p></note> that it
                    is by it we have an immediate knowledge of things past; that it must have an
                    object; that in this respect it agrees with perception, but differs from
                    sensation, which has no object but the feeling itself; and that every man can
                    distinguish the thing remembered from the remembrance of it; proceeds to inquire
                    what memory is. And, “First,” says he, “I think it appears that memory is an
                    original faculty given us by the Author of our being, of which we can give no
                    account but that we are so made. The knowledge,” continues he, “which I have of
                    things past by my memory, seems to me as unaccountable as an immediate knowledge
                    would be of things to come; and I can give no reason why I should have the one
                    and not the other, but that such is the will of my Maker. I find in my mind a
                    distinct conception and a firm belief of a series of past events; but how this
                    is produced I know not. I call it memory; but this is only giving a name to it;
                    it is not an account of its cause. ì believe most firmly what I distinctly
                    remember; but I can give no reason of this belief. It is the inspiration of the
                    Almighty which gives me this understanding. When I believe the truth of a
                    mathematical axiom or of a mathematical proposition, I see that it must be so;
                    every man who has the same conception of it sees the same. There is a necessary
                    and an evident connection between the subject and the predicate of the
                    proposition; and I have all the evidence to support my belief which I can
                    possibly conceive. When I believe that I washed my hands and face this morning,
                    there appears no necessity in the truth of the proposition. It might be or it
                    might not be. A man may distinctly conceive it without believing it at all. How
                    then do I come to believe it? I remember it distinctly. This is all I can say.
                    This remembrance is an act of my mind. Is it impossible that this act should be,
                    if the event had not happened? I confess I do not see any necessary connection
                    between the one and the other. If any man can show such a necessary connection,
                    then I think that belief which we have of what we remember will be fairly
                    accounted for; but if this cannot be done, that belief is unaccountable, and we
                    can say no more than that it is the result of our constitution. Our original
                    faculties are all unaccountable. Of these memory is one. He only who made them
                    comprehends fully how they are made, and how they produce in us not only a
                    conception, but a firm belief and assurance, of tnings which it concerns us to
                    know.”</p>
                <p>On this account of memory we shall not make any remarks. There is a certain sense
                    of the words, in which every thing which the author has said on the subject is
                    undoubtedly just; and it would be very uncandid to take his words in any other
                    sense. But though memory, as it is the result of that constitution which was
                    given us by God, and not the offspring of habit or human contrivance, is
                    unquestionably an original faculty, and though it is therefore impossible to
                    account for it so fully as to silence every inquiry which may be made, yet we
                    could wish that Dr Reid had bestowed a little more pains upon it, in order to
                    discover if possible in what respects it resembles or differs from perception.
                    He has well observed, that there are laws of nature by which the operations of
                    the mind are regulated, as well as laws of nature which govern the material
                    system. As the latter are the ultimate conclusions which the human faculties can
                    reach in the philosophy of bodies, so the former are the ultimate conclusions
                    which we can reach in the philosophy of minds. The more general that tliese laws
                    are in both cases, the more useful they are, and the more satisfactory; for as
                    they are themselves inexplicable, the fewer they are in number, and the more
                    comprehensive each is, the fewer will those phenomena be for which we can give
                    no account. Thus, as we know not what makes the planets tend to the centre of
                    the sun, or heavy bodies tend to the centre of the earth, we can give no other
                    account of these phenomena but that, as they appear to be of the same kind, it
                    is reasonable to conclude <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207830"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7830-0616"/>that they proceed from similar causes. What the
                    cause is of this tendency of bodies towards each other, we know not. We call it
                    gravitation, and employ it to account for all phenomena of the same kind. In
                    like manner it is universally allowed, that as we know not how mind and matter
                    operate upon each other, there is something in perception wholly unaccountable.
                    That perception follows sensation, and that there is no sensation which is not
                    occasioned by some affection of the brain, proceeding from some impression <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">extra,</hi> we have the evidence <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> experience; but how a particular affection of the brain
                    should excite a sensation in the mind, we know not, though we may here, as in
                    the corporeal system, attribute similar effects to the same or to similar
                    causes. Thus, if, when we exert an act of memory, we have the same appearance of
                    things as in the original act of perception, the rules of philosophizing
                    authorize us to refer both phenomena to the same general law, just as they
                    authorize us to refer the motion of the planets and of projectiles to the same
                    general law. On the other hand, if we perceive no similarity between memory and
                    perception, we have made no progress in the philosophy of mind; for in that case
                    we have discovered two phenomena proceeding from two causes totally different
                    from each other, and both inexplicable. Although we scarcely hope to throw any
                    light upon a subject which Dr Reid has not attempted to illustrate, we shall
                    state a few facts respecting the memory, and submit to the reader the
                    conclusions to which we think these facts naturally lead.</p>
                <p>1. Objects once perceived by the senses, when recalled to the mind by the power
                    of memory, appear precisely the same as in the original perception, only less
                    distinct. For example, having seen yesterday a spreading oak growing on the bank
                    of a river, and having heard a shepherd play, and handled a square stone, we
                    endeavour to recall to our mind these objects, which are now absent. But how is
                    this operation performed? Do we endeavour to form in our minds pictures of them,
                    or representative images? or does our intellect survey the types or forms which,
                    according to Aristotle, those objects left in the imagination when they were
                    originally perceived? Neither of these things is done. We conceive ourselves as
                    standing in the same place where we stood yesterday; upon which we have
                    perceptions of the objects similar in all respects to the perceptions which we
                    had when we employed our eyes, our ears, and our hands. The tree appears, as it
                    were, before us; faint, indeed, but attended with all the objects which we
                    observed around it yesterday; we seem to hear the sound of the pipe confusedly,
                    and at a distance; to move our hands over the stone, and to feel the same
                    surfaces and the same angles which we felt in the original perception. In this
                    recollection we are not conscious of pictures or images more than in the
                    original survey. The perceptions seem to be those of the tree and river
                    themselves, of the sound itself, and of the stone itself, exactly as at the
                    first; and yet we are satisfied that in the act of remembrance we perceive no
                    such object as a real tree, pipe, or stone. That these are facts, every man must
                    be convinced who attends to the energies of his own mind when exerting the
                    powers of retention; and therefore it is, in our opinion, with no iTn-propriety
                    that Mr Harris says we may call <hi rend="italic">sense, if</hi> we please, a
                    kind <hi rend="italic">of</hi> transient imagination; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >imagination,</hi> on the contrary, a kind of permanent sense; for if these two
                    faculties, as far as the mind or intellect is concerned, be not the same, they
                    seem to resemble each other much.</p>
                <p>2. The primary perception <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a visible object is more
                    complete, lively, and distinct, and remains longer in the sensorium, than that
                    of any other object. We know likewise by experience, that an idea or secondary
                    perception of a visible object is as much more complete, lively, and distinct,
                    than the idea of any other object, as was the primary perception; and that we
                    remember things which we have seen for a longer time than sounds which we have
                    heard, or than tangible objects which we have only handled. Yet there seems to
                    be a constant decay of all our ideas, even of those which have struck deepest,
                    and in minds, the most retentive; so that if they be not frequently renewed by
                    repeated exercise of the senses, or by reflection on those objects which,at
                    first occasioned them, the print wears out, and at last there remains nothing to
                    be seen. Concerning ideas, it is easy to remark, that those remain longest and
                    clearest in the memory which are derived from two or more senses, especially if
                    the sense of sight be one of the number, or which are most often refreshed by a
                    return of the objects which produced them. Hence a man has a longer and more
                    distinct remembrance of what he has seen than of what he has only heard, of what
                    he has both seen and felt than of what he has only seen; and the ideas which we
                    have of heat and cold, of hunger and thirst, and of all those things which most
                    frequently affect our senses, are extremely clear, and are never quite lost
                    whilst the mind retains any ideas at all.</p>
                <p>3. Memory appears to be a kind of habit, which is not always in exercise with
                    regard to things we remember, but is ready to suggest them when there is
                    occasion. The most perfect degree of this habit is, when the thing presents
                    itself to our remembrance spontaneously, and without labour, as often as there
                    is occasion. A second degree is, when the thing is forgotten for a longer or
                    shorter time, even when there is occasion to remember it, and yet at last some
                    incident, such as a violent passion,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Reid’s Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man; Locke’s
                    Essay, &amp;c.; and Harris’s Hermes.</p></note> which agitates the whole mind
                    and sensorium, tumbles the idea, as it were, out of its dark corner, and brings
                    it into view without any search. A third degree is, when we cast about and
                    search for what we would remember, and after some labour find it out. This
                    searching faculty of the soul is by Aristotle called <hi rend="italic"
                    >άναμνησις,</hi> by Dr Reid and others reminiscence, and by Mr Harris
                    recollection. Should it be said, that what we will to remember we must already
                    conceive, as we can will nothing of which we have not a conception; and that,
                    therefore, a will to remember a thing seems to imply that we remember it
                    already; we answer, with Dr Reid, that when we will to remember a thing, we must
                    indeed remember something relating to it, but we may have no positive idea or
                    conception of the thing itself, but only of the relation which it bears to that
                    other thing which we do remember. Thus, one remembers that a friend charged him
                    with a commission to be executed at such a place, but he has forgotten what the
                    commission was. He applies himself to discover it, and recollects that it was
                    given by such a person, upon such an occasion, in consequence of such a
                    conversation; and thus by a train of thought he is led to the very thing which
                    he had forgotten and wished to remember. To this operation it is not always
                    necessary that the relations between the various ideas which the mind turns over
                    be very close, or have their foundation in nature; for a casual connection is
                    often sufficient. Thus, from seeing a garment, we think of its owner; thence of
                    his habitation; thence of woods; thence of timber; thence of ships; thence of
                    admirals; thence of cannons, iron, furnaces, and forges, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>That, in the process of recollection, one idea should suggest another, may be
                    easily accounted for. When, in perception, our minds are exposed to the
                    influence of external objects, all the parts and properties, and even the
                    accidental variable adjuncts, of these objects, are perceived by full-grown men
                    at the same time; so that the whole group makes but one impression upon our
                    organs of sense, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207843"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7843-0617"/>and consequently upon the mind. By these means all
                    the parts of the simultaneous impression,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hartley on Man.</p></note> and consequently of the
                    perception occasioned by that impression, are so intimately associated or linked
                    together, that the idea of any one of them recurring at any future period
                    generally introduces the ideas of all the rest. But as the necessary parts and
                    properties of any thing are more closely linked together, and occur more
                    frequently, than any particular variable adjuncts, it is obvious, that by the
                    idea of any one of these properties, the idea of the rest, and of the object
                    itself, will be more readily introduced than by the idea of any variable
                    adjunct. It seems, however, to be certain, that we have no power of calling up
                    any idea at pleasure, but only such as have a connection, either in nature or by
                    means of former associations, with those which are at any time present to the
                    mind. Thus the sight, or the idea, of any particular person, generally enables
                    us to recollect his name, because his name and his person have been constantly
                    associated together. If that fail to introduce the name, we are at a loss and
                    cannot recollect it at all, till some other associated circumstance help us. In
                    naming a number of words in a sentence, or lines in a poem, the end of each
                    preceding word or line being connected with the beginning of the word or line
                    which succeeds it, we can easily repeat them in that order; but we are not able
                    to repeat them backwards with any ease, nor at all till after many fruitless
                    efforts. By frequent trials, however, we acquire at last a íaciĭity in doing it,
                    as maybe found by making the experiment upon the names of number from one to
                    twenty. It is indeed, probable, that in the wildest flights of fancy, no single
                    idea occurs to us but such as had a connection with some other idea, perception,
                    or notion, previously existing in the mind, as shall be shown more fully in a
                    subsequent chapter.</p>
                <p>4. “Memory appears to depend entirely or chiefly upon th.e state of the brain.
                    For diseases, concussions of the brain, spirituous liquors, and some poisons,
                    impair or destroy it; and it generally returns again with the return of health,
                    from the use of proper medicines and methods. It is observable, too, that in
                    recovering from concussions and other disorders of the brain, it is usual for
                    the person to recover the power of remcmbering the then present common
                    incidents, for minutes, hours, and days, by degrees; also the power of recalling
                    the events of his life preceding his illness. At length he recovers this last
                    power perfectly, and at the same time forgets almost all that passed in his
                    illness, even those things which at first he remembered for a day or two. Now
                    the reason of this seems to be, that upon a perfect recovery the brain recovers
                    its natural state, and all its former affections and tendencies; but that such
                    affections or tendencies as took place during the preternatural state, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e</hi>. during the patient’s illness, are obliterated by the
                    return of the natural state.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ibid.</p></note> All this we are induced to believe;
                    because, though it is a fact incontrovertible, that in certain diseases the
                    memory is impaired, and recovers its vigour with the return of health, it is not
                    conceivable that the mind itself should suffer any change by diseases,
                    concussions, spirituous liquors, or the like.</p>
                <p>From these facts we are strongly inclined to conclude, that the power of the
                    mind, or immaterial principle, by which it remembers past events, differs not
                    from that by which it perceives present objects. In perception, impressions are
                    made upon the organs of sense, which are communicated to the brain, and, by some
                    unknown means, occasion sensations which are followed by the perception of the
                    external object. When by the power of memory we recall past objects of sense,
                    the mind has the same view of them as in the original perception, except that
                    they appear fainter, less distinct, and generally more distant. We have,
                    therefore, reason to conclude, that in the act of remembrance the brain is
                    affected in the same way, although not so forcibly, as in perception. That
                    memory depends as ’ much as perception upon the state of the brain, is confirmed
                    by daily experience; and therefore there cannot be a doubt but that external
                    objects, operating upon the senses, nerves, and brain, leave some permanent
                    effect behind them. What that effect preciscly is we cannot know, and we need
                    not desire to know; but that they leave some effect we have as good evidence as
                    that the planets are moved round the sun by forces of the same kind with those
                    by which projectiles are moved on the earth. Could we suppose that they leave
                    real prints or impressions behind them, which we confess to be very little
                    probable, memory would seem to be nothing but the perceptive power of the mind
                    turned to those impressions. If the permanent effect of impressions by external
                    objects be, as Dr Hartley supposes, only a tendency in the brain to vibrate as
                    in the original perception, remembrance will result from the mind’s operating
                    upon tl ’.e brain as in actual perception; and the reason that ideas of memory
                    are fainter than perceptions of sense is, that the former are produced by a
                    single, and the latter by a double operation.</p>
                <p>This theory appears to be greatly confirmed by the well-known facts, that in
                    general children soon commit to their memory any thing which they understand,
                    and as soon forget it; that the powers of memory gradually advance to
                    perfection, and then gradually decay; and that <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    old men remember more distinctly what they perceived in their youth than what
                    they perceived a year ago. For if the memory belonged wholly to the pure
                    intellect, and had no dependence upon the brain, it is not easy to conceive how
                    it should advance towards a state of perfection, and afterwards decay. A being
                    which is unextended and indivisible can suffer no change either in its essence
                    or in its faculties; the ideas which it had once retained it would retain for
                    ever. But if memory be occasioned by some relict of sense left in the brain, it
                    is easy to see how all those changes should take place; and therefore, though
                    we. have the weight of Dr Reid’s authority against us, we cannot help thinking
                    that Aristotle was in the right when he imputed the shortness of memory in
                    children to this cause, that their brain is too moist and soft to retain
                    impressions made upon it; and that he was likewise in the right when he imputed
                    the defect of memory in old men to the hardness and rigidity of the brain, which
                    hinders it from receiving any durable impression.</p>
                <p>Another argument to prove that in remembrance the mind acts upon something left
                    in the brain by the impressions of sense is this, that nothing can act but where
                    it is present. The truth of this axiom is acknowledged by Dr Reid, and we
                    believe by all mankind, except Dr Priestley and one or two others, whose
                    paradoxes we shall afterwards consider. Now it is confessed, that in
                    recollection at least the mind is active; and therefore it must act, not upon an
                    object which has now perhaps no existence, and certainly no immediate existence,
                    but upon something left by that object in the brain or sensorium, to which the
                    mind is intimately present.</p>
                <p>But if this be so, we may be asked how it comes to pass that men never confound
                    memory with perception, nor fancy that they perceive things which they only
                    remember? If perception be an inference drawn from certain sensations excited by
                    an impression on the brain, and if remembrance result from the mind’s operating
                    upon relicts <hi rend="italic">of</hi> those impressions, one would think it
                    natural to suppose that in both cases we have actual perceptións, though in the
                    one case the perception must be much more vivid and distinct than in the other.
                    To this we answer, that, previously to all experience, perception and memory are
                    very <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207856" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7856-0618"/>probably
                    confounded; and that we believe a man brought into the world with all his
                    faculties in their full natural perfection would not instantly be able to
                    distinguish what he remembered from what he perceived. This we know to be the
                    case with respect to imagination, a faculty which strongly resembles memory; for
                    in dreams, and sometimes even in waking reveries, we fancy actually that we
                    perceive things which it is certain we can only imagine. A very short
                    experience, however, would enable this newly-created man to make the proper
                    distinction between remembrance and perception. For, let us suppose him to be
                    brought into a dark room, and soon afterwards a candle to be introduced. The
                    candle would give him a visible sensation, though not at first the perception of
                    an external object. Let the candle after some time be carried out; in that case
                    the man would retain a visible idea, which he might confound with the actual
                    sensation. But if, whilst this idea remained in his mind, the candle were
                    brought back, he would instantly feel a difference between the real sensation
                    and the idea, when both were together present in his mind. And having, in some
                    such manner as we have already described, acquired the power of perceiving
                    external objects by means of his senses, he would soon discover, without any
                    effort of his own, the difference between actual perceptions and the ideas
                    treasured up in his memory.</p>
                <p>The only remaining difficulty which seems to encumber this theory of remembrance
                    is, to account for the order of succession in which objects recur to the memory,
                    and to which we give the name of <hi rend="italic">time.</hi> But this
                    difficulty will vanish when we have once ascertained what time is. At present it
                    is sufficient to observe, that our perceptions of external objects remain a
                    certain space of time in the mind; that this time is different according to the
                    strength and other circumstances of the impression which occasioned the
                    perception; and that traces of those perceptions or ideas may be recalled after
                    the intervention of other trains of ideas, and at very different intervals. If
                    one look upon a house, and then shut his eyes, the impression which is made upon
                    his mind will not instantly vanish. He can contemplate the house almost as long
                    as he pleases; and, by the help of various associated circumstances, he may
                    recall the idea several years afterwards, and refer it to the original
                    perception.</p>
                <p>Before we dismiss the subject of retention, it may not be improper to take notice
                    of the retentive powers of inferior animals. Aristotle, Locke, Dr Reid, and
                    almost every philosopher of eminence, both amongst the ancients and moderns,
                    have maintained that inferior animals have memory as well as men; and indeed we
                    do not perceive how the fact can be denied of the more perfect animals, and
                    those with whose operations we are best*acquainted. A dog knovys his master
                    again after a long absence; a horse will trace back a road which he has but once
                    travelled, often with more accuracy than his rider; and it is well known that
                    many species of singing birds have a capacity to learn tunes from the human
                    voice, and that they repeat the notes again and again, approaching nearer and
                    nearer to perfection, till at last they sing the tune correctly. These phenomena
                    can be accounted for only by supposing, that in the brains of the several
                    animals traces are left by perception, of the same kind with those which
                    perception leaves in the brain of man, and which are the cause or occasion of
                    his remembrance. With respect to this point, the learned author of Ancient
                    Metaphysics differs from his master Aristotle. He allows that brutes have
                    imagination, but denies that they have memory; “for,” says he, “memory
                    necessarily implies a sense of time, and what is first and last; but brutes have
                    no iilea of time, or of first and last; and it is certain that they have not
                    consciousness or reflection, by which only they could review their own ope-:
                    rations.” At the same time he admits, that imagination in the brute serves the
                    purpose of memory in us; for “whenever he sees the object that is painted on his
                    <hi rend="italic">phantasia,</hi> he knows it again, but without any perception
                    of the time when he first saw it.” Butthat a brute, when he sees the object
                    which is painted on his phantasia, should know it again without referring it to
                    a former perception, is plainly impossible. The recognisance of any thing
                    consists in a consciousness of its having been perceived before; and nothing
                    more than such recognisance is essential to memory. The author’s mistake seems
                    to lie in supposing that memory necessarily implies a sense of some determinate
                    portion of past time; but we surely remember many things of which we can only
                    say that we have formerly perceived them, without being able to ascertain the
                    precise period at which we had such perceptions. A child has the use of memory
                    sooner than he acquires the faculty of speech; but he must have spoken and even
                    reasoned before he can have an accurate notion of time, which, as shall be
                    afterwards shown, arises from comparing the fleeting succession of our own ideas
                    with the permanence of ourselves and other objects. The author’s distinction
                    between memory and imagination seems to be in every view improper. Aristotle has
                    said, and said truly, that there is memory of ideas as well as of sensible
                    objects, meaning by ideas general conceptions or propositions; but this reviver
                    of his philosophy is inclined to say, “that memory is only of ideas, and
                    consequently belongs only to man; and that imagination is only of sensible
                    objects, and consequently belongs both to man and brute.” But surely man
                    remembers what he has seen and felt as well as what he has conceived or thought;
                    and if imagination and memory be properly distinguished by Mr Flarris, the
                    reverse of this writer’s doctrine must be true, viz. that imagination belongs
                    only to man, and memory of sensible objects both to man and brute. We can
                    contemplate in imagination the idea of a centaur or of a golden mountain; but we
                    cannot be said to remember them, for they were never perceived. That a dog can
                    contemplate in his imagination the idea of a centaur or of a golden mountain, we
                    have not the least reason to suppose; but were he not capable of viewing relicts
                    of sense reposed with him, and referring them to their original causes, he could
                    not possibly recognise his master after a day’s absence.</p>
                <p>Dr Reid and the same author agree with Aristotle in thinking it probable that
                    brutes have not reminiscence, or the power of reflection; but there are many
                    well-attested facts which seem to prove the contrary. We shall here mention one
                    which fell under our own observation. One of the persons concerned in this work
                    was, when a young man, absent for five months from the house of his father. Upon
                    his return, a dog of that species which is commonly called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >shepherd’s cur,</hi> and which had been in the possession of his father only a
                    few months before his departure, gazed at him for a few minutes as at any other
                    stranger. The animal then began to walk round him with looks which very soon
                    attracted his notice. This made him call the dog by the name which he bore in
                    the family, and stretch out his hand to caress him, when the creature instantly
                    leaped upon him with all that appearance of attachment which these animals so
                    commonly exhibit upon the return of their master after a few days’ absence. If
                    this was not recollection, we should be glad to know what it was, not being able
                    to distinguish it from recollection in men. Indeed, if dogs and some other
                    animals possess, as Aristotle, Locke, and others allow them to possess, the
                    power of memory, and something of ratiocination; and if, as Dr Reid expressly
                    says,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Essays on the
                    Intellectual Powers of Man.</p></note> “they ex <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194207869" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7869-0619"/>pect events in the same order
                    and succession in which they happened before,” it is not conceivable that they
                    can be wholly destitute of reminiscence, or the power of recollection.</p>
                <p>That memory is a faculty of the first importance, cannot be denied; since it is
                    obvious that, without the power of retaining the ideas and notions which we
                    receive by the senses and other faculties, we never could make any progress in
                    the acquisition of knowledge, but should begin every day, nay, every hour, in
                    the same state of ignorance in which we were born. That it is a faculty capable
                    of improvement by exercise, and that there are some methods of exercise better
                    adapted for this purpose than others, has been shown elsewhere. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Memory.)</hi></p>
                <p>CHAP. III.—OF SIMPLE APPREHENSION AND CONCEPTION.</p>
                <p>The ideas received into the mind by the senses, and treasured up in the memory
                    and imagination, are the original materials of human knowledge. It is by
                    comparing those ideas with one another, or by analyzing them into their first
                    principles, that we acquire all our knowledge in mathematics and philosophy, and
                    indeed all that knowledge which regulates our conduct throughout life. It must
                    therefore be of importance to trace the progress of the mind in her various
                    operations upon these materials; beginning, as she certainly does, with that
                    which is most simple, and proceeding regularly to those which are more complex
                    and difficult.</p>
                <p>Now th⅛ first operation of the mind about her ideas appears plainly to be that
                    which logicians term <hi rend="italic">simple apprehension,</hi> Having
                    yesterday observed a tree or any other object, if we contemplate the idea of
                    that tree to-day as it remains in the imagination, without comparing it with any
                    other idea, or referring it to any external object, we perform the operation
                    which is called simple apprehension. We consider simple apprehension as an
                    operation, because the mind in the apprehension of her own ideas is certainly
                    active; she turns them as it were round and round, and views them on every
                    side.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Simple apprehension</hi> is a phrase which is very commonly
                    taken to be of the same import with the word <hi rend="italic">conception,</hi>
                    and in the ordinary affairs of life no confusion can arise from an
                    indiscriminate use of the two words; but in this article we think it expedient
                    to employ the phrase <hi rend="italic">simple apprehension</hi> to denote the
                    view or contemplation of those ideas only which the mind by sensation has
                    actually received from external objects; and the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >conception</hi> to denote the view, not only of those ideas, but also of such
                    as the mind fabricates to herself. Thus, a man may conceive a centaur, but we
                    would not choose to say that he may apprehend a centaur; not that there is any
                    impropriety, perhaps, in this last expression, but as there is certainly a
                    difference between apprehending the idea of what has been seen or felt, and
                    conceiving that which never existed, perspicuity requires that these different
                    operations be expressed by different names.</p>
                <p>We have said that the mind may conceive what never existed; and every man may
                    easily satisfy himself that what we have said is true. But although this has
                    been frequently called the creative power of the mind, it has in fact no
                    resemblance to creation. The materials of all our most complex and fantastic
                    conceptions are furnished to our hands by sensation and. reflection; nor can we
                    form one simple idea which was not originally received by some of our senses
                    from external objects, or, as shall be shown afterwards, one intellectual notion
                    which was not acquired by reflecting on the operations of our own minds. To
                    explain the process of fantastic conception, it is to be observed, that in every
                    sensible object we perceive at once several things, such as colour, figure,
                    extension, and motion or rest, &amp;c. These are the objects of different
                    senses; but they are not, at least by full-grown men, perceived in succession,
                    but all at once; whence it comes to pass that the memory or the imagination
                    retains not several distinct and disjointed ideas, but the idea of one coloured,
                    figured, and extended object. But when we compare together various objects, or
                    the ideas of various objects, we find that in some respects they agree, and in
                    others disagree; in other words, that several objects affect some of our senses
                    in the same way, and other senses differently. Thus, one globe is black and
                    another white, one black substance is circular and hard, and another square and
                    soft. In the first instance, the two globes affect our sense of touch in the
                    same way, and our sense of seeing differently; in the second, the two black
                    substances affect our sense of sight in the same way, and our sense of touch
                    differently.</p>
                <p>From observing this difference amongst objects by means of the different
                    sensations received from them, the mind learns to analyze its original ideas,
                    which are copies of those sensations, into their first principles, and to
                    combine those principles in such a manner as to form complex ideas of objects
                    which were never actually perceived by the senses. Of the simple and unmixed
                    principles which compose those complex ideas, there is not indeed one which was
                    not originally received by some sense, so that the whole difference between
                    complex ideas fabricated by the mind and those which are the relicts of
                    sensation, consists in the order in which the constituent simple ideas of each
                    are put together. Thus, no man ever saw a mountain of pure gold, and therefore
                    the idea of such a mountain can be in no human mind as a relict of sensation;
                    but we have all seen pieces of gold of different sizes, and we have all seen
                    mountains, and nothing is more easy than to conceive a piece of gold extended on
                    all sides to the size of a mountain, and rising out of the earth. Again, though
                    no person ever saw a centaur, yet it is easy to conceive the upper parts of a
                    man joined to the breast and shoulders of a horse. In these instances the
                    complex conceptions are of things which it is in the highest degree probable
                    never had a real existence, and which it is certain we never perceived as
                    existing; but the simple ideas of which they are composed are the relicts of
                    actual sensations, for every one has perceived as really existing the body of a
                    horse and the upper parts of a man, and when conceiving a centaur, he only
                    conceives them to exist united. That we have not in the imagination one simple
                    and unmixed idea which was not left there as a relict of sense, every man will
                    be convinced who shall try to conceive a simple colour or taste which is totally
                    different from all the colours and tastes, and all the shades and varieties of
                    them, which he has received by sensation; but his simple ideas, though all
                    received from without, he may put together in innumerable ways or modes,
                    differing from any order in which he has ever actually perceived the qualities
                    of external objects existing.</p>
                <p>Yet even this power of the mind is limited. It is impossible to put together a
                    number of contrary and inconsistent ideas, in such a manner as to form of them
                    one complex conception. No man, for instance, can conceive a thing to be at once
                    white and black, round and square, hard and soft, in motion and at rest. Hence
                    it is a maxim almost universally received amongst philosophers, that although we
                    can conceive many things which never actually existed, yet we can form no ideas
                    but of such things as .might possibly exist. A centaur never existed, but it may
                    be conceived; for it is by no means impossible that the head of a man might be
                    joined to the body of a horse; but black snow cannot be conceived, for, in the
                    complex idea denoted by the word snow, whiteness is an essential part, and
                    nothing can be conceived to be both black and white <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194207882" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7882-0620"/>at the same time. From this
                    undoubted fact, that we cannot conceive impossible existence, the power of
                    conception has by some writers been in certain instances made a test of truth.
                    “In every idea is implied,” says Dr Price,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Morals.</p></note> “the possibility of the existence of its object; nothing
                    being clearer than that there can be no idea of an impossibility, or conception·
                    of what cannot exist.” “It is an established maxim in metaphysics,” says Hume,
                    “that whatever the mind conceives, includes the idea <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    possible existence; or, in other words, that nothing we imagine is absolutely
                    impossible.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="superscript"> ä</hi> Essays.</p></note> In a word, it has been admitted by
                    all philosophers, from Pythagoras to Dr Reid, that whatever we can distinctly
                    conceive is possible, although many things may be possible, nay, may really
                    exist, of which we can form no conception.</p>
                <p>This axiom has been denied by the author of the Essays on the Intellectual Powers
                    of Man, who affirms that “any two sides of a triangle may be conceived to be
                    equal to the third,” as distinctly as “any two sides of a triangle may be
                    conceived to be greater than the third.” This assertion proceeding from such a
                    man surprised us as much as any paradox which we ever read; for nothing is more
                    certain than that we ourselves can form no conception of a triangle of which two
                    of the sides are only equal to the third. We can indeed resolve the proposition
                    into its different parts, and form the distinct and independent ideas of a
                    triangle, two sides, and one side, and we can likewise form the general notion
                    of equality; but to combine these ideas and this notion into one individual
                    complex conception is absolutely impossible. A man who knows nothing of
                    triangles, if such a man there be, might believe Dr Reid that it is a figure of
                    which one of its sides is equal to the other two; but such a person would have
                    no conception of the figure itself, and only a confidence in the doctor’s
                    veracity.</p>
                <p>What is it to conceive a corporeal thing to exist? Is it not to fancy that we
                    view it on all sides as what may be seen, or felt, or smelled, or tasted? The
                    doctor, indeed, repeatedly reprobates, as the source of much error, the notion
                    of ideas as images in the mind; and if ideas he taken as real material figures,
                    he is certainly in the right; but we appeal to the common sense <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> mankind, whether every person who distinctly conceives a
                    triangle is not at the time conscious that his mind is affected in a similar
                    manner, although not so forcibly, as when he actually views a triangle with his
                    eyes? What other men may feel they know best; but we are as certain that this is
                    the case with respect to ourselves, as we are certain of our own existence. That
                    this affection of the mind is occasioned by some agitation in the brain, of the
                    same kind with that which occasions actual perception, is highly probable; but
                    whatever be the cause, the fact is undeniable.</p>
                <p>The doctor’s words, indeed, taken by themselves, would lead one to think that by
                    conception he means in this case nothing more than the understanding of the
                    terms of a proposition; but if that be his meaning, there was no room for
                    controversy, as the great philosophers Cudworth, Clarke, Price, and Hume, whose
                    opinion he is combating, would have been as ready as himself to allow, that when
                    a man is thoroughly master of any language, he will not find any difficulty in
                    understanding the meaning of any particular words in that language, however
                    absurdly these words may have been put together. When Dr Price says, that “in
                    every idea is implied the possibility of the existence of its object, nothing
                    being clearer than that there can be no idea of impossibility, or conception of
                    what cannot exist,” his meaning evidently is, that we cannot mentally
                    contemplate nor fancy ourselves viewing any thing corporeal, which we might not
                    actually view with our eyes, or perceive by some other sense. This is the true
                    meaning of conception, which is something very different indeed from
                    understanding the separate meaning of each word contained in a proposition.</p>
                <p>The learned professor, however, appeals to the practice of mathematicians for the
                    truth of his opinion; and if they be on his side, we must give up the cause, for
                    in no science have we such clear ideas, or such absolute certainty, as in
                    mathematical reasoning. But it is to be observed that the word conception is not
                    with any propriety applied to abstract truth, but to real or possible existence;
                    nor can we be said to conceive distinctly a real or possible object, unless we
                    are able to turn it round and round, and view it on all sides. The faculties
                    which are conversant about abstract truth are the judgment and the reason; and
                    truth itself consists in the agreement, as falsehood does in the disagreement,
                    of two or more ideas or terms when compared together. If those ideas about which
                    a judgment is ío be formed can be immediately brought together, without the
                    intervention of a third idea, it is impossible that we should judge, or, if Dr
                    Reid will have it so, conceive that to be true which is really false. If the two
                    ideas cannot be immediately brought together, it is impossible that we should
                    form any judgment or conception at all about their agreement or disagreement;
                    but we may suppose or admit, for the sake of argument, that they agree or
                    disagree, and if that supposition conduct to a manifest absurdity, we then know
                    that the supposition was false. It is therefore perfectly agreeable to the maxim
                    of Price and of Hume, that mathematicians should in many cases prove some things
                    to be possible and others impossible, which without demonstration would not have
                    been believed; because if the ideas compared cannot be immediately brought
                    together, no judgment, previously to the demonstration, can be formed of the
                    truth or falsehood of the proposition; and if it concern not real or possible
                    existence, it is a proposition with which conception has nothing to do.</p>
                <p>“But,” says Dr Reid, “it is easy to conceive, that in the infinite series of
                    numbers and intermediate fractions, some one number, integral or fractional, may
                    bear the same ratio to another as the side of a square bears to its diagonal.”
                    We are so far from thinking this an easy matter, that if the word <hi
                    rend="italic">conceive</hi> be taken in the sense in which it is used by the
                    philosophers whose opinion he is combating, we must confess that we can form no
                    adequate conception at all of an infinite series. When we make the trial, we can
                    only bring ourselves to conceive the real numerical figures 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., or
                    the fractional parts ⅜, ½, ½, &amp;c.; and even here our conception reaches but
                    a small way. We have reason to believe that minds of a larger grasp can conceive
                    at once more of the series than we can, and that the Supreme Mind conceives the
                    whole of it, if the whole of a mathematical infinity be not a contradiction in
                    terms; but surely no man will say that he can conceive an infinite series as he
                    conceives a centaur, and have an adequate and distinct view of it at once. If,
                    by conceiving that in an infinite series some one number may bear the same ratio
                    to another that the side of a square bears to its diagonal, the doctor only
                    means that such a supposition may be made, his observation is not to the purpose
                    for which it is brought; for the question is not about our power to make
                    suppositions of this kind, but about our power to raise in our imaginations an
                    adequate and distinct mental view of possible or impossible existence. “T&lt;ι
                    suppose,” says Johnson, “is to advance by way of argument or illustration,
                    without maintaining the truth of the position.” ln this sense a man may suppose
                    that in an infinite series there may be some <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207895"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7895-0621"/>one number which bears the same ratio to another
                    that the side of a square bears to its diagonal; but such a supposition contains
                    in it nothing that is positive, which conception always does; it is only
                    admitting, for the sake of argument, a position, of the truth or the falsehood
                    of which the person who makes the supposition knows nothing. He is only talking
                    of ratios as a blind man may talk of colours. A man born blind may be made to
                    comprehend many of the laws of optics, and may even make suppositions about
                    colours, and reason from such suppositions to a certain extent, as clearly and
                    justly as one who sees; but will any person say that a man blind from his birth
                    can conceive red or green? It is much the same with respect to an infinite
                    series. We can follow such a series so far, and may know the ratio by which it
                    increases or decreases, and reason irom what we know with the utmost certainty;
                    but no man ever conceived the whole of an infinite series as he conceives an
                    individual object, nor can any reasonings upon the nature of it be applied to
                    the question of conceiving impossible existence.</p>
                <p>But “mathematicians often require us,” says Dr Reid, “to conceive things that are
                    impossible, in order to prove them to be so. This is the case in all their
                    demonstrations <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">absurdum.</hi>
                    Conceive, says Euclid, a right line drawn from one point of the circumference of
                    a circle to another, to fall without the circle. I conceive this, I reason from
                    it, until I come to a consequence that is manifestly absurd, and from thence
                    conclude that the thing which I conceived is impossible.” If it be indeed true
                    that Euclid desires his readers to conceive a mathematical circle with a line
                    drawn from one point of its circumference to another, and that line lying
                    without the circle; if he really desires them to form such a complex conception
                    as this, we have no hesitation in affirming that he requires them to do what is
                    manifestly impossible. The writer of this article has not in his custody any
                    copy of the Elements in the original Greek, and therefore cannot say with
                    certainty what are Euclid’s words; nor is it of much importance what they be;
                    for upon a question which every man may decide for himself, by merely looking
                    into his own mind, the authority of Euclid is nohing. The proposition to which
                    the doctor refers is the second of the third book, and, in the edition of
                    Simpson, is expressed thus: “If any two points be taken in the circumference of
                    a circle, the straight line which joins them shall fall within the circle.”
                    Every mathematician who can form an adequate conception of a circle and a
                    straight line perceives the truth of this proposition instantly, for it results
                    necessarily from his conception; but he who has not an adequate conception of a
                    circle may stand in need of a demonstration to show him the truth; for it is to
                    be observed, that demonstration does not make truth, it only points it out to
                    those who cannot perceive it intuitively, just as a microscope does not make the
                    hairs on a mite’s back, but only brings them within the field of vision.</p>
                <p>Were a man who never examined a mite through a microscope, and who has no
                    adequate ideas of the insect kingdom, to be asked whether there be hairs on a
                    mite’s back, he would probably answer that he did not know, but he could
                    conceive no such hairs. In like manner, were a man who has no adequate
                    conception of a mathematical circle, to' be asked whether a straight line, which
                    joins any two contiguous points in the circumference, could lie without the
                    circle, be would probably answer that he did not know. Now it is to be
                    remembered, that the reader of the Elements can have no very adequate conception
                    of a circle when he comes to the second proposition of the third book. The
                    definition of a circle was indeed given him in the introduction to the first
                    book; but of that definition he has hitherto had occasion to make very little
                    use, so that his idea of a circle will be little more accurate than that of an
                    illiterate clown, who has no other idea of the figure than what he takes from a
                    halfpenny or a shilling. Dr Reid himself has elsewhere<note anchored="true"

                    that “when a youth of moderate parts begins to study Euclid, every thing at
                    first is new to him. His apprehension is unsteady; his judgment is feeble, and
                    rests partly upon the evidence of the thing, and partly upon the authority of
                    his teacher; but every time he goes over the definitions, the axioms, the
                    elementary propositions, more light breaks in upon him, the language becomes
                    familiar, and conveys clear and steady conceptions.” In this state he certainly
                    is when be reads foï· the first time the second proposition of the third book;
                    his conception of a circle can then be neither clear nor steady. Our young
                    geometrician, however, must allow, that the proposition is either true or false;
                    and if he has read the preceding books with any advantage, he must have clear
                    and steady conceptions of angles and triangles, and be able to demonstrate many
                    of their properties. “Well,” says Euclid, “though you have no adequate
                    conception of a circle, you are well acquainted with plane angles and triangles,
                    and many of their properties: Let us suppose, if that be possible, that my
                    proposition is false, and I wi∏ show you that the supposition is absolutely
                    inconsistent with what you know to be demonstrable or self-evident truth.” This
                    is all which Euclid can be supposed to require, when, in the words of his
                    excellent translator, he says, “If. it (the straight line) do not fall within
                    (the circle), let it fall, if possible, without.” He could not possibly desire a
                    man who has an adequate idea of a circle, to form the positive and complex
                    conception of that figure, with a straight line touching two points of the
                    circumference, and yet lying on the outside of the circumference; because all
                    his figures and lines are mere conceptions, and not real material things; and
                    such a request would have been the same thing as if he had said, Conceive what
                    cannot be conceived.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Principal Campbell, in treating of the commonly received doctrine of
                    abstraction, has shown, that though Locke has in one passage of Ins immortal
                    work expressed himself on the subject in terms unintelligible, his sentiments on
                    the whole differed little from those of Berkeley and Hume: “Some,” says he, “of
                    the greatest admirers of that eminent philosopher seem to have overlooked
                    entirely the preceding account of his sentiments on this subject; and, through 1
                    know not what passion for the paradoxical (I should rather say the impossible
                    and unintelligible), have shown an amazing zeal lor defending the propriety of
                    the hasty expressions which appear in the passages formerly referred to. Has not
                    the mind of man, say they, an unlimited power in moulding and combining its
                    ideas? The mind, it must be owned, hath an unlimited power in moulding and
                    combining its ideas. It often produces wonderful forms of its own, out of the
                    materials originally supplied by sense; forms indeed of which there is no
                    exemplar to be found in nature,—centaurs and griffins, ‘ Gorgons and hydras, and
                    chimeras dire.’ But still it must not attempt absolute impossibilities, by
                    giving to its creature contradictory qualities. It must not attempt to conceive
                    the same thing to be black and white at the same tune; to be no more than three
                    inches long, and yet no less than three thousand; to conceive two or more lines
                    to be both equal and unequal; the same angle to be at once acute, obtuse, and
                    right or, we may add, the two sides of a triangle to be not greater than the
                    third. (See <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Rhetoric,</hi> vol· ii∙ p∙ ∙ <hi

                <p>We have insisted the longer on this point, because we think it one of the highest
                    importance; for were it indeed true, that we could conceive impossible
                    existence, the consequences would be very melancholy. These consequences it is
                    needless to enumerate. Our readers will perceive, that if we could put together
                    inconsistent ideas of sensible objects, and view them so united as one
                    consistent whole, nothing is clearer than that our faculties would be <pb

                <p>CHAP. IV.—∙OF ABSTRACTION AND GENERAL IDEAS.</p>
                <p>Every sensible object is an individual, and it differs in many respects from
                    every other object. As such it is perceived by the senses; and ideas being
                    nothing more than relicts of sensation preserved in the imagination or memory,
                    every idea must of course be an individual, as much as the object to which it
                    refers. But all science, whether mathematical, moral, or metaphysical, is
                    conversant about general truths; and if truth consist, as we have already
                    observed, and shall more fully evince afterwards, in the agreement or
                    coincidence of ideas, how, it may be asked, can general truth result from the
                    comparison of particular ideas? To get rid of this difficulty, many
                    philosophers, both ancient and modern, pretend that the mind is furnished with
                    <hi rend="italic">general ideas,</hi> from a comparison of which result general
                    propositions applicable to many individuals. Philosophers, indeed, have differed
                    in opinion respecting the source of those ideas, some of the ancients deriving
                    them immediately from the Supreme Mind to the human, whilst almost all the
                    moderns say that? they are framed by abstraction, and therefore call them <hi
                    rend="italic">abstract ideas.</hi></p>
                <p>The doctrine of abstract ideas has been so fairly stated, and, in our opinion, so
                    completely overturned, by Bishop Berkeley, that we shall content ourselves with
                    abridging what he has said on the subject, and obviating some cavils which have
                    latterly been urged against his reasoning. “It is agreed on all hands,” says
                    that learned and ingenious prelate,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Introduction to the Principles of Human
                    Knowledge.</p></note> “that the qualities or modes of things do never really
                    exist each of them apart by itself and separated from all others; but are mixed,
                    as it were, and blended together, several in the same object. But, we are told,
                    the mind being able to consider each quality singly, or abstracted from those
                    other qualities with which it is united, does by that means frame to itself
                    abstract ideas. For example: There is perceived by sight an object extended,
                    coloured, and moved: this mixed or compound idea, the mind resolving into its
                    simple constituent parts, and viewing each by itself exclusive of the rest, does
                    frame the abstract ideas of extension, colour, and motion. Not that it is
                    possible for colour or motion to exist without extension; but only that the mind
                    can frame to itself, by <hi rend="italic">abstraction,</hi> the idea of colour
                    exclusive of extension, and of motion exclusive of both colour and extension.
                    Again, the mind having observed, that in the particular extensions perceived by
                    sense, there is something common and alike in all, and some other things
                    peculiar, as this or that figure or magnitude, which distinguish them from one
                    another, it considers apart, or singles out by itself, that which is common,
                    making thereof a most abstract idea of extension, which is neither line,
                    surface, nor solid, nor has any figure or magnitude, but is an idea entirely
                    prescinded from all these. So likewise the mind, by leaving out of the
                    particular colours perceived by sense that which distinguishes them one from
                    another, and retaining that only which is common to all, makes an idea of colour
                    in the abstract, which is neither red, nor blue, nor white, nor any other
                    determinate colour. And as the mind frames to itself abstract ideas of qualities
                    or modes, so does it by the same precision or mental separation attain abstract
                    ideas of the more compounded beings, which include several co-existent
                    qualities. For example, the mind, having observed that Peter, James, and John,
                    resemble each other in certain common agreements of shape and other qualities,
                    leaves out of the complex or compounded idea it has of Peter, James, and any
                    other particular man, that which is peculiar to each, retaining only what is
                    common to all, and so makes an abstract idea wherein all the particulars equally
                    partake, abstracting entirely from and cutting off all those circumstances and
                    differences which might determine it to any particular existence. After this
                    manner, it is said, we come by the abstract idea of man, or, if you please,
                    humanity or human nature, in which, it is true, there is included colour,
                    because there is no man but has some colour; but then it can be neither black
                    nor white, nor any particular colour, because there is no one particular colour
                    wherein all men partake. So likewise there is included stature; but then it is
                    neither tall stature, nor low stature, nor middle stature, but something
                    abstracted from all these; and so of the rest. Moreover, there being a great
                    variety of other creatures that partake in some parts, but not all, of the
                    complex idea of man, the mind, leaving out those parts which are peculiar to
                    man, and retaining those only which are common to all the living creatures,
                    frameth the idea of animal; which abstracts not only from all particular men,
                    but also from all birds, beasts, fishes, and insects. The constituent parts of
                    that abstract idea of animal are body, life, sense, and spontaneous motion. By
                    <hi rend="italic">body</hi> is meant body without any particular shape or
                    figure, there being no one shape or figure common to all animals, without
                    covering, either of hair, or feathers, or scales, &amp;c. and yet not naked;
                    hair, feathers, scales, and nakedness, being the distinguishing properties of
                    particular animals, and for that reason left out of the abstract idea. Upon the
                    same account, the spontaneous motion must be neither walking, nor flying, nor
                    creeping: it is nevertheless motion; but what that motion is, it is not easy to
                    conceive.</p>
                <p>“Whether others have this wonderful faculty of abstracting their ideas,”
                    continues the bishop, “they best can tell; for myself, I find indeed that I have
                    a faculty of imagining or representing to myself the ideas of those particular
                    things which I have perceived, and of variously compounding and dividing them. I
                    can imagine a man with two heads, or the upper parts of a man joined to the body
                    of a horse. I can consider the hand, the eye, the nose, each by itself
                    abstracted or separated from the rest of the body. But then, whatever hand or
                    eye I imagine, it must have some particular shape, and some particular colour.
                    Likewise the idea of man that I frame to myself, must be either of a white, or a
                    black, or a tawny, a straight or a crooked, a tall, or a low, or a middle-sized
                    man. I cannot by any effort <hi rend="italic">of</hi> thought conceive the
                    abstract idea above described. To be plain, I own myself able to abstract in one
                    sense, as when I consider some particular parts or qualities separated from
                    others with which, though they are united in some objects, yet it is possible
                    they may really exist without them. But I deny that I can abstract one from
                    another, or conceive separately those qualities which it is impossible should
                    exist so separated; or that I can frame a general notion by abstracting from
                    particulars in the manner aforesaid; and there are grounds to think most men
                    will acknowledge themselves to be in my case.”</p>
                <p>To think this, there are indeed such good grounds, that it is probable some of
                    our readers, little conversant with the writings of modern metaphysicians, are
                    by this time disposed to suspect, that the bishop, in his zeal, may have
                    misrepresented the doctrine of abstraction; as no man in his senses, who is not
                    perverted by some darling hypothesis, can suppose himself capable of tagging
                    together such monstrous inconsistencies, as magnitude which is neither great nor
                    small, and colour which is neither white, red, green, nor black, &amp;c. But
                    that the ingenious <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207921"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7921-0623"/>prelate, in his account of this process of looping
                    and pruning, as Mr Harris contemptuously but most properly terms it, has not
                    exaggerated in the smallest degree, is apparent from the following account of
                    abstraction given by Mr Locke. “Abstract ideas,” says that writer, "are not so
                    obvious or easy to children, or the yet unexercised mind, as particular ones. If
                    they seem so to grown men, it is only because by constant and familiar use they
                    are made so; for when we nicely reflect upon them, we shall find that general
                    ideas are fictions and contrivances of the mind, that carry difficulty with
                    them, and do not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to imagine. For
                    example, does it not require somè pains and skill to form the general idea of a
                    triangle (which is yet none of the most abstract, comprehensive, and difficult)?
                    for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural,
                    nor scalenon, but all and none of these at once. In effect, it is something
                    imperfect that cannot exist, an idea wherein some parts of several different and
                    inconsistent ideas are put together.” “Surely,” to use the words of Principal
                    Campbell,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Philosophy of
                    Rhetoric.</p></note> “the bare mention of this hypothesis is equivalent to a
                    confutation of it, since it really confutes itself.” But if any man has the
                    faculty of framing in his mind such an idea of a triangle as is here described,
                    it would be vain in us to dispute with him; for we are possessed of no such
                    faculty, and therefore would fight on unequal terms. All we have to desire is,
                    that the reader would fully and certainly inform himself whether he has such an
                    idea or not; and this can be no hard task to perform. What is more easy for any
                    one than to look a little into his own thoughts, and there try whether he has,
                    or can attain to have, an idea of colour separated from all extension; of
                    extension which is neither great nor small; of taste which is neither sweet, nor
                    bitter, nor acid, nor agreeable, nor disagreeable; or the general idea of a
                    triangle which is neither oblique nor rectangle, equicrural, equilateral, nor
                    scalenon, but all and none of these at once?<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Dr Reid having denied that there are or can be in the mind any ideas of sensible
                    objects, rejects of course the doctrine of abstract general ideas, whilst he
                    maintains in fact the very same thing, only substituting the word conception for
                    the word idea. “What hinders me,” says he, “from attending to the whiteness of
                    the paper before me, without applying that colour to any other object?” We know
                    nothing indeed which can hinder any man from performing this operation, which is
                    daily and hourly performed by infants; but will the doctor say that he can
                    attend to colour, or conceive it, abstracted from the paper and every other
                    surface? We are persuaded that he will not, though he immediately adds, “the
                    whiteness of this individual object is an abstract conception.” Now we should
                    rather have thought, that, consistently with his own notions of colour, he would
                    have called the whiteness of the paper a concrete quality, and his own
                    conception of it a particular and concrete conception. If he conceives the
                    whiteness as separated from the paper, it is no longer the whiteness of that
                    individual object; and he must either conceive it as abstracted from all
                    objects, which is plainly impossible; or he must conceive it as inhering in some
                    other object, and then neither the quality of whiteness, nor his conception of
                    it, is abstract in general, but concrete and particular. He affirms, however,
                    “that in abstraction, strictly so called, he can perceive nothing that is
                    difficult either to be understood or practised.” This is going much farther into
                    the doctrine than Mr Locke went; for he owned that there was much difficulty in
                    it. But let us see how it becomes so easy to Dr Reid. “What can be more easy,”
                    says he, “than to distinguish the different attributes which we know to belong
                    to a subject? In a man, for instance, to distinguish his size, his complexion,
                    .his age, his fortune, his birth, his profession, and twenty other things that
                    belong to him.” All this indeed, and much more, we can do with the utmost ease;
                    but this is not abstraction strictly so called, nor any thing like abstraction.
                    We distinguish the size, the complexion, the age, and other attributes, of the
                    man, from one another; but still we conceive them all as his qualities; nor is
                    it possible, at least for us, to abstract them from him, without conceiving them
                    as the qualities of some other man; so that our conceptions are all concrete and
                    particular. “It ought likewise to be observed,” says the professor, “that
                    attributes may with perfect ease be distinguished and disjoined in our
                    conception, which cannot be actually separated in the subject.” They maybe so in
                    his conception, but certainly not in ours; for we can conceive nothing which may
                    not actually exist. “Thus,” continues he, “I can in a body distinguish its
                    solidity from its extension, and its weight from both. In extension I can
                    distinguish length, breadth, and thickness; yet none of these can be separated
                    from the body, or from one another. It is therefore certain, that attributes
                    which in their nature are absolutely inseparable from their subject, and from
                    one another, may be disjoined in our conception; one cannot exist without the
                    other, but one can be conceived without the other.” So far is this from being a
                    matter of certainty, that in every possible sense in which we can understand the
                    word <hi rend="italic">conception,</hi> it appears to us as evidently false as
                    that three and two are equal to nine. It is indeed not difficult to distinguish
                    in a body its solidity from its extension, and its weight from both; but can we
                    distinguish them out of the body?.or, to speak in plain language, can we
                    conceive solidity as separated from all extension and all weight? Unless this
                    can be done, and by us it cannot be done, there is no abstraction strictly so
                    called. It is indeed easy to conceive solidity or extension abstracted from any
                    one individual object; but how is it done? Why, by transferring your attention
                    to some other individual object. Thus we can easily conceive solidity or
                    extension separated from a guinea, for instance; but it is only by transferring
                    our thoughts to another body, a piece of silver, or a ball of lead, &amp;c. and
                    our conceptions in both cases are particular and concrete.</p>
                <p>As we think this opinion of Dr Reid’s respecting <hi rend="italic"
                    >abstraction</hi> both ill founded and of dangerous consequences, we have
                    expressed our dissent from it in strong terms; and in doing so we have only
                    followed the example set us by himself when dissenting from the theories of Hume
                    and Berkeley. But we are so thoroughly convinced that the doctor’s acuteness is
                    superior to our own, that we are not without our fears that we may have mistaken
                    bis meaning. We are conscious that we have not wilfully misrepresented it; and
                    to enable our readers to judge for themselves between him and us, we shall lay
                    before them his definition of general conceptions, in his own words.</p>
                <p>That there are in every language general terms, is known to all mankind; for such
                    indeed are all substantives, proper names excepted, and all adjectives. But “it
                    is impossible,” says the doctor,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Essay on the Intellectual Powers of Man.</p></note> “that
                    words can have a general signification, unless there be conceptions in the mind
                    of the speaker and of the hearer, of things that are general.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207934" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7934-0624"/>
                <p>It is to such that I give the name of general conceptions; and it ought to be
                    observed, that they take this denomination, not from the act of the mind in
                    conceiving, which is an individual act, but from the object or thing conceived,
                    which is general.'’ Now, whatever is conceived must either be external to the
                    mind, or present with it. But the doctor himself acknowledges, “that all the
                    objects we perceive are individuals. Every object of sense, of memory, or of
                    consciousness, is an individual object. All the good things we enjoy or desire,
                    and all the evils we feel or fear, must come from individuals; and I think I may
                    venture to say, that every creature which God has made in the heavens above, or
                    in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth, is an individual.” If
                    this be so, and no man can call it in question, it is obvious that we can have
                    no general conception of any thing external. The act of conceiving is an
                    individual act; and therefore the only thing which can be general must be
                    something present with the mind, and different from the mere act of conceiving.
                    But what can this be, if not what Berkeley and others call an idea? and how can
                    we have an idea of which we are not conscious? Yet every thing of which we are
                    conscious, Dr Reid himself acknowledges to be an individual.</p>
                <p>But if the doctrine generally received respecting abstract ideas be so very
                    absurd as it has appeared in our representation, how comes it to be so prevalent
                    amongst the most acute philosophers? To this we answer, that those philosophers
                    have certainly in this instance been imposed upon by the structure of language.
                    Every adjective and every substantive, proper names excepted, are words of
                    general signification; and all science is conversant about general truth; but as
                    words are said to be significant, not of things, but of ideas, and as truth
                    results from the agreement or coincidence of ideas, it has been hastily
                    supposed, that, without general ideas, there could have been neither general
                    terms nor general truth. This is plausible, but it is not solid. Every object
                    which affects our senses is an individual object; but we perceive that two or
                    more objects which affect some of our senses very differently, affect others of
                    them in precisely the same way. Thus, the paper upon which one writes, the snow
                    which he perceives from his window, and the milk which he may use at breakfast,
                    affect his senses of touch and taste very differently, but they present the same
                    appearances to his eye. This diversity in the one case he believes to proceed
                    from different powers or qualities in the several objects; and the sameness of
                    appearance in the other, from similar qualities in these objects. To the similar
                    qualities, though he can frame no idea of them abstracted from every individual
                    object, he gives one common name, and calls every object which presents the same
                    appearance to his eye that snow does, a white object; in which case the word <hi
                    rend="italic">white</hi> does not stand for an abstract idea, but for a quality
                    inherent in one or more objects. Hence the origin of adjectives in ianguage,
                    which denote more than can be expressed by any class of substantives; for every
                    adjective, besides the power of a name, includes in itself the force of a
                    conjunction. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Grammar.)</hi></p>
                <p>The other class of general terms comprehends substantives, of which the origin is
                    as follows. The objects about which we have occasion to speak or write are so
                    numerous and so fluctuating, that if every individual had a proper name, a
                    complete language could never be formed. But as there are not perhaps in nature
                    two objects that appear to us similar in all respects, so are there not in
                    nature two objects which affect all our senses differently. The mind, therefore,
                    either actually perceiving two or more objects at once, or contemplating the
                    ideas left by two or more objects in the memory, perceives, by its intellectual
                    power, in what respects they agree and in what they disagree.</p>
                <p>If the agreement be striking, and hold in more qualities than one, it combines
                    the several individuals into one class or species, giving to the whole a common
                    name, which equal- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ly denotes the species and
                    every individual belonging to it. Thus, observing that Peter, James, and John,
                    agree in having the same erect form, in walking on two legs, in having two
                    hands, &amp;c., and being endowed with reason, we combine these three, and all
                    other individuals which we perceive to agree in the same striking and important
                    qualities, into one species, to which we give the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >man,</hi> a word which equally denotes the whole species and every individual
                    of it. Again, contemplating a number of figures, which all agree in the
                    circumstance of being bounded by three straight lines meeting one another so as
                    to form three angles, we call the whole class of figures and each individual by
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">triangle,</hi> although it may be impossible to
                    contemplate any number of triangles without perceiving that all the angles of
                    one are acute; that one angle of another is a right angle; and that in the third
                    there is one angle obtuse; but the word <hi rend="italic">triangle,</hi> unless
                    it be limited in its signification by the addition of an adjective, is equally
                    expressive of an acute-angled triangle, a right-angled triangle, and an
                    obtuse-angled triangle. By thus arranging individuals according to their most
                    conspicuous qualities, we may combine all the objects existing into so many
                    classes or species, which shall be afterwards known by as many names; but of
                    each species we neither have nor can have any other idea than that of a
                    multitude of similar individuals.</p>
                <p>As our acquaintance with nature enlarges, we discover resemblances, striking and
                    important, between one species and another, which naturally begets the notion of
                    a higher class called a genus. From comparing man with beasts, birds, fishes,
                    and reptiles, we perceive that they are all alike possessed of life, or a
                    principle of sensation and action, and of an organized body; hence we rank them
                    ail under a higher class or genus, to which we give the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">animal</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which equally denotes the
                    whole genus, each species comprehended under that genus, and every individual of
                    every species. Thus, animal is a genus: man, beast, bird, are so many species
                    comprehended under that genus; and Peter, James, and John, are individuals of
                    the species man. Peter, James, and John, are proper names, denoting each an
                    individual; man, beast, bird, are specific terms, denoting each a whole species,
                    comprising many individuals; and animal is a general term, because it denotes a
                    whole genus, comprehending under it several species, of which each consists of
                    many individuals; and the general term denotes either the whole genus, all the
                    species, or any individual of all the species. This is the whole mystery of
                    abstraction; they are merely terms that in strictness of speech are general and
                    abstract; and even these are general only as signs, of which the full
                    signification cannot always be represented by any conceivable idea.</p>
                <p>“It is a received opinion,” says Bishop Berkeley, “that language has no other end
                    but the communicating of our ideas, and that every significant name stands for
                    an idea. This being so; and it being withal certain, that names, which yet are
                    not thought altogether insignificant, do not always mark out particular
                    conceivable ideas; it is straightway concluded that they stand for abstract
                    notions·. That there are many names in use amongst speculative men, which do not
                    always suggest to others determinate particular ideas, is what nobody will deny;
                    and a little attention will discover, that it is not necessary, even in the
                    strictest reasonings, that significant names, which stand for ideas, should,
                    every time they are used, excite in the understanding the ideas they are made to
                    stand for. In reading and discoursing, names are for the most part used as
                    letters in algebra; in which, though a particular quantity<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194207947" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7947-0625"/> be marked by each letter,
                    yet, to proceed right, it is not requisite that in every step each letter
                    suggest to our thoughts that particular quantity it was appointed to stand for.”
                    The same thing is true of ideas, which, as well as names, are often used merely
                    as signs representing a whole class; and hence they may on that account be
                    called general, though every idea is in itself strictly particular. Thus, “an
                    idea, which considered in itself is particular, becomes general by being made to
                    represent or stand for all other particular ideas of the same sort. To make this
                    plain by example, suppose a geometrician is demonstrating the method of cutting
                    a line in two equal parts: he draws, for instance, a black line of an inch in
                    length; this, which in itself is a particular line, is nevertheless, with regard
                    to its signification, general, since, as it is there used, it represents all
                    particular lines whatsoever; and hence what is demonstrated of it is
                    demonstrated of all lines, or, in other words, of a line in general. And as that
                    particular line becomes general by being made a sign, so the name line, and the
                    idea of a line in the imagination, either of which taken absolutely is
                    particular, by being signs are made general likewise. And as the former owes its
                    generality, not to its being the sign of an abstract or general line, but of all
                    particular right lines that may possibly exist, so the latter, the name and the
                    idea, must be thought to derive their generality from the same cause, namely,
                    the various particular lines which each of them indifferently denotes.” Again,
                    when one demonstrates any proposition concerning triangles, it is to be supposed
                    that he has in view to demonstrate an universal truth; yet the particular
                    triangle which he considers must be either equilateral, isosceles, or scalenon;
                    for a plain triangle, winch is none of these, can neither exist nor be
                    conceived. But whether it be of this or that sort is of no importance, as any of
                    them may equally stand for and represent all rectilineal triangles, and on that
                    account be denominated universal.</p>
                <p>This doctrine respecting names and ideas being used merely as signs, has been
                    adopted by almost every sub-sequert t philosopher; and by Principal Campbell it
                    has been illustrated with a perspicuity and acuteness every way worthy of the
                    author of the Dissertation on Miracles. “In confirmation of this doctrine,” says
                    he,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Philosophy of
                    Rhetoric.</p></note> “it may be observed, that we really think by signs, as well
                    as speak by them. All the truths which constitute science, which give exercise
                    to reason, and are discovered by philosophy, are general; all our ideas, in the
                    strictest sense of the word, are particular. All the particular truths about
                    which we are conversant are properly historical, and compose the furniture of
                    memory. Nor do I include under the term historical the truths which belong to
                    natural history, for even these too are general. Now, beyond particular truth or
                    historical facts, first perceived and then remembered, we should never be able
                    to proceed one single step in thinking, any more than in conversing, without the
                    use of signs.</p>
                <p>“When it is affirmed that the whole is equal to all its parts, there cannot be an
                    affirmation which is more perfectly intelligible, or which commands a fuller
                    assent. If, in order to comprehend this, I recur to ideas, all that I can do is
                    to form a notion of some individual whole, divided into a certain number of
                    parts of which it is constituted, suppose of the year divided into the four
                    seasons. Now all that I can be said to discern here is the relation of equality
                    between this particular whole and its component parts. If I recur to another
                    example, I only perceive another particular truth. The same holds of a third and
                    of a fourth. But so far am I, after the perception of ten thousand particular
                    similar instances, from the discovery of the universal truth, that if the mind
                    had not the power of considering things as signs, or particular ideas as
                    representing an infinity of others, resembling in one circumstance though
                    totally dissimilar in every other, I could not so much as conceive the meaning
                    of an universal truth. Hence it is that some ideas, to adopt the expression of
                    Berkeley, are particular in their nature, but general in their
                    representation.”</p>
                <p>But if, in universal propositions, ideas particular in themselves be used only as
                    the signs of others, it may be demanded, how we can know any proposition to be
                    true of all the ideas which are represented by the sign. For example, having
                    demonstrated that the three angles of an isosceles rectangular triangle are
                    equal to two right ones, how can we conclude that this affection therefore
                    agrees to all other triangles which have neither a right angle nor two equal
                    sides? To this question Bishop Berkeley and Principal Campbell give the same
                    answer. Although the idea we have in view whilst we make the demonstration be
                    that of an isosceles rectangular triangle, whose sides are of a determinate
                    length, we may yet be certain that the demonstration extends to all other
                    rectilineal triangles, of what sort or bigness soever, for this plain reason,
                    that neither the equality nor the determinate length of the sides, nor the right
                    angle, are at all concerned in the demonstration. It is true, the idea or
                    diagram we have in view includes all these particulars; but then there is not
                    the least mention made of them in the proof of the proposition. It is not said
                    the three angles are equal to two right angles, because one of them is a right
                    angle, or because the sides comprehending it are of equal length; which
                    sufficiently shows that the right angle might have been oblique and the sides
                    unequal, and for all that the demonstration have held good. In every one of
                    Euclid’s theorems, a particular triangle, and a particular parallelogram, and a
                    particular circle, are employed as signs to denote all triangles, all
                    parallelograms, and all circles. When a geometrician makes a diagram with chalk
                    upon a board, and from it demonstrates the property of a straight-lined figure,
                    no spectator ever imagines that he is demonstrating a property of nothing else
                    but'that individual white figure, five inches long, which is before him. Every
                    one is satisfied that he is demonstrating a property of all of that order,
                    whether more or less extensive, of which it is both an example and a sign; all
                    the order being understood to agree with it in certain characters, however
                    different in other respects. Nay, what is more, the mind with the utmost
                    facility extends or contracts the representative power of the sign as the
                    particular occasion requires. Thus the same equilateral triangle will with equal
                    propriety serve for the demonstration, not only of a property of aD equilateral
                    triangles, but of a property of all isosceles triangles, or even of a property
                    of all triangles whatsoever. Nay, so perfectly is this matter understood, that
                    if the demonstrator in any part should recur to some property belonging to the
                    particular figure he has constructed, but not essential to the kind mentioned in
                    the proposition, and which the particular figure is solely intended to
                    represent, every intelligent observer would instantly detect the fallacy; so
                    entirely for all the purposes of science does a particular serve for a whole
                    species or genus. Now, why one visible individual should in our reasonings
                    serve, without the smallest inconvenience, as a sign for an infinite number, and
                    yet one conceivable individual, or a particular idea of imagination, should not
                    be adapted to answer the same end, it will, we imagine, be utterly impossible to
                    say.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207960" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7960-0626"/>
                <p>It must, however, be confessed that there is a considerable difference in kind
                    between ideas used as signs and the general terms of any language. Amongst all
                    the individuals of a species, or even of the highest genus, there is still a
                    natural connection, as they agree in the specific or generic character; and when
                    the mind makes use of any positive idea as the sign of the species or genus,
                    that idea appears in the imagination as an exact resemblance of some one
                    individual. But the connection which subsists between words and things, or even
                    between words and ideas, is in its origin arbitrary; and yet its effect upon the
                    mind is much the same with that of the natural connection between ideas and
                    things. For having often had occasion to observe particular words used as signs
                    of particular things, and specific terms used as signs of a whole species, we
                    contract a habit of associating the sign with the thing signified, insomuch
                    that, either being presented to the mind, necessarily introduces or occasions
                    the apprehension of the other. Custom in this instance operates precisely in the
                    same manner as natural resemblance in the other, so that certain sounds, and the
                    ideas of things to which they are not naturally related, come to be as
                    thoroughly linked together in our conceptions as the ideas of things and things
                    themselves. Nay, so completely are they linked together, that we often use,
                    throughout long chains of reasoning, certain sounds or words, without attending
                    at all to the ideas or notions of which they are signs. “I believe,” says the
                    author of a Treatise on Human Nature, “that every one who examines the situation
                    of his mind in reasoning will agree with me that we do not annex distinct and
                    complete ideas to every term we make use of; and that in talking of government,
                    church, negociation, conquest, we seldom spread out in our minds all the simple
                    ideas of which the compound notions signified by these terms are composed. It
                    is, however, observable, that notwithstanding this imperfection, we may avoid
                    talking nonsense on these subjects, and may perceive any repugnance amongst the
                    ideas, as well as if we had a full comprehension of them.” This remark generally
                    holds true; but then it is to be observed that all the words used as signs, and
                    which yet do not denote any one conceivable determinate idea, must be capable of
                    definition. Thus, in matters that are perfectly familiar, in simple narration,
                    or in moral observations on the occurrences of life, a man of common
                    understanding may be deceived by specious falsehood, but is hardly to be gulled
                    by downright nonsense or a repugnance of ideas. Almost all the possible
                    applications of the terms, or, in other words, all the acquired relations of the
                    signs, have become customary to him. The consequence is, that an unusual
                    application of any of them is instantly detected; this detection breeds doubt;
                    and this doubt occasions an immediate recourse to definition, which, proceeding
                    through species and genera, resolves complex terms into others less complex,
                    until it ends at last in simple ideas and relations, which can neither be
                    defined nor misunderstood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>For a further view of this subject, see some excellent observations on the
                    common doctrine concerning abstraction, by Mr Du∙ gald Stewart. <hi

                <p>Thus, then, we see, that though there are no ideas, properly speaking, general
                    and abstract, a man may, by terms and particular ideas, used as signs, arrive at
                    the knowledge of general truth. In neither case is it the matter, if we may be
                    allowed the expression, but the power of the sign that is regarded by the mind.
                    We find that, even in demonstrative reasonings, signs the most arbitrary, or
                    mere symbols, may be used with as little danger of error as ideas or natural
                    signs. The operations both of the algebraist and arithmetician are strictly of
                    the nature of demonstration. The one employs as signs the letters of the
                    alphabet, the other certain numerical characters. In neither of these arts is it
                    necessary to form ideas of the quantities and sums signified; in some instances
                    it is even impossible, without resolving the quantity or sum into parts, in a
                    manner analogous to definition, and then the mind comprehends not the whole
                    quantity or number at once, but the several parts of which it is composed, which
                    it connects by the relation of junction or addition. Yet without this resolution
                    the equations and calculations carried on by means of the letters and figures
                    significant of the whole quantity or of the whole sum, are not the less accurate
                    or convincing. And so much for abstraction, generalization, and the power of
                    signs, whether natural or artificial.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">chap.</hi> V.—OF THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS.</p>
                <p>Every man whilst awake is conscious of a continued train of thought spontaneously
                    arising in his mind and passing through it, nor could a single now or instant be
                    pitched upon in which some idea is not present in his memory or imagination. No
                    one idea, however, unless detained by a voluntary exertion of the mind, or
                    unless productive ofin-tense pleasure or pain, remains long in the imagination;
                    but each hastens off the stage to make way for another, which takes its turn,
                    and is succeeded by a third, &amp;c. We are not to imagine that this train of
                    thought is altogether fortuitous and incoherent. “It is evident,” says Mr Hume,
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> “that there is a principle of connection between
                    different thoughts or ideas of the mind, and that, in their appearance to the
                    memory or imagination, they introduce each other with a certain degree of method
                    and regularity. In our more serious thinking or discourse this is so observable,
                    that any particular thought which breaks in upon the regular track or chain of
                    ideas is immediately remarked and rejected. Even in our wildest and most
                    wandering reveries, nay, in our very dreams, we shall find·, if we reflect, that
                    the imagination ran not altogether at adventures, but that there was still a
                    connection upheld amongst the different ideas which succeeded each other. Were
                    the loosest and freest conversation to be transcribed, there would immediately
                    be observed something which connected it in al <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    its transitions; or, where this is wanting, the person who broke the thread of
                    discourse might still inform you, that there had secretly revolved in his mind a
                    succession of thoughts, which had gradually led him from the subject of
                    conversation. Amongst different languages, even where we cannot suspect the
                    least connection or communication, it is found that words expressive of ideas
                    the most compounded do yet nearly correspond to each other; a certain proof that
                    the simple ideas comprehended in the compound ones were bound together by some
                    universal principle, which had an equal influence on all mankind.”</p>
                <p>That these observations are well founded, every man may be satisfied by looking
                    attentively into his own thoughts; but when the author reduces the principles of
                    this association of ideas to three, viz. resemblance, contiguity in time and
                    place, and cause or effect, he certainly contracts them within too narrow a
                    compass. That these principles often serve to connect ideas, will not indeed be
                    denied. A picture leads our thoughts to the original; the mention of one
                    apartment in a building introduces an inquiry or discourse concerning the
                    others; and if we think of a wound, we can hardly forbear reflecting on the pain
                    which follows it. But surely ideas sometimes succeed each other without
                    resemblance, without contiguity in time or in place, and without being connected
                    by the relation of a cause to its <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207973"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7973-0627"/>effect. Besides all this, there are other
                    associations than those of ideas. Ideas are associated with passions and
                    emotions, and passions and emotions are associated together. A particular idea
                    is associated with a proper name, and often with the general name of the
                    species. General conceptions, such as those which Mr Locke calls mixed modes,
                    are associated with signs both audible and visible, and signs are associated
                    with each other. Surely virtue, as it consists in action and intention, does not
                    resemble the sound virtue, is not contiguous to it in time or in place, and is
                    neither its cause nor its effect; noris it conceivable that the arbitrary signs
                    of different things should have any natural relation to one another.</p>
                <p>But were the enumeration complete, the bare mention of these principles does not
                    account for the phenomena; for, granting the fact, it may still be asked, why
                    does a picture lead our thoughts to the original, or the mention of one
                    apartment in a building introduce an inquiry concerning the others? To these
                    questions our author has given no answer; nor are we acquainted with any writer
                    who can be said to have attempted it, excepting Dr Hartley and his ingenious
                    editor. There may be some of our readers whom the names of these men will
                    prejudice against their theory; but, doubtless, the greater part are willing to
                    adopt truth, or to examine an ingenious speculation, from whatever quarter it
                    comes. To such as feel themselves otherwise disposed, we beg leave to say, that
                    if they allow the name of Priestley to disgust them at what follows, they will
                    furnish him with a new proof of the truth of the doctrine which they reject.</p>
                <p>That ideas should be associated together, seems to be inevitable from the manner
                    in which the mind acquires them. All our ideas, properly speaking, are those of
                    sensible objects, and by far the greater part of them of visible objects. But
                    every sensible object conveys at once various sensations and perceptions to the
                    mind, which appear not only united in fact, but inseparable in imagination.
                    Thus, when a man looks at any particular object, a tree, for instance, he
                    perceives the trunk, branches, leaves, size, shape, and colour, &amp;c. of the
                    whole at once; he does not first perceive the figure of the trunk, then its
                    size, then its colour, then the branches, &amp;c. all in succession; but a
                    perception of the whole is conveyed to the mind by one simultaneous impression.
                    We have already seen that the senses, in fact, convey nothing to the mind but
                    their respective sensations, and that the perception of the external object
                    instantly follows the sensation. We have likewise seen that sensation is
                    occasioned by some impression, concussion, or vibration, given to the nerves and
                    brain, and by them communicated to the mind or percipient being. We have
                    likewise seen that memory depends as much upon the brain as original sensation,
                    and is always attended or occasioned by similar concussions or vibrations,
                    &amp;c. These are facts proved by universal experience, and which, we believe,
                    no thinking man has ever called in question. It follows, therefore, that every
                    actual sensation must leave some effect in the brain, either an actual print,
                    which seems to be impossible, or a tendency to vibrate or be agitated in the
                    same way as when the original impression was made. This being the case, it is
                    natural to conclude, that when any part of the original perception is revived in
                    the memory, the whole perception should be revived at once, so as that we cannot
                    have an idea of the trunk of a tree without perceiving the ideas of the branches
                    associated with it. This is indeed not merely natural, but the contrary seems to
                    be impossible; for as the original agitation or vibration was occasioned by the
                    whole tree, it is evident, that whatever effect or tendency that agitation or
                    vibration left behind it, must be left by the whole vibration, and therefore be
                    equally related to the whole tree.</p>
                <p>But no object stands single in nature. When we view a tree, or any thing else, we
                    always notice, however transiently, the field where it grows and the objects
                    around it. These two leave effects in the brain at the same time that the tree
                    does so, and therefore make their appearance with it in the memory or
                    imagination; but if the tree was the object to which we principally attended
                    during the actual sensation, the idea of it will be much more vivid than the
                    idea of its adjuncts, and remain much longer in the imagination or memory;
                    because the original sensation by which it was perceived had struck much deeper
                    than the sensation by which its adjuncts were perceived. All this must be
                    intelligible to every one who attends to what we have already said of sensation,
                    perception, and memory.</p>
                <p>Thus we see why a picture leads our thoughts to the original, and why the mention
                    of one apartment in a building introduces an inquiry concerning the others. It
                    is not merely because the picture resembles the original, and because the
                    apartments of a building are contiguous. Between a plain surface, variously
                    coloured and shaded, and the contour of the human face, there is certainly very
                    little real resemblance, as any man may be convinced who places his eye within
                    six inches of a good picture. But the painter having, by his skill in
                    perspective, contrived to lay his colours on the plain canvass in such a manner
                    as that they reflect the same rays of light with the original, provided the
                    spectator stand at the proper distance; these rays proceeding from the picture
                    fall upon the eye in the same direction, and therefore give to the nerves and
                    brain the very same impulse which was given by the original. When one apartment
                    of a building is mentioned, we inquire concerning the others from the very same
                    cause that, when we think of the trunk of a tree which we have seen, we cannot
                    avoid thinking likewise of its branches.</p>
                <p>But the principle of association takes place amongst things not naturally
                    connected, as the apartments of a building, and a substance with its attributes
                    and adjuncts. It is association which is the original source of all the general
                    or complex conceptions which we have, and which even gives meaning to the words
                    of every language. Between sounds considered in themselves, and things, or the
                    ideas of things, every one knows that there is no natural connection; yet the
                    idea of every known object is in the mind of every man so strictly associated
                    with the name which it bears in its native tongue, that the presence of the one
                    always suggests the other. It cannot indeed be otherwise, if we attend to the
                    manner in which a child learns to affix a meaning to the words which he hears. A
                    child knows his mother and nurse, and indeed almost every visible object in the
                    family, long before he acquires the power of articulation. The impressions made
                    by these objects, and repeated daily and hourly on his brain, every one of which
                    excites a sensation, must soon become so deep as not to be easily effaced.
                    Numbers of them, too, are associated together, so that the presence of one
                    introduces the other. It has been already observed, that ideas of sight are the
                    most vivid and the most lasting; but the child hearing the same sound often
                    repeated, even that sound comes in time to leave in his memory a permanent idea.
                    He then hears the sound <hi rend="italic">nurse,</hi> for instance, uttered at
                    the time when he is earnestly looking at the person of the nurse, with whom he
                    is well acquainted, and to whom he is strongly attached; and having the two
                    ideas repeatedly excited together, they soon become so associated, that the one
                    necessarily excites the other; the word <hi rend="italic">nurse</hi> calls into
                    view the idea of the woman treasured up in his imagination.</p>
                <p>But we need not have recourse to children for the proof of our assertion. It is
                    obvious that the name of every simple and uncompounded idea can be significant
                    only by association. Of a complex conception the name may be made intelligible
                    by a definition; but simple ideas cannot be defined, and between ideas and
                    sounds there is no natural<pb break="no" facs="nls:194207986"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7986-0628"/> connection, so as that the one previously to
                    association should suggest the other. Even of complex conceptions and mixed
                    modes, the meaning of the names is generally acquired by association; for though
                    it is certainly true that all such names are capable of definition, they are yet
                    used with sufficient propriety by thousands who know not what a definition is.
                    Were a plain unlettered man asked to define virtue, it is not probable that he
                    could do it so as to make himself understood, yet having ideas of the practice
                    ofjustice, charity, fortitude, &amp;c. strictly associated in his mind with the
                    word <hi rend="italic">virtue,</hi> he may understand the general meaning of
                    that word as well as the most acute grammarian or the most profound
                    philosopher.</p>
                <p>An alms is a donation to a poor man; but a child who never heard of this
                    definition knows perfectly what an alms is, from having often seen his parents
                    give money to a beggar, and call what they were doing by the name <hi
                    rend="italic">alms.</hi> The sound of the word, after having seen the first alms
                    given, will excite in his mind an idea of the individual object who received it,
                    and of the action of him by whom it was given; but after having seen several
                    poor men relieved, he comes to associate with the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >alms</hi> any thing given to any person who needs it, or appears to be in
                    want.</p>
                <p>So completely does this association take place between ideas or clusters of
                    ideas, and the words by which they are expressed, that even men of letters hear
                    and understand perfectly many words, without reviewing in their minds all the
                    ideas and relations of which they are the signs. It has been already observed,
                    that in talking of government, church, negociation, conquest, we seldom spread
                    out in our minds all the simple ideas of which the compound notions signified by
                    these terms are composed; and we now add, that the terms may be used with
                    sufficient propriety, and be perfectly understood, by those who never attempted
                    to analyze the notions of which they are significant, into their primary and
                    constituent parts. Every man has read numberless details of the transactions of
                    one court with another; he has heard such transactions universally called by the
                    term <hi rend="italic">negociation.</hi> The term and the transactions signified
                    by it are so closely associated in his mind, that they are in a manner
                    inseparable, and by this association he knows the meaning of the term better
                    than he could have done by the most complete definition, which, perhaps, he
                    would find it difficult to give, or even to comprehend.</p>
                <p>We have said that the meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi> is
                    acquired by association, by having often heard that sound applied to certain
                    actions; but it is extremely probable that the very notion of virtue, simple and
                    uncompounded as it appears to be, is acquired in the very same manner. The first
                    rudiments of the notions of right and wrong and obligation seem to be acquired
                    by a child when he finds himself checked and controlled by superior power. At
                    first he feels nothing but mere force, and consequently has no notion of any
                    kind of restraint but that of necessity. He finds he cannot have his will, and
                    therefore he submits. Afterwards he attends to many circumstances which
                    distinguish the commands of a father, or of a master, from those of any other
                    person. Notions of reverence, love, esteem, and dependence, are connected with
                    the idea of him who gives those commands; and by degrees the child experiences
                    the peculiar advantages of filial subjection. He sees also that all his
                    companions who are noticed and admired by others obey their parents, and that
                    those who are of a refractory disposition are universally disliked. These and
                    other circumstances now begin to alter and modify the notion of mere necessity,
                    till by degrees he considers the commands of a parent as something that must not
                    be resisted or disputed, even though he has a power of doing it; and all these
                    ideas coalescing, form the notions of moral right and moral obligation, which
                    are easily transferred from the commands of a parent to those of a magistrate,
                    of God, and of conscience. This opinion of the gradual formation of the ideas of
                    moral right and wrong, from a great variety of elements associated together,
                    perfectly accounts for that prodigious diversity in the sentiments of mankind
                    respecting the objects of moral obligation; nor do we see that any other
                    hypothesis can account for the facts. If the notion of moral obligation were a
                    simple uncompounded idea, arising from the view of certain actions or
                    sentiments; or were it acquired, as it certainly might be, by a chain of
                    reasoning from the nature of God and the nature of man; why should it not in the
                    one case be as invariable as the perception of colours or sounds, and in the
                    other as our judgments of mathematical or physical truths? But though the shape
                    and colour of a flower appear the same to every human eye; though every man of
                    common understanding knows, that if a billiard ball be struck by another, it
                    will move from its place with a velocity proportioned to the force of the
                    impulse; and though all mankind who have but dipped into mathematics perceive
                    that any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side; yet one
                    man practises as a moral duty what another looks upon with abhorrence, and
                    reflects on with remorse. Now, a thing that varies with education and
                    instruction, as moral sentiments are known to do, certainly has the appearance
                    of being generated by a series of different impressions and associations in some
                    such manner as we have endeavoured to describe. Let not any man imagine that
                    this account of the origin of moral sentiments endangers the cause of virtue;
                    for whether those sentiments be instinctive or acquired, their operation is the
                    very same, and in either case their rectitude must often be tried by the test of
                    reason, so that the interests of virtue are equally safe on this as on any other
                    scheme.</p>
                <p>This principle of association has so great an influence over all our actions,
                    passions, reasonings, and judgments, that there is not perhaps any one thing
                    which deserves more to be looked after in the education of youth. Some of our
                    ideas, such as those of a substance and its attributes, a genus and the species
                    contained under it, a species and its several individuals, have a real
                    connection with each other in nature. These it is the office of our reason to
                    trace out and to hold together in that union and order in which nature presents
                    them to the view of the mind; for such associations constitute perhaps the
                    greatest part of necessary and of useful truths. But there are others formed by
                    custom and caprice, which are too often the sources of error, superstition,
                    vice, and misery; of errors the more dangerous, and of vice the more deplorable,
                    that if the associations have been long formed without an attempt to dissolve
                    them, they generally become at last too strong to be broken by the most vigorous
                    effort of the best-disposed mind. Thus, let a foolish maid<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Locke’s Essay, and his Conduct of the
                    Understanding.</p></note> amuse or rather frighten children with stories of
                    ghosts appearing in the dark, let her repeat these fictions till they have made
                    a deep impression on the young minds, and the notion of ghosts will in time
                    become so closely associated with the idea of darkness, that the one shall
                    always introduce the other; and it may not be in the power of the children,
                    after they have become men, and are convinced in their judgments of the
                    falsehood and absurdity of the tales which originally frightened them, to
                    eparate entirely the notion of ghosts from the idea of darkness, or with perfect
                    ease to remain alone in a dark room. Again, let the idea of infallibility be
                    annexed to any person or so.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207999" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7999-0629"/>
                <p>ciety, and let these two inseparably united constantly possess the mind, and then
                    one body in ten thousand places at once shall, unexamined, be swallowed as an
                    incontrovertible fact, whenever that infallible person or society dictates or
                    demands assent without inquiry.</p>
                <p>Some such erroneous and unnatural combinations of ideas will be found to
                    establish the irreconcileable opposition that we find between different sects in
                    philosophy and religion; for we cannot imagine every individual of any sect to
                    impose wilfully upon himself, and knowingly to reject truth offered by plain
                    reason. That which leads men of sincerity and good sense blindfold, will be
                    found, when inquired into, to be some early and erroneous association. Ideas
                    independent and of no alliance to one another, are by education, custom, and the
                    constant din of their party, so linked together in their minds, that they can no
                    more be separated from each other than if they were but one idea; and they
                    operate upon the judgment as if they really were but one. This gives sense to
                    jargon, the force of demonstration to absurdities, and consistency to nonsense:
                    it is the foundation of the greatest and most dangerous errors in the world;
                    for, as far as it obtains, it hinders men from seeing and examining</p>
                <p>Before we dismiss the subject of association, it may be proper to inquire how far
                    it is agreeable to the account which we have given of the manner in which
                    external objects are perceived by means of the senses, and the ideas of such
                    objects retained in the memory. It has been proved, we think, by arguments
                    unanswerable, that by the organs of sense nothing is conveyed immediately to the
                    mind but sensations which can have no resemblance to external objects, and that
                    the perception of an object may be resolved into a process of reasoning from
                    effects to causes. But children, it will be said, do not reason from effects to
                    causes, and yet they soon acquire the faculty of perceiving and distinguishing
                    the objects with which they are surrounded. This is an undoubted truth; and it
                    can be accounted for only by the principle of association. A child has as much
                    the use of his senses as a full-grown man. By his eye he has the sensation of
                    colour; by his nose, that of smell; by his ear he has the sensation of sound;
                    and by his hand he feels heat and cold, resistance and bounded resistance. Every
                    object which is presented to him impresses his mind with various sensations; and
                    these sensations combined together are probably all that he perceives for some
                    years, for there is no reason to imagine that a boy of one or two years old has
                    the slightest notion of what we mean by solidity, hardness, softness, or indeed
                    of that which is termed <hi rend="italic">substance.</hi> Yet when two or more
                    objects are present, he may easily distinguish the one from the other, because
                    the sensations excited by the one must differ from those excited by the other,
                    as much as the real qualities of the one are different from the real qualities
                    of the other; and by distinguishing between his own sensations, he in effect
                    distinguishes between the objects which produce these sensations. His
                    sensations, too, being frequently excited, leave behind them ideas in his memory
                    or imagination; and those ideas, from having been imprinted together and never
                    separated, become in time so closely associated, that whenever one of them is
                    called into view, the others necessarily make their appearance with it. Thus a
                    child has a set of combined sensations excited in his mind by the presence of
                    his nurse; he has a different cluster excited, suppose by the presence of his
                    mother. These are often repeated, and leave deep traëes behind them, so that
                    when the mother or the nurse makes her appearance, she is immediately recognised
                    as a known object; or, to speak more correctly, the child feels the very same
                    sensations which he has felt before, from which he has experienced pleasure, and
                    of which he has the ideas treasured up in his memory or imagination. A stranger,
                    on the other hand, must affect him with a set of new sensations, and of course
                    will be distinguished from a known object as accurately as if the child were
                    possessed of the notions of solidity, substance, qualities, and distance. A man
                    born blind, who knew not that such things as fire and snow had never existed,
                    would yet distinguish the one from the other the moment that he should be
                    brought within their influence. He could not indeed apply their names properly,
                    nor say which is the fire and which is the snow, nor would he at first have any
                    notion of either of them as a real, external, and distant object; but he would
                    certainly distinguish his own sensations, the sensation of heat from that of
                    cold. It is just so with a child. At first he perceives nothing but different
                    sensations. These he can distinguish; and as they are caused by different
                    objects, in distinguishing between the sensations he will appear to distinguish
                    between the objects themselves. In a short time, however, he acquires, by a
                    natural process, some inaccurate notions of distance. He looks, for instance,
                    earnestly in his nurse’s face, and at the same time touches her cheek perhaps by
                    accident. He repeats this operation frequently, till the sensation communicated
                    by his eye comes to be associated with that of his touch, and with the extending
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his arm; and being all treasured up as associated
                    ideas in the memory, the sight of his nurse makes him ever afterwards stretch
                    out his hands with a desire to touch her. All this while there is not the
                    slightest probability that the child has any notion of substance or qualities,
                    or of any thing beyond his own sensations, and the means by which he has
                    experienced that sensations which are pleasant may be obtained, and that such as
                    are painful may be avoided. The precise time at which a child begins to think of
                    external things we cannot pretend to ascertain; but we are persuaded that it is
                    later than many persons imagine, and certainly not until he has made
                    considerable progress in the exercise of reason. Prior to that period the things
                    whiclι men know to be bodies, are known to children only as sensations and ideas
                    strongly bound together by the tic of association.</p>
                <p>But if association be of such importance in the act of sensation, it is of still
                    greater in that of retention; for it seems to constitute the whole difference
                    that there is between imagination and memory. By many <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    the ancient, as well as by some modern philosophers, .these two faculties seem
                    to have been confounded with each other; but between them there is certainly a
                    great difference, though they likewise resemble each other in some respects. An
                    idea of memory, considered by itself, makes the very same appearance to the
                    intellect as an idea of imagination. We contemplate both as if they were equal,
                    though faint and distant, perceptions; but. the one is attended with the
                    conviction that it is the idea of an object which has really been perceived at
                    some period of past time; whilst the other is attended with no conviction,
                    except that the idea itself is actually present to the mind. Mr Hume has said
                    that ideas of memory differ from those of imagination only in being more vivid
                    and distinct; but certainly this is not always the case. An idea of imagination
                    has sometimes been taken for a real perception, which an idea of memory can
                    never be. The difference between these two kinds of ideas, we are persuaded,
                    arises chiefly, if not wholly, from association. Every idea of memory is
                    associated with many others, and those again with others, down to the very
                    moment of the energy of remembrance; whereas ideas of imagination are either the
                    voluntary creatures of the fancy at the moment of their appearance, in which
                    case we should call them conceptions, or they are ideas which we have actually
                    received from sensation, but which, on account of some link being broken in the
                    vast chain of association, we cannot refer to any real objects.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208012" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8012-0630"/>
                <p>What gives probability to this conjecture is, that ideas often appear in the mind
                    which we know not whether to refer to the memory or imagination; nothing being
                    more common than to hear a person say, I have in my head the idea of such or
                    such an object, but whether I remember or only imagine the object, I am very
                    uncertain. Afterwards, however, by turning the idea over and over in the mind,
                    he finds that other ideas make their appearance, till at last clusters of them
                    come into view, and associate so closely with the principal idea, which was the
                    object of doubt, as to convince the judgment that it is an idea of memory.</p>
                <p>It has been asked, Why we believe what we distinctly remember? and to that
                    question it has been supposed that no answer can be given. But it appears to us
                    that association is the ground of belief in this, as it will be found to be in
                    other instances; and that a man believes he washed his hands and face in the
                    morning, because the idea of that operation is so strongly linked in his mind to
                    the whole train of ideas which have arisen in it through the day, that he cannot
                    separate the first from the last, that which was a sensation in the morning,
                    from the sensations which are present at the instant of remembrance. As those
                    ideas are associated by nature, each must pass in review in its proper order, so
                    that in so short a space of time there is no danger, and hardly a possibility,
                    of taking the first for the last, or the last for the first. Nay, more, we will
                    venture to hazard an opinion that every past event of a man’s life, which he
                    distinctly remembers, is tied by the chain of association to his present
                    perceptions. That this is possible is certain, since it is not difficult to
                    conceive how it may be done. The principal events of a single day may surely be
                    so linked together as to be all distinctly viewed in a cluster of ideas on the
                    morrow. Of these events some one or other must be the most important, which will
                    therefore make its appearance as an idea more frequently than the rest, and be
                    more closely associated with the events of next day. Some event of that day
                    will, for the same reason, be more closely associated with it than the others,
                    and these two, dropping perhaps all the rest of their original companions, will
                    pass on together to the third day, and so on through weeks, and months, and
                    years. In the compass of a year, several things must occur to make deep
                    impressions on the mind. These will at first be associated together by events of
                    little importance, like the occurrences of a single day. Whilst these feeble
                    chains, however, continue unbroken, they will be sufficient to link the one
                    important event to the other, and to bring them both into view at the same time,
                    till at last these two, from appearing so often together, will in time unite of
                    themselves, and the intermediate ideas be completely effaced. Thus may two or
                    three important events of one year be associated with such a number of similar
                    events of another year, so that the ideas of the one shall always introduce to
                    the mind the ideas of the other; and this chain of association may pass from the
                    earliest event which we distinctly remember, through all the intermediate years
                    of our lives, down to the instant when memory is exerted.</p>
                <p>To this account of memory it may perhaps be objected, that it gives us no
                    distinct notion of time. Every thing that is remembered is necessarily believed
                    to have been present in some portion of past time; but association brings into
                    view nothing but a series of events. This objection will be seen to have no
                    weight when we have inquired into the nature of time, and ascertained what kind
                    of a thing it is. It will then perhaps appear, that duration itself, as
                    apprehended by us, is not distinguishable from a series of events; and that if
                    there were no train of thought passing through our minds, nor any motion amongst
                    the objects around us, time could have no existence. Meanwhile, whatever become
                    of thisoninion, we beg leave to observe, that our theory of remembrance is
                    perfectly consistent with the commonly-received notions respecting time; and
                    indeed that it is the only theory which can account for numberless phenomena
                    respecting past duration. It is universally allowed, that if motion, or a
                    succession of events, do not constitute time, it is the only thing by which time
                    can be measured. Now it is a fact which no man will deny, that the distance of
                    time from the present <hi rend="italic">now</hi> or instant to the earliest
                    period which he distinctly remembers, appears to his view extremely short, much
                    shorter than it is said to be in reality; and that one year, when he looks
                    forward, appears longer than two, perhaps longer than ten when he looks
                    backward. Upon our principles this fact is easily accounted for. We remember
                    nothing which is not linked by a chain of associations with the perceptions of
                    the present moment; and as none but a few of the most important events of our
                    lives can be linked together in this manner, it hence follows, that events
                    which, in the order of succession, were far distant from one another, must thus
                    be brought together in the memory, and the whole chain be contracted within very
                    short limits. But when we figure Jo ourselves a series of future events, we
                    employ the active power of fancy instead of the passive capacity of retention;
                    and can therefore bring within the compassof one periodical revolution of the
                    sun, a longer series of imaginary events succeeding each other, than is
                    preserved of real events in our memory from the earliest period of our
                    existence. So perfectly does our theory accord with this well-known fact. On the
                    other hand, if memory be an original faculty of the mind, totally independent of
                    association, and of which no other account is to be given than that it
                    necessarily commands our belief, why is it a faculty which, with regard to
                    duration, thus uniformly deceives us? and how comes it to pass, that to a man
                    whose memory is tenacious, who has read much, seen many countries, and been
                    engaged in various occurrences, any determinate portion of past time always
                    appears longer than to another man whose memory is feeble, and whose life has
                    been wasted in ease and idleness? To these questions we know not what answer can
                    be given, upon any other principle than that which makes the evidence of memory
                    depend upon association. But if we remember nothing but what is linked to the
                    perception or idea which is present with us at the time of remembrance, and if
                    duration be measured by the succession of events, it is obvious that any portion
                    of past time must necessarily appear longer to him who has many ideas associated
                    in the mind than to him who has but few.</p>
                <p>There is not perhaps a single fact of greater importance in the philosophy of the
                    human mind than the association of ideas; which, when thoroughly understood,
                    accounts for many of those phenomena which some distinguished writers have, with
                    injury to science and danger to morality, attributed to a number of distinct and
                    independent instincts. It is for this reason that we have considered it so
                    minutely, and dwelt upon it so long; and, in addition to what we have said on
                    the subject, we beg leave to recommend to our more philosophical readers the
                    diligent study of Hartley’s Observations on Man. In that work, we think, several
                    things are taken for granted which require proof; and some which, we are
                    persuaded, have no foundation in nature; but, with all its defects, it has more
                    merit than any other treatise on the sensitive part of human nature with which
                    we are acquainted.</p>
                <p>CHAP. VI. OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND REFLECTION.</p>
                <p>Sensation, remembrance, simple apprehension, and conception, with every other
                    actual energy or passion of the mind, is accompanied with an inward feeling or
                    perception <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208025" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8025-0631"/>of
                    that energy or passion; and that feeling or perception is termed <hi
                    rend="italic">consciousness.</hi> Consciousness is the perception of what passes
                    in a man’s own mind at the instant of its passing there; nor can we see, hear,

                    enjoy any pleasure, or suffer any pain, without being conscious of what we arc
                    doing, enjoying, or suffering. Consciousness is only of things present;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Reid’s Essays on the
                    Intellectual Powers of Man.</p></note> and to apply it to things past, is to
                    confound consciousness with memory or reflection. One cannot say that he is
                    conscious of what he has seen or heard and now remembers; he is only conscious
                    of the act of remembrance, which, though it respects a past event, is itself a
                    present energy. It is likewise to be observed, that consciousness is only of
                    things in the mind, or conscious being, and not of things external. It is
                    improper in any person to say tha <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> the is
                    conscious of the table before him; he perceives it, he sees it, and he may with
                    great propriety say that he is conscious he perceives or sees it; but he cannot
                    say that he is conscious of the table itself, for it is only his immediate
                    energy of perception that can be the object of consciousness. All the operations
                    of our minds are attended with consciousness, which is the only evidence that we
                    have or can have of their existence. Should a man take it into his head to think
                    or to say that his consciousness may deceive him, and to require a proof that it
                    cannot, we know of no proof that can be given him; he must be left to himself as
                    a man who denies first principles, without which there can be no reasoning.
                    Every attempt to prove this point, or to set it in a clearer light, would only
                    serve to render it more dark and unintelligible. I think, I feel, I exist, are
                    first truths, and the basis of all human knowledge.</p>
                <p>This has given rise to the question, whether Descartes did not fall into an
                    absurdity when, inferring his own existence from his actual thought, he said,
                    <hi rend="italic">Cogito,</hi><hi rend="italic">ergo sum.</hi> This argument has
                    been called a pitiful sophism, and a <hi rend="italic">petitio principii</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> because, before a man take it for granted that he thinks,
                    he must also, it is said, take it for granted that he exists, since there cannot
                    be thought where there is no existence. Now it must be confessed, that if
                    Descartes pretended by this argument to give us a fresh conviction of our own
                    existence, his endeavours were useless and puerile; because a man capable of
                    being convinced by the arguments of another must have a previous conviction of
                    his own existence. But the argument itself is neither a sophism nor a <hi
                    rend="italic">petitio principii.</hi> Those<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Buffer’s First Truth.</p></note> who defend Descartes
                    assert, and there is no reason to doubt the truth of their assertion, that his
                    only view in urging such an argument was not to prove the truth of our
                    existence, but to exhibit the order of that process by which we arrive at the
                    knowledge of the fact; and this he has very clearly done by analyzing the truth
                    into its first principles. A stone exists as well as the human mind; but has the
                    stone any knowledge of its own existence? No man will say that it has; and
                    neither should we have any knowledge of ours, did we think as little as the
                    stone. We certainly might exist without thinking, as it is probable that we do
                    in very sound sleep; and in that state our existence might be known to other
                    beings, but it could not possibly be known to ourselves; for the only things of
                    which the mind is conscious, or has immediate knowledge, are its own operations.
                    “I exist”is therefore a legitimate inference from the proposition “I think ;”
                    and the observation that it is so may be useful to show us the procedure of the
                    mind in the acquisition of knowledge; but it has little merit as an argument,
                    and still less as a discovery, though, being strictly true and just, it should
                    never have been exposed to ridicule.</p>
                <p>It is to be observed, however, that we are conscious of many things to which we
                    give very little attention. We can hardly attend to several things at the same
                    time; and our attention is commonly employed about that which is the object of
                    our thought, and rarely about the thought itself. It is in our power, however,
                    when we come to the years of understanding, to give attention to our own
                    thoughts and passions, and the various operations of our minds. And when we make
                    these the objects <hi rend="italic">of</hi> our attention, either whilst they
                    are present, or when they are recent and fresh in our memory, we perform an act
                    of the mind which is properly called <hi rend="italic">reflection.</hi> This
                    reflection ought to be distinguished from consciousness,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Reid’s Essays on the Intellectual Powers of
                    Man.</p></note> with which it is sometimes confounded by Locke, and often by the
                    very learned author of Ancient Metaphysics. All men are conscious of the
                    operations <hi rend="italic">of</hi> their own minds at all times whilst they
                    are awake, nor does it appear that brutes can be wholly destitute of
                    consciousness; but there are few men who reflect upon the operations of their
                    minds, or make them the objects of thought; and it is not probable that any
                    species of brutes do so.</p>
                <p>From infancy until we attain to the years of understanding, we are employed
                    solely about sensible objects. For, although the mind is conscious of its
                    operations, it does not attend to them; its attention is turned solely to the
                    objects about which these operations are employed. Thus, when a man is angry, he
                    is conscious of his passion; but his attention is turned to the person who
                    offended him and the circumstances of the offence, whilst the passion of anger
                    is not in the least the object of his attention. The difference between
                    consciousness and reflection is like the difference between a superficial view
                    of an object which presents itself to the eye, whilst we are engaged about
                    something else, and that attentive examination which we give to an object when
                    we arc wholly employed in surveying it. It is by consciousness that we
                    immediately acquire all the knowledge which we have of mental operations; but
                    attentive reflection is necessary to make that knowledge accurate and distinct.
                    Attention is a voluntary act; it requires some exertion to begin and to continue
                    it, and by great exertion it may be sustained for a considerable time; but
                    consciousness is involuntary, and of no continuance, changing with every
                    thought. The power of reflection upon the operations of their own minds does not
                    at all appear in children. Men must have come to some ripeness of understanding
                    before they are capable of it. Of all the powers of the human mind, it appears
                    to be the last that unfolds itself. Most men seem incapable of acquiring it in
                    any considerable degree; and many circumstances conspire to make it to all men
                    an exercise of difficulty. The difficulty, however, must be conquered, or no
                    progress can be made in the science of our own or of other minds.</p>
                <p>All the notions which we have of mind and <hi rend="italic">of</hi> its
                    operations are got by reflection; and these notions are by Mr Locke termed ideas
                    of reflection. This appellation we think extremely ill chosen; and we believe it
                    has been the source of much error and confusion amongst Locke’s followers. A
                    man, by attending to the operations of his own mind, may have as distinct
                    notions of remembrance, of judgment, of will, and of desire, as of any object
                    whatever; but if the secondary perception of a sensible object, that appearance
                    which it has to the mind when viewed in the memory or imagination, be properly
                    called an idea, it is certain that of the operations of the mind itself there
                    can be no ideas; for these operations, when reflected on, make no appearance
                    without their objects, either in the memory or in the imagination. Nothing is
                    more evident, in fact, than that we have no ideas, in the original and proper
                    meaning of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208038" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8038-0632"/>the
                    word, but of sensible objects upon which the mind exerts its first operations.
                    Of these operations we have indeed a consciousness; but, abstracted from their
                    objects, we cannot frame any idea or resemblance of them. We are conscious to
                    ourselves of thinking, willing, remembering, discerning, reasoning, judging,
                    &amp;c.; but let any one look into himself, and try whether he can there find
                    any idea of thinking, or willing, &amp;c. entirely separate and abstracted from
                    the object of thought or will. Every man who has seen a tree or a house, will
                    find in his mind ideas of these objects, which he can contemplate by themselves,
                    independently of every thing else; but no man can contemplate the idea of
                    thinking or desiring without taking into view the thing thought or desired. It
                    is plain, therefore, that the energies of thinking, willing, and desiring, with
                    all their various modifications, are not themselves ideas, or capable of
                    communicating ideas to be apprehended, as the ideas of bodies are apprehended by
                    the pure intellect. They are the actions and workings of the intellect itself
                    upon ideas which we have received from the objects of sense, and which are
                    treasured up in the memory or imagination for the very purpose of furnishing the
                    intellect with materials to work upon. Between ideas and the energies of
                    thinking there is as great and as obvious a difference as there is between a
                    stone and the energies of him by whom it is cast. Ideas are the passive
                    subjects; but the energies of thinking are the operations of the agents. Ideas
                    are relicts of sensation, and have a necessary relation to things external; the
                    energies of thinking are relicts of nothing, and they are wholly and originally
                    internal.</p>
                <p>That we cannot in any sense of the word be said to have ideas of the operation of
                    the intellect, will be still more evident, if we consider by what means wo
                    acquire the knowledge which we have of those operations. It has been already
                    observed, that when our thoughts are employed upon any subject, though we are
                    conscious of thinking, yet our attention is commonly employed upon the object of
                    our thought, and not upon the thought itself; and that if we would give
                    attention to our thoughts and passions, we must do it by a reflective act of the
                    mind, whilst the act of thinking is still recent and fresh in our memory. Thus,
                    if a man wishes to know what perception is, it is not the time to make the
                    inquiry whilst he is looking at some rare or beautiful object; for though he is
                    conscious of the energy of perceiving, the object of perception employs all his
                    attention. But the time to make this inquiry is either when the object has
                    become familiar to him, or presently after it is removed from his sight. In the
                    former case, he can look upon it without emotion, pay attention to every step in
                    the process of perception, and be immediately conscious what perception is. In
                    the latter case, by turning his attention inwards, and reflecting on what he did
                    or felt when the object was before him, he will find clear and vivid ideas of
                    every thing which he perceived by his sense of sight; but he will find no idea
                    of the act <hi rend="italic">of</hi> seeing or perceiving. On the contrary, if
                    he be capable of sufficient attention, he will observe that his intellect is
                    employed in the very same manner upon the idea that it was upon the original
                    sensations; and of that employment, and the manner of it, he will be equally
                    conscious as he was of the original energy exerted in sensation. There is indeed
                    this difference between the two, without which reflection could make no
                    discoveries, that the most vivid ideas being still faint when compared with
                    actual sensations, the intellect is not so wholly engrossed by them as it was by
                    the original objects, nor is it so rapidly carried from idea to idea as it was
                    from sensation to sensation. It is thus at leisure to attend toits own
                    operations, and to know what they are; though to form ideas of them as separate
                    from their objects is absolutely impossible. Every man capable of paying
                    attention to what passes within himself when he sees, hears, and feels, may have
                    very accurate notions of seeing, hearing, and feeling; but he cannot have ideas
                    of them as he has of the objects of sight, of hearing, and of touch.</p>
                <p>The same is the case with respect to the exertion of our reasoning faculties. A
                    man must have distinct and clear ideas to reason upon, but he can have no idea
                    of reasoning itself, though he must be conscious of it, and by attention may
                    know what it is. When a man sits down to study for the first time a proposition
                    in the Elements of Euclid, he certainly employs his reasoning faculty, and is
                    conscious that he is doing so; but his attention is wholly turned to the diagram
                    before him, and to the several ideas which that diagram suggests. Afterwards,
                    when he has mastered the proposition, he may go over it again, with a view to
                    discover what reasoning is; but he will not find that he has any idea of
                    reasoning as he has of the diagram. He will only exert that faculty a second
                    time, and perceive one truth linked to and depending upon another in such a
                    manner that the whole taken together forms a complete demonstration. In a word,
                    the operations of our own minds, when attention is paid to them, are known
                    immediately by consciousness; and it is as impossible that we should have ideas
                    of them, as that a living man should be a picture upon canvass. He who attends
                    to what passes in his own mind when he perceives, remembers, reasons, or wills,
                    must know by consciousness what these operations are, and be capable of forming
                    very accurate notions of them, as connected with their objects; and he who does
                    not attend to what passes in his own mind will never acquire any notions of
                    them, although he were to read all that has been written on the subject from the
                    days of Pythagoras to those of Dr Reid.</p>
                <p>As we acquire ideas of external objects by means of our senses, and notions of
                    perceiving, remembering, reasoning, and willing, &amp;c. by reflecting on the
                    operations of our own minds, so there are other things of which we acquire
                    notions, partly by sensation, partly by reflection, and partly by means of that
                    faculty of which it is the more peculiar office to compare ideas and to perceive
                    truth. Such are substance, body, mind, with their several qualities, adjuncts,
                    and relations; the knowledge of which, as has been already observed, constitutes
                    what in strictness of speech is termed the science of metaphysics. These shall
                    be considered in order, after we have investigated the nature of truth, and
                    inquired into the several sources of evidence; but there is one notion, about
                    the origin and reality of which there have been so many disputes, which in
                    itself is of so great importance, and which will be so intimately connected with
                    all our subsequent inquiries, that it may not be improper to consider it here.
                    The notion to which we allude is that of <hi rend="italic">power.</hi></p>
                <p>Amongst the objects around us we perceive frequent changes, and one event
                    regularly succeeding another. Gold∣ thrown into the fire is changed from a solid
                    to a fluid body. Water exposed to a certain degree of cold is changed from a
                    fluid to a solid body. Night succeeds to day, and summer succeeds to winter. We
                    are conscious of new sensations in ourselves every hour. We are likewise
                    conscious of reasoning, willing, and desiring; and we know that by an exertion
                    of will we can rise or sit, stand still or walk, call one idea into view, and
                    dismiss others from our contemplation, Experience teaches us, that it is not
                    occasionally, but always, that gold is changed into a fluid by being thrown into
                    the fire, and water into a solid body by being exposed to a certain degree of
                    cold; that night succeeds to day, and summer to winter. These changes have
                    regularly taken place since the creation of the world; and it has never once
                    been observed that water was made solid by fire, or. gold rendered liquid by
                    cold. Were we not instructed by experience that our own voluntary motions <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194208051" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8051-0633"/> are produced by
                    exertions of our minds, of which we are conscious, and that without such
                    exertions those motions would never have taken place, we should probably have
                    considered the liquefaction of gold as an event equally independent of fire,
                    though uniformly conjoined with it, as night is independent of day, and day of
                    night. But having experienced that we can move or not move our bodies as we
                    please, that when it is our will to sit we never get up to walk, and that when
                    we wish to walk we always do it except prevented by external violence; having
                    likewise experienced that by a thought, by some internal and inexplicable
                    exertion of our minds, we can call up in our memory or imagination one idea, and
                    dismiss others from our mental view; we are led to believe with the fullest
                    conviction, that all those motions of our bodies which in common language are
                    termed voluntary, and that succession of ideas which follows a conscious
                    exertion of the mind, depend entirely upon ourselves. In other words, we are
                    necessitated to believe that we have a power to move or not to move our bodies
                    in many cases, and a power to turn our attention to one idea in preference to
                    others.</p>
                <p>It is in this way that we acquire the notion of power in ourselves, which we
                    easily transfer to other objects. Knowing that the various motions of our bodies
                    thus effected proceed from power, we are naturally led to inquire whether the
                    changes which we perceive in other bodies may not proceed from power likewise,
                    or from something analogous to that power, of the exertions of which we are
                    conscious in ourselves. Now uniform experience teaching us that gold is
                    liquefied by being thrown into the fire, and that water is made solid by being
                    exposed to cold, we infer with the utmost certainty that there are powers in
                    fire and cold to produce these changes, and that without the exertion of such
                    powers these changes would not be produced. We cannot indeed say of external
                    powers, as we can of our own, in what substance they inhere. We know with the
                    utmost certainty that the voluntary motions of our hands, &amp;c. are produced
                    by a power not inherent in the hands, but in the mind, for of the exertion of
                    that power we are conscious; but we do not know whether the power which
                    liquefies gold be inherent in that sensible object which we call fire, or in
                    something else to which fire is only an instrument. We learn by observation,
                    that the minute particles of fire or heat insinuate themselves between the
                    particles of gold, and, if we may use the expression, tear them asunder; but
                    whether they do this in consequence of a power inherent in themselves, or only
                    as instruments impelled by another power, is a question which observation cannot
                    enable us to answer.</p>
                <p>Were we not conscious of the exertion of our own powers, it seems scarcely
                    conceivable that we could ever have acquired any notion of power at all; for
                    power is not an object of sense, nor, independent of its operations, is it
                    indeed an object of consciousness. In external operations, all that we perceive
                    is one thing, in which we suppose the power to reside, followed by another,
                    which is either the change or that on which the change is produced; but the
                    exertion of the power itself we do not perceive. Thus we perceive gold, after it
                    has been some time in the fire, converted from a solid to a fluid body; but we
                    perceive not by our senses either the power or the energy of the power which
                    operates to this conversion. In the exercise of our own powers, the case is
                    otherwise. When a man puts his hand to his head, and afterwards thrusts it into
                    his bosom, he not only perceives by his senses the change of position, but he is
                    also conscious of the energy or exertion by which the change was produced.</p>
                <p>“Suppose,” says Mr Hume, “a person, though endowed with the strongest faculties
                    of reason and reflection, to be brought on a sudden into this world, he would
                    indeed immediately observe a continual succession of objects, and one event
                    following another, but he would not be able to discover any thing farther. He
                    would not at first by any reasoning be able to reach the idea of cause and
                    effect, since the particular powers by which all natural operations are
                    performed never appear to the senses. The impulse of one billiard ball is
                    attended with motion in the second. This is the whole that appears to the
                    outward senses. The .mind feels no sentiment or inward impression from this
                    succession of objects; consequently there is not, in any single particular
                    instance of cause and effect, any thing which can suggest the idea of power or
                    necessary connection. From the first appearance of an object, we never can
                    conjecture what effect will result from it; but, were the power or energy of any
                    cause discoverable by the mind, we could foresee the effect, even without
                    experience, and might at first pronounce with certainty concerning it by the
                    mere dint of thought and reasoning. It is impossible, therefore, that the idea
                    of power can be derived from the contemplation of bodies in single instances of
                    their operations; because no bodies ever discover any power which can be the
                    original of this idea.”</p>
                <p>There is a sense in which this reasoning is unquestionably just. A man who had
                    never been conscious of exerting power in himself would certainly not acquire
                    the notion of power from observing a continual succession of external objects.
                    The impulse of one billiard ball being followed by the motion of another, would
                    no more lead him to the notion of power in the former than the succession of
                    night to day would lead him to the notion of a power in light to produce
                    darkness. When Mr Hume says, “that, from the first appearance of an object, we
                    can never conjecture what effect will result from it,” he uses language that is
                    ambiguous, and utters an assertion which is either true or false according to
                    the sense in which it is understood. If it be meant, that after having reflected
                    upon the operations of our own minds, and learned by experience that motion is
                    communicated by impulse from one ball of ivory to another, we could not
                    conjecture whether a similar effect would be produced by the impulse of balls
                    made of other hard bodies which we had never before seen, the assertion is
                    manifestly false. A man who had but once seen motion communicated in this manner
                    from one ivory ball to another, would certainly conjecture that it might be
                    communicated from one wooden ball to another; and if he had observed it
                    repeatedly communicated from one ball to another of different substances, he
                    w0uld infer, with the utmost confidence, that it might be communicated from ball
                    to ball, of whatever substance composed, provided that substance be hard, or of
                    a similar texture with the balls to the impulse of which he had formerly paid
                    attention. If by this ambiguous phrase the author only means, as is probably the
                    case, that from the first appearance of an object to which we had never before
                    observed any thing in any respect similar, we could not conjecture what effect
                    would result from it; or if his meaning be, that a man suddenly brought into the
                    world, who had never acquired such a notion of power as may be had from
                    attention to the energies and operations of our own minds, would not, by
                    observing an effect to result from one body, conjecture from the first
                    appearance of another similar body what effect would result from it;—in either
                    of these cases his assertion is certainly true, and tends to prove, that without
                    the consciousness of the operations of our own minds, we could never acquire a
                    notion of power from the changes perceived by our senses in external
                    objects.</p>
                <p>But Mr Hume, not contented with denying, which he might justly do, that we could
                    ever have derived the idea of power merely from observing the continual
                    succession of external objects, labours hard to prove that we have r.o notion of
                    power at all, and that when we employ the word <pb break="no"

                    we do nothing more than utter an insignificant sound. To pave the way for the
                    arguments by which so extravagant a paradox is to be supported, he lays it down
                    as a “proposition which will not admit of much dispute, that all our ideas arc
                    nothing but copies of our impressions; or, in other words, that it is impossible
                    for us to think of any thing that we have not antecedently felt either by our
                    external or internal senses.” As this proposition, however,, will, it seems,
                    admit of some dispute, he takes care, before applying it to the purpose of
                    demolishing all power, to support it by two arguments. “First,” says he, “when
                    we analyze our thoughts or ideas, however compounded or sublime, we always find
                    that they resolve themselves into such simple ideas as were copied from a
                    precedent feeling or sentiment. Those who would assert that this position is not
                    universally true nor without exception, have only one, and that an easy method
                    of refuting it, by producing that idea, which, in their opinion, is not derived
                    from this source. Secondly, if it happen, from a defect of the organ, that a man
                    is not susceptible of any species of sensation, we always find that he is as
                    little susceptible of the correspondent ideas. A blind man can form no notion of
                    colours, a deaf man of sounds. And though there are few or no instances of a
                    like deficiency in the mind, where a person has never felt, or is wholly
                    incapable of a sentiment or passion that belongs to his species, yet we find the
                    same observation to take place in a less degree. A man of mild manners can form
                    no idea of inveterate revenge or cruelty; nor can a selfish heart easily
                    conceive the heights of friendship and generosity.”</p>
                <p>As these propositions are the engines by which all power is banished from the
                    world, it may not be improper, before we proceed to inquire by what means they
                    perform so arduous a task, to consider their own inherent strength; for if they
                    be weak in themselves, their work, however dexterously they may be employed, can
                    have no stability. We have already noticed the perverseness of this writer’s
                    language, when it confounds sensations with impressions; but here it is still
                    more perverse, for passions, sentiments, and even consciousness, are styled
                    impressions. When sensations are confounded with impressions, the effect is only
                    mistaken for the cause, it being universally known that sensations proceed from
                    impressions made upon the organs of sense. When consciousness is confounded with
                    an impression, one thing is mistaken for another, to which it is universally
                    known to have neither resemblance nor relation. But, not to waste time upon
                    these-fallacies, which, though dangerous if admitted, are yet too palpable to
                    impose upon a reader capable of the slightest attention, let us examine the
                    propositions themselves. The most important, and that for the sake of which
                    alone the others are brought forward, is, “that it is impossible for us to think
                    of any thing that we have not antecedently felt, either by our external or
                    internal senses.” Did Mr Hume, then, never think of a mathematical point, or a
                    mathematical line? Neither of these things is capable of being felt, either by
                    making an impression upon the organs of sense or as an object of consciousness,
                    and therefore it is impossible that he should ever have had ideas of them such
                    as he doubtless had of sensible objects; yet in the most proper sense of the
                    word <hi rend="italic">think,</hi> he certainly thought of both points and
                    lines; for he appears to have made considerable progress in the science of
                    geometry, in which he could not have proceeded a single step without a perfect
                    knowledge of these things, on which the whole science is built. It is not
                    therefore true, that our thoughts or ideas, when analyzed, always resolve
                    themselves into such simple ideas as were copied from a precedent feeling or
                    sentiment; for every mathematical figure of which we can think resolves itself
                    into a point and motion; and a point having no parts and no magnitude, cannot
                    possibly be the object of feeling to any of our senses.</p>
                <p>If, therefore, ideas alone be the objects of thought, we have refuted Mr Hume’s
                    position by the very method which he himself lays down; for we have produced an
                    idea which is not derived either from a precedent feeling or a precedent
                    sentiment. By sentiment, we suppose to be here meant that which by other
                    philosophers is denominated consciousness; and of consciousness it is undeniable
                    that nothing is the object but the actual energies of our own minds.</p>
                <p>But ideas are not the only objects of thought. We have already given our reasons
                    for restricting the word <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> to that appearance which an
                    object of sense, when reflected on, makes, either in the memory or imagination.
                    Such was undoubtedly its original signification; and had it never been used to
                    denote other and very different objects, much error and perplexity would have
                    been avoided, which now disgrace the science of metaphysics. Things may
                    themselves be the objects of thought; and when that is the case, to think of
                    their ideas, were it possible to do so, would be worse than useless; for we may
                    certainly know a man better by looking at himself than by looking at his
                    picture. Of things which are themselves the objects of thought, we have either a
                    direct or a relative knowledge. We know directly the actual operations of our
                    own minds by the most complete of all evidence, that of consciousness; and we
                    have a relative notion of mathematical points and lines, but neither of mental
                    energies nor of these external things can we possibly have any idea.</p>
                <p>It is well observed by Dr Reid, that our notions both of body and of mind are
                    nothing more than relative. “What is body? It is, say philosophers, that which
                    is extended, solid, and divisible. Says the querist, I do not ask what the
                    properties of the body are, but what is the thing itself? let me first know
                    directly what body is, and then consider its properties. To this demand I am
                    afraid the querist will meet with no satisfactory answer; because our notion of
                    body is not direct, but relative to its qualities. We know that it is something
                    extended, solid, and divisible, and we know no more. Again, if it should be
                    asked, what is mind? It is that which thinks. I ask not what it does, or what
                    its properties arc, but what it is. To this I can find no answer; our notion of
                    mind being not direct, but relative to its operations, as our notion of body is
                    relative to its qualities.” <hi rend="italic">{Essay on the Active Powers of
                    Man.')</hi></p>
                <p>Our notion of a mathematical point is of the very same kind. What is a point? It
                    is, says Euclid, that which has no parts and no magnitude. Replies the querist,
                    I ask not either what it has or what it has not; let me first know what it is.
                    To this second question, it might perhaps be answered, that a mathematical point
                    is that which by motion generates a line. But, rejoins the querist, I am not
                    inquiring what it generates; give me a direct idea of the point itself; or, if
                    that cannot be done, as assuredly it cannot, tell me what its offspring a line
                    is. A line, says Euclid, is length without breadth. I have no idea, replies the
                    querist, of length without breadth. I never felt an impression from a sensible
                    object which did not suggest length, breadth, and thickness, as inseparably
                    united; and I can have no idea which is not the copy of a former impression. To
                    assist the querist’s conception, it may be said that lines are the boundaries of
                    a superficies, and that superficies are the boundaries of a solid body; and of a
                    solid body every man has a clear and direct idea, in the most proper sense of
                    the word. Here then arc several things, namely, points, lines, and superficies,
                    of not one of which is it possible to form a direct notion; and yet we know them
                    so thoroughly, from the relation which they bear to other subjects, that we can
                    reason about them with a precision and certainty which the mathematical sciences
                    alone admit of.</p>
                <p>The great advantage of these sciences above the moral Mr Hume himself expressly
                    admits; but he attributes it <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208077"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8077-0635"/>to a wrong cause when he says it consists in this,
                    that the “ideas of the former being sensible, are always clear and determinate;”
                    for we see that the notion of a point or of a line is merely relative, and
                    cannot possibly be the copy of a sensation, or, in his language, of a sensible
                    impression. If, then, we have clear and determinate notions of points and lines,
                    and may reason about them without ambiguity, as he acknowledges we may, what is
                    there to hinder us from having an equally clear and determinate notion of power,
                    or from reasoning about it with as little ambiguity?<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“There are some things of which we can have
                    both a direct and relative conception. I can directly conceive ten thousand men,
                    or ten thousand pounds, because both are objects of sense, and may be seen. But
                    whether I see such an object, or directly conceive it, my notion of it is
                    indistinct; it is only that of a great multitude of men, or of a great heap of
                    money; and a small addition or diminution makes no perceptible change in the
                    notion I form in this way. But I can form a relative notion of the same number
                    of men or of pounds by .attending to the relations which this number has to
                    other numbers greater or less. Then I perceive that the relative notion is
                    distinct and scientific; for the addition of a single man, or a single pound, or
                    even of a penny, is easily perceived. In like manner, I can form a direct notion
                    of a polygon of a thousand equal sides and equal angles. This direct notion
                    cannot be more distinct when conceived in the mind, than that which I get by
                    sight when the object is before me; and I find it so indistinct that it has the
                    same appearance to my eye, or to my <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> conception, as
                    a polygon of a thousand and one, or of nine hundred and ninety nine sides. But
                    when I form a <hi rend="italic">relative</hi> conception of it, by attending to
                    the relation it bears to <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> polygons of a greater or
                    less number of sides, my notion of it becomes distinct and scientific, and I can
                    demonstrate the properties by which it is distinguished from all other polygons
                    From these instances it appears, that our relative conceptions of things are not
                    always less distinct, nor less fit materials for accurate reasoning, than those
                    that are direct; and that the contrary may happen in a remarkable degree."

                    Why, says he, we are not conscious of power. And to prove this position, which
                    needs no proof, he makes many observations that, however just, might certainly
                    have been spared. Of these, one is not a little curious. <hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi><hi rend="italic">A</hi> man suddenly struck with a palsy in the leg or
                    arm,” says he, “or who has now lost these members, frequently endeavours at
                    first to move them, and employ them in their usual offices. Here he is as much
                    conscious of power to command such limbs, as a man in perfect health is
                    conscious of power to actuate any member which remains in its natural state and
                    condition. But consciousness never deceives. Consequently, neither in the one
                    ease nor in the other are we ever conscious of any power.” This is true; we are
                    never conscious of any power; but we are frequently conscious of actual
                    energies; and the man who, after being suddenly struck with a palsy, endeavours
                    in vain to move his leg or arm, is as conscious of energy as he who in health
                    makes the same attempt with success. Nor let it be imagined that his
                    consciousness deceives him; for, as Mr Hume justly observes, consciousness never
                    deceives. He is certain of the energy, but finds by experience that the
                    instrument of this energy has suddenly become disordered and unfit for its usual
                    office. In this and this alone consists the difference between the paralytic and
                    the man whose limbs are sound. The one may be as conscious of energy as the
                    other, and his consciousness may be equally infallible. But what then is this
                    energy? Mr Hume will not say that it is an idea, for it is not the copy of any
                    antecedent impression; besides, he has somewhere allowed that ideas are never
                    active. Is it then a substance? Impossible, for it is not permanent; and we
                    believe no man will venture to affirm, or even to suppose, that the same
                    substance can be repeatedly annihilated, and as often created. Is it, then, the
                    occasional exertion of some substance? This must be the truth, for no other
                    supposition remains to be made. If so, that substance must be possessed of
                    power; for a capacity of exerting actual energy is all that is meant by the word
                    power. “Wherever there is a capability of energy or exertion, there must be
                    power; for though there can be no exertion without power, there may be power
                    that is not ex-reted. Thus a man may have power to speak when he is silent; and
                    he may have power to rise and walk when he sits still. But though it be one
                    thing to speak and another to have the power of speaking, we always conceive of
                    the power as something which has a certain relation to the effect; and of every
                    power we form our notion by the effect which it is capable of producing. Nor is
                    it only in speaking and moving his limbs that a man is conscious of energy.
                    There is as much energy, though of a different kind, in thinking as in acting.
                    Hence the powers of the human mind have been divided into active and
                    speculative. By the former we move the body; and by the latter we see, hear,
                    remember, distinguish, judge, reason, and perform upon our notions and ideas
                    every other operation which is comprehended under the general word <hi

                <p>Mr Locke<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Essay, book ii.
                    chap. xxi.</p></note> has introduced into his theory of power another
                    distinction than that which we have here made between active and speculative
                    powers. Observing by our senses, under which on this occasion memory is
                    certainly included, various changes in objects, we collect, says he, a
                    possibility in one object to be changed, and in another a possibility of making
                    that change, and so come by that idea which we call power. Thus we say that fire
                    has a power to melt gold, and that gold has a power to be melted. The first he
                    calls active, the second passive power. But to say that the possibility of being
                    changed is power, seems to be a very improper mode of speaking, and such as may
                    lead to consequences which the excellent author certainly held in abhorrence. It
                    tends to make unwary readers imagine that the passive subject is as necessary to
                    the existence of power as the active being of which power is an attribute; but
                    if the universe had a beginning, and if its Creator be immutable, two
                    propositions which Mr Lockc firmly believed, there certainly was power when
                    there was no change, nor any thing existing which was capable of change. He
                    owns, indeed, that active power is more properly called power than the other;
                    but we see no propriety at all in what he calls passive power. “It is,” in the
                    language of Dr Reid, “a powerless power, and a contradiction in terms.”</p>
                <p>But although Locke here us¢ss improper terms, he makes some other observations
                    with which we have the honour fully to agree, and which lead to consequences the
                    reverse of that impiety which seems to follow f rom the notion of passive power.
                    He observes, that “we have from body no idea at all of thinking, nor any idea of
                    the beginning of motion. A body at rest affords us no idea of any active power
                    to move; and when it is set in motion itself, that motion is rather a passion
                    than an action in it. For when the ball obeys the stroke of a billiard stick, it
                    is not any action of the ball, but a passion; also, when by impulse it sets
                    another ball in motion that lay in its way, it only communicates the motion it
                    had received from another, and loses in itself so much as the other received,
                    which gives us but a very obscure idea of an active power moving in body, whilst
                    we observe it only to transfer, but not to produce, any motion. So that it seems
                    to me, we have from the observation of the operation of bodies by our senses,
                    but a very imperfect, obscure idea of active power, since they afford us not any
                    idea in themselves of the power to begin any action either of motion or
                    thought.” He thinks <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208090"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8090-0636"/>it evident, however, “that we find in ourselves a
                    power to begin or forbear, continue or end, several actions of our minds and
                    motions of our bodies, barely by a thought or preference of the mind ordering,
                    or, as it were, commanding, the doing or not doing such or such a particular
                    action. -This power which the mind has thus to order the consideration of any
                    idea, or the forbearing to consider it, or to prefer the motion of any part of
                    the body to its rest, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> i∏ any particular
                    instance, is that which we call will. The actual exercise of that power, by
                    directing any particular action, or its forbearance, is that which we call
                    volition or willing.”</p>
                <p>According to Mr Locke, therefore, the only clear notion or idea we have of power
                    is taken from the power which we find in ourselves to give certain motions to
                    our bodies, or certain directions to our thoughts; and this power in ourselves
                    can be brought into, action only by willing or volition. This is exactly our
                    doctrine, where we have endeavoured to prove, that without the consciousness of
                    actual energy in ourselves, we never could have acquired any notion at all of
                    power from observing the changes which take place amongst external objects. But
                    if this be so; if the power, of which alone we know any thing, can be brought
                    into action only by willing or volition; and if will necessarily implies some
                    degree of understanding, as in us it certainly does; it comes to be a question
                    of the first importance, whether any being which possesses not will and
                    understanding can be possessed of real power, or be the efficient cause of any
                    action. This question we feel ourselves compelled to answer in the negative. If
                    we had not will, and that degree of understanding which will necessarily
                    implies, it is evident that we could exert no power, and consequently could have
                    none; for power that cannot be exerted is no power. It follows also, that the
                    power, of which alone we can have any distinct notion, can be only in beings who
                    have understanding and will. Power to produce any effect, implies power not to
                    produce it; and we can conceive no way in which power may be determined to one
                    of these rather than the other in a being who has not will. We grow from infancy
                    to manhood; we digest our food, our blood circulates, our heart and arteries
                    beat; we are sometimes sick and sometimes in health; all these things must be
                    effected by the power of some agent, but they are not done by our power. And if
                    it be asked how we know this, the obvious answer is, because they are not
                    subject to our will. This is the infallible criterion by which we distinguish
                    what is our doing from what is not, what is in our power from what is not. Human
                    power can be exerted only by will; and we are unable to conceive any active
                    power to be exerted without will. If, therefore, any man affirms that a being
                    may be the efficient cause of an action which that being can neither conceive
                    nor will, he speaks a language which we do not understand. If he has any
                    meaning, he must take the words <hi rend="italic">power</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">efficiency</hi> in a sense very different from ours; for the only
                    distinct notion, indeed the only notion, which we can form, of real efficiency,
                    is a relation between the cause and effect similar to that between us and our
                    voluntary actions. It seems, therefore, most probable that such beings only as
                    have some degree of understanding and will can possess active power, and that
                    inanimate beings must be merely passive. Nothing which we perceive without us
                    affords any good ground for ascribing active power to any inanimate being; and
                    we can as little conceive such a being possessed of power, as we can conceive it
                    capable of feeling pain. On the other hand, every thing which we discover in our
                    own constitution leads us to think that active power cannot be exerted without
                    will and intelligence; and to affirm that it can, is to affirm what, to us at
                    least, is a contradiction in terms.</p>
                <p>To this reasoning, which is Dr Reid’s, and which to us appears to be
                    unanswerable, we have heard it objected, that a man born blind has the same
                    evidence for the non-existence of colour that is here urged for the
                    impossibility of power being exerted without will and understanding. If the
                    objection had not been made by a very acute man, we should have deemed it
                    altogether unworthy of notice; for between the two cases supposed to be similar
                    there is hardly any analogy. A man born blind has no notion whatever of colour.
                    If you describe it to him in the best manner you can, and refer it to any of the
                    senses which he possesses; if you say that it is the object of feeling, and that
                    by feeling it one may perceive things at the distance of many miles; the blind
                    man has reason to say that you are uttering a proposition which he knows with
                    the utmost certainty cannot possibly be true. But if you tell him that colour is
                    the object of the sense of sight, a sense which he possesses not; that it has
                    not the least resemblance to the objects of the other senses; and that persons
                    endowed with the sense of sight perceive coloured objects at the distance of
                    many miles; the blind man cannot know whether what you say be true or false,
                    because he has no idea or conception of the things of which you speak. This is
                    not the case with respect to power; for every man who has reflected on the
                    operations of his own mind has a very distinct notion of power, and knows
                    perfectly, that to the actual exertion of the only power which he can conceive,
                    will and understanding are necessary. Should it be said that there may be power
                    altogether different from that of which we have a distinct conception, we think
                    it sufficient to reply, that of a thing which cannot be conceived, nothing can
                    be either affirmed or denied; that activity exerted without will and
                    understanding ought not to be called an exertion of power, because power is the
                    name already appropriated to the attribute of a being, by which he can do
                    certain things if he wills; that as we cannot form any notion of a real
                    efficient cause which has not will and understanding, so we have no reason to
                    believe that such a cause anywhere exists; and to say that power, such as we can
                    conceive, may be exerted without will and understanding, is as great an
                    absurdity as to say that there may be velocity without space.</p>
                <p>But if active power, in its proper meaning, requires a subject endowed with will
                    and intelligence, what shall we say of those active powers which philosophers
                    teach us to ascribe to matter, the powers of corpuscular attraction, magnetism,
                    electricity, gravitation, and others? These powers, as they are called, shall be
                    considered when we come to treat of the nature and source of corporeal motion.
                    In the mean time, it is sufficient to observe, that whatever may be the agents
                    in the operations of nature, whatever the manner of their agency or the extent
                    of their power, they depend upon the First Cause, and are all under his supreme
                    control.</p>

                <p>By pursuing these inquiries in the order which to us appears most natural, we are
                    now led to the contemplation of those faculties of the human mind of which truth
                    is properly the object. But what is truth? This was a famous question amongst
                    the Greek sophists, which had been so often agitated, and to which so many
                    absurd answers had been given, that it came at last to be doubted by men of the
                    world whether a satisfactory answer could be given to it, or indeed whether the
                    matter was worthy of investigation. It is well known, that amongst the ancient
                    philosophers there was a sect called from their principles Sceptics, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194208103" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8103-0637"/> from their
                    founder Pyrrhonists, who openly avowed their opinion that truth, like virtue, is
                    nothing but a name;— that all things are equally true, or rather equally
                    doubtful ;—and that it is in vain for man to hope for certainty in any inquiry
                    in which he can be engaged. Such scepticism as this no modern philosopher has
                    professed; but many have had enough of it to make sober men hesitate about
                    defining truth, and even insinuate that of truth no definition can be given.
                    This, however, is surely a mistake. If truth cannot be defined, it still wanders
                    at large and in disguise, and vain must be the pursuit of everyman who
                    endeavours to obtain it, for he is pursuing he knows not what.</p>
                <p>So obvious and so solid is this reflection, that almost every philosopher of
                    merit who has latterly written on the nature of evidence, has begun his work, if
                    not with a formal definition, with something at least equivalent to a
                    definition, of the object of his pursuit. To repeat all these definitions could
                    serve no other purpose than to swell this article to a disproportioned bulk, and
                    to perplex perhaps the mind of the reader. We shall therefore content ourselves
                    with that which is given by Mr Wollaston. “Those propositions,” says he, “are
                    true which represent things as they are, or truth is the conformity of those
                    words or signs by which things are expressed to the things themselves.”
                    Notwithstanding the objections of Dr Tatham, the acute author of the Chart and
                    Scale of Truth, this is the best definition of truth which we have yet met with
                    in any language. It is concise and perspicuous. It comprehends all kinds of
                    truth, as well that which is merely mental, the subject of silent contemplation,
                    as that which is communicated either by written language or by the living voice;
                    and it makes truth itself immutable, as depending, not upon the arbitrary
                    constitution of this or that individual, or even of the whole human race,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Beattie, in his Essay, has
                    given a definition of truth very different from this, though it is possible that
                    his meaning may be the same with Mr Wollaston’s. “I account that to be truth,”
                    says he, “which the constitution of our nature determines us to believe, and
                    that to be falsehood which the constitution of our nature determines us to
                    disbelieve.” But if truth be really immutable, as he teaches or wishes to teach,
                    it must depend upon the nature of things, and not upon the instinctive impulse
                    of any particular constitution. It is always difficult, often impossible, to
                    distinguish between the constitution of our nature as it came from the hand of
                    God, and the same constitution as it is moulded by arbitrary and capricious
                    associations of our own. A sincere member of the church of Home certainly
                    believes the doctrine of transubstantiation. How he may do so we have already
                    shown. Were all mankind sincere members of that church, it would be said and
                    thought, “that the constitution of human nature determines men to believe
                    transubstantiation a doctrine which, though it is rejected by millions, Père
                    Buffier has laboured hard to reconcile with common sense. Yet it is certain that
                    the same body cannot be in different places at the same time; and that therefore
                    transubstantiation must be false, although believed by all mankind. Our
                    believing any thing does not make it true, nor our disbelieving any thing make
                    it false. W e must, indeed, act according to our belief; but in every instance
                    truth and falsehood would have been what they are although we had never
                    existed.</p></note> but upon the nature of things as established by the Almighty
                    Creator of all.</p>
                <p>According to this definition, every proposition which can be expressed or
                    apprehended is necessarily either true or false, whether its truth or falsehood
                    be perceived or not, either by him who hears or by him who utters it. All
                    propositions are either affirmative or negative; but before any thing can with
                    certainty be affirmed or denied of another, we must know those things as they
                    are in themselves, as well as the established use of the signs by which they are
                    expressed. He who affirms or denies without this knowledge, speaks at random,
                    and has no distinct meaning.</p>
                <p>Every faculty which we possess is in some way or other an instrument of
                    knowledge; for we know by our senses, by our memory, and by our intellect. Every
                    one of our faculties, therefore, is concerned in the acquisition of truth, and
                    furnishes the mind with the materials of propositions. These propositions are
                    indeed of various kinds; but they are all certainly true or certainly false,
                    though the certainty of the truth or falsehood of every one it is not always in
                    our power to perceive.</p>
                <p>When a man affirms that red is a quality inherent in a soldier’s coat, he utters
                    a proposition which every one of the vulgar firmly believes to be true, but
                    which every philosopher knows to be false. This diversity of belief, however,
                    does not affect the truth of the proposition itself. All mankind know that it is
                    either true or false, independently of them or their perceptions; and it is
                    easy, by a few optical experiments, and by an explanation of terms, to convince
                    them all, that what they have agreed to call red is no quality inherent in
                    external objects, but only a sensation caused by the impulse of certain rays of
                    light reflected from certain objects to the eye of the percipient. The
                    contrariety, therefore, in this case of vulgar to philosophical belief, does not
                    result from any ambiguity in the nature of truth itself, but from the different
                    means of perception which the clown and the philosopher possess.</p>
                <p>Again, were a man looking at a red and a green object, to affirm that they are
                    both of the same colour, he would affirm what in one sense may be true, what in
                    another is undoubtedly false, and what in a third may be either true or false.
                    If it be his meaning that the two objects give to him the same sensation, he may
                    know with the utmost certainty that what he says is true; if he mean that they
                    affect all mankind precisely as they affect him, he utters what all mankind with
                    the most absolute certainty know to be false; if he mean that the texture of the
                    two bodies (that particular disposition of parts on their surfaces which makes
                    them reflect certain rays of light and absorb others) is exactly similar, so
                    that the one must reflect the very same kind of rays with the other, he utthrs
                    what all mankind must believe to be false, although still it is possible that
                    what he affirms may be true. This diversity of belief affects not the truth
                    itself. The two objects are what they are, by whomsoever perceived, or whether
                    perceived or not. The rays of light reflected by each are what they are, whether
                    they fall upon this, upon that, or upon any other eye; and the sensation
                    communicated to this singular man is certainly what he is conscious it is, as
                    those of the rest of mankind are with equal certainty what they are conscious
                    of. This being the case, it is obvious and undeniable, that the organs of sight
                    in this individual of the human race are somehow differently formed from those
                    of other men; and the only question which can occasion a doubt in the mind of
                    the sceptic is, whether his or their eyes be so formed as to represent things
                    falsely; for that by the one or the other things are falsely represented, is as
                    evident as that two contradictory propositions cannot both be true. Now,
                    although for any thing we know it is certainly possible, as to us it appears not
                    to imply any contradiction, that the eyes of but one man are formed in a manner
                    suitable to their objects, whilst the eyes of all other men are formed to
                    deceive them; yet the contrary is so highly probable, that no man really doubts
                    of it, any more than he doubts whether three and two be equal to five.</p>
                <p>This last proposition is indeed said to express a truth absolutely certain,
                    whilst the former expresses a truth which is called morally certain; not that
                    there is any difference or degrees of certainty in the nature of truths
                    themselves; the only difference consists in our power of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208116" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8116-0638"/>perceiving them. That three
                    and two are equal to five is said to be an absolute truth, because we perceive
                    the whole of it as it is in itself, and are convinced that every intelligence,
                    from the highest to the lowest, who understands the terms in which it is
                    expressed, perceives it as we do; whereas of moral or of physical truths, as
                    they are called, we only perceive a part, and may therefore mistake for want of
                    evidence. Thus, in the case of the two objects exhibiting the same colour to one
                    man, whilst they exhibit different colours to all other men, could we see into
                    the objects themselves, and comprehend them immediately with our intellect as we
                    comprehend our own ideas, it might, and no doubt would, appear as palpable a
                    contradiction to say that the particular disposition of the parts on the
                    surfaces, which reflect the rays of light, are the same in both, as it is now to
                    affirm that three and two are not equal to five. Between truth and falsehood
                    there is no medium. All truths are in themselves equally certain; and to the
                    Supreme Being, who knows the nature of every thing more fully and intimately
                    than we know our own ideas, they must all appear equally certain; but yet we may
                    without absurdity speak of probable truth as well as of certain truth, provided
                    always that we make the difference to result, not from the nature of things, but
                    from the power of our understanding, which comprehends the one kind of truth
                    wholly and the other only partially.</p>
                <p>There is another division made of truth into that which is eternal and necessary,
                    and that which is temporary and contingent. Though we do not approve of applying
                    the epithets temporary and eternal to any thing but real existences, yet as this
                    manner of speaking has been used by all philosophers, we shall give instances of
                    each kind of truth, and endeavour to ascertain in what the distinction consists.
                    “The three angles of a plain triangle are equal to two right angles,” is a
                    proposition expressive of a necessary and eternal truth. “The world exists,” is
                    a contingent and temporary truth. Here it is very obvious, that if both these
                    propositions be true, there is no distinction between them, so far as mere truth
                    is concerned; for truth admits not of degrees of comparison. It is however said,
                    that the first proposition depends not upon time, nor will, nor any thing else,
                    and that the Supreme Being himself could not make it false: whereas it is
                    certainly possible, that he who created the world could annihilate it, and thus
                    reduce what is now a truth to an absolute falsehood. This difference between the
                    two propositions is thought a sufficient ground for calling the former a
                    necessary and eternal truth, and the latter a temporary and contingent truth.
                    But is the difference itself real? In the present instance we cannot think that
                    it is; for if the right angles and triangles, which constitute the materials of
                    the former proposition, be real corporeal things, they may be annihilated as
                    well as the rest of the world; and then the truth of the proposition will cease,
                    for there can be neither equality nor inequality between nonentities. If the
                    angles and triangles be merely ideas in the mind of a rational being, it is not
                    to be denied that the proposition must be true, independently of all will,
                    whenever those ideas exist, or whenever right angles and triangles arc thought
                    upon; but if all reasonable creatures were to be annihilated, and the Supreme
                    Being never to think of triangles, the proposition would unquestionably cease to
                    be either true or false. The world may indeed be annihilated; but it certainly
                    is not annihilated whilst any one creature exists to contemplate even that which
                    is called necessary and eternal truth; and therefore, whilst any truth exists in
                    a mind not divine, it must be necessarily true that the world exists; for the
                    individual being by which truth is perceived would then constitute the whole
                    world.</p>
                <p>But if in a somewhat different manner we compare the former of these propositions
                    with this, “The solar system consists of the sun and at least seven primary
                    planets,” we shall at once perceive the difference between necessary and
                    contingent truths. Both propositions we know to be true at this moment; but
                    there is this difference between them, that a plain triangle can neither
                    actually exist <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> at any period of duration, nor be
                    conceived by any one mind, divine nor human, of which the three internal angles
                    are not precisely equal to two right angles; whereas the solar system may easily
                    be conceived, and might certainly have been formed, with a smaller number of
                    primary planets rolling round the central orb. This needs no proof, as it is
                    well known that till very lately we conceived the system to consist of the sun
                    and only six primary planets; and it has been already shown, that whatever we
                    can positively conceive may possibly exist. Thus, then, every proposition, of
                    which the contrary is clearly and distinctly perceived to be impossible, is a
                    necessary truth; and it may likewise be said to be eternal, because at every
                    period of duration it must of necessity when thought upon be perceived to be
                    true. On the other hand, every proposition of which the contrary may be clearly
                    and distinctly conceived, is, if true, only a contingent truth, because its
                    contrary might have existed; and it may likewise be called temporary, because
                    what might have been false in time past may yet be false in time to come.</p>
                <p>Though all ouι∙ faculties, our senses, our memory, and our intellect, furnish
                    materials for propositions, and are therefore all subservient to the
                    investigation of truth, yet the perception of truth, as it is in itself, is
                    commonly ascribed to our rational faculties; and these have by Locke and others
                    been reduced to two, namely, reason and judgment. The former is said to be
                    conversant about certain truths, the latter chiefly about probabilities.</p>
                <p>Some modern philosophers of great merit, dissatisfied with this analysis of the
                    intellect, have added to reason and judgment a third faculty, to which they have
                    given the name of <hi rend="italic">common sense,</hi> and of which the proper
                    object is such truths as neither admit nor stand in need of evidence. By common
                    sense they mean “that degree of judgment which is common to men with whom we can
                    converse and transact business.” Whether the introduction of such a term into
                    metaphysics was proper or improper, we do not think it of importance to inquire.
                    According to this definition of it, which is Dr Reid’s, it differs not from the
                    reason and judgment of Locke;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This is expressly acknowledged by Dr Reid. “It is absurd,”
                    says he, “to conceive that there can be any opposition between reason and common
                    sense. It is indeed the first-born of reason; and as they are commonly joined
                    together in speech and in writing, they are inseparable in their nature. We
                    ascribe to reason two offices or two degrees: the first is to judge of things
                    self-evident; the second to draw conclusions that are not self-evident from
                    those that are. The first of these is the province, and the sole province, of
                    common sense; and therefore it coincides with reason in its whole extent, and is
                    only another name for one branch or one degree of reason.” Père Buffier talks
                    nearly the same language; but Dr Beattie expresses himself very differently.
                    “That there is a real and essential difference between these two faculties; that
                    common sense cannot be accounted for by being called the perfection of reason,
                    nor reason by being resolved into common sense; will appear,” he thinks, “from
                    the following remarks: 1. We are conscious, from internal feeling, that the
                    energy of understanding which perceives intuitive truth, is different from that
                    other energy which unites a conclusion with a first principle by a gradual chain
                    of intermediate relations. 2. We cannot discern any necessary connection between
                    reason and common sense.” Nay, he says that “we often find men endued with the
                    one who are destitute of the other and he instances dreams and certain kinds of
                    madness where this is the case; adding, “that a man who believes himself made of
                    glass, shall yet reason very justly concerning the means of preserving his
                    supposed brittleness from flaws and fractures.”</p></note> ' agreeing with the

                    its object is certain truth, and with the latter when it is conversant about
                    probabilities. Nothing indeed is more evident, than that, in the assent of the
                    mind to every proposition, some energy of the judgment is exerted; and upon
                    every proposition not self-evident, reasoning of some kind or other must be
                    employed to procure that assent. Instead therefore of perplexing ourselves and
                    our readers with various analyses of the human understanding, or rather with
                    various names to what after all is perhaps but one individual power, it will
                    surely be of more importance to the cause of truth to examine the different
                    sources of evidence by which the assent of the reason, or judgment, or common
                    sense, is determined.</p>

                <p>Intuitive evidence is that which arises from the comparison of two or more ideas
                    or notions when their agreement or disagreement is perceived immediately,
                    without the intervention of any third idea or notion. Of this kind is the
                    evidence of these propositions: One and four make five ∙,<note anchored="true"

                    Rhetoric.</p></note> things equal to the same thing are equal to one another;
                    the whole is greater than any of its parts; and, in a word, all the axioms in
                    arithmetic and geometry. All these are in reality propositions in which the
                    subject and predicate appear upon comparison to be nothing more than the same
                    thing taken in different views, or expressed by different terms. In fact, they
                    are all in some respect reducible to this axiom: “Whatever is, is.” We do not
                    say that they are deduced from it; for they have in themselves that original and
                    intrinsic evidence which makes them, as soon as the terms are understood, to be
                    perceived intuitively. And if they be not thus perceived, no deduction of reason
                    will ever confer on them any additional evidence. But although not deduced from
                    the general axiom, they may be considered as particular exemplifications of it;
                    inasmuch as they are all implied in this, that the properties and relations of
                    our clear and adequate ideas can be no other than what the mind clearly
                    perceives them to be.</p>
                <p>It may perhaps be thought that if axioms were propositions perfectly identical,
                    it would be impossible by their means to advance a single step beyond the simple
                    ideas first perceived by the mind. And it would indeed be true, that if the
                    predicate of the proposition were nothing but a repetition of the subject under
                    the same aspect, and in the same or synonymous terms, no conceivable advantage
                    could be made of it for the furtherance of knowledge. Of such propositions as
                    these, for instance, “Seven are seven, eight are eight, the three angles of a
                    triangle are the three angles of a triangle, two right angles are two right
                    angles,” it is manifest that we could never avail ourselves for the improvement
                    of science. But when the thing, although in effect coinciding, is considered
                    under a different aspect; when that which is single in the subject is divided in
                    the predicate, and conversely; or when what is a whole in the one is regarded as
                    a part of something else in the other; such propositions lead to the discovery
                    of innumerable and apparently remote relations. It is by the aid of such simple
                    and elementary principles that the arithmetician and the algebraist proceed to
                    the most astonishing discoveries. Nor are the operations of the geometrician
                    essentially different; for to this class belong all propositions relating to
                    number and quantity; that is, all which admit of mathematical demonstration. If
                    the truth of a mathematical proposition be not self-evident; in other words, if
                    the subject and predicate do not appear at first sight to be different names for
                    the same thing; another term must be found which shall be synonymous to them
                    both. Thus, to prove that the three internal angles of a right-lined triangle
                    are equal to two right angles, I produce the base of the triangle; and by a very
                    short process I discover that the exterior angle, so formed, is equal to the two
                    interior and opposite angles. By a process equally plain and short, I perceive
                    that the exterior angle and the interior adjacent angle are equal to two right
                    angles. But I have already seen, that the exterior angle is neither more nor
                    less than the two interior and opposite angles under a different aspect; whence
                    it appears that the three internal angles of the triangle are nothing else than
                    two right angles under a different aspect. In a word, all demonstration is
                    founded on first principles or primary truths, which neither admit nor stand in
                    need of proof, and to which the mind is compelled to give its assent by a bare
                    intuition of the ideas or terms of which these primary truths are composed.
                    Nothing is susceptible of demonstration, in the rigid sense of the word, but
                    general, necessary, and eternal truths; and every demonstration is built upon
                    intuition, and consists in a series of axioms or propositions of the very same
                    kind with the first principle or truth from which the reasoning proceeds. That
                    propositions formerly demonstrated are taken into the series, does not in the
                    least invalidate this account; inasmuch as these propositions are all resolvable
                    into axioms, and are admitted as links in the chain; not because they are
                    necessary, but merely to avoid the useless prolixity which frequent and tedious
                    repetitions of proofs formerly given would occasion. But it is obvious that such
                    truths only as result from the comparison of ideas and notions are necessary,
                    and of course that such truths only are capable of strict demonstration. The
                    truths which relate to real existences are all contingent, except that which
                    affirms the existence of the Supreme Being, the parent of all truth.</p>
                <p>The mathematical sciences, categorical logic, and that part of metaphysics which
                    demonstrates the being of God, are therefore the only branches of human
                    knowledge which admit of strict demonstration. The longest demonstration in the
                    mathematical sciences may be traced to this general and necessary truth,
                    “Whatever is, is,” or to some particular exemplification of it: the longest
                    train of categorical syllogisms terminates in this general principle, “What is
                    affirmed or denied of a whole genus, may be affirmed or denied of all the
                    species, and all the individuals belonging to that genus and the metaphysical
                    demonstration of the being of God rests upon this foundation, “Whatever had a
                    beginning must have had a cause.” That these are truths absolutely certain,
                    which can neither be proved nor called in question, every man may be satisfied,
                    merely by attending to the ideas or notions which the terms of each proposition
                    express. The two first are merely identical propositions, of the truth of which
                    no man has ever pretended to doubt; and though the last is not identical, it is
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> necessary and self-evident truth, as its contrary
                    implies, that in the same thing there is power and no power, change and no
                    change, action and inaction, at the same instant of time.</p>
                <p>Before we dismiss the subject of intuition, it may not be improper to observe,
                    that it is by this faculty or power of the mind contemplating its ideas and
                    comparing one idea with another, that we acquire all our notions of relation;
                    such as identity and diversity, resemblance, co-existence, relations of space
                    and time, relations of quantity and number, of a cause to its effect, and many
                    more which it would be useless as well as tedious to enumerate.</p>

                <p>It has been just observed, that intuition and demonstration are applicable only
                    to general and necessary propositions, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208142"

                    absurd and impossible. The great business of life, however, is with facts and
                    contingent truths, which admit not of demonstration, but rest upon other
                    evidence. The senses, external and internal, are the inlets to all our knowledge
                    of facts; and the memory is the storehouse where that knowledge is proserved..
                    Of what a man sees or feels, he can at the instant of seeing or of feeling
                    entertain no doubt; and whilst the ideas of what he has seen or felt, with all
                    their associated circumstances, remain vivid and distinct in his memory, he is
                    conscious that he possesses so much real knowledge. But all our knowledge, as it
                    is derived from the senses, is of particular facts or particular truths; and the
                    man who has in certain circumstances observed one particular phenomenon, for the
                    existence of which he perceives no necessity, has not sufficient ground to
                    conclude, that in similar circumstances similar phenomena will always occur.
                    Milton, who surpassed the greater part of his contemporaries in philosophical
                    science almost as far as he has surpassed all succeeding poets in the sublimity
                    of his genius, represents Adam, when first falling asleep, as under
                    apprehensions that he was about to sink into his original state of
                    insensibility.</p>
                <p>Gentle sleep</p>
                <p>First found me, and with soft oppression seiz’d My droused sense, untroubled; 1
                    hough I thought I then was passing to my former state Insensible, and forthwith
                    to dissolve.</p>
                <p>Apprehensions similar to these would take place in his mind when he first
                    perceived that darkness had overspread the earth. In his circumstances, he could
                    have no ground to expect that the sun when once set would rise again to re∙
                    illumine the world, as he had not then experienced the alternate succession of
                    light and darkness, and probably knew not whence light proceeded. After some
                    time, however, having observed day and night regularly to succeed each other,
                    these two appearances, or the ideas of them, would be so associated in his mind,
                    that each setting sun would suggest the idea of next sunrising, and lead him to
                    expect that glorious event with the utmost confidence. He would then consider
                    the alternate succession of day and night as a law of nature, which might be
                    affirmed in a proposition expressive of a certain truth.</p>
                <p>This continued observation of the same event happening in the same or similar
                    circumstances is what we call experience; and it is the only evidence which we
                    have for all the general truths in physics, even for those which we are apt to
                    think intuitively certain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    supposed to be universal and necessary truths; but, for any thing that we know,
                    they may be particular truths; and they are certainly contingent, as the
                    contrary to either of them may be supposed without absurdity. We have indeed
                    always observed that the milk of animals of every species is white; and
                    therefore the idea of whiteness becomes a necessary part of our idea of the
                    substance milk, of which we call whiteness an essential property. This, however,
                    respects only the milk of those animals with which we are acquainted. But since
                    the milk of all the animals with which we are acquainted, or of which we have
                    heard, is white, we can have no reason to suspect that the milk of any new and
                    strange animal is of any other colour. Also, since, wherever there has been the
                    specific gravity, ductility, and other properties of gold, the colour has always
                    been yellow, we conclude that these circum-. stances are necessarily united,
                    although by some unknown bond of union, and that they will always go
                    together.</p>
                <p>The proper proof, therefore, of such universal propositions as that “milk is
                    white,” that “gold is yellow,” or that “a certain degree of cold will freeze
                    water,” consists in what is called an induction of particular facts of precisely
                    the same nature. Having found, by much and various experience, that the same
                    events never fail to take place in the same circumstances, the expectation of
                    the same consequences from the same previous circumstances is necessarily
                    generated in our minds; and we can have no more suspicion of a different event
                    than we can separate the idea of whiteness from that of the other properties of
                    milk. When the previous circumstances arc precisely the same, we call the
                    process of proof by the name of induction, and expect the event from experience;
                    but if they be not precisely the same, but only bear a considerable resemblance
                    to the circumstances from which any particular appearance has been found to
                    result, we call the argument analogy; and it is stronger in proportion to the
                    degree of resemblance in the previous circumstances. Thus the milk of all the
                    cows that we have seen, or upon which we have made the experiment, having been
                    found nutritious, we confidently expect that the milk of all other cows will
                    prove nourishing likewise; and this confidence of expectation is the result of
                    uniform experience. But if, from having found the milk of all the animals with
                    which we are acquainted to be nourishing, however different the nature of these
                    animals, we infer that the milk of any strange animal will likewise be
                    nourishing, the inference is drawn by analogy, and by no means carries with it
                    the conviction of experience. A proof from real experience can leave no doubt in
                    the mind; an argument from analogy always must. In the one case, we only infer
                    that two events of precisely the same nature, and in precisely the same
                    circumstances, have been produced by the same kind of cause; in the other, we
                    infer that two events similar in most respects, although, for any thing that we
                    know, dissimilar in others, have been produced by the same kind of cause; and it
                    is obvious that between these cases the difference is great.</p>
                <p>Thus, after having observed that all the projectiles tø which we have paid any
                    attention, a stone thrown from the hand, a ball from a gun, and an arrow from a
                    bow, describe a certain curve, and are impelled in that curve by two powers
                    acting in different lines of direction, which form with each other a certain
                    angle, we infer that all projectiles which on the surface of the earth describe
                    the same curve, are impelled by the same or by similar powers acting in the same
                    or similar lines of direction. This inference is the result of experience, and
                    carries with it the fullest conviction to the mind. But when, from having
                    observed that the curves described by the planets arc of the same kind with
                    those described by projectiles on the earth, Sir Isaac Newton inferred that
                    these vast bodies are impelled in their orbits by forces of the very same kind,
                    and acting in the same manner, with the forces which impel a ball from a cannon
                    or an arrow from a bow, his argument was founded only on analogy, and even that
                    analogy was very remote. We know by experience that all projectiles which fall
                    under our immediate cognizance are of the very same kind and in the very same
                    circumstances; that every one of them has a tendency, from whatever cause, to
                    the centre of the earth, and is preserved from falling by the force of
                    projection. We know likewise that they are all moved through the medium of the
                    atmosphere, which at the surface of the earth is considerably dense, and that a
                    dense medium must occasion much resistance. But we do not know that the planets
                    have a tendency to the centre of the sun, that they arc preserved from falling
                    into that luminary by a projectile force, or whether they move through a medium
                    or <hi rend="italic">in</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:194208155"

                    >;</hi> so that we are not certain that the motion of the planets is perfectly
                    similar to that of terrestrial projectiles in any other circumstance than the
                    form of the curve which they all describe; and from this single case of
                    coincidence no inference can be drawn which carries to the mind absolute
                    conviction.</p>
                <p>When a man reasons from experience, he infers, that what has uniformly happened
                    hitherto, will happen always in the very same circumstances; or that what is
                    known to be the cause of various phenomena of the same kind is the cause of
                    every other phenomenon in all respects similar to these. Such an inference is
                    foundedon thcunited and complete evidence of sense, memory, and reason. When a
                    man reasons from analogy, he infers, that what has generally happened hitherto,
                    will happen again in circumstances nearly similar; or that what is known to be
                    the cause of various phenomena of the same kind, is the cause of other phenomena
                    in some respects similar to these. This inference is likewise founded on the
                    united evidence of sense, memory, and reason; but here the evidence of sense is
                    not complete, and it can be strengthened only by finding more facts of the same
                    or of a similar nature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">Of Testimony.</hi></p>
                <p>The last source of evidence which we proposed to consider is testimony, or the
                    report of men concerning events which have fallen under the observation of their
                    senses. That we are all ready to believe the information which we receive from
                    the testimony of our fellow-creatures, is undeniable; and indeed, without such
                    belief, every man’s knowledge of facts and events would be confined to those
                    only of which he himself had been a personal witness. In that case, no man who
                    had not travelled would believe that there are such cities as Rome and
                    Constantinople; and no man whatever could now believe that such heroes as
                    Hannibal and Caesar had ever existed.</p>
                <p>Between words and things there is no natural connection; and although we are all
                    accustomed to give to things the names by which they are known in the language
                    that we speak, and to express their mutual relations by the words appropriated
                    for that purpose, yet it is obviously impossible to denote one thing by the name
                    of another, and to express by words relations which have no existence. This
                    being the case, it may be asked, upon what principle do we give credit to human
                    testimony? To this question various answers have been given, which have produced
                    much controversy on one of the most important subjects which can employ the mind
                    of man.</p>
                <p>“We may observe,” says Mr Hume,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Essay on Miracles.</p></note> “that there is no species of
                    reasoning more common, more useful, and even necessary to human life, than that
                    which is derived from the testimony of men and the reports of eye-witnesses and
                    spectators. This species of reasoning perhaps one may deny to be founded on the
                    relation of cause and effect. I shall not dispute about a word. It will be
                    sufficient to observe, that our assurance in any argument of this kind is
                    derived from no other principle than our observation of the veracity of human
                    testimony, and of the usual conformity of facts to the reports of witnesses. It
                    being a general maxim that no objects have any discoverable connection together,
                    and that all the inferences which we can draw from one to another are founded
                    merely on our experience of their constant and regular conjunction, it is
                    evident that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human
                    testimony, whose connection with any event seems in itself as little necessary
                    as any other. Were not the memory tenacious to a certain de gree; had not men
                    commonly an inclination to truth, and a principle of probity; were they not
                    sensible to shame when detected in falsehood; were not these, I say, discovered
                    by experience to be qualities inherent in human nature, we should never repose
                    the least confidence in human testimony. And as the evidence derived from
                    witnesses and human testimony is founded on past experience, so it varies with
                    that experience, and is regarded either as a proof or probability, according as
                    the conjunction between any particular kind of report and any kind of object has
                    been found to be constant or variable. There are a number of circumstances to be
                    taken into consideration in all judgments of this kind; and the ultimate
                    standard by which we determine all disputes that may arise concerning them, is
                    always derived from experience and observation. The reason why we place any
                    credit in witnesses and historians, is not derived from any connection which we
                    perceive <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> between testimony and reality, but
                    because we are accustomed to find a conformity between them. But when the fact
                    attested is such a one as has seldom fallen under our observation, here is a
                    contest of two opposite experiences, of which the one destroys the other as far
                    as it goes, and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force which
                    remains. The very same principle of experience which gives us a certain degree
                    of assurance in the testimony of witnesses, gives us also, in this case, another
                    degree of assurance against the fact which they endeavour to establish; from
                    which contradiction there necessarily arises a counterpoise, and mutual
                    destruction of belief and authority.”</p>
                <p>This account of the origin of our faith in testimony has been controverted with
                    much success by the Doctors Campbell and Reid. “That the evidence of testimony
                    is derived solely from experience,” says the former of these writers,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dissertation on Miracles, and
                    The Philosophy of Rhetoric.</p></note> “is at least not so incontestable a truth
                    as Mr Hume supposes it; that, on the contrary, testimony hath a natural and
                    original influence on belief antecedent to experience, will, I imagine, easily
                    be conceived. For this purpose, let it be remarked, that the earliest assent
                    which is given to testimony by children, and which is previous to all
                    experience, is, in fact, the most unlimited; that by a gradual experience of
                    mankind, it is gradually contracted, and reduced to narrower bounds. To say,
                    therefore, that our diffidence in testimony is the result of experience, is more
                    philosophical, because more consonant to truth, than to say that our faith in
                    testimony has this foundation. Accordingly, youth, which is unexperienced, is
                    credulous; age, on the contrary, is distrustful. Exactly the reverse would be
                    the case were this author’s doctrine just.” This is a complete confutation of
                    the reasoning of Mr Hume; but in order to prevent all cavilling, it is to be
                    wished that the very acute author had explained more fully what he means by
                    saying that testimony has a natural and original influence on belief; for these
                    words may be taken in different senses, in one of which what he affirms is true,
                    and in another it is false.</p>
                <p>Dr Campbell’s omission is amply supplied by Dr Reid, who gives the following
                    account of testimony, and of the credit which it obtains. “The wise and
                    beneficent Author of nature, who intended that we should be social creatures,
                    and that we should receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge
                    by the information of others, hath, for these purposes, implanted in our nature
                    two principles that tally with each other. The first of these principles is a
                    propensity to speak truth, and to use the signs of language so as to convey our
                    real sentiments. This principle has a powerful operation even in the greatest
                    liars; for where they lie once, they speak truth a hundred <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208168" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8168-0642"/>times. Truth is always
                    uppermost, and is the natural issue of the mind. It requires no art or training,
                    no inducement or temptation, but only that we yield to a natural impulse. Lying,
                    on the contrary, is doing violence to our nature, and is never practised, even
                    by the worst men, without some temptation. Speaking truth is like using our
                    natural food, which we would do from appetite, although it answered no end; but
                    lying is like taking physic, which is nauseous to the taste, and which no man
                    takes but for some end which he cannot otherwise attain. AVhen we are influenced
                    by any motive, we must be conscious of that influence, and capable of perceiving
                    it upon reflection. Now, when I reflect upon my actions most attentively, I am
                    not conscious that in speaking truth I am influenced on ordinary occasions by
                    any motive moral or political. I find that truth is always at the door of my
                    lips, and goes forth spontaneously, if not held back. It requires neither good
                    nor bad intention to bring it forth, but only that I be artless and undesigning.
                    There may indeed be temptations to falsehood, which would be too strong for the
                    natural principle of veracity, unaided by principles of honour or virtue; but
                    where there is no such temptation, we speak truth by instinct. By this instinct,
                    a real connection is formed between our words and our thoughts; and thereby the
                    former become fit to be signs of the latter, which they could not otherwise be.”
                    <hi rend="italic">(Inquiry into the Human Mind.')</hi></p>
                <p>Such is the account which Dr Reid gives of the truth of human testimony; and he
                    adds, that there is anotherori-ginal principle implanted in us by the Supreme
                    Being, to tally with it, viz. a disposition to confide in the veracity of
                    others, and to believe what they tell us. “This,” he says, “is the counterpart
                    to the former; and as that may be called the principle of veracity, we shall,
                    for the want of a more proper name, call this the principle of credulity. It is
                    unlimited in children until they meet with instances of deceit and falsehood;
                    and retains a very considerable degree of strength through life.”</p>
                <p>It is ever with extreme reluctance that we controvert the opinions of this able
                    writer; and that reluctance cannot be lessened in the present instance, when we
                    are conscious that great part of what he says is unanswerable. That truth is
                    always at the door of the lips; that it requires no effort to bring it forth;
                    that in ordinary cases men speak truth uninfluenced by any motive moral or
                    political; that the greatest liars speak truth a hundred times where they lie
                    once; and that lying is never practised by the worst men without some
                    temptation; are positions which daily experience renders it impossible to
                    question. But, notwithstanding this, we do not think that truth is spoken by an
                    instinctive principle; because it is inconceivable that instinct should teach
                    the use of arbitrary and artificial signs, such as the words of every language
                    undoubtedly are; or that between such signs and ideas any instinctive connection
                    should ever be formed, “Truth,” as we have defined it, “is the conformity of
                    those words or signs by which things are expressed, to the things themselves ;”
                    and things themselves are what they are, independently of us, our instincts, and
                    perceptions. When we have precise and adequate ideas of objects, and when those
                    ideas are related to one another as the objects themselves are related, we are
                    in possession of mental truth; and in this case there is a real and natural
                    connection between the signs and the things signified. For we cannot frame
                    original and simple ideas which have no archetype in nature; nor can one object,
                    distinctively perceived, generate in our minds the ideas that are generated by
                    other objects. Here external things are the objects, and ideas are the signs,
                    which, when they are in conformity to the things signified by them, constitute
                    truth.</p>
                <p>But, in human testimony, the ideas in the mind of the speaker are the things
                    signified, and the^words of language are signs by which they are expressed; and
                    when these things and signs are in conformity to each other, the words uttered
                    express so much truth. Now, though in this case there is no natural connection
                    between the sign and the thing signified, yet it is obvious, that without a
                    violent effort of the speaker to the contrary, they must always be in conformity
                    with each other; because in every language there are words appropriated for the
                    purpose of denoting every idea and relation which can be expressed; and in the
                    mind of every man these ideas, relations, and words, have been constantly
                    associated, from the time that he learned to speak. So intimate is this
                    association, and so impossible to be broken, that whoever will pay sufficient
                    attention to the operations of his own mind, will find that he thinks as well as
                    speaks in some language; and that in cogitation he sup. poses and runs over,
                    silently and habitually, those sounds which in speaking he actually utters. If
                    this be so, it is impossible that a man without some effort should ever speak
                    any thing but truth: for the ideas of what he has seen or heard, &amp;c. are not
                    of his manufacture; they are generated by external objects, and, till they be
                    effaced from the memory, they must always, by the law of association, make their
                    appearance there, with all their mutual relations, and in their proper dress. In
                    the very act of learning to speak, we necessarily learn to speak the truth; for
                    were we not to employ words exactly as they are employed by those with whom we
                    converse, our language, if language it might be called, would be unintelligible;
                    and we could neither declare our wants nor ask relief with any hopes of success.
                    Children beginning to speak may indeed utter untruths without any motive, and
                    merely from mistake, because the ideas and words of children have neither been
                    long nor closely associated; but it is impossible that a man, however wicked,
                    should habitually and without motives lie on ordinary occasions, unless the
                    fundamental principles of his nature have been totally altered; unless his brain
                    has been disordered by disease; unless his ideas have been disarranged, and all
                    his original associations broken.</p>
                <p>We know indeed by woful experience, that immoral men occasionally utter
                    falsehoods with a view to deceive. But on these occasions they are influenced by
                    some motive either of hope or terror. The falsehood is always uttered with an
                    effort; and so strong is the association between words and ideas, that the truth
                    will at times break out in spite of all their endeavours to suppress it; so that
                    the end or middle of a false narrative, if it be of any length, is commonly
                    inconsistent with the beginning. We entertain a suspicion concerning any matter
                    of fact, when those who relate it contradict each other; when they are but few
                    in number, or of a doubtful character; when they have an interest in what they
                    affirm; when they deliver their testimony with hesitation, or, on the contrary,
                    with too violent asseverations; because these are circumstances which we have
                    generally experienced to accompany false evidence. It is likewise with
                    reluctance that we admit a narrative of events entirely different from every
                    thing which hitherto we have seen or heard; because we may not be certain that
                    the narrator is not under some influence to deceive us in matters concerning
                    which we have nothing but his testimony upon which to ground our judgment. But
                    in every case where the fact recorded is in itself possible, and attributed to
                    an adequate cause; where a competent number of witnesses had sufficient means of
                    information, and are certainly' under no inducement to deceive, testimony is
                    complete evidence, however extraordinary the fact may be; because no fact which
                    is known to have an adequate cause can be so incredible, as that a number of men
                    of sound understandings should act contrary to the fundamental principles of
                    human nature, or <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208181"

                <p>PART II.</p>
                <p>OF BODY WITII ITS ADJUNCTS.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I.—OF THE COMPOSITION OF BODIES; OR, OF MATTER AND FORM.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have contemplated only the powers of our minds by which we acquire a
                    stock of ideas, and the various operations of the intellect upon those ideas, as
                    treasured up in the memory or imagination. In the course of the inquiry we have
                    found, that every idea and notion which we have was suggested by something
                    independent of us; and in order to discover what those things are, we have
                    investigated the nature of each sense, as it is by the senses only that we have
                    any communication with the external world. By touch we perceive heat and cold,
                    hardness and softness, figure and solidity, motion and extension; by the organ
                    of smell we perceive odours; by the tongue and palate, tastes; by the ear,
                    sounds; and by the sight, colours. We have likewise seen, that heat and cold,
                    odours, tastes, sounds, and colours, are mere sensations, which have no
                    existence but whilst they are perceived. On the other hand, hardness and
                    softness, figure and solidity, motion and extension, are neither sensations, nor
                    like sensations; but arc conceived to be something external and independent of
                    our faculties, which may operate in a desert wilderness as well as in a populous
                    city; although, for want of sentient beings to operate upon, it cannot in the
                    wilderness produce the same effects as in the city.</p>
                <p>Of things perceived by the senses we find the greater part always united; for
                    when a man perceives a ρiece of sealing-wax, if he makes use of all his senses,
                    he perceives at once cold, taste, colour, hardness, roughness or smoothness,
                    figure, solidity, motion or rest, and extension. That the powers or qualities
                    which in this instance produce the sensations of heat or cold, taste, odour, and
                    colour, are so united to the hardness, figure, solidity, and extension of the
                    wax, that they cannot exist alone, is very evident; because it is impossible to
                    remove any one of these things, or to conceive it removed, without removing with
                    it all the rest. What then is the bond of this union? Do these tilings
                    necessarily accompany one another, so that one of them cannot exist without
                    bringing all the rest along with it? No. There is no necessary connection
                    amongst them; for by the operation of fire the wax maybe rendered liquid, when
                    the hardness and cold are gone, although every thing else remains the same, or
                    nearly the same, as it was before. By a still further operation of fire the
                    appearance may be entirely changed; and that which was formerly a piece of hard
                    red wax, may be reduced to smoke and ashes, in which there is neither hardness,
                    colour, odour, nor figure; at least there is not in the smoke and the ashes such
                    hardness, colour, odour, or figure, as was in the wax. The solidity and
                    extension, however, remain; for we perceive ashes and smoke to be extended and
                    solid, as much as wax or adamant; nor is it possible to do any thing with the
                    wax, or with any other sensible object, which shall deprive it of extension or
                    solidity.</p>
                <p>Thus, then, extension and solidity may exist and be perceived, when separated
                    from hardness, colour, and odour; but none of these can exist, nor be conceived
                    to exist, independently of extension and solidity. Hardness, colour, odour,
                    taste, and figure, or the things which suggest these notions to us, have with
                    great propriety been termed accidents or qualities; because they cannot exist
                    nor be conceived to exist by themselves, but require for their support one
                    common subject. Extension and solidity can exist independently of them, but they
                    cannot exist independently of solidity and extension.</p>
                <p>Is then solidity the basis of these qualities, so that they necessarily result
                    from it? No. There are many things solid and extended which are neither hard,
                    nor coloured, nor odorous, nor sapid; which could not be if these qualities were
                    the necessary effect of solidity. Besides, all mankind conceive of solidity and
                    extension as qualities of something else; for we never say that solidity is
                    extended or coloured, or hard or odorous, but that something solid has these
                    qualities; and hence it is evident that we consider solidity as a quality
                    itself. In what, then, does solidity and all the other sensible qualities
                    inhere, since they cannot exist separately, and do not support each other? This
                    is a question which modern philosophers do not pretend to answer. But some of
                    the ancients were not so modest. Aristotle and his followers resolved every
                    bodily substance into matter and form; making matter the basis or substratum,
                    and under form comprehending all sensible qualities.</p>
                <p>As attempts have latterly been made to revive this philosophy, it may not be
                    improper to give a short view of the doctrine of matter and form, if it were
                    only to discover whether the speculations of Aristotle and his adherents on this
                    subject deserve to be preferred to those of Newton and Locke.</p>
                <p>The most perspicuous, and by far the most elegant writer, among the moderns, who
                    has adopted the ancient philosophy, is Mr Harris; and, lest we should be accused
                    by others of doing injustice to a subject above the reach of ordinary
                    comprehension, we shall transcribe so much of what he has said of matter and
                    form in his Philosophical Arrangements as seems necessary to make our readers
                    understand' his meaning, as far as it is intelligible. “Matter,” says this
                    writer, “is that elementary constituent in composite substances which appertains
                    in common to them all, without distinguishing them from one another. Every thing
                    generated or made, whether by nature or art, is generated or made out of
                    something else; and this something else is called its subject or matter. Sueh is
                    iron to the saw; such is timber to the boat. Now this subject or matter of a
                    thing being necessarily previous to that thing’s existence, is necessarily
                    different from it, and not the same. Thus iron, as iron, is not a saw; and
                    timber, as timber, is not a boat. Hence, then, one character of every subject or
                    matter, that is, the character of negation or privation. [He means negation or
                    privation of what is to be made out of it].</p>
                <p>“Again, though the subject or matter of a thing be not that thing, yet, were it
                    incapable of becoming so, it could not be called its subject or matter. Thus
                    iron is the subject or matter of a saw, because, though not a saw, it may still
                    become a saw. On the contrary, timber is not the subject or matter of a saw,
                    because it not only (as timber) is no saw, but can never be made one from its
                    very nature and properties. Hence, then, besides privation, another character of
                    every subject or matter, and that is the character of aptitude or capacity. [He
                    means aptitude or capacity to be that which is made out of it.]</p>
                <p>“Again, when one thing is the subject or matter of many things, it implies a
                    privation of them all, and a capacity to them all. Thus iron being the subject
                    or matter of the saw, the axe, and the chisel, implies privation and capacity
                    with respect to all three. Again, we can change a saw into a chisel, but not
                    into a boat; we can change a boat into a box, but not into a saw. The reason is,
                    there can be no change or mutation of one thing into another where the two
                    changing beings do not participate the same <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208194"

                    type="authorial"><p>In a note, he says, “This reasoning has reference to what
                    the ancients called ὑλϰ πϑoσεχϰς <hi rend="italic">, the immediate matter,</hi>
                    in opposition to <hi rend="italic">ὑλϰ πϑωτη</hi><hi rend="italic">, the
                    remote</hi> or <hi rend="italic">primary matter.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >”</hi></p></note> But even here, were the boat to moulder and turn to earth,
                    and that earth by natural process to metallize and become iron; through such
                    progression as this we might suppose even the boat to become a saw. Hence
                    therefore it is, that all change is by immediate or mediate participation of the
                    same matter. Having advanced thus far, we must be careful to remember, first,
                    that every subject or matter implies, as such, privation and capacity; and,
                    next, that all change or mutation of beings into one another is by means of
                    their participating the same common matter. This we have chosen to illustrate
                    from works of art, as falling more easily under human cognizance and
                    observation. It is, however, no less certain as to the productions of nature,
                    though the superior subtlety in these renders examples more difficult. The
                    question then is, whether, in the world which we inhabit, it be not admitted
                    from experience, as well as from the confession of all philosophers, that
                    substances of every kind,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>He must mean only bodily substances; for it is not admitted by such
                    philosophers as make a distinction between mind and body, that the one ever
                    passes into the other.</p></note> whether natural or artificial, either
                    immediately or mediately pass into one another; and whether, in that case, there
                    must not be some one primary matter common to all things. I say some one primary
                    matter, and that common to all things, since, without some such matter, such
                    mutation would be wholly impossible. But if there be some one primary matter,
                    and that common to all things, this matter must imply, not (as particular and
                    subordinate matters do) a particular privation and a particular capacity, but,
                    on the contrary, universal privation and universal capacity. If the notion of
                    such a being appear strange and incomprehensible, we may farther prove the
                    necessity of its existence from the following considerations: either there is no
                    such general change as here spoken of, which is contrary to fact, and would
                    destroy the sympathy and congeniality of things: or, if there be, there must be
                    a matter of the character here established; because, without it (as we have
                    said), such change would be impossible. Add to this, however hard universal
                    privation may appear, yet had the primary matter, in its proper nature, any one
                    particular attribute, so as to prevent its privation from being unlimited and
                    universal, such attribute would run through all things, and be conspicuous in
                    all. If it were white, all things would be white; if circular, they would be
                    circular; and so as to other attributes; which is contrary to fact. Add to this,
                    that the opposite to such attribute could never have existence, unless it were
                    possible for the same thing to be at once and in the same instance both white
                    and black, circular and rectilineal, &amp;c. since this inseparable attribute
                    would necessarily be everywhere; because the matter, which implies it, is itself
                    everywhere, at least may be found in all things that are generated and
                    perishable.</p>
                <p>“Here then we have an idea (such as it is) of that singular being <hi
                    rend="italic">υλη πgωτη, the primary matter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a being
                    which those philosophers who are immerged in sensible objects know not well how
                    to admit, though they <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> cannot well do without it;
                    a being which flies the perception of every sense, and which is at best, even to
                    the intellect, but a negative object, no otherwise comprehensible than either by
                    analogy or abstraction. We gain a glimpse of it by abstraction, when we say that
                    the first matter is not the lineaments and complexion which make the beautiful
                    face, nor yet the flesh and blood which make those lineaments and that
                    complexion; nor yet the liquid and solid aliments which make that flesh and
                    blood; nor yet the simple bodies of earth and water which make those various
                    aliments; but something which, being below all these, and supporting them all,
                    is yet different from them all, and essential to their existence. We obtain a
                    sight of it by analogy when we say, that as is the brass to the statue, the
                    marble to the pillar, the timber to the ship, or any one secondary matter to any
                    one peculiar form, so is the first and original matter to all forms in
                    general.”</p>
                <p>Such is the doctrine of the Peripatetics concerning the primary matter or the
                    basis of bodily substances. We forbear to make any remarks upon it until we have
                    seen what they say of form, the other essential part of every body; for what is
                    meant by matter and form will be most completely seen when they are viewed
                    together.</p>
                <p>“Form,” says the same elegant writer, “is that elementary constituent in every
                    composite substance, by which it is distinguished, characterized, and known from
                    every other. But to be more explicit: the first and most simple of all
                    extensions is a line; this, when it exists, united with a second extension,
                    makes a superficies, and these two existing together, with a third, make a
                    solid. Now this last and complete extension we call the first and simplest form;
                    and when this first and simplest form accedes to the first and simplest matter,
                    the union of the two produces body, which is for that reason defined to be
                    matter triply extended. And thus we behold the rise of pure and original
                    body.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Original body,”
                    he says, “when we look downward, has reference to the primary matter, its
                    substratum: when we look upwards, it becomes itself a matter to other things; to
                    the elements, as commonly called, air, earth, water, &amp;c. and in consequence
                    to all the variety of natural productions.”</p></note> It must be remembered,
                    however, that body, under this character, is something indefinite and vague, and
                    scarcely to be made an object of scientific contemplation. It is necessary to
                    this end that its extension should be bounded; for as yet we have treated it
                    without such regard. Now, the bound or limit of simple body is figure, and thus
                    it is that figure, with regard to body, becomes the next form after
                    extension.</p>
                <p>“But though the boundary of body by figure is one step towards rendering it
                    definite and knowable, yet is not this sufficient for the purposes of nature. It
                    is necessary here, that not only its external should be duly bounded, but that a
                    suitable regard should likewise be had to its internal. This internal
                    adjustment, disposition, or arrangement (denominate it as you please), is called
                    <hi rend="italic">organization,</hi> and may be considered as the third form
                    which appertains to body. By its accession we behold the rise of <hi
                    rend="italic">body physical</hi> or <hi rend="italic">natural</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for every such body’ is some way or other organized. And
                    thus may we affirm, that these three, that is to say, extension, figure, and
                    organization, are the three original forms to body physical or natural; figure
                    having respect to its external, organization to its internal, and extension
                    being common both to one and to the other. It is more than probable, that from
                    the variation in these universal and (as I may say) primary forms, arise most of
                    those secondary forms usually called quantities sensible, because they are the
                    proper objects of our several sensations. Such are roughness and smoothness,
                    hardness and softness; the tribes of colours, savours, odours; not to mention
                    those powers of character more subtile, the powers electric, magnetic,
                    medicinal, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>“Here therefore we may answer the question, how natural bodies are distinguished.
                    Not a single one among them consistsof materials in chaos, but of materials
                    wrought up after the most exquisite manner, and that conspicuous in their
                    organization, or in their figure, or in both. As therefore every natural body is
                    distinguished by the differences just described, and as these differences have
                    nothing to do with the original matter, which, being everywhere<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208207" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8207-0645"/> similar, can afford no
                    distinction at all; may we not here infer the expediency of essential forms,
                    that every natural substance may be essentially characterized? These forms,
                    though they differ from matter, can yet never subsist without it; but, united
                    with it, they help to produce every composite being, that is to say, in other
                    words, every natural substance in the visible world. It must be remembered,
                    however, that it is the form in this union which is the source of all
                    distinction. It is by this that the ox is distinguished from the horse, not by
                    that grass on which they subsist, the common matter to both. To which also may
                    be added, that as figures and sensible qualities are the only objects of our
                    sensations, and these are all parts of natural form; so therefore (contrary to
                    the sentiment of the vulgar, who dream of nothing but of matter) it is form
                    which is in truth the whole that we either hear, see, or feel; nor is mere
                    matter any thing better than an obscure imperfect being, knowable only to the
                    reasoning faculty by the two methods already explained, I mean that of analogy
                    and that of abstraction. Here, therefore, we conclude with respect to sensible
                    forms, that is to say, forms immerged in matter and ever inseparable from it. In
                    these and matter we place the <hi rend="italic">elements of natural
                    substance.'’</hi></p>
                <p>If this extract appear long, let it be remembered that it contains the fullest
                    and most perspicuous detail which is to be found in the English language, of a
                    doctrine of which the author of Ancient Metaphysics supposes Mr Locke to have
                    been ignorant; and for which ignorance he affects to treat the English
                    philosopher with supercilious contempt. Had Mr Locke really been ignorant of the
                    ancient doctrine of matter and form, it is probable that most people will be of
                    opinion that the contempt expressed by his censurer might have been spared; but
                    if it should appear that, as far as this theory is intelligible, it differs not,
                    excepting in words, from the doctrine laid down in the Essay concerning Human
                    Understanding, what shall we think of that zeal for ancient phrases which had
                    influence sufficient to make one respectable philosopher pour contempt upon
                    another who was an ornament to his country?</p>
                <p>What Mr Harris has said of matter and form respecting works of art, is
                    sufficiently intelligible, and extremely just. Nor should we object to the
                    account which he gives of the origin of natural body, if he had not divested his
                    first matter of every power and every quality, solidity and extension not
                    excepted. But though we can suppose body divested of any one particular figure,
                    and of every sensible quality, such as colour, odour, tastes, &amp;c. and the
                    substratum or basis or matter of it still remain the same, yet it seems
                    impossible to conceive it divested of solidity without supposing it totally
                    annihilated. Nay, if we have any just notion at all of solidity, it is evidently
                    inseparable from the substratum of body, whatever that substratum may be; and
                    indeed, though Mr Harris divests his first matter of every attribute, the
                    argument by which he proves the necessary existence of such a being does not
                    require its privation to be so universal. “Had the primary matter,” says he, “in
                    its proper nature, any one particular attribute, so as to prevent its privation
                    from being unlimited and universal, such attribute would run through all things,
                    and be conspicuous in all.” This indeed is obvious and undeniable; but solidity
                    and extension do in fact run through all things into which the substratum or
                    matter of body is ever formed, or ever can be conceived to be formed; and
                    therefore there is no necessity for supposing the first matter divested of these
                    attributes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nor does it
                    appear that it was divested of them by all the ancient philosophers. We learn
                    from Cudworth, that “the atomical physiology, the most ancient perhaps of any,
                    teaches that body is nothing else but <hi rend="italic">'3</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">αστοοτον</hi> αι&gt;&lt;nruwov, <hi
                    rend="italic">extended t&gt;ulk</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that nothing is
                    to be attributed to it but what is included in the nature and idea of it, viz.
                    greater or less magnitude, with divisibility into parts, figure, and position,
                    together with motion or rest, but so as that no part of body can ever move
                    itself.” And, consequently, this philosopher supposes that “there is no need of
                    any thing else besides the simple elements of magnitude, figure, site, and
                    motion (which are clearly intelligible, or different modes of extended
                    substance), to solve the corporeal phenomena by; and therefore not of any
                    substantial forms distinct from the matter; nor of any other qualities really
                    existing in the bodies without, besides the results or aggregates of those
                    simple elements, and the disposition of the insensible parts of bodies in
                    respect of figure, site, and motion; nor of any intentional <hi rend="italic"
                    >species</hi> or <hi rend="italic">show</hi> propagated from the objects to our
                    senses; nor, lastly, of any other kind of motion or action really distinct from
                    local motion (such as generation and alteration), they being neither
                    intelligible as modes∙of extended substance, nor any way necessary: Forasmuch as
                    the forms and qualities of bodies may well be conceived' to be nothing but the
                    result of those simple elements of magnitude, figure, site, and motion,
                    variously compounded together, in the same manner as syllables and words in
                    great variety result from the different combinations and conjunctions of a few
                    letters, or the simple elements of speech; and the corporeal parts of sensation,
                    and particularly that of vision, may be solved only by local motion of bodies,
                    that is, either by corporeal effluvia (called <hi rend="italic">simulacra,
                    mcmbranx,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">exuviae)</hi> streaming continually from
                    the surface of the objects, or rather, as the later and more refined atomists
                    conceived, by pressure made from the object to the eye, by means of light in the
                    medium. So that <hi rend="italic">⅛ ìi* β</hi><hi rend="italic

                    as it were by a staff, touch it. Again, generation and corruption may be
                    sufficiently explained by concretion and secretion, or local motion, without
                    substantial forms and qualities. And, lastly, those sensible ideas of light and
                    colours, heat and cold, sweet and bitter, as they are distinct things from the
                    figure, site, and motion of the insensible parts of bodies, seem plainly to be
                    nothing else but our own fancies, passions, and sensation, however they be
                    vulgarly mistaken for qualities in the bodies without us.” (Cudworth’s <hi

                    seen by and by, is the philosophy of Newton, Locke, and all their followers. And
                    that it is the genuine philosophy of the ancient atomists, we may safely take
                    the word of the author whom we have quoted; for no modern has been more
                    conversant with their writings, more completely master of their language, or has
                    given their sense with greater accuracy· Those authors, therefore, who in their
                    zeal for ancient metaphysics would explode the physiology of Newton and Locke,
                    and substitute in its stead the Aristotelian doctrine of matter and form, belie
                    their own pretences; for the theory which they would banish is more ancient than
                    that which they introduce, and we appeal to our readers if it be not more
                    intelligible.</p></note></p>
                <p>Mr Harris mentions that both Timaeus and Plato drop expressions as if they
                    considered matter to be place; but place, as will afterwards be seen, can be the
                    basis of nothing. He likewise quotes a passage from Ammonius on the
                    predicaments, in which it is said “that there never was in actuality either
                    matter without body, or body without quality ;” and we appeal to our readers if
                    it be not absolutely impossible to contemplate such a thing even in idea. To the
                    question, whether the first matter has a separate existence by itself, distinct
                    from all the qualities of body, the author of Ancient Metaphysics answers thus:
                    “We have no idea of it existing separately, because we find no such a thing in
                    nature, from which we draw all our ideas; but whether there may not be such a
                    thing existing in the regions of infinite space, as matter without form and
                    dimensions, is what I think no man can take upon him to decide.” But, with all
                    submission, if a man cannot decide this question with the utmost certainty, his
                    three ponderous volumes are nothing better than useless paper; for the subject
                    of them is things existing; and concerning existence we know nothing with
                    greater certainty than that a being of which nothing positive can be affirmed,
                    cannot possibly have any existence.</p>
                <p>That, in the world which we inhabit, bodily substances of every kind, whether
                    natural or artificial, either immediately or mediately pass into one another, is
                    a truth which <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208220" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8220-0646"
                    />cannot be denied; and therefore it follows, that there must be some one
                    primary matter common to all things. In the modern philosophy this primary
                    matter is considered as solid, and as the substratum of all bodies; and all
                    those things which, in the language of Mr Harris, are comprehended under the
                    appellation of form, are called qualities; so that on this subject the ancient
                    and the modern philosophy differ in nothing but in the latter using the word
                    qualities instead of the word form; and defining the first matter to be, “a
                    solid substance everywhere the same,” whilst the ancient philosophy considers it
                    as void of solidity.</p>
                <p>Of the nature of this first matter all philosophers are equally ignorant; for, as
                    Mr Harris says, it is in truth form; or, as modern philosophers would say, they
                    are in truth qualities, which are the whole that we either hear, or see, or
                    fee], or of which we have either idea or conception. Mr Locke says expressly,
                    “that if any one will examine himself concerning his notion of pure substance in
                    general, he will find that he has no other idea of it at all, but only a
                    supposition of he knows not what support of such qualities as are capable of
                    producing simple ideas in us.”</p>
                <p>But how, it has been asked, do we know that the things which we perceive are
                    qualities, and cannot exist without a subject? We answer, because every one of
                    them, except solidity, may be changed or destroyed, and the subject in which
                    they inhere still remain. Thus, though wax may be melted or burned, and be no
                    longer a hard red substance of such a figure and such a smell, the matter which
                    supported the hardness, figure, colour, and smell, still remains; for melted wax
                    or ashes is as much a solid substance as is that which may be used for the
                    sealing of letters or documents. It has been said that solidity is the
                    substratum of body;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    philosophers of most eminence who have maintained this opinion are,,Dr Watts,
                    the author of Procedure, Extent, and Limits, of the Human Understanding; and Dr
                    Law, the bishop of Carlisle, who, in a note upon King’s Origin of Evil, gives
                    the opinion of the triumvirate in the following words. “We find by experience,
                    that a thing will always exhibit the same appearances in some respects, though
                    it admit of changes in others; or, in Mr Locke’s language, that certain numbers
                    of simple ideas go constantly together, whereas some others do not. The former
                    of these we call the <hi rend="italic">substance,</hi> thing, or being, itself;
                    the latter are termed its modes or <hi rend="italic">accidents.</hi> Thus the
                    substance of <hi rend="italic">body,</hi> as far as we know of it, consists in
                    solidity and extension; which being necessarily finite, it also becomes capable
                    of division, figure, and motion. 'These are its original inseparable qualities,
                    which constitute the thing, and seem not to depend on any thing else as a
                    subject. But a particular figure, motion, &amp;c. are only accidents or modes of
                    its existence; which do not necessarily attend it, though they themselves cannot
                    be supposed to exist without it. The substance of spirit consists in the powers
                    of thinking and acting, which likewise admit of various modifications. This
                    seems to be all that we can learn concerning the nature of things from
                    observation and experience. To inquire into the manner how these, which we call
                    properties, exist together, or to attempt to explain the cause, ground, or
                    reason of their union, is in vain. To assign the word substance for a
                    representation of it, is saying nothing; it is setting a mere word for what we
                    have neither any idea of nor occasion for. Indeed if we consider these primary
                    qualities as needing something to inhere in, we are obliged to seek for
                    something to support them; and, by the same way of reasoning, we may seek for
                    something else to support that other something, and so on; and at last shall
                    find no other support for the whole but the cause which produced it.” “Dr
                    Watts,” continues the Bishop, “is of opinion, that it is introducing a needless
                    scholastic notion into the real nature of things, and then fancying it to have a
                    real existence.” <hi rend="italic">{Logic,</hi> p. 14.) The author of the
                    Procedure, Extent, &amp;c. affirms, “that, as far as we directly know the
                    essential properties of any substance, so far we have a direct knowledge of the
                    substance itself; and if we had a direct knowledge of all the essential
                    properties of any substance, we should have an adequate knowledge of that
                    substance; for surely, if there be any meaning in words, the knowing any thing
                    of the essential properties of a thing is knowing so much of its very
                    substance.”</p><p>That the substance of body consists in solidity and extension,
                    and nothing more, and that these depend not upon any thing else as a subject,
                    cannot be true; for solidity, in our conception, is nothing but impenetrability;
                    but whoever uses the word impenetrability, certainly means that there is
                    something impenetrable. That there is some real thing or being different from
                    solidity and extension, which impresses us with the notion that it is solid and
                    extended, is self-evident to all mankind. If it be not matter, these conceptions
                    must be communicated to us by the immediate agency of the Deity, which seems to
                    have been the real opinion of the Bishop of Carlisle. But this differs not from
                    the theory of Berkeley, which we shall consider by and by.</p></note> and men
                    have been probably led into this notion from a conviction that such substratum,
                    whatever it be, is and must be solid; but that solidity is only a quality
                    inseparable from the first matter, and not that matter itself, must be evident
                    from this consideration, that solidity is the same in all bodies, and incapable
                    of producing by itself any other effect than that of excluding from the place
                    occupied by it every other solid substance. It could not of itself be the
                    substratum of colour, taste, or smell, otherwise all bodies would be coloured,
                    sapid, and odorous; and as, according to all our notions of it, it is incapable
                    of any change, it could not by itself be so modified as to excite in us these
                    sensations.</p>
                <p>The things, then, immediately perceived by us, or of which we have any adequate
                    idea or conception, are only qualities which must belong to a subject; and all
                    that we know about this subject is, that it is that to which such qualities
                    belong. From this it is evident, that our notion of matter, as distinguished
                    from its qualities, is a relative<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Reid’s Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Mau.</p></note>
                    and obscure notion, and must remain such until men receive other faculties. In
                    this the philosopher seems to have no advantage above the vulgar; for as the
                    latter perceive colour, and figure, and motion, by their senses, as well as he
                    does, and as both are equally certain that there is a subject of those
                    qualities, so the notions which both have of this subject are equally obscure;
                    or, to speak more properly, they have no positive notion of it at all. When a
                    philosopher calls it the first matter, a substratum, or a subject of inhesion,
                    those learned words convey no meaning but what every man understands and
                    expresses, by saying, in common language, that it is a thing extended, solid,
                    and moveable.</p>
                <p>They are therefore qualities, or, in the language of ancient philosophy, forms
                    alone, about which, in corporeal substance, we can reason with precision and
                    certainty; and it is sufficient for all the purposes of life that we have of
                    them an adequate knowledge. For as the first matter or original substratum of
                    all bodies seems to be the same, although we know not what it is, and as one
                    body is distinguished from another only by its qualities or powers, a knowledge
                    of the nature of these is all that can be necessary to direct our conduct with
                    respect to the various objects with which we are surrounded.</p>
                <p>Qualities thus considered in bodies are, first, such as are utterly inseparable
                    from the body, in what state soever it is; such as, in all the changes and
                    alterations which it suffers, and under all the force which can be employed upon
                    it, it constantly exhibits. Thus, in the instance already given, a stick of
                    sealing-wax may, by the operation of fire, be rendered liquid, or reduced to
                    smoke and ashes; and when it has undergone these changes, it has lost many of
                    the sensible qualities which it had when a long round substance, fit for the
                    purpose of sealing letters; but other qualities which were then perceivable in
                    it still remain; for not only liquid wax, but every particle of smoke and ashes,
                    is solid and extended, as well as the hardest or the largest body; and every
                    such particle has likewise some figure, and is capable of motion or rest. Again,
                    if a grain of wheat, or any other corporeal substance, be divided into <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194208233" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8233-0647"/> two parts, and
                    each part be again divided without end, still the smallest particle of it will
                    be solid, extended, of some figure, and capable of further division. Solidity,
                    extension, divisibility, and motion or rest, are therefore qualities inseparable
                    from body, and have on that account been with great propriety called its
                    original or primary qualities.</p>
                <p>There are other qualities, which in truth are nothing in the bodies themselves,
                    but powers, arising from the magnitude, the figure, the texture, and the motion,
                    of their insensible parts, to produce in us various sensations. Such are
                    colours, sounds, tastes, and odours. These have been denominated secondary
                    qualities; and to them may be added a third sort, which are universally allowed
                    to be barely powers, though they are in fact as much real qualities in the
                    subject as those we have just mentioned. Thus the power in fire to produce by
                    its primary qualities a new colour or consistency in wax or clay, is as much a
                    quality in the fire as the power which it has to produce in us a new sensation
                    of warmth or burning. That colours, tastes, sounds, and odours, as they arc
                    perceived by us, are mere sensations, has been already proved; and that the
                    powers in the bodies which produce these sensations are not, like solidity and
                    extension, inseparable from the body to which they may belong, is evident,
                    because a piece of red wax may be reduced to black ashes, and because, by
                    pounding an almond, we may change its clear white colour into a dirty hue, and
                    its pleasant taste into one that is oily and rancid; and a single rent through
                    the body of a bell destroys its sound.</p>
                <p>The primary qualities of body have a real existence independently of us and of
                    every other creature. Thus the particular bulk, number, figure, and motion of
                    the parts of fire or snow are really in the fire or snow, whether any man’s
                    senses perceive them or not; and therefore these may be called real qualities,
                    because they really exist in the bodies. But light, heat, whiteness, or cold, as
                    they are perceived by us, are no more really in fire or in snow, than sickness
                    is in tartar or pain in a sword. Take away the sensations of them; let not the
                    eyes see light or colours, nor the cars hear sounds; let not the palate taste
                    nor the nose smell; and all colours, tastes, odours, and sounds, as they are
                    such particular sensations, vanish and cease, and are reduced to their causes,
                    that is, to the bulk, figure, and motion of the parts of the body.</p>
                <p>The qualities, then, which are in bodies, rightly considered, are of three sorts.
                    1. The bulk, figure, number, situation, and motion or rest, of their solid
                    parts. Of these, as they are in themselves, we have clear and distinct notions.
                    We know that they are in the body whether we perceive them or not, and we call
                    them primary or essential qualities. 2. The power that is in any body, by reason
                    of its internal texture and insensible primary qualities, to operate upon our
                    senses in a peculiar manner, producing in us the different sensations of
                    colours, sounds, tastes, or smells, &amp;c. These we have denominated secondary
                    qualities, but they are often termed sensible qualities. 3. The power that is in
                    any body, by reason of the particular constitution of its primary qualities, to
                    effect such a change in the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of another body,
                    as to make it operate on our senses differently from what it did before. Thus,
                    the sun has a power to make wax white, and fire to make lead fluid. These are
                    universally called powers; but we have no such notions of them as we have of the
                    primary qualities of bodies. We know that they exist, but we know not what they
                    are. It has indeed been discovered that the sensation of smell is occasioned by
                    the effiuvia of bodies;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Heid’s Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man, and Locke’s Essay on Human
                    Understanding.</p></note> that of sound by their vibration. The disposition of
                    bodies to reflect a particular kind of light occasions the sensation of colour;
                    and the operation of the minute parts of bodies upon the nerves of the tongue
                    and palate is the cause of tastes. Very curious discoveries have been made as to
                    the nature of heat and its manner of operating, and an ample field still
                    remains. We are likewise intuitively certain, that body can operate upon body
                    only by impulse; but how certain impulses upon certain organs should produce
                    sensations in us to which there is nothing similar in the impelling body, is
                    equally unknown to the clown and the philosopher.</p>
                <p>Such is the distinction which in modern philosophy is made between primary and
                    secondary qualities; but it is a distinction which was likewise well known to
                    that sect of ancient philosophers who were denominated atomists. At the head of
                    these were Thales and Pythagoras; and .we may infer from Aristotle, that the
                    sect comprehended almost all the physiologists who had taught before himself and
                    Plato; for he says,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    fall into a great absurdity, since they make all sense to be touch, and resolve
                    sensible qualities into the figures of insensible atoms.” And he adds, that “the
                    former physiologists (without exception) said not well, that there is no black
                    and white without the sight, nor bitter and sweet without the taste.” He
                    elsewhere<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Generatione et Corruptione,</hi> lib. i.
                    cap. ii.</p></note> tells us, that those philosophers explained generation and
                    alteration without forms and qualities, by figures and local motion. “Democritus
                    and Leucippus having made figures (or variously figured atoms) the first
                    principles, make generation and alteration out of these, namely, generation
                    together with corruption from the concretion and secretion of them, but
                    alteration from the change of their order and position.” By the atomic
                    physiologists the name of quality was very generally applied to those things
                    only which we have called secondary qualities. The primary, being considered as
                    essential to matter, were seldom, if ever, called qualities. That the atoms,
                    which they held to be the first principles of bodies, were figured, solid,
                    extended, and moveable, is apparent not only from the short view of their system
                    which we have given from Cudworth, but likewise from the passages which we have
                    just quoted from Aristotle; but the question debated between them and their
                    antagonists was, whether those atoms had smell, taste, and colour, or, as it was
                    commonly expressed, whether they had qualities. Democritus, Leucippus, and the
                    other atomists, we see, maintained that they bad not; and the following account
                    of the doctrine of Protagoras, another philosopher of that school, shows that on
                    this subject at least the ancient advocates for the atomic system reasoned as
                    justly as any of the moderns, and much more justly than the Peripatetics and
                    Platonists, by whom they were opposed. Plato having in his Theoetetus first said
                    in general that the philosophy of Protagoras made all things to consist of a
                    commixture of atoms and local motion, represents his doctrine concerning colours
                    in particular after this manner: “First, as to that which belongs to the sight,
                    you must conceive what is called a white or black colour not to be any thing
                    absolutely existing either without your eyes or within your eyes; but black and
                    white, and every other colour, are caused by different motions made upon the
                    eye, from objects differently modified; so that it is nothing either in the
                    agent or patient absolutely, but something which arises from between them both.”
                    From this passage it is plain that Protagoras thought of colours exactly as Mr
                    Locke thought, that they are not real qualities existing in bodies, but merely
                    sensations excited in our minds; and indeed he is presently after represented as
                    having called them <hi rend="italic">τινα εν ημw φασματα, certain fancies</hi>

                    rend="italic">appearances in us.</hi> But there is in the Theoetetus another
                    passage, in which a fuller account is given of the atomic philosophy, to this
                    purpose: “The principle upon which all these things depend is this, that the
                    whole universe is motion of atoms, and nothing else, which motion is considered
                    two ways, and is accordingly called by two names, action and passion. From the
                    mutual congress, and, as it were, attrition of these together, are begotten
                    innumerable offsprings, which, though infinite in number, yet may be reduced to
                    two general heads, sensibles and sensations, which are both generated at the
                    same time. The sensations are seeing, hearing, and the like; and the
                    corresponding sensibles are colours, sounds, &amp;c. Wherefore, when the eye and
                    its proper object meet together, both the <hi rend="italic">αiσ-</hi> 0jjrwand
                    <hi rend="italic">theaiσ0ησις,</hi> the sensible idea of white and black, and
                    the sensation of seeing, are generated together, neither of which would have
                    been produced if those two had not met. The like is to be conceived of all other
                    sensibles, as hot and cold, &amp;c. None of these are absolutely things in
                    themselves, or real qualities in external objects; but they are begotten from
                    the mutual congress of agent and patient, and that by motion: so that neither
                    the agent has any such thing in it before its congress with the patient, nor the
                    patient before its congress with the agent. But the agent and patient meeting
                    together, and begetting sensation and sensibles, both the object and the
                    sentient are forthwith made to be so and so qualified; as when honey is tasted,
                    the sensation of tasting and the quality of sweetness are begotten together,
                    though the sensation be vulgarly attributed to the taster, and the quality of
                    sweetness to the honey.” The conclusion of all which is summed up thus: “Not one
                    of these sensible things is any thing absolutely in the object without, but they
                    are all generated or made relative to the sentient.”</p>
                <p>The language of the ancient philosophy was defective in precision; terms were
                    used vaguely and improperly, so that the meaning of the author is often to be
                    collected only from the context. When Protagoras is here made to say, that when
                    the agent and patient meet together, both the object and the sentient are
                    forthwith made to be so and so qualified, as, when honey is tasted, the
                    sensation of tasting and the quality of sweetness are begotten together, it
                    could not be his meaning that any real change is made upon the external object
                    merely by our tasting it, but only that the actual sensation and the sensible
                    idea of sweetness arc produced at once; just as he had said before that the
                    sensible idea of white or black, and the sensation of seeing, are generated
                    together. If his words be thus interpreted, they express a noble truth; and the
                    whole passage shows that the ancient atomic theory differed little, if at all,
                    from the theory of Descartes, Newton, and Locke, being the most rational, as
                    well as the earliest, system of physics with which we have any acquaintance. By
                    divesting body of essential forms distinct from matter and motion, and by giving
                    to the first matter extension and solidity, it renders the corporeal world
                    intelligible, and accounts for tho⅛e appearances which are called secondary
                    qualities in a manner perfectly satisfactory. Aristotle indeed opposed the
                    atomic philosophy, and had influence enough to bring it into disrepute for many
                    ages; but when he insisted that the two constituent principles of body are
                    matter and form, both independent of all sentient beings, and which maybe
                    conceived as existing distinct from each other, he substituted for a simple and
                    sublime theory an absurd and incomprehensible fiction.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II. OF THE ESSENCES OF BODIES.</p>
                <p>Having treated of the substance, qualities, and powers of body, we may seem to
                    have exhausted this part of our subject; but there is still more to be done.
                    Metaphysicians, ancient and modern, have introduced another term into the
                    science to denote that which distinguishes one species or sort of bodies from
                    all other species or sorts; and this term we shall briefly explain. Gold is
                    apparently different from lead, and from every other species of metal; a horse
                    is apparently different from an ox, and from every other species of animals; and
                    all animals apparently differ from all vegetables, as vegetables differ from
                    metals.</p>
                <p>It is only with the bodies, not the minds, of animals, that we£are at present
                    concerned; and we have seen that all bodies are composed of the same matter.
                    What then is it that makes different bodies exhibit to us such different
                    appearances, or, in other words, how come they to be possessed of such different
                    qualities and powers? It is, say theζfollowers of Plato and Aristotle, from
                    their having different essential forms, by which every natural substance is
                    essentially characterized; for of every animal, vegetable, or metal, &amp;c.
                    there is a form conceived, as existing before the individuals in which it is
                    incorporated, from <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> which result all the properties
                    of that animal, vegetable, or metal, such as figure, size, colour, and the other
                    qualities perceptible by our senses; but this internal and essential form
                    itself, from which all other forms result, is not perceptible by our senses, nor
                    even by our understanding directly and immediately, nor otherwise than by the
                    analogy formerly mentioned. These essential forms, we arc told, mean something,
                    which, although different from matter, can yet never subsist without it;
                    something which, united with it, helps to produce every composite being, that is
                    to say, in other words, every natural substance in the visible world.</p>
                <p>This assertion Mr Harris submits with deference to his contemporaries; because,
                    says he, “I speak perhaps of spectres as shocking to some philosophers as those
                    were to Aeneas which he met in his way to hell, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Terribiles</hi><hi rend="italic">visu</hi><hi rend="italic">formacy</hi> The
                    elegant author’s unwillingness to frighten his contemporaries, was a proof of
                    his amiable and benevolent disposition; but there was no need for his suffering
                    from any such apprehension. Those spectres, apparently so dreadful, had long
                    before been laid to rest by the incomparable Cudworth, who has demonstrated that
                    essential forms different from matter and motion, as they have no real
                    existence, had no place in the most ancient philosophy; and that the different
                    appearances or sensible qualities which different bodies exhibit .are the result
                    of the different contexture of their insensible parts. Thus gold and lead are
                    composed of the same primary matter, but the atoms or minute parts of that
                    matter are in the one substance differently combined from what they are in the
                    other; and this different combination is the sole cause that gold is
                    specifically heavier than lead, more ductile, and of a different colour, &amp;c.
                    For the very same reason, iron is harder than either gold or lead, specifically
                    lighter, and possessed of many other sensible qualities which are not Found in
                    either of these substances. One vegetable differs from another externally in
                    size, colour, taste, smell, rapiditv of growth, and proportion of parts,
                    &amp;c.; but all vegetables are composed of the same matter, and the external
                    difference which prevails among them is the result of a different structure and
                    motion of their insensible parts. The same is to be said of the differences
                    which prevail amongst the bodies of animals; they all result from internal
                    organization and motion, and from nothing else, whatever be the immediate cause
                    of that motion.</p>
                <p>This particular internal texture and motion of insensible parts is that which
                    makes one sort of bodies differ externally from every other sort of bodies, and
                    it is by modern metaphysicians called the real essence of bodies. Thus, that
                    internal texture of minute parts, which makes gold of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208259" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8259-0649"/>a bright yellow, extremely
                    ductile, specifically heavier than all other metals, and soluble in <hi
                    rend="italic">aqua regia,</hi> is the real essence of gold; but what that
                    essence is in itself no man can tell, as we perceive only the qualities which
                    result from it. We are, however, certain that it is different from the real
                    essences of lead and iron, because it produces different effects from those
                    which are produced by these essences, and different effects are never produced
                    in the same circumstances by the same cause.</p>
                <p>We have called the internal texture and motion of the insensible parts of bodies
                    their real essences, to distinguish them from other essences which are only
                    nominal, and with which we are perfectly acquainted, because they are the
                    fabrication of our own minds. Thus, a beautiful bright yellow, a certain
                    specific gravity, extreme ductility, and solubility in <hi rend="italic">aqua
                    regia,</hi> are the qualities by which we distinguish gold from all other
                    metals. Of these qualities we frame a sort of general conception, which we call
                    the essence of gold, and every substance in which we find this essence we class
                    under the specific name of gold. For though it is obvious that our conceptions
                    cannot be the real essences of things external, yet are they sufficient guides
                    to these essences, as we know that bodies which, being all formed of the same
                    matter, have the very same sensible qualities, must likewise have the same
                    internal organization or texture of parts, because it is only in that
                    organization or texture that one body can differ from another. So much for
                    bodily substance, qualities, and essences.</p>
                <p>CHAP. III.—OF THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER.</p>
                <p>We have endeavoured to prove that all corporeal substances consist of minute
                    atoms, solid and extended; and that the sensible qualities of every body result
                    from the combination and motion of the atoms of which such body is composed. The
                    celebrated Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne, however, attempted to demonstrate that
                    these atoms have no real existence, and that the very supposition of a solid,
                    extended, and inert substance, being the archetype of our ideas, involves in it
                    an absurdity and contradiction.</p>
                <p>It is universally allowed that all our knowledge of matter is derived through the
                    senses, either immediately in the very act of sensation, or mediately by an
                    association which is resolvable into a process of reasoning. According to the
                    principles which we have stated and laboured to establish, matter itself is no
                    immediate object of the senses; and as these are the principles upon which the
                    bishop erected his demonstration, it will be incumbent upon us to consider his
                    theory, because it has been represented as in the highest degree pernicious, and
                    as leading to universal scepticism.</p>
                <p>The author of the Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth represents
                    Berkeley as teaching us, “that external objects (that is, the things which we
                    take for external objects) are nothing but ideas in „our minds; in other words,
                    that they are in every respect different from what they appear to be; that
                    matter exists not but in our minds, and that, independent on us and our
                    faculties, the earth, the sun, and the starry heavens have no existence at all;
                    that a lighted candle hath not one of those qualities which it appears to have;
                    that it is not white nor luminous, nor round, nor divisible, nor extended, but
                    that, for any thing we know, or can ever know, to the contrary, it may be an
                    Egyptian Pyramid, the king of Prussia, a mad dog, the island of Madagascar,
                    Saturn’s ring, one of the Pleiades, or nothing at all.” With respect to the
                    consequences of this theory, he affirms that “it is subversive of man’s most
                    important interests as a moral, intelligent, and percipient being; and not only
                    so, but also, that if it were universally and seriously adopted, the dissolution
                    of society, and the destruction of mankind, would necessarily ensue within the
                    compass of a month.”</p>
                <p>The dissolution of society and the destruction of mankind are indeed dismal
                    consequences, enough to make a man shudder in his closet. But do they really
                    flow from Berkeley’s system? They certainly do, if it be the aim of that system
                    to prove that a candle has not any one quality which it appears to have, and
                    that it may be a mad dog; for should all philosophers, by some means or other,
                    become converts to the theory of Berkeley, as we know that the Bishops Sherlock,
                    Smalridge, and others, actually did, the dissolution of society and the
                    destruction of mankind would indeed be inevitable.</p>
                <p>But, not to dwell upon such considerations, we beg leave to affirm, that the
                    theory of Berkeley is here totally and grossly misrepresented, and that not one
                    of those dangerous consequences which flow from that misrepresentation can be
                    fairly deduced from any thing taught in the Principles of Human Knowledge, and
                    the Dialogues on the Existence of Matter. So far is Berkeley from teaching that
                    external things are nothing but ideas in our minds, and that they are in every
                    respect different from what they appear to be, that he teaches the very reverse
                    of this in the plainest language possible. “I am of a vulgar cast,” observes he,
                    “simple enough to believe my senses, and leave things as I find them. It is my
                    opinion, that the real things are those very things I see and feel and perceive
                    by my senses. That a thing should really be perceived by my senses, and at the
                    same time not really exist, is to me a plain contradiction. When I deny sensible
                    things an existence out of the mind, I do not mean <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
                    mind in particular, but <hi rend="italic">all</hi> minds. Now it is plain they
                    have an existence exterior to my mind, since I find them by experience to be
                    independent of it. There is, therefore, some other mind wherein they exist
                    during the intervals between the times of my perceiving them, as likewise they
                    did before my birth, and would do after my annihilation. And as the same is true
                    with regard to all other finite created spirits, it necessarily follows there is
                    an omnipotent eternal mind, which knows and comprehends all things, and exhibits
                    them to our view in such a manner, and according to such rules, as he himself
                    hath ordained, and are by us termed the laws of nature.”</p>
                <p>So far is Berkeley from teaching that, independently of us and our faculties, the
                    earth, the sun, and the starry heavens have no existence at all, and that a
                    lighted candle has not one of those qualities which it appears to have, that he
                    repeatedly affirms the direct contrary; that the universe has a real existence
                    in the mind of that infinite God, in whom, according to the scriptures, we all
                    live, and move, and have our being; that a lighted candle has not only all those
                    qualities which it appears to have, but that with respect to us it has nothing
                    else; that, so far from being continually deceived by our senses, we are never
                    deceived by them; and that all our mistakes concerning matter are the result of
                    false inferences from true sensations.</p>
                <p>The bishop makes the same distinction which we have made between ideas and
                    notions, restraining the use of the former <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> term to
                    denote the relicts of sensation, and employing the latter to denote our
                    knowledge or conception of spirits, and all such objects as are not perceived by
                    sense. He likewise affirms that we can have no idea of an external inert
                    substance, because an idea can be like nothing but another idea, or the
                    sensation of which it is a relict; and as all mankind admit that ideas and
                    sensations can have no existence but in the mind of a percipient being, he
                    therefore infers that we can have no idea of any thing existing unperceived, and
                    by consequence can have no idea of matter in the philosophical sense of that
                    word. Solidity, extension, divisibility, motion, figure, colour, taste, and all
                    those things which are usually called qualities<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208272" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8272-0650"/> primary and secondary,
                    being, according to him, mere ideas, can have no existence but in a mind
                    perceiving them; but so far is he from supposing their existence to depend upon
                    the perception of our minds, that he says expressly, “When in broad day-light I
                    open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or no, or to
                    determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view; and so
                    likewise as to the hearing and other senses, the ideas imprinted on them are not
                    creatures of my will. There is, therefore, some other will or spirit that
                    produces them. The question between the materialists and me is not, whether
                    things have a real existence out of the mind of this or that person; but whether
                    they have an absolute existence, distinct from being perceived by God, and
                    exterior to all minds. I assert, as well as they, that since we are affected
                    from without, we must allow powers to be without in a being distinct from
                    ourselves. So far we are agreed. But then we differ as to the kind of this
                    powerful being. I will have it to be spirit; they matter, or 1 know not what
                    third nature. Thus I prove it to be spirit: From the effects I see produced, I
                    conclude there are actions; and because actions, volitions (for 1 have no notion
                    of any action distinct from volition), and because there are volitions, there
                    must be a will. Again, the things I perceive must have an existence, they or
                    their archetypes, out of my mind; but being ideas, neither they nor their
                    archetypes can exist otherwise than in an understanding; there is, therefore, an
                    understanding. But will and understanding constitute in the strictest sense a
                    mind or spirit. The powerful cause, therefore, of my ideas is, in strict
                    propriety of speech, a spirit.”</p>
                <p>This is a faithful abstract of Berkeley’s theory, given in his own words. Matter,
                    according to him, cannot be the pattern or archetype of ideas, because an idea
                    can resemble nothing but another idea, or the sensation of which it is a relict.
                    Matter, he thinks, cannot be the cause of ideas; for every cause must be active,
                    and matter is defined to be inert and incapable of action. He therefore infers
                    that all our sensations of what we call the qualities of body are the effects of
                    the immediate agency of the Deity upon our minds; and that corporeal substance
                    has no existence, or at least that we have no evidence of its existence. That
                    such may possibly be the origin of onr sensations no man will deny who reflects
                    upon the infinité power and wisdom of the Agent from whom they are conceived to
                    proceed. Dr Reid himself, the ablest of all Dr Berkeley’s opponents, frankly
                    acknowledges that no man “can show, by any good argument, that all our
                    sensations might not have been as'they are, though no body or quality of body
                    had ever existed.”</p>
                <p>In its consequences we do not perceive that this theory can be hurtful either to
                    religion, to virtue, or to the business of common life; for it only explodes the
                    notion of a substratum, which, though it may have a real existence, was never
                    thought of by the generality of mankind in any nation under heaven. Dr Beattie
                    indeed affirms, that in “less than a month after the non-existence of matter
                    should be universally admitted, he is certain there could not, without a
                    miracle, be one human creature alive on the face of the earth.” But this
                    assertion must be the consequence of bis mistaking Berkeley’s non-existence of
                    matter for the non-existence of sensible objects, the reality and existence of
                    which the bishop never denied. On the contrary, he expressly says, “We are sure
                    that we really see, hear, feel; in a word, that we are affected with sensible
                    impressions; and how are we concerned any farther? I see this cherry, 1 feel it,
                    I taste it; and I am sure <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> cannot be seen, or
                    felt, or tasted; it is therefore real. Take away the sensation of softness,
                    moisture, redness, tartness, and you take away the cherry.” All this is equally
                    true, and equally conceivable, whether the combined sensations which indicate to
                    us the existence of the cherry be the effect of the immediate agency of God or
                    of the impulse of matter upon our minds; and to the lives of men there is no
                    greater danger in adopting the former than the latter opinion.</p>
                <p>But it has been said that Berkeley’s doctrine necessarily leads to scepticism in
                    religion, as the same kind of reasoning which he employs to prove the
                    non-existence of matter operates equally against the existence of mind, and
                    consequently against the possibility of a future state of rewards and
                    punishments. “The rational issue of this system,” we are told, “is scepticism
                    with regard to every thing excepting the existence of our ideas and their
                    necessary relations. For ideas being the only* objects of thought, and having no
                    existence but when we are conscious of them, it necessarily follows that there
                    is no object of our thought which can have a continued and permanent existence.
                    Body and spirit, cause and effect, time and space, to which we were wont to
                    ascribe an existence independent of our thought, are all turned out of existence
                    by this short dilemma. Either those things are ideas of sensation or reflection,
                    or they are not.: If they are ideas of sensation or reflection, they can have no
                    existence but when we are conscious of them: If they are not ideas of sensation
                    or reflection, they are words without any meaning.”</p>
                <p>This sophism was advanced as a consequence of Berkeley’s principles by Mr Hume;
                    and upon these principles it has been deemed unanswerable by subsequent
                    philosophers of great merit. But is it really a part of Berkeley’s system, or
                    can it be fairly inferred from the principles on which that system is built?
                    These questions it is fit that Berkeley should answer for himself; and we shall
                    venture to assert that his answer will be perfectly satisfactory to every reader
                    who attends to the distinction which, after the bishop, we have stated between
                    ideas and notions.</p>
                <p>Though we believe that this dangerous inference from Berkeley’s principles is
                    commonly attributed to Hume as its author, it did not escape the sagacity of the
                    bishop himself. In the third dialogue, Hylas, who pleads for the existence of
                    matter, thus objects to the reasoning of his antagonist. “Notwithstanding all
                    you have said, to me it seems that, according to your own way of thinking, and
                    in consequence of your own principles, it should follow that you are only a
                    system of floating ideas, without any substance to support them. Words are not
                    to be used without a meaning. And as there is no more meaning in spiritual
                    substance than in material substance, the one is to be exploded as well as the
                    other.” To this Philonus answers: “How often must I repeat, that I know or am
                    conscious of my own being; and that I myself am not my ideas, but somewhat else,
                    a thinking active principle, that perceives, knows, wills, and operates about
                    ideas; I know that I, one and the same self, perceive both colours and sounds;
                    that a colour cannot perceive a sound, nor a sound a colour; that I am therefore
                    one independent principle, distinct from colour and sound, and, for the same
                    reason, from all other sensible things and inert ideas. But I am not in like
                    manner conscious either of the existence or essence of matter. Farther, I know
                    what I mean when I affirm that there is a spiritual substance or support of
                    ideas; <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> that a spirit knows and perceives ideas. But
                    I do not know what is meant when it is said that an unperceiving substance hath
                    inherent in it, and supports, either ideas or the archetypes of ideas. In the
                    very notion or definition of material substance there is included a manifest
                    repugnance and inconsistency. But this cannot be said of the notion of spirit.
                    That ideas should exist in what doth not perceive, or be produced by what doth
                    not act, is repugnant. But it is no repugnancy to say that a perceiving thing
                    should be the subject of ideas, or an active being the cause of them. That I,
                    who am a spirit or thinking substance, exist, I know as certainly<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208285" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8285-0651"/> as I know that my ideas
                    exist. I know likewise what I mean by the terms Zand <hi rend="italic"
                    >myself</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and I know this immediately or intuitively,
                    though I do not perceive it as I perceive a triangle, a colour, or a sound.
                    Ideas are things inactive and perceived; and spirits a sort of beings altogether
                    different from them, by which they arc perceived. I do not therefore say that my
                    soul is an idea, or like an idea. However, taking the word idea in a large
                    sense, my soul may be said to furnish me with an idea, that is, an image or
                    likeness of God, though indeed extremely inadequate. For all the notion I have
                    of God is obtained on reflecting on my own soul, heightening its powers, and
                    removing its imperfections. I have, therefore, though not an inactive idea, yet
                    in myself some sort of an active thinking image of the Deity. And though I
                    perceive him not by sense, yet I have a notion of him, or know him, by
                    reflection and reasoning. My own mind and my own ideas I have an immediate
                    knowledge of, and by the help of these do immediately apprehend the possibility
                    of the existence of other spirits and ideas. Farther, from my being, and from
                    the dependency I find in myself and my ideas, I do by an act of reason
                    necessarily infer the existence of a God, and of all created things in the mind
                    of God. It is granted that we have neither an immediate evidence nor a
                    demonstrative knowledge of the existence of other finite spirits; but it will
                    not therefore follow that such spirits are on a footing with material
                    substances; if to suppose the one be inconsistent, and if it be not inconsistent
                    to suppose the other; if the one can be inferred by no argument, and there is a
                    probability of the other; if we see signs and effects indicating distinct finite
                    agents like ourselves, and see no sign nor symptom whatever that leads to a
                    rational belief of matter. I say, lastly, that I have a notion of spirit, though
                    I have not, strictly speaking, an idea of it. I do not perceive it as an idea,
                    or by means of an idea; but know it by reflection. Whereas I neither perceive
                    matter objectively as I do an idea, nor know it as I do myself by a reflex act;
                    neither do I mediately apprehend it by similitude of the one or the other, nor
                    yet collect it by reasoning from that which I know immediately. All which makes
                    the case of matter widely different from that of the Deity and all spirits.”</p>
                <p>Thus far we consider Berkeley’s theory tenable, and its consequences harmless.
                    That by the immediate agency of the Deity all our sensations might be what they
                    are, although matter bad no existence, we think he has proved by arguments
                    unanswerable; and we are likewise of opinion, that by admitting the evidence of
                    sense, consciousness, and reason, in their fullest extent, and by distinguishing
                    properly between those things of which we have ideas and those of which we have
                    notions, he has sufficiently secured the existence of spirits or percipient
                    beings, and obviated the irreligious sophistry of Hume before it was conceived
                    by that author. But the good bishop does not stop here. Not satisfied with
                    proving that all our sensations lead us immediately to the Deity, and that, for
                    aught we know, matter, as defined by philosophers, may have no separate
                    existence, he proceeds farther, and endeavours to prove that matter cannot
                    possibly exist. This appears even in the extracts which we have quoted from his
                    book, in which he talks of the repugnance and inconsistency of the notion. In
                    this part of his system we think he errs greatly, and advances an opinion
                    altogether inconsistent with his own just principles.</p>
                <p>The repugnance of which he speaks arises solely from considering solidity and
                    extension as relicts of sensation, or as ideas of the same kind with those of
                    heat and cold, tastes and sounds. “Light and colours, heat and cold, extension
                    and figures; in a word, the things we see and feel; what are they,” says his
                    lordship, “but so many sen sations, notions, ideas, or impressions, on sense:
                    and is it possible to separate, even in thought, any of these from perception?
                    Some there are who make a distinction betwixt primary and secondary qualities;
                    by the former, they mean extension, figure, motion, rest, solidity or
                    impenetrability, and number; by the latter, they denote all other sensible
                    qualities, as colours, sounds, tastes, and so forth. The ideas we have of these
                    they acknowledge not to be the resemblances of any thing existing without the
                    mind, or unperceived; but they will have our ideas of the primary qualities to
                    be patterns or images of things which exist without the mind, in an unthinking
                    substance which they call matter. But it is evident that extension, figure, and
                    motion, are only ideas existing in the mind; that without extension, solidity
                    cannot be conceived; that an idea can be like nothing but another idea; and that
                    consequently neither they nor their archetypes can exist in an unperceiving
                    substance. Hence it is plain, that the very notion of what is called matter or
                    corporeal substance involves a contradiction in it.”</p>
                <p>This account of extension and solidity affords a striking instance how much the
                    most vigorous and upright mind is liable to be warped by prejudice in behalf of
                    a darling theory, and how apt the clearest understanding is to be blinded by the
                    equivocal use of terms. That Bishop Berkeley possessed a vigorous and
                    perspicacious mind, his most vehement antagonists are eager to admit; and that
                    his intentions were good, is known to all Europe. Yet by the' equivocal use of
                    the word idea, which the writings of Mr Locke had then introduced into the
                    language of philosophy, he has here suffered himself to lose sight of a very
                    proper and accurate distinction, which, as far as we know, was amongst the
                    moderns first made by himself between ideas and notions. According to the
                    bishop, “we have a notion of power and a notion of spirits, but we can have no
                    idea either of the one or the other; for all ideas bein-r</p>
                <p>, , . O</p>
                <p>passive and inert, they cannot represent unto us by way of image or likeness that
                    which acts. Such is the nature of spirit, or that which acts, that it cannot be
                    of itself perceived, but only by the effects which it produceth. It must be
                    owned, however, that we have some notion of soul, spirit, and the operations of
                    the mind, such as willing, loving, hating, inasmuch as we know or understand the
                    meaning of these words.”</p>
                <p>Now, we beg leave to state, that what is here said of spirits, and of which we
                    readily admit the truth, is equally true of material or solid substances. We
                    have no ideas of solidity and extension, because these things arc not originally
                    impressed upon the senses; but we have very distinct though relative notions of
                    them, for they are clearly perceived by the effects which they produce. That
                    this is at least possible, we have the acknowledgment of Bishop Berkeley
                    himself; for he “freely owns, that from a cause, effect, operation, sign, or
                    other circumstance, there may reasonably be inferred the existence of a thing
                    not immediately perceived; and that it were absurd for any man to argue against
                    the existence of that thing, from his having no direct and positive notion of
                    it.” This is exactly the case with respect to solid substances. These substances
                    we do not immediately perceive; but we infer their existence from effects,
                    signs, and other circumstances, and we have very clear though relative notions
                    of them. Thus a man can open and shut his empty hand; but when he grasps an
                    ivory ball of three or four inches diameter, he feels, that though the same
                    power be exerted, his hand cannot then be shut. He is conscious that there is no
                    change in himself; and being intuitively certain that every effect must have a
                    cause, he infers, with the utmost confidence, that the cause which prevents his
                    hand from shutting is in the ball; or, in other words, that the thing which
                    communicates to his eye the sensation of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208298"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8298-0652"/>colour, and impresses upon his hand a sensation of
                    touch, must be solid or impenetrable. Solidity, however, is not the sensation
                    itself; it is only the cause of the sensation; and therefore it is so far from
                    being an idea in our minds, that we are conscious our notion of it is of a thing
                    totally different from all our ideas of a thing external, at least to our minds.
                    Indeed the notion itself is not positive; it is only relative, and inferred from
                    the effects which are produced upon our senses. That it is the same thing which
                    communicates to the eye the sensation of colour, and has the power of resisting
                    the compression of our hand, is evident, because, when the ball is thrown away,
                    the resistance as well as the actual sensation vanishes at once.</p>
                <p>From this fact, which a less acute man would think a proof that the resistance
                    was not occasioned by the immediate agency of the Supreme Being, but by the
                    impenetrability of a solid substance of small dimensions, the bishop argues thus
                    against the possibility of such a substance: “They who assert that figure,
                    motion, and the rest of the primary or original qualities, do exist without the
                    mind in unthinking substances, do at the same time acknowledge that colours,
                    sounds, heat, cold, and such like secondary qualities, do not; which they tell
                    us are sensations existing in the mind alone, that depend on and are occasioned
                    by the different size, texture, and motion, of the minute particles of matter.
                    This they take for an undoubted truth, which they can demonstrate beyond all
                    ‘exception. Now, if it be certain, that those original qualities are inseparably
                    united with the other sensible qualities, and not even in thought capable of
                    being abstracted from them, it plainly follows that they exist only in the mind.
                    But 1 desire any one to reflect and try whether he can, by any abstraction of
                    thought, conceive the extension and motion of a body, without all other sensible
                    qualities. For my own part, I see evidently that it is not in my power to frame
                    an idea of a body extended and moved, but I must withal give it some colour or
                    other sensible quality, which is acknowledged to exist only in the mind. In
                    short, extension, figure, and motion, abstracted from all qualities, are
                    inconceivable. Where, therefore, the other sensible qualities are, there must be
                    these also, to wit, in the mind, and nowhere else.”</p>
                <p>In this reasoning, although plausible, there is an unintentional fallacy. It is
                    indeed true that we cannot contemplate in imagination a solid substance without
                    conceiving it to have some colour; but there is sufficient reason to believe
                    that this union of colour and solidity in our minds is not the effect of nature
                    as it operates at first upon our senses, but merely the consequence of early and
                    deep-rooted association. Bishop Berkeley has himself taught us that the objects
                    of sight are not at a distance; and that if a man born blind were suddenly made
                    to see, he would conceive the objects of his sight as existing either in his eye
                    or in his mind. This is a truth which no man will controvert who has dipt into
                    the science of optics, or who has even paid the slightest attention to the
                    perceptions of infants; and if so, it follows, that to a man born blind and
                    suddenly made to see, colour and solidity would not appear united. Were such a
                    person to lay hold of an ivory ball and raise it to the elevation of his eye, he
                    would perceive whiteness as a new sensation existing in his eye or his mind, but
                    he would feel resistance at the extremity of his arm. He would not have the
                    least reason to conclude, that this whiteness was inseparably united to the
                    cause of this resistance; and he would, in fact, draw no such conclusion, till
                    experience had taught him, that by removing the ball or cause of resistance from
                    his hand, he at the same time removed the sensation from his eye. After repeated
                    experiments, he would indeed discover, that the cause of colour to the eye was
                    likewise by some means or other the cause of resistance to the hand; and he
                    would so associate these in his mind, that the one would never afterwards make
                    its appearance as an idea or a notion without bringing the other along with it.
                    The whole difficulty, therefore, in this case, is to break an early and
                    deep-rooted association; for it is plain that the associated ideas were not
                    originally united, and that solidity and colour were at first conceived as
                    separate.</p>
                <p>If the reader perceive not the force of this reasoning, we beg leave to recommend
                    to him the following experiment, which, if we mistake not, will carry conviction
                    to his judgment, that in the last-quoted passage Bishop Berkeley has argued
                    fallaciously, and that extension and colour are not inseparably united as ideas
                    in the mind. Let him go into a dark room, containing a number of spherical
                    bodies of various colours; let him take one of these into his hand, and he will
                    instantly feel resistance, and have a notion of extension and solidity; but will
                    he likewise have the idea of colour inseparably united with . this notion? The
                    bishop says he will; and if so, it must be the idea of some particular colour;
                    for his lordship has taught us that the abstract and general idea of colour,
                    which is neither red, nor green, nor blue, &amp;c. cannot possibly be formed.
                    The man, then, we shall suppose, whilst he feels resistance, conceives the
                    resisting body to be green; and holding it still in his hand, walks into the
                    light of day. The resistance, and consequently thecause of resistance, remain
                    unchanged; but what becomes of the inseparable union of those with colour, when
                    the body, upon being actually seen, proves to be black, that is, to have no
                    colour at all? It appears, therefore, undeniable, that solidity and colour are
                    not united in nature; that the one is an essential quality of something external
                    to us, of which we have no idea, but a very distinct· though relative notion;
                    and that the other is an actual sensation in our minds, caused by the impression
                    of something external upon the organ of sense, which leaves behind it in the
                    memory or the imagination a positive and direct idea that exists nowhere
                    else.</p>
                <p>Solid substance, therefore, may exist; for although it is not immediately
                    perceived by the senses, and is a thing of which we can have no idea, we acquire
                    a clear and distinct notion of it, by the very same means which Bishop Berkeley
                    thinks sufficient to give us distinct notions of power and of spirits; and,
                    therefore, that notion cannot involve in it a contradiction. Still, however, we
                    would not say with Dr Beattie, “that we could as easily believe that two and two
                    are equal to ten, or that whatever is, is not, as that matter has no separate
                    existence.” For it is certainly possible, that the Supreme Being, without the
                    instrumentality of matter, could communicate to our minds all the sensations and
                    notions from which we infer the reality of solid substance. All that we contend
                    for, as having the evidence of demonstration, is the possibility of solid and
                    extended substance; and if the thing be possible, the general voice of mankind
                    proclaims its probability. We are conscious of our actual sensations, and we
                    know by experience that they are caused by something distinct from ourselves.
                    When a man grasps an ivory ball, he feels that he cannot shut his hand, and he
                    knows that the resistance which prevents him proceeds not from himself. Thus far
                    indeed all mankind are agreed. But Bishop Berkeley says, that the resistance
                    proceeds immediately from the Supreme Being, or some other spirit; whilst we,
                    without pretending that his scheme is im possible, think it more natural to
                    suppose that the man’s hand is kept from shutting by the resistance of a solid
                    substance of four inches diameter, of which substance, although we have no idea
                    of it, we have as distinct a notion as Berkeley had of spirits. From one or
                    other of these causes this effect must proceed; and it is of little importance
                    to life or happiness which of them be the true <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208311" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8311-0653"/>cause, since it is with the
                    effect only that we are immediately concerned. Still, however, a philosopher
                    would choose to adopt the easiest and most natural side of every alternative,
                    which, if our notion of solidity he just, is certainly, in the present case, the
                    existence of matter.</p>
                <p>After treating so largely of the composition of bodies, and showing the general
                    agreement of metaphysicians, ancient and modern, with respect to the notion of
                    their solidity, it will appear strange to the less philosophical part of our
                    readers, that we should now express a doubt of that notion being well founded.
                    We have ourselves no doubt, but on the contrary are fully convinced, that
                    solidity is essential to matter. This, however, has been denied by philosophers
                    of great merit. Dr Priestley, after Mr Mitchell and Father Boscovich, affirms
                    that matter is not solid nor impenetrable to other matter; and that it has, in
                    fact, no properties but those of attraction and repulsion.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Disquisitions on flatter and Spirit, and
                    Correspondence with Dr Price.</p></note> The proofs of this position, which
                    appears so paradoxical, he draws from optical experiments, from electricity, and
                    from the effects of heat and cold upon substances usually conceived to be
                    solid.</p>
                <p>The appearances from which the solidity of matter is inferred, are nothing more,
                    he says, than superficial appearances, and therefore have led to superficial and
                    false judgments, which the real appearances will not authorize. “Resistance, on
                    which alone our opinion concerning the solidity or impenetrability of matter is
                    founded, is never occasioned by solid matter, but by something of a very
                    different nature, viz. a power of repulsion, always acting at a real, and in
                    general an assignable distance, from what we call the body itself. When I press
                    my hand against the table, I naturally imagine that the obstacle to itsgoing
                    through the table is the solid matter of which it consists; but a variety of
                    philosophical considerations demonstrate that it generally requires a much
                    greater power of pressure than I can exert to bring my fingers into actual
                    contact with the table. Electrical appearances show that a considerable weight
                    is requisite to bring into seeming contact even the links of a chain hanging
                    freely in the air, they being kept asunder by a repulsive power belonging to a
                    very small surface, so that they do not actually touch, though they arc
                    supported by each other. It has been shown from optical considerations, that a
                    drop of water rolls upon a cabbage leaf without ever coming into actual contact
                    with it; and indeed all the phenomena of light are most remarkably unfavourable
                    to the hypothesis of the solidity or impenetrability of matter. When light is
                    reflected back from a body on which it seems to strike, it was natural to
                    suppose that this was occasioned by its impinging against the solid parts of the
                    body; but it has been demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton, that the rays of light
                    are always reflected by a power of repulsion acting at some distance from the
                    body. Again, when part of a beam of light has overcome this power of repulsion,
                    and has entered any transparent substance, it goes on in a right line, provided
                    the medium be of a uniform density, without the least interruption, and without
                    a single particle being reflected, till it comes to the opposite side, having
                    met with no solid particles in its way, not even in the densest transparent
                    substances, as glass, crystal, or diamond; and when it is arrived at the
                    opposite side, it is solely affected by the laws of attraction and
                    repulsion.</p>
                <p>“Nay, that the component particles of the hardest bodies themselves do not
                    actually touch one another, is demonstrable from their being brought nearer
                    together by cold, and by their being removed farther from each other by heat.
                    The power sufficient· to overcome these internal forces of repulsion, by which
                    the ultimate particles of bodies are prevented from coming into actual contact,
                    is what no person can pretend to compute. The power requisite to break their
                    cohesion, or to remove them from the sphere of each other’s attraction, may in
                    some measure be estimated; but this affords no data for ascertaining the force
                    that would be necessary to bring them into actual contact, which may exceed the
                    other almost infinitely.”</p>
                <p>From these facts Dr Priestley infers, that the mutual resistance of bodies
                    proceeds in all cases from powers of repulsion acting at a distance from each
                    body; that the supposition of the solidity or impenetrability of matter is
                    destitute of all support whatever; and that matter itself is nothing but powers
                    of attraction and repulsion, and several spheres of them, one within another. As
                    other philosophers have said, “Take away solidity, and matter vanishes ;” so he
                    says expressly, “Take away attraction and repulsion, and matter vanishes.”</p>
                <p>To illustrate this strange notion, “Suppose,” says he, “that the Divine Being,
                    when he created matter, only fixed certain centres of various attractions and
                    repulsions, extending indefinitely in all directions, the whole effect of them
                    to be upon each other, these centres approaching to or receding from each other,
                    and consequently carrying their peculiar spheres of attraction and repulsion
                    along with them, according to certain definite circumstances. It cannot be
                    denied that these spheres may be diversified infinitely, so as to correspond to
                    all the kind of bodies that we are acquainted with, or that are possible. For
                    all effects in which bodies are concerned, and of which we can be sensible by
                    our eyes, touch, &amp;c. may be resolved into attraction or repulsion. A
                    compages of these centres, placed within the spheres of each other’s attraction,
                    will constitute a body that we term compact; and two of these bodies will, on
                    their approach, meet with a repulsion or resistance sufficient to prevent one of
                    them from occupying the place of the other, without a much greater force than we
                    are capable of employing; so that to us they will appear perfectly hard.</p>
                <p>“As in the constitution of all actual bodies that we are acquainted with, these
                    centres are placed so near to each other, that in every division that we can
                    make we still leave parts which contain many of these centres; we, reasoning by
                    analogy, suppose that every particle of matter is infinitely divisible; and the
                    space it occupies is certainly so. But, strictly speaking, as those centres
                    which constitute any body arc not absolutely infinite, it must be naturally
                    possible to come by division to one single centre, which could not be said to be
                    divisible, or even to occupy any portion of space, though its sphere of action
                    should extend ever so far; and had only one such centre of attraction, &amp;c.
                    existed, its existence could not have been known, because there would have been
                    nothing on which its action could have been exerted; and there being no effect,
                    there could not have been any ground for supposing a cause.”</p>
                <p>In answer to this reasoning against the solidity of matter, Dr Priestley was
                    frequently asked by his candid and masterly antagonist,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Free Discussion between Dr Price and Dr
                    Priestley.</p></note> “What it is that attracts and repels, and that is
                    attracted and repelled ?” But to this question he was never able to give a
                    satisfactory answer. Indeed, how could he have been able? For, as Dr Price
                    argues, “exclusive of attraction and repulsion, he affirms matter to be
                    absolutely nothing; and therefore, though we were to allow it the power of
                    attracting and repelling, yet, as it is nothing but this power, it must be the
                    power of nothing, and the very idea of it be a contradiction.”</p>
                <p>If there be any class of truths intuitively certain, that class comprehends the
                    two following propositions: <hi rend="italic">Power</hi><pb break="no"

                    act where it is not.</hi> If, therefore, there be powers of attraction and
                    repulsion (which shall be considered afterwards in the chapter on Motion), there
                    must be a subject of those powers; and if matter, whether solid or unsolid, be
                    the subject, it cannot possibly attract or repel at a distance. Sir Isaac
                    Newton, in his letters to Dr Bentley, calls the notion that matter possesses an
                    innate power of attraction, or that it can act upon matter at a distance, and
                    attract and repel by its own agency, “an absurdity into which, he thought, no
                    one could possibly fall.” Hence it follows, that the appearances from which Dr
                    Priestley infers the penetrability of matter must be fallacious appearances,
                    since they contradict an intuitive and necessary truth. The facts which he
                    instances are, indeed, such as would make most other men suspicious of fallacy;
                    and in his reasonings from them he sometimes takes for granted the truth to be
                    proved. The links of a chain used for electrical purposes, supposing them to be
                    in contact with each other, can touch only with very small surfaces. The
                    electrical fluid is of considerable density, and incapable of being absorbed
                    within a very narrow compass. This is evident, because it passes not through
                    paper and other porous bodies without making a passage for itself, and leaving a
                    visible aperture behind it; and although it assimilates with metals, and passes
                    through them more easily than through other bodies, yet it is plain that it
                    requires a certain quantity of metal to conduct it; for when the conductor falls
                    short of the necessary quantity, it is melted or dissipated by the force of the
                    fluid. This being the case, it follows that the links of a chain may be in
                    actual contact (we do not positively affirm that they are), and yet the fluid
                    become visible in passing from link to link; for if the point of contact be too
                    small to absorb the whole fluid, part of it must pass without any metallic
                    conductor through the atmosphere, and thus become apparent to the eye of the
                    spectator.</p>
                <p>With ‘respect to light, it is obvious that there cannot possibly be any
                    demonstration, in the logical sense of the word, that it is reflected by a power
                    of repulsion acting at some distance from the body; for, in the opinion of all
                    mankind, the primary and solid atoms of matter are too minute to fall under the
                    cognizance of our senses, however assisted by art; and therefore, if light
                    appears to be reflected at a distance from the surface of the body, we must
                    conclude, either that between the point of reflection and the apparent surface
                    of the body there are solid atoms unperceived by us, or that light is reflected
                    by the agency of some other substance than matter. One of these conclusions, we
                    say, must be drawn, because they are both possible; and there is no other
                    alternative but to admit one of them, or to suppose that a thing may act where
                    it is not, which is as clearly absurd and impossible as that whatever is, is
                    not. Again, when part of a beam of light has entered any transparent substance,
                    how does Dr Priestley know that it goes on in a right line, without the least
                    interruption, till it comes to the opposite side? This he can know only by his
                    senses; but the beam may meet with ten thousand interruptions from objects which
                    the senses cannot perceive, and may describe a zig-zag line, of which the
                    deflections are so small as to elude the keenest eye aided by the most powerful
                    glass.</p>
                <p>That the component particles of the hardest bodies do not all actually touch one
                    another, is indeed evident from the effects of cold and heat upon those bodies;
                    but it does not therefore follow that those bodies have no component particles,
                    but only that they are fewer in number than we are apt to imagine; that all the
                    solid matter in the universe might possibly be compressed within a very narrow
                    sphere; and that it is held together in different bodies and different systems
                    by a power foreign from itself. These are truths which all philosophers have
                    admitted who have thought sufficiently on the subject; but who will admit Dr
                    Priestley’s proposition when it is translated into common English, viz. “that
                    the component nothings of the hardest bodies do not actually touch one another,
                    is demonstrable from their being brought nearer together by cold, and by their
                    being removed farther from each other by heat ?”</p>
                <p>Dr Priestley owns, that if matter be solid it could act upon other matter by
                    impulse. But we are certain that, whatever it be, it can act upon nothing in the
                    manner which he describes; and therefore, to use the words of Dr Price, “matter,
                    if it be any thing at all, must consist of solid particles or atoms occupying a
                    certain portion of space, and therefore extended, but at the same time simple
                    and uncompounded, and incapable of being resolved into any other smaller
                    particles. It must likewise be the different form of these primary particles,
                    and their different combinations and arrangement, that constitute the different
                    bodies and kinds of matter in the universe.” This is exactly agreeable to the
                    doctrine of Newton, who, after considering the question in every point of view,
                    concludes, that “in the beginning God formed matter in solid, massy, hard,
                    impenetrable, moveable particles, of such sizes and figures, and with such other
                    properties, as most conduced to the end for which he formed them; and that those
                    primary particles being solid, are incomparably harder than any porous bodies
                    compounded of them, even so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces, no
                    ordinary power being able to divide what God himself made one in the creation.”
                    To talk, as Dr Priestley does, of matter being certain centres of various
                    attractions and repulsions extending indefinitely in all directions, and to
                    describe these centres as not being physical points or solid atoms, is either to
                    say that nothing attracts and repels, or it is to introduce the divine agency as
                    the immediate cause of all our sensations. The former branch of the alternative
                    Dr Priestley disclaims, the latter he seems willing to admit. But if it be his
                    meaning that all our sensations are caused by the immediate agency of God or
                    created spirits, his scheme differs not from that of Berkeley, except in being
                    less elegantly expressed and less ingeniously supported. Berkeley’s scheme is
                    evidently possible. The commonly-received scheme is likewise possible. It
                    remains, therefore, with the reader, whether he willadopt the system of the
                    Bishop of Cloyne, or admit, with all other philosophers, that matter exists;
                    that it consists of parts actually distinct and separable; and that each of
                    these parts is a <hi rend="italic">monad</hi> or solid atom, which requires no
                    foreign agency to keep it united.</p>
                <p>CHAP. IV.—OF SPACE AND ITS MODES.</p>
                <p>Having considered bodies in their substance, essences, and qualities, and proved
                    that they have a real existence independently of us and our conceptions, we
                    proceed now to inquire into the nature of space, motion, number, and duration.
                    These are commonly called the adjuncts of body, and are supposed to be
                    absolutely inseparable from its existence. It does not indeed appear that actual
                    motion is a necessary adjunct of body, considered as a mere solid, extended, and
                    figured substance; but it is certainly necessary to the existence of organized
                    and animated bodies, and the capability of being moved enters into our
                    conceptions of all bodies whatever. Of these adjuncts, that which first demands
                    our attention is <hi rend="italic">space;</hi> for without a knowledge of its
                    nature we could not have an adequate idea of motion, and without motion we could
                    have no idea of time.</p>
                <p>Every body is extended; and between two bodies not in actual contact, we perceive
                    that a third body may be easily introduced. That which admits of the
                    introduction of the third body is what we call space, and if it be totally <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194208337" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8337-0655"/> void of matter,
                    it is called pure space. Whether there be any space absolutely pure, has been
                    disputed; but that such space is possible admits of no dispute. Were any one
                    body, a cannon ball, for instance, to be annihilated, and the circumambient air,
                    with every other material substance, kept from rushing into the space which the
                    ball bad occupied, that portion of space, with respect to matter, would be empty
                    or pure space; whether it would necessarily be filled with mind, shall be
                    considered afterwards. Pure space, therefore, is conceivable; and it is
                    conceived as having three dimensions, length, breadth, and depth, which are
                    generally called the three simple modes of space. In this respect it agrees with
                    body; but the agreement proceeds no farther, for space is conceived as destitute
                    of solidity, without which the existence of body is inconceivable. It has been
                    formerly observed, that whatever may be distinctly conceived may possibly exist;
                    but with respect to the existence of pure space, whatever is possible is real,
                    for it shall be shown in the next section, that were there no space absolutely
                    pure or void of matter, there could be no motion. Our business at present is to
                    inquire what the nature of space is, and what notion we ought to have of its
                    existence.</p>
                <p>Many modern philosophers consider space as something entirely distinct both from
                    body and mind; some of them ascribe to it no less than four of the attributes of
                    the Deity, eternity, immobility, infinity, and necessary existence; and a few of
                    them have gone so far as to call infinite space the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sensorium</hi> of the Deity. “The supposal of the existence of any thing
                    whatever,” says Dr Clarke,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God, and Correspondence with a
                    Gentleman in Gloucestershire, <hi rend="italic">passim.</hi></p></note>
                    “necessarily includes a presupposition of the existence of space. Nothing can
                    possibly be conceived to exist without thereby presupposing space, which,
                    therefore, I apprehend to be a property or mode of the self-existent substance;
                    and that, by being evidently necessary itself, it proves that the substance of
                    which it is a property must be also necessary.” Elsewhere he says, that “space
                    is a property or mode of the self-existent substance, but not of any other
                    substances. All other substances are in space, and are penetrated by it; but the
                    self-existent substance is not in space, nor penetrated by it, but is itself (if
                    I may so speak) the <hi rend="italic">substratum</hi> of space, the ground <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the existence of space itself.” He acknowledges, however,
                    that such expressions as “the self-existent substance is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >substratum</hi> of space, or space is a property of the self-existent
                    substance, are not, perhaps, very proper; but what 1 mean,” says he, “is this:
                    The idea of space (as also of time or duration) is an abstract or partial idea;
                    an idea of a certain quality or relation, which we evidently see to be
                    necessarily existing, and yet which (not being itself a substance) at the same
                    time necessarily presupposes, a substance, without which it could not
                    exist.”</p>
                <p>These opinions respecting space have been adopted by succeeding philosophers of
                    great merit, and particularly by Dr Price, who says, that “it is a maxim which
                    cannot be disputed, that time and place are necessary to the existence of all
                    things. Dr Clarke,” continues he, “has made use of this maxim to prove that
                    infinite space and duration are the essential properties of the Deity, and I
                    think he was right.”</p>
                <p>Had authority any weight in philosophy, we know not what modern writers we could
                    oppose to the celebrated names of Clarke and Price, unless it were Bishop
                    Berkeley, Dr Law, bishop of Carlisle, and the author of Ancient Metaphysics. But
                    the question is not to be decided by authority. Learned and acute as Dr Clarke
                    was, his assertions respecting space are contradictory and inconsistent.</p>
                <p>If nothing can possibly be conceived to exist without thereby presupposing the
                    existence of space, how can space be a property or mode of the self-existent
                    substance? Are properties piioι in the older of nature, or even in our
                    conceptions, to the substances in which they inhere? Can we frame an abstract
                    idea of figure, or extension, or solidity, before we conceive the existence of
                    any one figured, extended, or solid substance? These are questions which every
                    man is as capable of answering as Doctors Clarke and Price, provided he can look
                    attentively into his own mind, and trace his ideas to their source in sensation;
                    and if he be not biassed by the weight of great names, we are persuaded he will
                    find, that if it be indeed true, that the supposition of the existence of
                    anything whatever necessarily includes a presupposition of the existence of
                    space, space cannot possibly be a property or mode of the self-existent
                    substance, but must of necessity be a substance itself.</p>
                <p>It is, however, not true, that the supposal of the existence of any thing
                    whatever necessarily includes a pre-supposition of the existence of space. The
                    idea of space is indeed so closely associated with every visible and tangible
                    object, that we cannot see the one nor feel the other without conceiving them to
                    occupy so much of space. But bad we never possessed the senses of sight and
                    touch, we could not have supposed the existence of space necessary to the
                    existence of any thing whatever. The senses of smelling, tasting, and hearing,
                    together with our internal powers of consciousness and intellect, would
                    certainly have compelled us to believe in our own existence, and to suppose the
                    existence of other things; but no object either of consciousness, smelling,
                    tasting, or hearing, can be conceived as occupying space. Space and every thing
                    which fills it are conceived as of three dimensions; but whoever supposed or can
                    suppose an odour, a taste, or a sound, to have length, breadth, and depth; or an
                    object of consciousness to be an ell or an inch in length?</p>
                <p>Let us suppose that body and all the visible world had a beginning, and that once
                    nothing existed but that Being who is alone of necessary as well as eternal
                    existence; space, say the followers of Dr Clarke, would then exist likewise
                    without bounds or limits. But we desire to know of these gentlemen what sort of
                    a being this space is. It is certainly not substance; neither is it a property;
                    for we have seen that the very notions of it, which lead men to suppose its
                    existence necessary, render it impossible to be a property of the self-existent
                    Being. Is it then nothing? It “is in one sense;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ancient Metaphysics.</p></note> it is nothing
                    actually existing; but it is something potentially; for it has the capacity of
                    receiving body whenever it shall exist. It is not, and cannot become, any thing
                    itself, nor hath it any actual existence; but it is that without which nothing
                    corporeal could exist.” And for this reason it was that Democritus and Epicurus
                    made space one of the principles of nature; nay, for the same reason, Aristotle
                    has made privation one of his three principles of natural things, matter and
                    form being the other two. But although the privation of one form be doubtless
                    necessary belòre matter can receive another (for a piece of wax or clay cannot
                    receive the form of a globe before it lose the form of a square), yet Aristotle
                    never dreamed that the privation of the square was any property of the globe, or
                    that privation itself was to be reckoned a real being. On the contrary, he
                    expressly calls it <hi rend="italic">το μr</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    l</hi><hi rend="italic">δν,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">no being.</hi> In this
                    way, if we please, we may consider space, and call it the privation of fulness
                    or of body. We have indeed a positive idea of it, as well as of silence,
                    darkness, and other privations; but to argue from such an idea of space, th at
                    space itself is something <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208350"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8350-0656"/>real, seems altogether as good sense as to say,
                    that because we have a different idea of darkness from that of light, of silence
                    from that of sound, of the absence of any thing from that of its presence;
                    therefore darkness, silence, absence, must be real things, and have as positive
                    an existence as light, sound, and body; and to deny that we have any positive
                    idea, or, which is the very same thing, any idea at all, of the privations above
                    mentioned, will be to deny what is capable of the most complete proof, and to
                    contradict common sense and daily experience. There are therefore ideas, and
                    simple ones too, which have nothing <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >extra</hi> correspondent to them; no proper archetype, or objective reality;
                    and we do not see why the idea of space may not be reckoned of that number. To
                    say that space must have existence because it has some properties (for instance,
                    penetrability, or the capacity of receiving body), seems<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Notes on King’s Origin of Evil, and Law’s
                    Inquiry into the Ideas of Space, &amp;c.</p></note> to be the same thing as to
                    urge that darkness must be something because it has the capacity of receiving
                    light; silence the property of admitting sound; and absence the property of
                    being supplied by presence. To reason in this manner is to assign absolute
                    negations; and such as, in the same way, may be applied to nothing, and then
                    call them positive properties; and so infer that the chimera, thus clothed with
                    them, must needs be something.</p>
                <p>But it is said, that as we cannot conceive space to be annihilated, it must be
                    some real thing of eternal and necessary existence. If this argument had not
                    been used by writers of great merit, and with the best intention, we should not
                    have scrupled to call it the most contemptible sophism that ever disgraced the
                    page of philosophy. Whatever has now an actual existence, must from eternity
                    have had a possible existence in the ideas of the divine mind. Body, as an
                    extended substance, has now an actual existence, and therefore it must from
                    eternity have had a possible existence in the ideas of the divine mind; but the
                    possible existence of body is all that we can conceive by space, and therefore
                    this argument, upon which so much stress has been laid, amounts to nothing more,
                    than that what has from eternity been possible, can at no period have been
                    impossible. It is evident that the capacity or potentiality of every thing
                    existing must have been from eternity; but is capacity or potentiality, a real
                    being? All the men and women who shall succeed the present generation to the end
                    of time have at this moment a possibility of existence, nor can that possibility
                    be conceived as an impossibility; but is it therefore any thing actually
                    existing, either as a substance or a quality?</p>
                <p>It has been urged that space must be something more than the mere absence of
                    matter, because if nothing be between bodies, such as the walls of a room, they
                    must necessarily touch. But surely it is not self-evident that bodies must
                    necessarily touch if nothing be between them; nor of the truth of this
                    proposition can anything like a proof be brought. It is indeed intuitively
                    certain, that “things, when they are in contact, have nothing between them and
                    hence it has rashly been inferred, that things, when they have nothing between
                    them, are in contact; but this is an illegitimate conversion of the proposition.
                    Every logician knows, that to convert a proposition, is to infer from it another
                    whose subject is the predicate, and whose predicate is the subject, of the
                    proposition to be converted; but we are taught by Aristotle, and by common
                    sense, that an universal affirmative can only be converted into a particular
                    affirmative. “Things, when they are in contact, have nothing between them,” is
                    an universal affirmative proposition; and therefore it can only be converted
                    into the following particular affirmative: “Some things, when they have nothing
                    between them, are in contact ;” a proposition which by no means includes in it
                    the contact of the walls of an empty room. The reason why the walls of an empty
                    room do not touch, is that they are distant; but is distance, in the abstract,
                    any thing really existing? Two individuals differ, or there is a difference
                    between them; but is difference itself any thing really external? Bodies are
                    long, broad, thick, heavy; but are length, breadth, density, weight, properly
                    any thing? Have they any real separate archetypes or external archetypes? Or can
                    they exist but in some substances?</p>
                <p>The reason why so many philosophers have considered space as a real external
                    thing, seems to be this. Every bodily substance is extended; but space is
                    conceived to be that which contains body, and therefore to space we likewise
                    attribute extension. Extension is a quality which can have no existence but as
                    united with other qualities in some substance; and it is that of which,
                    abstracted from all substances, we can, properly speaking, form no idea. We
                    understand the meaning of the word, however, and can reason about that which it
                    denotes, without regarding the particular substance in which extension may
                    inhere; just as we can reason about whiteness without regarding any one white
                    object, though it is self-evident that whiteness, abstracted from all objects,
                    cannot figure in the mind as an idea. Qualities considered in this manner are
                    general and relative notions, the objects of pure intellect, which make no
                    appearance in the imagination, and arc far less, if possible, to be perceived by
                    sense; but it is extremely painful to the mind to dwell upon such notions, and
                    therefore the. ever-active fancy is always ready to furnish them with imaginary
                    substrata, and to make that which was a general and invisible notion be
                    conceived as a particular ideal object. In the case of extension this is the
                    more easily done, that the notion which we have of a real substratum or
                    substance, the support of real qualities, is obscure and relative, being the
                    notion of something we know not what. Now, by leaving, if we can, solidity and
                    figure entirely out of our conception, and joining the notion of something with
                    the notion of extension, we have at once the imaginary substratum of an
                    imaginary quality, or the general notion of extension particularized in an
                    imaginary subject; and this subject we call space, vainly imagining that it has
                    a real external and independent existence. Whether this be not all that can be
                    said of space, and whether it be not absurd to talk of its having any real
                    properties, every man will judge for himself, by reflecting upon his own ideas,
                    and the manner in which they are acquired. We ourselves have no doubt about the
                    matter. We consider pure space as a mere notion relative to the existence of
                    corporeal substance, as in truth nothing more than the absence of body, where
                    body is possible; and we think the usual distinction between absolute and
                    relative space, if taken as real, the grossest absurdity. We do not, however,
                    pretend to dictate to others, but recommend it to every man to throw away all
                    respect for great names, to look attentively into his own thoughts, and on this,
                    as on all metaphysical subjects, to judge for himself.</p>
                <p>Having said so much of space in general, we need not waste much time upon its
                    modes. Indeed the only mode of space, after considering it with respect to the
                    three dimensions of body, which now demands our attention, is that which we call
                    <hi rend="italic">place.</hi> For, as in the simplest mode of space we consider
                    the relation of distance between any two bodies or points; so, in our idea of
                    place, we consider the relation of distance between any thing, and any two or
                    more points, which, being considered as at rest, keep the same distance one from
                    another. Thus, when we find any thing at the same distance now at which it was
                    yesterday<pb break="no" facs="nls:194208363" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8363-0657"/> from
                    two or more points with which it was then compared, and which have not, since
                    the comparison was made, changed their distance or position with respect to each
                    other, we say that the thing has kept its place, or is in the same place; but if
                    it has sensibly altered its distance from either of these points, we then say
                    that it has changed its place.</p>
                <p>From this view of the nature of <hi rend="italic">place,</hi> we need not observe
                    that it is a mere relation; but it may be worth while to advert to this
                    circumstance, that a thing may without falsehood be said to have continued in
                    the same place, and at the same time to have changed its place according to the
                    different objects with which it is compared. Thus, if two persons find a company
                    of chess-men standing each upon the same square of the chess-board where they
                    left them, the one may with truth affirm that they are all in the same place, or
                    unmoved, and the other may with equal truth affirm that they have all changed
                    place. The former considers the men only with respect to their distances from
                    the several parts of the chess-board, which have kept the same distance and
                    position with respect to one another. The latter must consider the men with
                    respect to their distance from something else; and finding that the chessboard,
                    with every thing upon it, has been removed, we shall suppose, from one room to
                    another, he cannot but say that the chess-men have changed their place with
                    respect to the several parts of the room in which he formerly saw them.</p>
                <p>This modification of distance, however, which we call <hi rend="italic"
                    >place,</hi> being made by men for their common use, that by it they may
                    designate the particular position of objects where they have occasion for such
                    designation, they determine this place by reference to such adjacent things as
                    best serve their present purpose, without regarding other things which, for a
                    different purpose, would better determine the place of the same object. Thus, in
                    the chess-board, the use of the designation of the place of each chess-man being
                    determined only within that chequered piece of wood, it would cross that purpose
                    to measure it by any thing else; but when these very chess-men are put up in a
                    box, if any one should ask where the black king is, it would be proper to
                    determine the place by reference to something else than the chess-board, such as
                    the parts of the room or closet which contain the box.</p>
                <p>That our idea of place is nothing but such a relative position of things as we
                    have mentioned, will be readily admitted, when it is considered that we can have
                    no idea of the place of the universe. Every part of the universe has place,
                    because it may be compared with respect to its distance from other parts
                    supposed to be fixed. Thus the earth and every planet of our system has a place,
                    which may be determined by ascertaining its distance from the sun, and from the
                    orbits of the other planets; and the place of the system itself may be
                    ascertained by comparing it with two or more fixed stars; but all the systems
                    taken as one whole can have no place, because there is nothing else to which the
                    distance and position of that whole can be referred. It is indeed true that the
                    word <hi rend="italic">place</hi> is sometimes used, we think improperly, to
                    denote that space or portion of space which any particular body occupies; and in
                    this sense, no doubt, the universe has place, as well as the earth or solar
                    system; but to talk of the place of the universe in the other and proper sense
                    of the word, is the grossest absurdity.</p>
                <p>CHAP. V. OF MOTION.</p>
                <p>Mobility, or a capacity of being moved, is essential to every corporeal
                    substance; and by actual motion are all the operations of nature performed.
                    Motion, therefore, if it may be called an adjunct of body, is certainly the most
                    important of all its adjuncts; and to ascertain its nature and origin demands
                    the closest attention of the metaphysician, as well as of the mechanician and
                    astronomer. With the laws of motion, as discovered by experience, we have at
                    present no concern; they are explained and fully established in other treatises
                    of this work. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics, Motion,</hi> and other
                    articles.) The principal questions which we have to consider are, “What is
                    motion? and by what power is it carried on ?”</p>
                <p>For an answer to the first of these questions, the modern metaphysician refers
                    every man to his own senses, because, in his apprehension, the word motion
                    denotes a simple idea which cannot be defined. Amongst theancients, the
                    Peripatetics were of a different opinion; and Aristotle, whose love of
                    dialectics made him define every thing, has attempted to give two definitions of
                    motion. As some learned men have laboured to revive this system, we shall, out
                    of respect to them, mention those definitions, and make such remarks upon them
                    as to us appear proper.</p>
                <p>The author of Ancient Metaphysics having observed, that both nature and art
                    propose some end in all their operations; that when the end is obtained, the
                    thing operated upon is in a state of perfection or completion; and that in the
                    operations of both nature and art there is a progress, and by consequence a
                    change from one thing to another; adds, that this change is <hi rend="italic"
                    >motion.</hi> Motion, therefore, according to him, is a change or progress to
                    the end proposed, or to that state of perfection or completion which Aristotle
                    calls <hi rend="italic">iντελεχεια.</hi> It is not enough, however, that we know
                    to what the change or progress is made; to have an adequate idea of motion, we
                    must likewise know from what it proceeds. Now, it is evident that every thing
                    existing, whether by nature or art, had, before it existed, a possible
                    existence; and therefore, adds the same author, things do in some sort exist
                    even before they exist. This former kind of existence is said by Aristotle to be
                    <hi rend="italic">εν δυνάμει,</hi> that is, in power or capacity. In this way,
                    plants exist in their seeds; animals in the embryo; works of art in the idea of
                    the artists and in the materials of which they are made; and, in general, every
                    thing in the causes which produce it. From this power or capacity there is a
                    progress to energy or to actual existence; so that we are now able to answer the
                    question, “from what and to what motion is a change ?” for it is universally
                    true of all motion, that it is a change from capacity to energy.</p>
                <p>“Having thus discovered that motion lies betwixt capacity and energy, it is
                    evident,” he says, “that it must have a connection with each of them; and from
                    this double connection Aristotle has given us two definitions of it; one of them
                    taken from the energy, or end to which it tends; the other from the capacity
                    from which it begins. The first is expressed in two words, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">ivεgγεια ατε∖ης,</hi> or imperfect energy; the other is <hi
                    rend="italic">εvτε∖εχεια</hi><hi rend="italic">του εν</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >δυναμει, η εν δυναμει,</hi> “The perfection of what is in capacity, considered
                    merely as in capacity.” The meaning of the last words is, that nothing is
                    considered in the thing that is moved but merely its capacity; so that motion is
                    the perfection of that capacity, but not of the thing itself. It is something
                    more, adds the learned author, than mere capacity; for it is capacity exerted,
                    which, when it has attained its end, so that the thing has arrived at that state
                    to which it is destined by nature or art, ceases, and the thing begins to exist
                    <hi rend="italic">εvεξγεια,</hi> or actually.</p>
                <p>By all the admirers of Aristotle, this latter definition has been preferred to
                    the former; for what reason, it is difficult to say. They both involve in the
                    thickest obscurity that which, viewed through the senses, is very easily
                    understood; and on this, as on many other occasions, Aristotle was certainly
                    guilty of darkening counsel by words without knowledge. The author, whose
                    comment on this <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208376" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8376-0658"
                    />wonderful definition we have faithfully abridged, admits that it is not
                    intelligible till we know what change and progress are: but is it possible to
                    conceive any change to take place in bodily substances without motion? or, if we
                    were called upon to explain what progress is, could we do it better than by
                    saying that it is motion from something to something? It is likewise very
                    obvious, that before we can have an adequate idea of motion, we must, according
                    to this definition, know perfectly what the words capacity, energy, and
                    perfection denote; and yet nothing can be more true than that perfection denotes
                    a complex conception, which may be easily defined by resolving it into the
                    simple ideas and notions of which it is compounded, whilst motion is not
                    susceptible of any such resolution. The perfection of a knife is compounded of
                    the temper of the steel and the sharpness of the edge; the perfection of a
                    system of philosophy consists of the importance of the subjects treated, the
                    strength of the author’s arguments, and the perspicuity of his style and manner;
                    but of what is the motion of a ball, or an atom, or any thing else, compounded?
                    We are aware that to this question the modern Peripatetics will reply, that it
                    is not the motion of a ball or an atom, nor of any one thing, that their master
                    has so learnedly defined, but motion abstracted from all individuals, and made
                    an object of pure intellect; and they will likewise affirm, that by the word
                    perfection used in the definition, he does not mean any one kind of perfection
                    as adapted to any particular object or end, but perfection abstracted from all
                    objects and all ends. The perfection of nothing and the motion of nothing (for
                    such surely are that motion and that perfection which are abstracted from all
                    objects and ends) are strange expressions. To us they convey no meaning; and we
                    have reason to think that they are equally unintelligible to men of greater
                    acuteness. In a word, motion must be seen or felt; for it cannot be defined. To
                    call it the act of changing place, or a passage from one place to another, gives
                    no information; for change and passage cannot be conceived without previously
                    conceiving motion.</p>
                <p>The Peripatetics, having idly attempted to define motion, proceed next to divide
                    it into four kinds or classes. This division was by the father of the school
                    pretended to be made from the effects which it produces, and was said by him to
                    belong to three categories, viz. quality, quantity, and where (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Category).</hi> The first kind is that well-known motion from
                    place to place, which falls under the category last mentioned; the second is
                    alteration, by which the quality of any thing is changed, the substance
                    remaining the same. This belongs to the category of quality. The third is
                    increase, and the fourth diminution, both belonging to the category of quantity.
                    The ancient atomists, and all the modern metaphysicians of eminence, have with
                    great propriety rejected this division, as being nothing but a collection of
                    absurd distinctions where there is in nature no difference. It has already been
                    shown, that body has no other real qualities than solidity, extension, and
                    figure; but of these the first cannot be altered without destroying the
                    substance; for every thing which is material is equally solid. The extension of
                    a body may indeed be enlarged, and its figure may be altered, whilst the
                    substance re mains the same; but that alteration can be made only by moving from
                    their places the solid atoms of which the body is composed. Aristotle’s second
                    kind of motion, therefore, does not differ from the first; nor do the third and
                    fourth differ from these two. For a body cannot be increased without acquiring
                    new matter, nor diminished without losing some of the matter of which it was
                    originally composed; but matter can neither be added nor taken away without
                    motion from place to place; for there is not now any creation <hi rend="italic"
                    >de novo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and we have no reason to imagine that,
                    since the original creation, a single atom has ever been annihilated. It is
                    therefore beyond dispute, that local motion is the only motion conceivable; and
                    indeed, as far as we are capable of judging from what we know of body, it is the
                    only motion possible.</p>
                <p>This has given rise to a question which has been debated amongst modern
                    philosophers, though, as far as we know, it was never agitated amongst the
                    ancients, viz. “Whether, if there were but one solid body existing, that body
                    could possibly be moved.” Bishop Berkeley seems to be of opinion that it could
                    not; because no motion can be conceived but what has a direction towards some
                    place, and the relation of place necessarily supposes the existence of two or
                    more bodies. Were all bodies, therefore, annihilated excepting one globe, it
                    would be impossible, he thinks, to conceive that globe in motion. With respect
                    to the origin of our ideas of motion, his reasoning appears unanswerable; but we
                    do not perceive how it concludes against the possibility of motion itself as
                    existing in a single body. It has been already shown in the chapter on Simple
                    Apprehension and Conception, that although nothing can be conceived which may
                    not possibly exist, yet many things may be possible which we have not faculties
                    or means to conceive. In the present instance, were this solitary globe animated
                    as our bodies arc, were it endowed with all our senses and mental powers, it
                    certainly would not acquire any idea of motion, though impelled by the greatest
                    force. The reason is obvious. It would have no objects with which to compare its
                    place and situation at different periods of time; and the experience of a ship
                    at sea in calm weather affords sufficient proof that motion which is equable
                    cannot be perceived by any other means than by such a comparison. When the waves
                    swell and the ship pitches, it is indeed impossible that those who are on board
                    should not perceive that they are actually in motion; but even this perception
                    arises from comparing their position with that of the waves rising and falling
                    around them; whereas, in the regions of empty space, the animated globe could
                    compare its position with nothing, and therefore, whether impelled by equal or
                    unequal forces, it could never acquire the idea of motion. It may perhaps be
                    thought, that if this solitary globe were a self-moving animal, it might acquire
                    the idea of motion by inferring its existence from the energy which had produced
                    it. But how, we would ask, could any animal in such circumstances be
                    self-moving? Motion is the effect of some cause; and it has been already shown
                    that we have no reason whatever to suppose that any being can be the real and
                    primary cause of any effect which that being can neither conceive nor will; but,
                    as motion can be perceived only by the senses, a solitary animal could have no
                    idea of motion previously to its own exertions, and therefore could neither
                    conceive nor will any exertion to produce it. Let us, however, suppose, that
                    without any end in view it might spontaneously exert itself in such a manner as
                    would produce sensible motion were it surrounded with other corporeal objects;
                    still we may venture to affirm, that, as long as it should remain in absolute
                    solitude, the being itself would acquire no idea of motion. It would indeed be
                    conscious of the mental energy, but it could not infer the existence of motion
                    as a consequence of that energy; for the idea of motion can be acquired only by
                    sense; and by the supposition there are no objects from which the senses of this
                    spherical animal could receive those impressions, without which there can be no
                    perception, and of course no ideas.</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose that, whilst this animated globe is under the influence either
                    of external impulse or of its own spontaneous energy, other bodies are suddenly
                    brought into existence; would it then acquire the idea of motion? It certainly
                    would, from perceiving its own change of place with respect to those bodies; and
                    although at first it would not perhaps be able to determine whether itself or
                    the bodies around it were moving, yet a little experience <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208389" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8389-0659"/>would decide this question
                    likewise, and convince it that the motion was the effect either of its own
                    mental energy, or of that external impulse which it had felt before the other
                    bodies were presented to its view. But it is obvious that the creation of new
                    bodies at a distance can make no real alteration in the state of a body which
                    had existed before them; and, therefore, as this animated globe would now
                    perceive itself to be moving, we may infer, with the utmost certainty, that it
                    was moving before, and that the motion of a single body, though not perceivable
                    by the senses, might possibly be produced in empty space.</p>
                <p>Having thus seen that a single body is capable of motion in empty space, the next
                    question that occurs on this subject is, whether it would be possible to move a
                    body injspace that is absolutely full? Such are the terms in which this question
                    is usually put; and by being thus expressed, it has'given rise to the dispute
                    amongst natural philosophers about the existence of a vacuum. Perhaps the
                    dispute might have been avoided had the question been more accurately stated.
                    For instance, had it been asked, whether motion would be possible, could matter
                    be supposed absolutely infinite, without any the least interstice or vacuity
                    amongst its solid parts? We apprehend that every reflecting man would have
                    answered in the negative. At any rate, the question ought to be thus stated in
                    metaphysics, because we have seen that space, though a positive term, denotes
                    nothing really existing. Now it being of the very essence of every solid
                    substance to exclude from the place which it occupies every other’solid
                    substance, it follows undeniably, that not one particle of an infinite solid
                    could be moved from its place without the previous ∙annihilation of another
                    particle of equal extent, but that annihilation would destroy the infinity. Were
                    matter extended to any degree less than infinity, the motion of its parts would
                    undoubtedly be possible, because a sufficient force could separate those parts,
                    and introduce amongst them vacuities of any extent; but without vacuities
                    capable of containing the body to be moved, it is obvious that no force whatever
                    could produce motion. This being the case, it follows, that however far we
                    suppose the material universe to be extended, there must be vacuities in it
                    sufficient to permit the motion of the planets and all the other heavenly
                    bodies, which we plainly perceive to revolve round a centre; and, if so, the
                    next question to be determined is, what can operate <hi rend="italic">in
                    vacuo</hi> upon such immense bodies, so as to produce a regular and continued
                    motion?</p>
                <p>That all bodies are equally capable of motion or of rest, has been as completely
                    proved by natural philosophers as any thing can be proved by observation and
                    experience. It is indeed a fact obvious to the most superficial observer; for if
                    either of these states were essential to matter, the other would be absolutely
                    impossible. If rest were essential, nothing could be moved; if motion were
                    essential, nothing could be at rest, but every the minutest atom would have a
                    motion of its own, which is contrary to universal experience. With respect to
                    motion and rest, matter is wholly passive. No man ever perceived a body
                    inanimate begin to move, or, when in motion, to stop without resistance. A
                    billiard ball laid at rest on the smoothest surface, would continue at rest to
                    the end of time, unless moved by some force extrinsic to itself. If such a ball
                    were struck by another ball, it would indeed be moved with a velocity
                    proportioned to the impetus with which it was struck; but the impelling ball
                    w∙ould lose as much of its own motion as was communicated to that upon which the
                    impulse was made. It is evident, therefore, that in this instance there is no
                    beginning of motion, but only the communication of motion from one body to
                    another; and we may still ask, where had the motion its origin? If the impelling
                    ball was thrown from the hand of a man, or struck with a racket, it is plain,
                    that by a volition of the man’s mind the motion was first given to his own arm,
                    whence it proceeded through the racket from one ball to another; so that the
                    ball, the racket, and the arm, were mere instruments, and the mind of the man
                    the only agent or first mover. That motion can be begun by any being which is
                    not possessed of life, consciousness, and will, or what is analogous to these,
                    is to us altogether inconceivable. Mere matter or inanimate body can operate
                    upon body only by impulse; but impulse, although from the poverty <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> language we are sometimes obliged to talk of its agency,
                    is itself merely an effect; for it is nothing more than the contact of two
                    bodies, of which one at least is in motion. An infinite series of effects
                    without a cause is the grossest absurdity; and therefore motion cannot have been
                    communicated from eternity by the impulse of body upon body, but must have been
                    originally produced by a being who acts in a manner analogous to the energies of
                    the human will.</p>
                <p>But though motion could not have been begun except by the energy of mind, it is
                    generally believed that it might be continued by the mere passiveness of body;
                    and it is a law of the Newtonian philosophy, that a body projected in empty
                    space would continue to move in a straight line for ever. The only reason which
                    can be assigned for this law is, that since body continues to move at all after
                    the impetus of projection has ceased, it could not of itself cease to move
                    without becoming active; because as much force is required to stop a body in
                    motion as to communicate motion to the same body at rest. Many objections have
                    been made to this argument, and to the law of which it is the foundation; but as
                    we do not perceive their* strength, we shall not undertake any formal
                    examination of them. If a single body could exist and have motion communicated
                    to it <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> by the force of projection, we are
                    persuaded that, from the very passiveness of matter, that motion would never
                    have an end; but it is obvious that it could be moved only in a straight line,
                    for an impulse can be given in no other direction.</p>
                <p>The heavenly bodies, however, are not moved in straight lines, but in curves
                    round a centre; and therefore their motion cannot have been originally
                    communicated merely by an impressed force of projection. This is admitted by all
                    philosophers; and therefore the Newtonians suppose that the planets are moved in
                    elliptical orbits by the joint agency of two forces acting in different
                    directions. One of these forces makes the planet tend directly to the centre
                    about which it revolves; the other impels it to fly off in a tangent to the
                    curve described. The former they call gravitation, which some of them have
                    affirmed to be a property inherent in all matter; and the latter, which is a
                    projectile force, they consider as impressed <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">extra.</hi> By the joint agency of such forces, duly proportioned
                    to each other, Sir Isaac Newton has demonstrated, that the planets must
                    necessarily describe such orbits as by observation and experience they are found
                    actually to describe. But the question with the metaphysician is, whether such
                    forces be real?</p>
                <p>With respect to projection, indeed, there is no difficulty; but that bodies
                    should mutually act upon each other at a distance, and through an immense
                    vacuum, seems at· first sight altogether impossible. If the planets are moved by
                    the forces of gravitation and projection, they must necessarily move <hi
                    rend="italic">in vacuo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for the continual resistance
                    of even the rarest medium would in time overcome the force of the greatest
                    impetus; but if they move <hi rend="italic">in vacuo,</hi> how can they be
                    attracted by the sun or by one another? It is a self-evident truth, that nothing
                    can act but where it is present, either immediately or mediately; because every
                    thing which operates upon another must perform that operation either by its own
                    immediate agency or by means of some instrument. The sun and planets are not in
                    contact; nor, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208402" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8402-0660"
                    />if the motion of these bodies be <hi rend="italic">in vacuo,</hi> can any
                    thing material pass as an instrument from the one to the other. We know indeed
                    by experience, that every particle of unorganized matter within our reach has a
                    tendency to move towards the centre of the earth; and we are intuitively
                    certain, that such a tendency must have some cause; but when we infer that cause
                    to be a power of attraction inherent in all matter, which mutually acts upon
                    bodies at a distance, drawing them towards each other, we employ a language
                    which is perfectly unintelligible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A different opinion on this point is held by Mr Dugald
                    Stewart in his <hi rend="italic">Elements of the Philosophy of the Human
                    Mind.</hi> We shall, however, claim the same liberty of dissenting occasionally
                    from him that he has claimed of dissenting from Newton, Locke, Clarke, and
                    Cudworth, from whom he differs widely in thinking it as easy to conceive how
                    bodies can act upon each other at a distance, as how one body can communicate
                    motion to another by impulse. “I allow,” says he (p. 70), “that it is impossible
                    to conceive in what manner one body acts upon another at a distance through a
                    vacuum; but 1 cannot admit that it removes the difficulty, to suppose that the
                    two bodies are in actual contact. That one body may be the efficient cause of
                    the motion of another body placed at a distance from it, I do by no means
                    assert; but only that we have as good reason to believe that this may be
                    possible, as to believe that any one natural event is the efficient cause of
                    another.”</p><p>If by efficient cause be here meant the first and original cause
                    of motion, we have the honour to agree with the learned professor; for we are
                    persuaded, that body inanimate is not, in this sense of the word, the cause of
                    motion either at hand or at a distance. But if he mean (and we think he must,
                    because such was the meaning of Newton, from whom he professes to differ), that
                    we can as easily conceive one body to be the instrumental cause of the motion of
                    another from which it is distant, as we can conceive it to communicate motion by
                    impulse, we cannot help thinking him greatly mistaken. We will not indeed
                    affirm, with the writer whom he quotes, “that although the experiment had never
                    been made, the communication of motion by impulse might have been predicted by
                    reasoning <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> because we are not certain, that
                    without some such experiment we should ever have acquired adequate notions of
                    the solidity of matter. But if all corporeal substances be allowed to be solid,
                    and possessed of that negative power to which philosophers have given the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">vis inertiae,</hi> we think it may be easily proved <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori,</hi> that a sufficient impulse of one hard body upon
                    another must communicate motion to that other; for when the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vis inertiae,</hi> by which alone the one body is kept in its place, is less
                    than the <hi rend="italic">vis impetus</hi> with which the other rushes to take
                    possession of that place, it is evident that the former body must give way to
                    the latter, which it can do only by motion, otherwise the two bodies would
                    occupy one and the same place, which is inconsistent with their solidity. But
                    that a substance possessed of a <hi rend="italic">vis inertiae</hi> should make
                    another substance possessed of the same negative power quit a place to which
                    itself has no tendency, is to us not only inconceivable, but apparently
                    impossible, as implying a direct contradiction.</p></note> Nay, more; we may
                    venture to affirm that such an inference is contrary to fact. The particles of
                    every elastic fluid fly from each other; the flame of a fire darts upwards with
                    a velocity for which the weight of the circumambient air cannot account; and the
                    motion of the particles of a plant, when growing, is so far from tending towards
                    the centre of the earth, that when a flower-pot is inverted, every vegetable in
                    it, as soon as it is arrived at a sufficient length, bends itself over the side
                    of the pot, and grows with its top in the natural position.</p>
                <p>Sensible of the force of these arguments against the possibility of an attractive
                    power in matter which operates at a distance, other philosophers have supposed
                    that the heavenly bodies are moved in elliptical orbits by means of two forces
                    originally impressed upon each planet, impelling it in different directions at
                    the same time. But if the tendency of the planets towards the centre of the sun
                    be of the same kind with that of heavy bodies towards the centre of the earth
                    (and if there be such a tendency at all, we have no reason to suppose it
                    different), it cannot possibly be the effect of impulse. A body impelled or
                    projected <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> would continue to be moved with an
                    equable velocity, neither accelerated nor retarded as it approached the object
                    towards which it was directed; but the velocity of a body tending towards the
                    centre of the earth is continually accelerated; and as we cannot doubt but that
                    the same thing takes place in the motion of a body tending towards the centre of
                    the sun, that motion cannot be the effect of impulse or projection.</p>
                <p>Some of the Newtonians therefore have supposed “that all kinds of attraction
                    consist in fine imperceptible particles or invisible effluvia, which proceed
                    from every point in the surface of the attracting body, in rectilineal
                    directions every way, which, in their progress, lighting on other bodies, urge
                    and solicit them towards the superior attracting body; and therefore,” say they,
                    “the force or intensity of the attracting power in general must always decrease
                    as the squares of the distances increase.” The inference is fairly drawn from
                    the fact, provided the fact itself were real or possible. But it is obvious,
                    that if fine imperceptible particles or invisible effluvia were thus issued from
                    every point in the surface of the sun, the earth and other planets could not
                    move <hi rend="italic">in vacuo,</hi> and therefore the projectile motion would
                    in time be stopped by the resistance of this powerful medium. Besides, is it not
                    altogether inconceivable, nay impossible, that particles issuing from the sun
                    should draw the planets towards that centre? would they not rather of necessity
                    drive them to a greater distance? To say that after they have reached the
                    planets, they change their motion, and return to the place whence they set out,
                    is to endue them with the powers of intelligence and will, and to transform them
                    from passive matter to active mind.</p>
                <p>These difficulties in the theories of attraction and impulse have set
                    philosophers upon fabricating numberless hypotheses. Even Sir Isaac Newton
                    himself, who never considered gravitation as any thing more than an effect,
                    conjectured that there might be a very subtile fluid or ether pervading all
                    bodies, and producing not only the motion of the planets, and the fall of heavy
                    bodies to the earth, but even the mechanical part of muscular motion and of
                    sensation. Others, again, have supposed that fire, or light, or the electric
                    fluid, is the universal agent; and some few have acknowledged, that nothing is
                    sufficient to produce the phenomena but the immediate agency of mind.</p>
                <p>With respect to the interposition of any material fluid, whether ether, fire,
                    light, or electricity, it is sufficient to say that it does not remove any one
                    difficulty which encumbers the theory of innate attraction. All these fluids are
                    elastic; and of course the particles of which they are composed are distant from
                    each other. Whatever motion, therefore, we may suppose to be given to one
                    particle or set of particles, the question still recurs, how is it communicated
                    from them to others? If one body can act upon another at the distance of the ten
                    thousandth part of an inch, we can perceive nothing to hinder its action from
                    extending to the distance of ten thousand millions of miles. In the one case as
                    well as in the other, the body is acting where it is not present; and if that be
                    admitted to be possible, all our notions of action are subverted, and it is vain
                    to reason about the cause of any phenomenon in nature.</p>
                <p>This theory of the intermediate agency of a subtile fluid differs not essentially
                    from the vortices of Descartes, which appeared so very absurd to Cudworth, that,
                    with a boldness becoming a man of the first genius and learning, he rejected it,
                    and adopted the plastic nature of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek
                    philosophers. That incomparable scholar observes, that matter, being purely
                    passive, the motion of the heavenly bodies, the growth of vegetables, and even
                    the formation of animal bodies, must be the effect either of the immediate
                    agency of God, or the agency of a plastic <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208415"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8415-0661"/>nature employed as an instrument by Divine Wisdom.
                    That they are not the effect of God’s immediate agency, he thinks obvious from
                    several circumstances. In the first place, they are performed slowly and by
                    degrees, which is not suitable to our notions of the agency of Almighty Power.
                    Secondly, many blunders are committed in the operations of nature, such as the
                    formation of monsters, &amp;c. which could never be were things formed by the
                    immediate hand of God. He is therefore of opinion, that after the creation of
                    matter, God employed an inferior agent to give it motion and form, and to carry
                    on all those operations which have been continued in it since the beginning of
                    the world. This agent he calls plastic nature; and considers it as a being
                    incorporeal, which penetrates the most solid substance, and, in a manner which
                    he pretends not to explain otherwise than by analogy, actuates the universe. He
                    does not look upon it as a being endued with perception, consciousness, or
                    intelligence, but merely as an instrument which acts under Divine Wisdom,
                    according to certain laws. He compares it to art embodied; and, quoting from
                    Aristotle, says, “If the art of the shipwright were in the timber itself,
                    operatively and effectually, it would there act just as nature does.” He calls
                    it a certain lower life than the animal, which acts regularly and artificially
                    for ends of which it knows nothing. It maybe, he says, either a lower faculty of
                    some conscious soul, or else an inferior kind of life or soul by itself, but
                    depending in either case upon a higher intellect. He is aware with what
                    difficulty such a principle will be admitted by those philosophers who have
                    divided all being into such as is extended and such as is cogitative; but he
                    thinks this division improper. He would divide beings into those which are solid
                    and extended, and those which have life or internal energy. Those beings which
                    have life or internal energy he would again divide into such as act with
                    consciousness, and such as act without it; the latter of which is this plastic
                    life of nature. To prove that such an instrument is possible, or that a being
                    may be capable of operating for ends of which it knows nothing, he instances
                    bees and other animals, who arc impelled by instinct to do many things necessary
                    to their own preservation, without having the least notion of the purpose for
                    which they work. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Instinct.)</hi> He observes, that
                    there is an essential difference between reason and instinct, although they are
                    both the attributes of mind or incorporeal substance; and that therefore, as we
                    know of two kinds of mind differing so widely, there is nothing to hinder us
                    from inferring a third, with powers differing as much from instinct as instinct
                    differs from reason. Mankind are conscious of their own operħtions, know for
                    what purpose they generally act, and can, by the power of reflection, take a
                    retrospective view of their actions and thoughts, making as it were the mind its
                    own object. Brutes are conscious of their own operations, but they arc ignorant
                    of the purposes for which they operate, and altogether incapable of reflecting
                    either upon their past conduct or their past thoughts. Between their
                    intellectual powers and those of man there is a much greater difference than
                    there is between them and a plastic nature, which acts as an instrument of
                    Divine Wisdom, without any consciousness of its own operations. Aristotle, from
                    whom principally the learned author takes this notion of this plastic nature,
                    compares it, with respect to the Divine Wisdom which directs and superintends
                    its operations, to a mere builder or mechanic working under an architect, for a
                    purpose of which the mechanic himself knows nothing. The words of the Stagyrite
                    are, “We account the architects in every thing more honourable than the mere
                    workmen, because they understand the reason of the things done; whereas the
                    other, as some inanimate things, only work, not knowing what they do, just as
                    the fire burns; the difference between them being only this, that inanimate
                    things act by a certain nature in them, but the workman by habit.”<note

                <p>Still further to prove that a being may be endowed with some vital energy of a
                    subordinate kind, and yet be destitute of consciousness and perception, the
                    learned author observes, that there is no reason to think that the souls of men
                    in sound sleep, lethargies, or apoplexies, are conscious of any thing; and still
                    less, if possible, to suppose that the souls of embryons in the womb are, from
                    the very first moment of their arrival there, intelligent and conscious beings;
                    neither can we say how we come to be so differently affected in our souls by the
                    different motions made upon our bodies, nor are we always conscious of those
                    energies by which we impress fantastic ideas on the imagination. But if it be
                    possible for the souls <hi rend="italic">of</hi> men to be for one instant void
                    of consciousness and intelligence, it follows that consciousness is not
                    absolutely necessary to those energies and motions by which life is preserved.
                    To this it maybe added, upon the best authority,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gregory’s Philosophical and Literary
                    Essays.</p></note> “that where animal or vegetable life is concerned, there is
                    in every case a different relation between the cause and effect, and seemingly
                    depending upon the concurrence or influence of some farther principle of change
                    in the subject than what subsists in inanimate matter, or in the causes and
                    effects that are the objects of mechanical and chemical philosophy.” Now to this
                    principle of vegetable life, without which, in a seed or in a plant, vegetation
                    will neither begin nor continue, though light, heat, air, earth, and water,
                    should concur in the utmost perfection, Cudworth expressly compares his plastic
                    nature in the universe. It is so far, says he, from being the first or highest
                    life, that it is indeed the last and lowest of all lives, being really the same
                    thing with the vegetative.</p>
                <p>These arguments, if the phenomena of elective attractions in chemistry be added
                    to them, demonstrate, we think, the possibility of such a principle; and to
                    those who are inclined to affirm that no such thing can .exist, because,
                    according to the description of it given by Cudworth and the ancients, it is
                    neither body nor spirit in the proper sense of the words, we beg leave to ask,
                    in the words of Locke, “who told them that there is and can be nothing but solid
                    beings which cannot think, and thinking beings that are not extended, which is
                    all that they mean by the terms body and spirit?” All the Greek philosophers who
                    were not materialists, and even the inspired writers of the Old and New
                    Testaments, constantly distinguish between the <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">soul of</hi> a man, calling the former sometimes <hi
                    rend="italic">νους,</hi> and sometimes <hi rend="italic">πνεύμα,</hi> and the
                    latter <hi rend="italic">∙ψυχη</hi>; and St Paul, who, before he was a
                    Christian, was learned in philosophy, describes the constituent parts of man as
                    three, <hi rend="italic">πνεύμα,</hi><hi rend="italic">ψυχη, σωμa,</hi> spirit,
                    soul, and body. This distinction, setting aside the authority with which it
                    comes to us, seems to be well founded; for there are many operations carried on
                    in the human body without any conscious exertion of ours, and which yet cannot
                    be accounted for by the laws of mechanism. Of these, Cud worth instances the
                    motion of the diaphragm and other muscles which cause respiration, and the
                    systole and diastole of the heart, neither of which, he thinks, can be the
                    effect of mere mechanism. But, as we are not conscious of any energy of soul
                    from which they proceed, even whilst we are awake, and still less, if possible,
                    whilst we are asleep, he attributes them, not to the intellect or rational mind,
                    but to this inferior vital principle called <hi rend="italic">∙^υχη,</hi> which,
                    in his opinion, acts the same part in the system of the human body which the
                    plastic nature acts in the system of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208428"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8428-0662"/>the world. To make the resemblance still tore
                    striking, he observes, that even the voluntary motion f our limbs, although it
                    proceeds ultimately from an enrgy of will, seems to be the effect of that energy
                    employig some instrument which pervades the sinews, nerves, and muscles of the
                    body; and if the human spirit or <hi rend="italic">τrνευμ</hi> employ the
                    instrumentality of a plastic nature or <hi rend="italic">ψυχη</hi> i moving the
                    small machine of the body, it seems to be fa from incredible that the Divine
                    Wisdom should emplo the instrumentality of a plastic nature in moving the geat
                    machine of the universe.</p>
                <p>But we need not insist further on the possnlity of such an instrument. Whatever
                    may be thought f the arguments of Cudworth, of which some are, to sr the least
                    of them, plausible, though others appear to us ^ have very little strength, Dr
                    Clarke has proved, with a bree of reasoning not inferior to mathematical demon
                    ration, that the motions of the heavenly bodies are carrid on by the ageney of
                    something very different from mtter, under every possible form. “For, not to say
                    that seeing matter is utterly incapable of obeying any laws ι the proper sense
                    of the word, the very original laws of otion themselves cannot continue to take
                    place but by smething superior to matter continually exerting on it a ertain
                    force or power, according to such certain and detιmined laws, it is now evident
                    beyond question, that the odies of all plants and animals could not possibly
                    have cen formed by mere matter according to any general lars of motion; and not
                    only so, but that most universal priciple of gravitation itself, the spring of
                    almost all the cat and regular inanimate motions in the world, anseing not at
                    all the surfaces of bodies, by which alone they an act upon one another, but
                    entirely to their solid con≡nts, cannot possibly be the result of any motion
                    origina y impressed upon matter.” For although it is true that to most solid
                    bodies with which we are acquainted are al very porous, and that therefore a
                    subtile material fluid miht penetrate the bodies of the planets, and operate
                    upon hem with a force exerted internally, still it is self-evi nt that the
                    greatest quantities of such a fluid could nt enter into those bodies which arc
                    least porous, and wh <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> e the greatest force of
                    gravitation resides; “and, then ire, this motion must of necessity be caused by

                <p>Nor let it be imagined, that this ancient theory of motion is in any degree
                    inconsistent with the mathematical principles of Sir Isaac Newton’s astronomy,
                    or with thecalculations derived from those principles. Having founded his
                    astronomy on analogy between the phenomena of projectile and planetary motions,
                    he assigned the same or similar forces existing in nature as the efficient
                    causes of both. And indeed, both in the act of deriving his principles from the
                    projectile phenomena, and afterwards for the purpose of applying them to the
                    planetary, it was necessary to analyze the elliptical motion of the heavenly
                    bodies into a compound of two simple motions in right lines, produced by the
                    action of these different forces; and this might also be useful for the purposes
                    of teaching and demonstration, just as we find it necessary, in almost all parts
                    of science, to separate what in nature is inseparable, for the convenience and
                    assistance of the understanding. The planetary motions, however, are very
                    probably simple and uncompounded, for no experiments can be tried in those
                    distant regions; and the astronomy of Newton, which is only the application of
                    his mathematical principles to their mensuration from their analogy to
                    projectile motions, does not at all require that the forces of gravitation and
                    projection be assigned as their real existent causes.<note anchored="true"

                    xvi.</p></note> “suggested to the mind by more ways, so there is none more
                    simple, than that of <hi rend="italic">unity,</hi> or one. It has no shadow of
                    variety or composition in it. Every object our senses are employed about, every
                    idea in our understandings, every thought of our minds, bring this idea along
                    with it; and therefore it is the most intimate to our thoughts, as well as it
                    is, in its agreement to all other things, the most universal idea we have; for
                    number applies itself tomen, angels, actions, thoughts, every thing that either
                    doth exist or can be imagined.” He seems likewise to be of opinion, that we have
                    the idea of unity before that of many; and that it is by repeating the simple
                    idea of unity in our own minds that we come by the complex ideas of two, three,
                    or more. In this opinion he is joined by Père fluffier,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>First Truths.</p></note> who observes, that
                    it is impossible to explain the nature of unity, because it is the most simple
                    idea, and that which perhaps first occurred to the mind.</p>
                <p>That unity is a simple idea, must be granted; but it certainly<pb break="no"

                    mind, nor can it be abstracted from all individuals, and apprehended, in Locke’s
                    sense of the word, as a general idea. Let any man look into his own mind, and
                    then say whether he has a general idea of one or of unity as abstracted from
                    every individual object mental and corporeal. In particular, when he thinks he
                    has completely abstracted it from body and mind, sensations, ideas, actions, and
                    passions, &amp;c. let him be sure, before he pronounce it a general abstract
                    idea, that he is not all the while contemplating the idea of its name, or of
                    that numerical figure by which it is marked in the operations of arithmetic.
                    Both these ideas are in themselves particular; and become general in their
                    import, only as representing every individual object to which unity is in any
                    sense applicable. But, in the chapter on Abstraction, we have said enough to
                    convince every person capable of conviction, that they are employed as signs for
                    whole classes of objects.</p>
                <p>Instead of being an abstract general idea, unity, as the basis of number, is in
                    fact nothing but a mere relation, which cannot be conceived without the related
                    objects; and so far is it from being the first idea that occurred to the mind,
                    that it is certainly the result of a comparison, made by the intellect, of two
                    or more objects. The ideas which first occur to the mind are, beyond all doubt,
                    those which are called ideas of sensation; and many such ideas every child
                    receives before he is capable of comparing objects and forming to himself
                    notions of number. Unity, or the idea of one, is indeed the element of the
                    science of arithmetic, just as a mathematical point is the clement of the
                    science of geometry; but accurate notions of these elements are, in the progress
                    of knowledge, subsequent to ideas of many and of surfaces. There is reason to
                    believe that persons totally illiterate have no notion at all of mathematical
                    points; and we think it possible to conceive an intelligent and conscious being
                    in such a situation as that he could not acquire a notion of unity or one. Were
                    a child never to sec or feel two objects of the same kind, we doubt if he would
                    think of numbering them, or of making such a comparison of the one with the
                    other as would suggest to his mind the relations of one and two; for these
                    relations imply both a sameness and a difference of the objects beyond the power
                    of a child to ascertain. The difference indeed would be perceptible to the
                    senses, but the senses would perceive no sameness or agreement. A guinea, a
                    shilling, and a ball of lead, impress upon the mind different sensations; and
                    therefore a child undoubtedly distinguishes these objects from one another; but
                    what could make him derive from this his first idea of the relation of number? A
                    guinea, a shilling, and a ball of lead, are not one, two, three, in any sense
                    which a child can comprehend. To be convinced of this, let any man throw a
                    guinea, a shilling, and a ball of lead upon a table, and ask a clown what is
                    their number, From being accustomed to retail the names of number as signs,
                    without affixing to them any idea of the things signified, he will probably
                    answer with quickness three, or perhaps one, two, three. But if he be further
                    asked in what respect they are one, two, three, we believe his answer will not
                    be so ready. They are not one, two, three guineas, or shillings, or balls of
                    lead. A philo sopher knows thm to be three pieces of the same first matter under
                    dií rent forms, and can therefore apply to them the relatio of number with truth
                    and propriety; but of the first m; ter a clown is entirely ignorant, and of
                    course cannot call hem one, two, three, in any sense which is at once true an to
                    him intelligible.</p>
                <p>To make it sti more evident that it is only by comparing together tkigs of the
                    same kind that our first ideas of unity and num r are formed, let us suppose
                    that no created being had . therto existed except the animated and intelligent
                    globe mentioned in the last chapter, and we think it will be grr ted that such a
                    being in solitude could never acquire the lea of unity. Let us next suppose a
                    cubical body to be reated, and exhibited to the senses of this spherical man The
                    consequence would be a sensation or feeling entirely ew, but that feeling would
                    not be one <hi rend="italic">of</hi> unity; for, as ιe author of Ancient
                    Metaphysics has somewhere well oberved, unity is no object of sensation. The
                    sensation word be one of colour, hardness, softness, roughness or smoo mess,
                    &amp;c. for beyond these the empire of the senses doe-not reach. Again, let
                    another body be created of a comr and figure totally different from the colour
                    and figure o the cube, and the spherical man would then experience no sensations
                    having no agreement with those which he ha formerly felt. These different kinds
                    of sensations migh be compared together; but the result of the comparison ould
                    not be the ideas which are denoted by the wore one and two, but merely that
                    which is expressed by dií rence or dissimilarity. Were another cube, however, of
                    xactly the same size and colour with the former to be bi ught into existence,
                    and both to be at once presented to e view of the spherical man, the rudiments
                    of the id of number would then be generated in his mind, becau &gt; he could not
                    but perceive the cubes to be in one respet different and in another the same;
                    different as being &gt;tinct from each other, and agreeing in their effects upo

                    “could have had any idea of <hi rend="italic">number:</hi> for, before we can

                    be able to apply to all of them one common name; or, in other words, that we
                    should reduce them all to the same mus. The various objects, for example,
                    animate and inanimate, which are at this moment before me, I may class and
                    number in a ariety of different ways, according to the view of them that I
                    choose to take. I may reckon successively the number of sheep, of c s, of

                    sense, I could never have conceived them as forming plurality.” <hi

                    always attend to the caning of the expression. Language was formed to answ r the
                    common purposes of life; and those purposes are est answered by denoting
                    individuals by the name of the &gt;ecies or genus to which they belong. But God
                    belongs to o species or genus, unless he be said improperly to be c the
                    universal genus of Being; and therefore the true waning of the word “one,” when
                    joined to the verb “is,” aι transferred from the creature to the Creator, in
                    such a st tence as “There is one God,” seems to be nothing mor than an
                    affirmation that God exists, and that to him the elation of number cannot be
                    applied. In a word, unity am lumber are merely relations between <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208454" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8454-0664"/>the individuals of the same
                    species or genus of being; and men acquire ideas of these relations at the same
                    time and by the same means that they are led to class things into species and
                    genera. As to the processes of addition and subtraction, and the various
                    purposes to which number is applied, these things belong to the science of
                    arithmetic, and do not fall under the province of the metaphysician, whose sole
                    object is to ascertain the real nature and causes of things. It may, however, be
                    worth while to observe, that Locke, whose notions of number seem to have been
                    different from ours, owns, that a man can hardly have any ideas of numbers of
                    which his language does not furnish him with names. But if units were either
                    real things, or even positive ideas, we see not how names could be necessary to
                    their existence; whereas, if they be nothing more than mere relations, it is
                    obvious that they cannot be conceived but as relative either to beings actually
                    existing, or to names which are the signs of actual beings.</p>
                <p>CHAP. VII OF TIME.</p>
                <p>When St Augustin was asked what time is, he replied, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Si non</hi><hi rend="italic">roges,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >intelligo</hi> an answer from which it may be inferred that he thought the
                    nature of time could not be explained by a logical definition. Time and eternity
                    are commonly considered as the two modes of duration; and if duration be taken
                    in what Locke thinks its true and original sense, to denote permanence of
                    existence, with a kind of resistance to any destructive force, the distinction
                    seems to be sufficiently proper. It is indeed the best that we can make or
                    comprehend; for duration, time, and eternity, are subjects which have perplexed
                    philosophical minds in all ages, and of which, if we have any adequate notions,
                    it is verydifficultto express these notions inffanguage. Instead of attempting
                    it by previous definitions, the method in which the ancients generally began
                    their inquiries, we shall pursue the better course of induction recommended by
                    Lord Bacon, and endeavour to show by what means we acquire the notion of that
                    mode of duration which is called time, in contradistinction to eternity. We
                    begin with time, because we ourselves exist in it, and it is in some sense
                    familiar to us. If we be able to trace our notions of this mode of duration to
                    their source, we may then give a definition of it founded upon fact and
                    universal experience, and afterwards proceed to consider the other mode in
                    conjunction with infinity, to which it is nearly allied.</p>
                <p>It has already been observed, that every man, whilst awake, has a train of
                    sensations and ideas constantly passing through his mind, in such a manner that
                    the one succeeds the other in a regular order. It is not possible, either by
                    detaining in the mind one idea to the exclusion of all others, to stop the
                    course of this succession entirely; or, by hurrying some ideas off the stage,
                    and calling others in their place, to quicken its progress beyond a certain
                    degree. One man indeed has naturally a quicker succession of ideas than another;
                    and all men can, by great exertions, accelerate or retard in a small degree the
                    natural current of their thoughts. A studious man lays hold, as it were, of a
                    particular idea, which he wishes to contemplate, and detains it in the
                    imagination, to the exclusion of all others; a man of wit calls remote ideas
                    into view with a rapidity of which a cool and phlegmatic reasoner cannot form
                    any conception; and a forcible sensation takes full possession of the mind, to
                    the exclusion of all ideas whatever. Whilst the attention is wholly occupied by
                    one idea, or by one sensation, the mind has no notion whatever of time; and were
                    it possible to detain such idea or sensation alone in the mind till the hand of
                    a clock should move from the number of one hour to that of another, the hour, as
                    marked on the dial-plate and measured by the motion of the hand, would appear
                    but as one instant absolutely void of duration. For the truth of this assertion
                    we appeal to the experience of our readers. Such of them as have ever been
                    engaged in deep study must often have had their attention so fixed upon one
                    object, that large portions of time, as measured by the clock, have passed away
                    wholly unheeded; and every man who has seen a very striking and uncommon object,
                    must remember that when the sensation was first impressed upon his mind, all
                    other objects, ideas, and notions, and amongst the rest the notion of time, were
                    for a while excluded.</p>
                <p>No sensation, however, keeps possession of the whole mind after it has ceased to
                    be new; nor can the most vigorous exertions long preserve any one idea from
                    being driven off' the stage by the succeeding train. Now this succession of
                    ideas appearing and disappearing in their turns, is that which, when compared
                    with the permanency of ourselves and other things, gives us our first and
                    justest notion of time; for whilst we <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> are
                    thinking, or whilst a series of ideas is successively passing through our
                    mindsand vanishing, we know that we ourselves and the things around us exist;
                    and this existence, or continuation of existence, commensurate with the train of
                    our fleeting ideas, is what we call the duration of ourselves and the things
                    around us.</p>
                <p>We are aware that the first notions <hi rend="italic">of</hi> time have been
                    often said to be derived from motion as perceived by our senses in the objects
                    around us. It is observed by Euclid, that “if there were no motion, there could
                    be no sound, nor any sense of hearing.” “He might have added,” says the author
                    of Ancient Metaphysics, “nor any other perception of sense. Further, without
                    motion there would have been no visible world, nor generation or production of
                    any kind here below; and, among other things, time could have had no existence.”
                    All this is certainly true; but that corporeal motion, though the original
                    source of all our ideas, is not that which immediately suggests to us the notion
                    of time, will be readily granted by him who considers that motion itself is
                    perceived by us only when it excites or accompanies a constant succession of
                    perceptions and ideas. Motion, when equable and very slow, such as that of the
                    hour-hand of a common watch, is not perceived by us in its course; nor can we
                    discover that the thing has moved at all, till after we have been sensible of
                    the lapse of a considerable portion of what is commonly called time, when we
                    discover that the hand of the watch has changed its place with respect to other
                    objects which we know to be fixed. The same is true of motion remarkably quick:
                    « Let a cannon ball,” says Locke, “pass through a room, and in its way take with
                    it any limb or fleshy parts of a man; it is as clear as any demonstration can
                    be, that it must strike successively the two sides of the room; it is also
                    evident that it must touch one part of the flesh first, and another after, and
                    so in succession; and yet I believe nobody who ever felt the pain of such a
                    shot, or heard the blow against the two distant walls, could perceive any
                    succession either in the pain or sound of so swift a stroke.”</p>
                <p>Of these two phenomena a satisfactory account may be easily given ;,from which we
                    think it will at the same time be apparent, that the succession of the train of
                    ideas in the mind is the measure and standard of all other successions. We know
                    that the energy of mind which reviews a train of sensible ideas is of the very
                    same kind with that which attends to a series of passing sensations; and
                    therefore it is natural to suppose that we can pay attention to sensations and
                    ideas passing with nearly equal velocities. But it has been shown, that every
                    sensation remains in the mind or sensorium for a very short space after the
                    object which excited it is taken away; whence it follows, that a body
                    communicating to*the organs of sense a series of similar impressions succeeding
                    each other with remarkable <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208467"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8467-0665"/>rapidity, cannot possibly excite a train of
                    similar and distinct sensations; because the effects of the first and second
                    impressions not having vanished when those of the third and fourth arrive, the
                    whole train of effects must necessarily coalesce into one uniform sensation.
                    This reasoning is confirmed by experience. Similar sounds succeeding each other
                    at considerable intervals are all distinctly perceived, and if the motion be
                    accelerated gradually, it may be carried to a great degree of velocity before
                    the sounds be confounded and coalesce into one. Sir William Herschel having, by
                    means of a clock, produced sounds or clicking noises, which succeeded each other
                    with such rapidity that the intervals between them were, as far as could be
                    judged, the smallest possible, found that he could evidently distinguish one
                    hundred and sixty of them in a second of time; but beyond that he could by no
                    effort of attention distinguish one sound from another. The same philosopher
                    tried another experiment on visible sensations. By means of the same handle and
                    work of the clock, he caused a wheel in it to turn till it acquired the velocity
                    of once in a second. He continued to increase the velocity, and observed it
                    whilst revolving at the rate of twenty times round in thirteen seconds, and
                    could still distinguish the teeth and spaces from each other; whence it appears,
                    by a computation given at length, that he had two hundred and forty-six distinct
                    visible sensations generated by equable motion in a second of time. The teeth of
                    the wheel, he owns, were not so far visible as to show their shape distinctly,
                    much less could they have been counted; but he very plainly distinguished the
                    circumference to be divided into teeth and spaces; and he supposes that the same
                    division might still have been seen though the motion had been a little faster,
                    as far perhaps as two turns in a second, equal to three hundred and twenty
                    sensations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Watson’s
                    Treatise on Time.</p></note> The reason why the division could not be seen
                    whilst the wheel moved more rapidly than twice round in a second of time, was
                    doubtless the continuance of that agitation in the brain from which each
                    sensation proceeded, until a new impression caused a new agitation, which
                    coalesced with the former and removed all distinction. Hence it is plain, that
                    no external succession can be perceived which moves with a greater velocity than
                    that of which the internal train of sensations and ideas ⅛ capable. On the other
                    hand, an external succession which moves with less rapidity than that to which
                    the internal flow of ideas may be reduced, either has not sufficient force to
                    generate sensations at all, or the successive impressions from which the
                    sensations proceed follow one another at such distances as to permit the natural
                    train of ideas to intervene between them, and thus destroy the perception of the
                    succession entirely.</p>
                <p>To us, therefore, it seems evident that the constant and regular succession of
                    ideas in the mind of a waking man is the measure and standard of all other
                    successions; of which, if any one either exceeds the pace which our ideas are
                    capable of, or falls short of it, the sense of a constant and continued
                    succession is lost, and we perceive it not except with certain intervals of rest
                    between. Hence it is not motion, but the constant train of ideas in our minds,
                    that suggests to us our first notion of time, of which motion no otherwise gives
                    us any conception, than as it causes in our minds a constant succession of
                    sensations; and we have as cleaι∙ a notion of time by attending to the train of
                    ideas succeeding each other in our minds, as by a train of sensations excited by
                    constant and perceptible motion.</p>
                <p>That it is merely by comparing the permanent existence of things with the
                    fleeting succession of ideas in our own minds that we acquire our notions of
                    time, may perhaps be still more evident from the following narrative quoted by
                    Dr Beattie,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Essay on
                    Truth.</p></note> from <hi rend="italic">E</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    1719. “A nobleman of Lausanne, as he was giving orders to a servant, suddenly
                    lost his speech and all his senses. Different remedies were tried without
                    effect. At last, after some chirurgical operations, at the end of six months,
                    during all which time he had appeared to he in a deep sleep or delirium, his
                    speech and senses were suddenly restored. When he recovered, the servant to whom
                    he had been giving orders when he was first seized with the distemper, happening
                    to be in the room, he asked whether he had executed his commission, not being
                    sensible, it seems, that any interval of time, except perhaps a very short one,
                    had elapsed during his illness.” If this story be true, here was a man, who, by
                    the train of ideas vanishing at once from his mind, lost the perception of what
                    was to others six months of time; and had all mankind been in this state, the
                    same portion of time would have been irrecoverably lost even to the annals of
                    chronology.</p>
                <p>We are aware of an objection to any inference which may be drawn respecting the
                    present question, from the case of this nobleman. It may be said that he had
                    lost, together with the perception of time, the perception of every thing
                    besides; and that, therefore, motion may still be the cause from which a waking
                    man derives his notions of time. But, in reply to this objection, we beg leave
                    to ask, whether, if a ball had been put in motion on a table, and the nobleman
                    had been told, that a body moved with the velocity of that ball would have been
                    carried over so many thousand miles of distance during the time that he lay in a
                    state of insensibility, he could from such information alone have formed any
                    tolerable notion of the length of time during which he was insensible? He
                    certainly could not, for want of a standard by which to measure the rapidity of
                    the motion. He would, indeed, have known instantly that he had been insensible
                    for a very considerable length of time, because he had the evidence of former
                    experience that a body carried by perceptible motion over a great extent of
                    distance would have generated in his mind a vast train of successive sensations;
                    but unless he had attended this ball during part of its course, and compared
                    with the permanency of other objects the series of sensations which it generated
                    in his mind, he would not have been able to guess, with any thing approaching to
                    accuracy, the length of time it would take to pass over a thousand miles. The
                    same insensibility of duration happens to every man in sound sleep. From having
                    notions of time, such as they are, formed in our minds, we never indeed suppose,
                    however soundly we may have slept, that the moment at which we awake in the
                    morning is contiguous to that in which we fell asleep at night. The reason is
                    obvious. Every man has been awake whilst others were sleeping, and has known by
                    experience, that if they had been awake likewise, a train of ideas would have
                    passed through their minds which must have suggested to them the notions of
                    time. Most men, too, have been frequently awake for entire nights, and have thus
                    acquired a notion of time as going on incessantly, whether perceived by them or
                    not; and this motion being closely associated with our ideas of night and
                    morning, we inevitably suppose a portion of time to have elapsed between them,
                    though unperceived by us in our sleep. But were a man to sleep without dreaming
                    from Sunday night till Tuesday morning, and then to awake at his usual hour as
                    marked on the clock, there are numberless instances on record to convince us,
                    that he would not of himself suppose, nor perhaps be very easily persuaded, that
                    more than one night had elapsed between the time of his falling asleep and the
                    moment at which he awoke.</p>
                <p>It being thus evident, that our conception of time is suggested by that
                    comparison which we inevitably make of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208480"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8480-0666"/>the existence of things permanent with the train
                    of ideas incessantly passing through our minds, we may now perhaps be able to
                    answer the question, “What is time?” It must of necessity be one of three
                    things, viz. either the ideal succession itself; or a certain quality inherent
                    in all objects; or merely the relation of co-existence between things that are
                    permanent and the trains of fleeting ideas which succeed each other on the
                    theatre of the imagination. It is not the first of these; for in every train of
                    thought, the appearance of any one idea in the mind occupies no more of the
                    extension of time, than a mathematical point occupies of the extension of
                    distance. Ten thousand mathematical points added together would make no part of
                    a line; and ten thousand ideas made to coalesce, if that were possible, would
                    not occupy any part of that mode of duration which is called time. A point is
                    the boundary of a line, but no part of it; the appearance of an idea in the mind
                    is instantaneous; and an instant is the boundary, but no part of time. Hence it
                    follows, that were every thing instantaneous, like ideas in a train, there could
                    be no such thing as time, since nothing could be said to have, in that sense of
                    the word, any duration. That time is not a quality inherent in all objects, is
                    likewise obvious; for we have seen, that were ideas as permanent as objects, the
                    notion of time could never have been acquired. Succession, although it does not
                    itself constitute time, is essential to its existence; and were all motion to
                    cease, and the attention of men to be immoveably fixed upon one invariable
                    object or cluster of objects, time would likewise cease.</p>
                <p>It remains, therefore, that time can be nothing else than the relation of
                    co-existence apprehended between things that are permanent and those trains of
                    fleeting ideas which incessantly succeed each other on the theatre of the
                    imagination. Thus, whilst a man is steadily looking at one ob-ect, which, from
                    its being common, does not occupy his vhole mind, he may be conscious of a
                    thousand ideas staring up in his imagination, and each in its turn vanishing the
                    nstant in which it appeared. Every one of these ideas had in existence as well
                    as the object at which he is looking; mt the existence of each of them was
                    instantaneous and n succession, whilst the existence of the external object is
                    permanent. The object, therefore, as contrasted with a train of ideas, is said
                    to endure or to exist i'n time, whilst each idea is destitute of duration, and
                    exists in no time.</p>
                <p>To this theory some objections occur, which it will be incumbent upon us to
                    obviate. It may be said, that although each idea considered by itself is
                    instantaneous, and occupies no time; yet the whole train, when taken together,
                    without being compared with any thing external, is perceived to occupy a
                    considerable portion of that mode of duration; and that, therefore, time itself
                    must be something more than a mere relation between a fleeting succession of
                    ideas and objects of more permanent existence. But how, we beg leave to ask, is
                    the whole train perceived to occupy any portion of time? Is it not by being
                    compared with our own existence? A man, whilst a train of ideas is passing
                    through his mind, may be suddenly deprived of all his external senses, and then
                    indeed it will be impossible for him to compare the fleeting existence of this
                    internal succession with the more permanent existence of external things; but,
                    whilst he thinks at all, he must be conscious of his own existence, and cannot
                    avoid perceiving, that whilst his ideas pass in constant succession, each making
                    an instantaneous appearance in his mind, he himself remains unchanged. Now, what
                    is it that this perception suggests to the mind? Evidently nothing more than the
                    relation of co-existence between a fleeting succession and a permanent object;
                    for were it possible that the man could be deprived of memory as well as of his
                    senses, and still have ideas succeeding each other in his mind, he would then
                    think all objects equally fleeting; he would indeed be himself a mere succession
                    of instantaneous distinct persons, and could have no notion whatever of time.
                    His existence, though it should seem to endure half a century as estimated by
                    others, must to himself appear to pass away like a flash of lightning.</p>
                <p>It may be still further objected to our theory, that time is measured by motion;
                    and that it seems very absurd to talk of measuring a relation, especially a mere
                    ideal relation, by a real external thing. In answer to this objection, which at
                    first sight appears formidable, we beg leave to observe, that all relations are
                    equally ideal; and that many of them may yet be said to be measured by real
                    external things, with as much propriety as time can be said to be measured by
                    motion. When a man wishes to ascertain the relation of quantity which one body
                    bears to another, though he knows that such a relation has no other than an
                    ideal existence, and cannot be conceived but in conjunction with the related
                    bodies, he applies to them successively some common standard; and having
                    discovered the relation which each bears to that, he compares the one relation
                    with the other, and thus ascertains the relation sought. Just so it is with
                    respect to motion measuring time. That which to each individual constitutes real
                    time, is the relation of co-existence between the fleeting succession of his own
                    ideas and other things of a more permanent nature. But a man has often occasion
                    to ascertain the time of things external which fall not under the inspection of
                    his senses; and in society all men have transactions with one another to be
                    performed in some determinate portion of time, although there are not, perhaps,
                    two men existing whose ordinary trains of thought flow with precisely the same
                    rapidity. To remedy these inconveniences, it was necessary to invent some common
                    standard, by means of which men might ascertain the duration of actions
                    performed at a distance, and be able to keep appointments made with each other.
                    The only standard proper for these purposes is such a constant and equable
                    motion as has suggested a flux of perceptions common to all men in ail ages and
                    countries; and hence motions of the heavenly bodies have been universally made
                    use of as the common regulators of time. These motions, however, do not
                    constitute real and natural time, any more than a foot or a yard applied to two
                    distant bodies constitutes the relation of quantity which these bodies bear to
                    each other. They are merely stated measures, to be differently applied according
                    to the different, purposes which we have in view.</p>
                <p>Thus, if a man in Europe wishes to know what would to him have been the real and
                    natural time of an action performed in the East Indies, he has only to be told
                    that it was co-existent, we shall suppose, with a diurnal revolution of the
                    earth; and by comparing this common measure with his usual flow of thought, he
                    can form some notion of the extent of that train of ideas which, had he been
                    present, would to him have been successively co-existent with the action in
                    question. But when persons have an appointment to keep, this common measure of
                    motion must be differently, or rather partially, applied. In such cases, it is
                    no part of their intention to compare their own existence with that of the whole
                    train of ideas which may pass in the mind of each; for the result of such a
                    comparison, which alone constitutes true and natural time, would not be the same
                    in perhaps any two men; but their purpose is, to compare their own permanent
                    existence only with that train of sensations which shall be excited in the mind
                    by the perceptible motion of the sun, or any other body fixed upon, which moves
                    equably; and such a train must consist of an equal number of instants in all
                    men. Neither the sun nor the hour-hand of a common watch moves with such
                    apparent rapidity as to keep pace with the internal flow of thought of which the
                    most phlegmatic man is conscious. That these bodies move at all, is known only
                    by <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208493" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8493-0667"/>their
                    visible change of place during the lapse of a considerable portion of real time;
                    and as there is in their course a certain number of places distinctly marked, to
                    which alone it is agreed that the attention is to be turned, it is impossible
                    that of time so computed two men can have different notions. Such time, however,
                    is but partial; and the method of ascertaining it, when compared with that by
                    which we ascertain real time, has a striking resemblance to that by which we
                    ascertain the relation of partial quantity between two distant bodies. When it
                    is our purpose to ascertain the relation of real quantity which one body bears
                    to another, we apply the common standard to each in every dimension of length,
                    breadth, and depth; but when we have no other vieψ than to ascertain the
                    relation of length which the one bears to the other, we apply the common
                    standard to each in that dimension only. Just so it is with regard to real and
                    partial time. When an individual wishes to ascertain what would to him have been
                    the duration of any action which he did not see performed, he applies the common
                    standard to the existence of that action, and to the usual flow of his own
                    thoughts; but when two men talk of the duration of any action, or agree <hi
                    rend="italic">to</hi> meet upon such a day, they compare the existence of the
                    action, or the distance intervening between the present moment and the day of
                    meeting, only with that partial train of sensations which by the common standard
                    is generated in an equal number, and in the same order, in the minds of
                    both.</p>
                <p>It will be said, that if time be nothing more than a mere relation subsisting
                    between trains of ideas or other fleeting objects, and things of a more
                    permanent existence, and if the universe really had a beginning, either time
                    must have had a beginning likewise, or the Deity cannot be immutable. We allow
                    the force of the argument; but instead of an objection, we consider it as <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> confirmation of the truth of our theory. The Deity, who is
                    immutable, exists not in time, but in eternity; and that these, though from the
                    poverty of language they are both called modes of duration, are yet very
                    different from each other, we shall endeavour to prove in the next chapter.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">of infinity and eternity.</hi></p>
                <p>As corporeal substance is certainly not infinite, and as the present material
                    system has in itself every evidence of its not being eternal, it may seem
                    strange, perhaps, to the reader, that we should treat of infinity and eternity
                    amongst the adjuncts of body. But in modern metaphysics these words are used in
                    a vague sense to denote the extent of space and time; and in this chapter it is
                    our intention to do little more than ascertain their meaning, and to show, in
                    opposition to some celebrated names, of what subjects they may not be
                    predicated. There is a mathematical and a metaphysical infinity, which, although
                    often confounded, ought to be kept distinct. In mathematics, extension is said
                    to be divisible <hi rend="italic">in infinitum,</hi> and number is sometimes
                    considered as infinite; but in metaphysics these modes of expression are
                    extremely improper. A positive and metaphysical infinite is that which has no
                    limits, and to which no addition can be made; but it is obvious that there is no
                    number which may not be enlarged, nor any positive idea of extension which has
                    not limits, and which may not be either increased or diminished. The infinity of
                    the mathematician is termed infinity of power, and that of the metaphysician
                    absolute infinity. The first consists in this, that a being, however great or
                    small it be supposed, may still be conceived to possess more greatness or
                    minuteness than we can form an idea of, even after the utmost stretch of human
                    thought. Thus, when it is said, that all extension as such is infinitely
                    divisible, it is not meant that every extended substance contains an infinite
                    number of real parts; for then the parts of an inch would be equal to those of a
                    league; but the meaning is, that in ideal extension we can never reach the end
                    of ideal division and subdivision. In like manner, when it is said that number
                    is infinite, the meaning is not that any positive number is without limits, or
                    the possibility of increase, but that we might go on for ever, adding unit to
                    unit, without approaching nearer to the end of the process. If, therefore, the
                    mathematician would speak properly, and without the affectation of paradox, he
                    ought to say that all extension, as such, is indefinitely divisible, and that
                    unit might be added to unit without end; but these phrases suggest notions very
                    different from that of a metaphysical infinite, which is something positive to
                    which nothing can be added.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>That there is something positively infinite, has been very seldom questioned; but
                    it has been warmly disputed amongst metaphysicians what subjects are infinite.
                    Dr Clarke and his adherents have contended that space and time are real things;
                    that they arc bodies of necessary existence; that the former impresses us with
                    the idea of its infinity, and that the latter is positively eternal. “Time and
                    space,” say&gt; ’ Dr Clarke,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God, and
                    Correspondence with a Gentleman of Gloucestershire.</p></note> “are the <hi
                    rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of all other things, and of all other ideas. To
                    suppose either of them finite, is an express contradiction in the idea itself.
                    No man does or can possibly imagine either of them to be finite; but only either
                    by non-attention or by choice he attends perhaps to part of his idea, and
                    forbears attending to the remainder. They who suppose space to be nothing but a
                    relation between two bodies, are guilty of the absurdity of supposing that which
                    is nothing to have real qualities; for the space which is between two bodies is
                    always unalterably just what it was, and has the very same dimensions, quantity,
                    and figure, whether these or any other bodies be there or anywhere else, or not
                    at all; just as time or duration is the same, whether you turn your hour-glass
                    or no, or whether the sun moves or stands still, or whether there was or was not
                    any sun, or any material world at all. To set bounds to space is to suppose it
                    bounded by something which itself takes up space, and that is a contradiction;
                    or else that it is bounded by nothing, which is another contradiction. To
                    suppose space removed, destroyed, or taken away, amounts to the absurd
                    supposition of removing a thing away from itself; that is, if in your
                    imagination you annihilate the whole of infinite space, the whole of infinite
                    space will still remain; and if you annihilate any part of it, that part will
                    still necessarily remain, as appears by the unmoved situation of the rest; and
                    to suppose it divided or divisible amounts to the same contradiction.”</p>
                <p>The absurdity of considering space as a real external thing has been already
                    evinced in Chapter IV. where it was shown how we acquire the notion, and what
                    kind of notion it is. Space, as was there observed, may be conceived either as
                    the mere absence and possibility of body; or as ideal extension, united to and
                    inhering in an ideal substratum. Taken in the former sense, it is an object of
                    pure intellect; in the latter it is an idea or form in the imagination. That the
                    absence of body or matter is the <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of all
                    other things, and all other ideas, Dr Clarke was not disposed to affirm, when he
                    made the divine substance to pervade every material atom in the universe<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194208506" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8506-0668"/>; and to talk of
                    the absence of body being infinite is a palpable contradiction, unless
                    Berkeley’s doctrine be true, that the material world has no existence. To say
                    that the possibility of matter is infinite, is to use language which has no
                    other meaning than that, however far the material world be on all sides
                    extended, its extension may still be conceived greater and greater <hi
                    rend="italic">in infinitum.</hi> This is a position which no philosopher,
                    ancient or modern, has ever denied; but it is so far from implying that we have
                    a positive idea of the infinity of the material world, or of any adjunct of the
                    material world, that it is absolutely inconsistent with such infinity. Whatever
                    is capable of perpetual increase must certainly have limits, and every new
                    addition is the limit of that to which the addition was made.</p>
                <p>Taken in the second acceptation as an ideal extension united with an ideal
                    substratum, space is so far from being infinite in any sense of the word, that
                    we will venture to assert no man ever contemplated such a form in his own
                    imagination, without conceiving it to be bounded. Of this, at least, we are
                    certain, that when we have attempted to frame a positive idea of pure space,
                    it'has not been in our power to divest that idea of limits. Those who can frame
                    in their minds real and positive ideas wholly abstracted from every individual
                    object, may indeed perform in this way many feats above our abilities; but as we
                    possess no such powers of abstraction, every thing which we can call an idea is
                    limited in the same manner that the object itself is limited from which the idea
                    was derived. Thus the largest expansion that we ever beheld is that of the
                    concave hemisphere; and when we try to form the largest positive idea of pure
                    space, all that we can do is to figure to ourselves that concave empty of body.
                    We may, indeed, suppose its diameter to be either a million or ten thousand
                    millions of miles, and we may go on enlarging it <hi rend="italic">in
                    infinitum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but when we return from this process of
                    intellect to the contemplation of the ideal forms of the imagination, none of
                    these forms appears to us larger or more extended than the hemisphere, which is
                    the object of sense, and they all appear to be bounded, and bounded in the very
                    same way.</p>
                <p>With respect to the eternity of time, again, we think Dr Clarke equally mistaken
                    as with respect to the infinity of space. Of time, indeed, we cannot, properly
                    speaking, have any idea or mental form. Time, as we have seen, is a mere
                    relation, and is in itself the creature of the mind, which has no external <hi
                    rend="italic">idiatum.</hi> It is suggested, however, by the fleeting succession
                    of our ideas, compared with the more permanent existence of other objects; and
                    therefore succession is essential to it. But nothing which has parts, whether
                    co-existent or in succession, can be positively infinite. For, in an infinite
                    series of successive generations of men, for instance, there will be several
                    infinites that are parts of one another, and by consequence one greater than
                    another which, as has been well argued,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Dr Law’s Inquiry into the Ideas of Space, Time, Immensity,
                    and Eternity. See also the same writer’s translation of King’s Origin of
                    Evil.</p></note> is an express contradiction, since the greater must necessarily
                    bound the less, and exceed its limits by so’ much as it is greater than it; that
                    is, must make it not infinite. Infinite generations contain an infinitely
                    greater infinity of particular men. An infinite number of men must have twice as
                    many hands, and ten times as many fingers, and so on. Infinite time has an
                    infinity of ages; these a much greater infinity of years, days, hours, &amp;c.
                    Space likewise, according to Dr Clarke, has three dimensions, all infinite. It
                    must therefore contain an infinity of surfaces, an infinitely greater infinity
                    of lines, and a still infinitely greater infinity of physical points. The case
                    is the same in number itself, which, if we suppose it to contain an absolute
                    infinity of thousands (and we may as well do that as imagine it to comprehend an
                    infinity of units), will contain ten times as many hundreds, fifty times as many
                    scores, and so on. All this is only the indefiniteness of number, which we in
                    vain attempt to turn into a positive infinite, with which it is totally
                    incompatible. For let us add one to any of these infinite series of generations,
                    ages, lines, or numbers, which we know to be always in our power, and if it was
                    absolutely infinite before, here is one more than infinite. If it only becomes
                    infinite now, then one finite added to another finite makes infinity. If it be
                    no larger after the addition than it was before, then one part added to another
                    adds nothing; all which are absurdities. The same will appear if we subtract a
                    part from this supposed absolute infinite, which may be done in any of the
                    before-mentioned subjects, as well as in every thing which admits of parts, or
                    may be taken in pieces by the mind.</p>
                <p>To this kind of reasoning Dr Clarke replies as follows: “To endeavour to prove
                    that there cannot possibly be any such thing as infinite time or space, from the
                    impossibility of an addition of finite parts ever composing or exhausting an
                    infinite, or from the imaginary inequality of the number of years, days, and
                    hours, that would be contained in the one, or of the miles, yards, and feet,
                    that would be contained in the other, is supposing infinites to be made up of
                    numbers of finites; that is, it is supposing finite quantities to be aliquot or
                    constituent parts of infinite, when indeed they are not so, but do all equally,
                    whether great or small, whether many or few, bear the very same proportion to an
                    infinite, as mathematical points do to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> line, or lines
                    to a superficies, or as moments do to time, that is, none at all. No given
                    number or quantity can be any aliquot or constituent part of infinite, or be
                    compared at all with it, or bear any kind of proportion to it, or be the
                    foundation of any argument in any question concerning it.”</p>
                <p>If it be indeed true, and it is that for which we contend, that no given number
                    or quantity can be any aliquot or constituent part of infinite, or be compared
                    at all with it, then it undeniably follows, not that miles, yards, and feet are
                    no constituent parts of space, or years, days, and hours constituent parts of
                    time, but that space and time cannot possibly be positive infinites. This, we
                    say, follows undeniably; for nothing is more evident than that all quantities of
                    the same kind, from the largest to the least, bear a certain proportion to each
                    other; and upon the supposition that space is a real extending thing, miles,
                    yards, and feet are included in it, and bear to it the relation of parts to a
                    whole. The same is true of time, days, and hours. To affirm, for no proof is
                    offered, that all finite quantities, whether great or small, whether many or
                    few, do equally bear the very same proportion to an infinite, as mathematical
                    points do to a line, or as moments do to time, is plainly to beg the question,
                    “that space considered as a real extended thing is infinite,” and to beg it,
                    too, in opposition to the common sense and reason of mankind.· Mathematical
                    points we all know to be nothing real, but merely negations of extension; but
                    supposing space to be something real and extended, can any man persuade himself
                    that a mile or a million of miles of this space is likewise a mere negation of
                    extension? With him who can bring himself into this persuasion, we do not
                    pretend to argue. He is possessed of faculties, whether true or false, of which
                    we are destitute.</p>
                <p>That finite quantities, whether these be great or small, do <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208519" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8519-0669"/>all equally bear the same
                    proportion to an infinite in power, is indeed true; but it is no great
                    discovery; for such an infinite, as we have seen, is nothing but the continued
                    possibility of repeating the same mental process of addition or multiplication;
                    and he who can go on for ever adding, in his own imagination, foot to foot, or
                    hour to hour, will find it equally easy to add, in the same manner, league to
                    league, or age to age. If he can perform the one operation, he must likewise
                    have power to perform the other; and he cannot but perceive that it is as
                    impossible to come to an end of adding league to league, or age to age, as of
                    adding foot to foot, or hour to hour; but then he must know that these leagues,
                    and feet, and ages, and hours, are not real external things, but mere ideas and
                    notions in his mind. If such powers of ideal multiplication and addition be what
                    Dr Clarke means by the ideas of space and time, it is indeed a contradiction to
                    suppose either of them limited; for that would be to suppose our powers
                    different from what we know them to be by consciousness and experience. But to
                    confound powers with the objects of those powers, is certainly very inaccurate;
                    and to suppose, because we can go on for ever adding one portion of ideal space
                    or time to another, that therefore our ideas of space and time are in themselves
                    positively infinite, is a contradiction; for to an idea positively infinite it
                    is obvious that nothing can be added. Either, therefore, space and time do not
                    impress us with the ideas of their positive infinity; or we cannot have the
                    power of adding league to league, and age to age, without end.</p>
                <p>“But,” says Dr Clarke, “to suppose space removed, destroyed, or taken wholly
                    away, amounts to the absurd supposition of removing a thing from itself; that
                    is, if in your imagination you remove the whole of space, the whole of space
                    will still remain.” True, every man has ideas of space treasured up indfis
                    imagination, which the sound of the very word space will at all times bring into
                    his immediate view; and whilst he has such ideas, it is impossible that he
                    should not have them; which is all the mystery of the matter, and amounts to
                    nothing more than that a thing cannot be and not be at the same instant. When
                    the doctor affirms, that if “you annihilate any part of space, that part will
                    necessarily remain, as appears by the unmoved situation of the rest,” we are not
                    certain that we perfectly understand him. A man may’ surely think of a cubical
                    inch without also thinking of a foot or a yard; and he may suppose the inch
                    taken away from the foot or the yard, and diese ideal quantities so much
                    lessened by the subtraction. But if the doctor be here again confounding the
                    powers of the mind with the positive ideas of space, the sentence when explained
                    will be found to contain nothing to his purpose. Every man has the power of
                    contemplating in idea millions of miles, and millions of ages, and of adding
                    mile to mile, and age to age, without end; and if he try to deprive himself of
                    any part of this power, or to fix a limit to the mental process of addition, he
                    will find that in spite of himself his imagination will ramble beyond the limit
                    assigned, and that he has attempted an utter impossibility. This, however, is so
                    far from being a proof that his ideas of space and time are positively infinite,
                    that, as we have already observed, it is a proof of the contrary.</p>
                <p>But, says this great man and his followers, “space and time are the <hi
                    rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of all other things and all other ideas. The
                    supposal of the existence of any thing whatever includes necessarily a
                    presupposition of the existence of space and time and, therefore, if there be
                    any thing infinite and eternal, space and time must likewise be so.</p>
                <p>To every corporeal substance, and every idea of such substance, space and time
                    are indeed necessary; for every body has extension and duration, and every idea
                    of a particular body, being nothing but a secondary perception in the
                    imagination· or the memory, must have the same relation to imaginary extension
                    that the object from which it was derived has to extension which is real. Every
                    idea, too, which remains in the imagination whilst a train of other ideas passes
                    successively in view, or whilst external things are perceived to change, has
                    real time. But will any man pretend that consciousness, our notion of power, our
                    acts of willing, or even tastes, sounds, and smells, are extended, or that the
                    supposition of their existence necessarily implies a presupposition of the
                    existence of space? We acquire our ideas of extension and of space by means of
                    our senses of touch and sight; and we learn from experience that things external
                    and extended are the causes of our sensations of taste, and sound, and smell.
                    The effects are in our minds closely associated with the ideas of their causes;
                    and it is not perhaps easy to think of a particular sound, taste, or smell,
                    without at the same time thinking of the object by which it was first excited in
                    the mind; but if we had been originally formed with the powers of consciousness,
                    thinking, and willing, and with no other senses than those of tasting, smelling,
                    and hearing, it is obvious that we never could have had the idea of space; and
                    therefore, that idea cannot possibly be necessary to the presupposition of every
                    thing else. To consciousness, thinking, and willing, space is so far from being
                    necessary, that we cannot perceive any the most distant relation between them.
                    It is not more difficult to conceive a part greater than the whole, than it is
                    to conceive an ell of consciousness, of thought, or of will; nor is it in the
                    power of any man to make space and sweetness coalesce in his mind so as to form
                    of these two simple ideas one complex conception. The very reverse is the case
                    with respect to the objects of sight and touch. The idea of every thing which we
                    see and handle necessarily coalesces in the mind with the idea of space, nor can
                    we possibly separate the one from the other; but the things which we see and
                    handle are neither infinite nor capable of infinity.</p>
                <p>With respect to time, the same observations will be found to be as applicable as
                    with respect to space. Whatever is liable to change exists in time, and cannot
                    be eternal; but if there be any immutable being who views at once all things
                    which to us are past, present, and to come, the existence of such a being is not
                    commensurable with time. That such a being is possible, no man can doubt who
                    reflects, that if we had one permanent idea invariably in the mind, we should
                    never have acquired the notion of succession or of time; and that if there were
                    actually no change in nature, there could not possibly be in nature any such
                    thing as time. Every man, therefore, who can conceive existence without change
                    must be convinced, that the supposition of the existence of any thing whatever
                    does not necessarily include the presupposition of the existence of time, and
                    that there may be an eternity distinct from time, as well as an infinity
                    distinct from space; nay, that that which is properly infinite and eternal
                    cannot possibly occupy either space or time.</p>
                <p>If it be asked, What kind of infinity and eternity they are which have no
                    relation to space and time? Cudworth, treading in the footsteps of the ancients,
                    has long ago answered, that they are “absolute perfection and necessary
                    existence.” For, according to him, infinite understanding and knowledge are
                    nothing else but perfect knowledge, which has in it no defect or mixture of
                    ignorance, but knows whatsoever is knowable. In like manner, infinite power is
                    nothing else but perfect power, which has in it no defect or mixture of
                    impotency; a power which can do every thing which is possible or conceivable.
                    Lastly, infinity of duration, or eternity, is really nothing else but
                    perfection, as including in it necessary existence and immutability; so that it
                    is a contradiction to suppose such a being to have had a beginning, to cease to
                    be, or to suffer or be affected by any change whatsoever. And because infinity
                    is perfec <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208532" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8532-0670"
                    />tion, therefore, whatever includes in its idea or essence any thing of
                    imperfection, as every positive idea of number, corporeal magnitude, and
                    successive duration evidently does, cannot be truly and properly infinite.</p>
                <p>It must indeed be confessed, that the idea of succession so insinuates itself
                    into our usual ideas of existence, and is so closely connected with the
                    existence of all finite beings, that we find it extremely difficult to imagine
                    the eternal existence of God any otherwise than as an eternally continued series
                    or succession. Our constant conversation with material objects, and the
                    associations thence arising, make it almost impossible for us to consider things
                    abstracted from time and space; yet we have the evidence of experience and
                    consciousness that an idea may be conceived without relation to space and time,
                    and that space and time cannot be made to coalesce with some of our notions. The
                    same must be true with respect to infinity and eternity; for we have seen that
                    neither space, nor time, nor any thing else which consists of parts, whether
                    continuous or successive, can be supposed to be positively infinite, as the
                    supposition implies the most palpable contradiction. But that there may be
                    perfect power, perfect knowledge, and permanent invariable existence, is so far
                    from implying any contradiction, that even we, whose faculties are all so very
                    limited, can yet make some advances towards the conception of such perfections.
                    Thus, every man of common understanding knows that some things are in themselves
                    possible, and others impossible, to be performed by any power. Of these
                    possibilities and impossibilities a philosopher knows more than an illiterate
                    man; and one philosopher knows more than another. An intellect more perfect
                    knows more of them than any man; and that intellect which knows them all must be
                    absolutely perfect, and incapable of improvement, because it knows every thing
                    which is to be known. The same is true of perfect power; but we shall treat of
                    real infinity and eternity more at large when we come to demonstrate the being
                    and attributes of God. At present it is sufficient to have shown that nothing
                    can be positively infinite but a being absolutely perfect, which can produce all
                    things possible and conceivable, and upon which all other things must
                    depend.</p>
                <p>PART III.</p>
                <p>OF MINDS AND THEIR POWERS.</p>
                <p>CIIAP. I.—OF MIND IN GENERAL.</p>
                <p>The science of metaphysics comprehends every thing into the existence, the
                    nature, or the causes of which any inquiry may be made. But all things of which
                    we have any notion or idea may be divided into mind and body, with their various
                    powers, and qualities, and adjuncts. By body is meant that which is solid,
                    extended, inert, and divisible; and its several adjuncts arè space, motion,
                    number, and time. The only mind with which we are intimately acquainted is our
                    own; and we know that it is possessed of the powers of sensation, perception,
                    retention, consciousness, reflection, reason, and will. These are totally
                    different from extension, solidity, divisibility, and motion; and therefore it
                    is proper to distinguish the being of which they are powers by another name than
                    that of body.</p>
                <p>Of bodies there are various kinds, possessing various sensible qualities; and
                    hence from analogy it is reasonable to conclude, that there may be various
                    classes of minds endowed with different kinds or degrees of power. For this
                    indeed we have much stronger evidence than that of analogy. Brute animals
                    evidently possess the powers of perception and spontaneity, with some degree of
                    consciousness; but as they do not appear to reflect upon their own conduct, or
                    to have their actions influenced by motives, their minds are inferior to ours,
                    although still perfectly distinct from mere extended, inert, and divisible
                    substances. Mind, therefore, considered with respect to its powers, is evidently
                    different from body, considered with respect to its qualities. This is indeed a
                    truth which has seldom or never been controverted; but it has been long and
                    warmly disputed, whether mind and body be not both composed of the same first
                    matter.</p>
                <p>Hobbes supposed that every material atom is endowed with the faculty of
                    sensation, but that for want of memory each sensation is momentaneous, being
                    instantly and wholly effaced as soon as its cause is removed. Though this
                    hypothesis is too absurd to require a formal and laboured confutation, it may
                    not be improper to observe, that, if it were true, the hairs of a man’s head
                    would feel extreme pain when pinched by the hot iron of the hair-dresser, and
                    that the nails of his fingers would be severely tortured when under the
                    operation of the knife or the file.</p>
                <p>Others, again, have supposed that each atom of matter has a tendency towards
                    sensation and perception; and that when a sufficient number of these atoms are
                    brought together in a certain order, the united tendencies produce the actual
                    powers which distinguish'mind from gross body. This supposition is, if possible,
                    more absurd than that of Hobbes. Sensation and perception are of such a nature,
                    that a mere tendency towards them is inconceivable. A thing must either be
                    sensible and percipient, or insensible and inert; there is evidently no medium.
                    Or if we could suppose each individual atom to have a tendency towards
                    sensation, it would by no means follow that a number of such atoms brought
                    together in any possible order would become one sentient, thinking, and active
                    being. A number of bodies laid upon an inclined plane have each a tendency to
                    roll downwards; but if th¾declivity of the plane be not such that their separate
                    tendencies may overcome the resistance opposed to each individual body by
                    friction, the united tendencies of all these bodies when brought together will
                    not be sufficient to overpower the resistance of their united frictions. It is
                    just so with respect to sensation and perception. If the tendency of one atom
                    cannot overcome one degree of inertness, the tendency of a thousand atoms will
                    not overcome a thousand degrees of the same inertness.</p>
                <p>We have just mentioned these absurd suppositions, that our article might be
                    complete; but it is proper to inform the reader, that, so far as we know or are
                    aware, neither of them has for many years been maintained by any philosopher of
                    eminence either at home or abroad. The opinions on this subject which at present
                    divide the republic of letters are two, and these alone are worthy of
                    examination. One party maintains that perception, memory, reason, and will,
                    &amp;c. are the powers of a being which must be immaterial and indivisible; the
                    other alleges, that as we know nothing of these powers but from our own
                    consciousness, and as we can trace them in ourselves to the brain and no
                    farther, we have no reason to suppose that they are the powers of any substance
                    distinct from matter. Both parties, however, distinguish that which in man is
                    the subject of thought from his external organs of sense, and agree to call it
                    by the name of <hi rend="italic">mind</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> although the
                    one considers it as composed of the same first matter with the dust of the
                    ground, whilst the other believes it to have no property whatever in common with
                    that matter.</p>
                <p>Were we to adopt some of the ancient methods of philosophizing, this important
                    question might soon be decided. A most respectable writer, who has laboured to
                    restore the metaphysics of Plato and Aristotle, attempts to confute the
                    materialists, by laying down what they must think arbitrary definitions of mind
                    and matter, and then show <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208545"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8545-0671"/>ing that the one is not the other. “In all the
                    parts of the material world,” says he, “there is <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    perpetual motion; for the celestial bodies move constantly in one respect or
                    another, and all here below is in a continual vicissitude of generation^and
                    corruption, which cannot be without motion. Now, where there is motion, there
                    must be something that moves. What is moved I call <hi rend="italic"
                    >body</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> what moves I call <hi rend="italic"
                    >mindl</hi> ’ From this definition he undertakes to prove that mind must be
                    immaterial. “That there is a relation between moving and being moved,” says he,
                    “nobody can deny; and the relation is no other than that of action and passion.
                    But the nature of relation is such, that it must necessarily be between two
                    things at least; and it is further necessary, that the two things related should
                    exist together. Hence,∙if there be that which moves, there must be a different
                    thing that is moved; and wherever the one is, the other must necessarily be; so
                    that nothing can move itself. This being established, I say that what moves must
                    be either material or immaterial; for the one of these being the negation of the
                    other, there can be no middle betwixt them, because a thing must necessarily be
                    or not be. If then it be immaterial, there is an end of the question; but if it
                    be said to be material, then I say that it must be moved itself before it can
                    move any thing else, for it is only in that way that body can move body. If then
                    it must be first moved itself, but cannot itself move itself, what is it that
                    moves itself? If it be answered that it is another material mover, then I repeat
                    the same question, to which the same answer must be given; and so we have an
                    infinite series of material movers, without any beginning or principle of
                    motion. Now this is absurd, and contradictory to this first principle of natural
                    philosophy, admitted by all philosophers ancient and modern, that <hi
                    rend="italic">nothing can be produced without a causey</hi></p>
                <p>For the immateriality of the human mind, and of every being endowed with the
                    powers of perception and thought, the learned writer has better arguments; but
                    it is upon this chiefly that he rests his persuasion, that mind is the only
                    mover in the universe. It is needless to observe, that in the very definitions
                    and axioms upon which this reasoning is built, the thing to be proved is taken
                    for granted; for if it be self-evident that what moves is, in the author’s sense
                    of the word, mind, that what is moved is body, and that nothing can move itself,
                    all reasoning on the subject is superfluous. This, however, is so far from being
                    self-evident, that a materialist may reply, that “every animal moves itself, and
                    yet every animal is nothing more than a system of matter.” This position,
                    whether true or false, can neither be proved nor confuted by arguments <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> founded on general definitions. That animals move
                    themselves, and that to the senses they appear to be nothing else than systems
                    of matter, are facts which cannot be controverted. If we would know whether they
                    have in them a principle of motion which is not material, we must submit to the
                    laws of induction, and, by investigating the essential qualities of matter,
                    endeavour to ascertain whether a material system can be rendered active. That we
                    ourselves have active powers, we know by the most complete of all evidence, our
                    consciousness of their energies; and it has been already shown, that such powers
                    as we experience in ourselves cannot exist but in a subject possessed of will
                    and understanding. The question, therefore, to be first decided between the
                    materialists and immaterialists is, whether the powers of consciousness,
                    understanding, and will, can result from the particular organization of a system
                    of matter. If they can, then we have no reason to attribute them in man to any
                    other source. If these powers appear necessarily to require an immaterial
                    principle for their support, it will probably be granted that an immaterial
                    principle is the source of every power and every motion in the universe; and the
                    doctrine of mind, in the strictest sense of the word, will be sufficiently
                    established.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II.—OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE HUMAN MIND.</p>
                <p>The most celebrated materialist of this, or perhaps of any other century, was Dr
                    Priestley, who having in his own imagination divested matter of solidity, and
                    reduced it to mere centres of attraction and repulsion, observed, that “if one
                    kind of substance be capable of supporting all the known properties of man, that
                    is, if those properties have nothing in them that is absolutely incompatible
                    with one another, we shall be obliged to conclude (unless we openly violate the
                    rules of philosophizing, which will not authorize us to multiply causes or kinds
                    of substance without necessity), that no other kind of substance enters into bis
                    composition; the supposition being manifestly unnecessary, in order to account
                    for any appearance whatever. All the properties that have hitherto been
                    attributed to matter may be comprised under those of attraction and repulsion.
                    Besides these, man is possessed of the powers of sensation or perception, and
                    thought. But if, without'giving the reins to our imaginations, we suffer
                    ourselves to be guided in our inquiries by the simple rules of philosophizing
                    above mentioned, we must necessarily conclude that these powers also may belong
                    to the same substance that has also the properties of attraction, repulsion, and
                    extension, which I as well as others call by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >matter.</hi> The reason of the conclusion is simply this, That the powers of
                    sensation or perception, and thought, as belonging to man, have never been found
                    but in conjunction with a certain organized system of matter; and therefore that
                    those powers necessarily exist in, and depend upon, such a system. This at least
                    must be our conclusion, till it can be shown that these powers are incompatible
                    with the other known properties of the same substance; and for this I see no
                    sort of pretence.”</p>
                <p>This is what Dr Priestley has called the proper and direct proof that the
                    sentient principle in man is the material substance of the brain; and he
                    enforces it by the following observations: “Had we formed a judgment concerning
                    the necessary seat of thought by the circumstances that universally accompany
                    it, which is our rule in all other cases, we could not but have concluded that
                    in man it is a property of the nervous system, or rather of the brain; because,
                    as far as we can judge, the faculty of thinking, and a certain state of the
                    brain, always accompany and correspond to one another, which is the very reason
                    why we believe that any property is inherent in any substance whatever. There is
                    no instance of any man retaining the faculty of thinking when his brain was
                    destroyed; and whenever that faculty is impeded or injured, there is sufficient
                    reason to believe that the brain is disordered in proportion; and therefore we
                    are necessarily led to consider the latter as the seat of the former. Moreover,
                    as the faculty of thinking in general ripens and comes to maturity with the
                    body, it is also observed to decay with it; and if, in some cases, the mental
                    faculties continue vigorous when the body in general is enfeebled, it is
                    evidently because in those particular cases the brain is not much affected by
                    the general cause of weakness. But, on the other hand, if the brain alone be
                    affected, as by a blow on the head, by actual pressure within the skull, by
                    sleep, or by inflammation, the mental faculties are universally affected in
                    proportion. Likewise, as the mind is affected in consequence of the affections
                    of the body and brain, so the body is liable to be reciprocally affected by the
                    affections of the mind, as is evident in the visible effects of all strong
                    passions, hope or fear, love or anger, joy or sorrow, exultation or despair.
                    These are certainly irrefragable argu <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208558"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8558-0672"/>ments, that it is properly no other than one and
                    the same thing that is subject to these affections, and that they are
                    necessarily dependent upon one another. In fact, there is just the same reason
                    to conclude, that the powers of sensation and thought are the necessary result
                    of a particular organization, as that sound is the necessary result of a
                    particular concussion of the air. For in both cases equally the one constantly
                    accompanies the other; and there is not in nature a stronger argument for a
                    necessary connection <hi rend="italic">of</hi> any cause and any effect. To
                    adopt an opinion different from this, is to form an hypothesis without a single
                    fact to support it.”</p>
                <p>Although the ingenious author thinks, that if there be any foundation for the
                    established rules of philosophizing, this reasoning ought to be conclusive, he
                    yet subjoins, for the greater satisfaction of his readers, some additional
                    arguments, or rather, as he says, distinct illustrations of the great argument.
                    They are as follow:</p>
                <p>1. “That the faculty of thinking necessarily depends, for its exercise at least,
                    upon a stock of ideas, about which it is always conversant, will hardly be
                    questioned by any person. But there is not a single idea of which the mind is
                    possessed but what may be proved to have come to it from the bodily senses, or
                    to have been consequent upon the perceptions of sense. The notion, therefore, of
                    the possibility of thinking in man, without an organized body, is not only
                    destitute of all evidence from actual appearances, but is directly contrary to
                    them; and yet these appearances ought alone to guide the judgment of
                    philosophers.</p>
                <p>2. “The only reason why it has been so earnestly contended for, that there is
                    some principle in man that is not material, is, that it might subsist, and be
                    capable of sensation and action, when the body is dead. But if the mind was
                    naturally so independent of the body as to be capable of subsisting by itself,
                    and even of appearing to more advantage after the death of the body, it might be
                    expected to discover some signs of its independence before death, and especially
                    when the organs of the body were obstructed, so as to leave the soul more at
                    liberty to exert itself; as in a state of sleep or swooning, which must resemble
                    the state of death, in which it is pretended that the soul is most of all alive,
                    most active, and vigorous. But, judging by appearances, the reverse of all this
                    is the case.</p>
                <p>3. “If the mental principle was, in its own nature, immaterial and immortal, all
                    its particular faculties would be so too; whereas we see that every faculty of
                    the mind without exception is liable to be impaired, and even to become wholly
                    extinct, before death. Since, therefore, all the faculties of the mind,
                    separately taken, appear to be mortal, the substance or principle in which they
                    exist must be pronounced to be mortal too.</p>
                <p>4. “If the sentient principle in man be immaterial, it can have no extension; it
                    can neither have length, breadth, nor thickness; and consequently every thing
                    within it, or properly belonging to it, must be simple and indivisible. Let us
                    now consider how this notion agrees with the phenomena of sensation and ideas.
                    It will not be denied, but that sensations or ideas properly exist in the soul,
                    because it could not otherwise retain them, so as to continue to perceive and
                    think after its separation from the body. Now, whatever ideas are in themselves,
                    they are evidently produced by external objects, and must therefore correspond
                    to them; and since many of the objects or archetypes of ideas are divisible, it
                    necessarily follows, that the ideas themselves are divisible also. But how is it
                    possible that a thing (be the nature of it what it may) that is divisible should
                    be contained in a substance, be the nature of it likewise what it may, that is
                    indivisible? If the archetypes of ideas have extension, the ideas which are
                    expressive of them, and are actually produced by them according to certain
                    mechanical laws, must have extension likewise; and therefore the mind in which
                    they exist, whether it be material or immaterial, must have extension also. But
                    how any <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> thing can have extension and yet be
                    immaterial, without coinciding with our idea of mere empty space, I know
                    not.”</p>
                <p>To the argument, which is here chiefly insisted upon as being agreeable to the
                    established rules of philosophizing, a very able reply has been made, which we
                    shall give in the words of its elegant and spirited author. But before we
                    attempt to dig up the foundation of the doctor’s system, it may not be improper
                    to demolish, if possible, the additional buttresses by which it is strengthened.
                    An experienced general, before he storms a citadel which he knows to be strongly
                    fortified and skilfully defended, will take care to raze every less important
                    redoubt from which the enemy might annoy him in his rear.</p>
                <p>Because the faculty of thinking in general ripens, comes to maturity, and decays
                    with the body, and the body, on the other hand, is affected by the affections of
                    the mind, Dr Priestley affirms that we have the same reason to conclude, that
                    the powers of sensation and thought are the necessary result of a particular
                    organization, as that sound is the necessary result of a particular concussion
                    of the air. This argument is conclusive only upon the supposition that there is
                    no positive evidence whatever of the immateriality of the being which is the
                    subject of thought. If the other reasonings for the materiality or immateriality
                    of the mind be of equal weight, this argument ought doubtless to turn the
                    balance; but if there be the smallest prepon-derancy in behalf of the
                    immaterialists, it is a mere begging of the question to attempt to counteract it
                    by any inference which can be drawn from the mutual affections of the body and
                    mind. If two such heterogeneous beings as an immaterial mind and an organized
                    body can be supposed united in one person, they must necessarily affect each
                    other; and to affirm, on account of this reciprocal affection, that they are one
                    and the same, is equally absurd as to say that an electrician and his apparatus
                    are one and the same. Dr Priestley himself did not at first perform his
                    electrical experiments with so much ease as after he had acquired facility by
                    long practice, nor could he even yet perform them so neatly with a bad as with a
                    good apparatus.</p>
                <p>That which the doctor calls the first illustration of his argument might be
                    admitted, and the force of the argument itself be consistently denied. Some kind
                    of organized body may be necessary to the mind as an instrument without which it
                    could not exert its faculties; but it would certainly be rash to infer that the
                    mind must therefore be a system of matter. An anvil and a hammer are necessary
                    to the exercise of the blacksmith’s craft; but what would be thought of him who
                    should from this fact conclude, that the blacksmith himself must be a system of
                    iron. This, therefore, instead of illustrating the great argument, appears to be
                    wholly foreign to the question in debate; and it has in fact been admitted by Dr
                    Price,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Correspondence
                    with Dr Priestley.</p></note> and thousands of others who reject the doctrine of
                    materialism, as an impious absurdity. The second illustration, however, is more
                    to the purpose; and as it is not new, we shall give it an old answer.</p>
                <p>Why do not we perceive external objects in our sleep or in a swoon? “Because,”
                    says Mr Wollaston,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Religion of Nature Delineated.</p></note> “the passages are become
                    impracticable, the windows shut, and the nerves, being obstructed, or somehow
                    rendered for the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208571"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8571-0673"/>time useless, can transmit no information to it.
                    Why, however, does it not reason and think about something or other? Because all
                    the marks by which things are remembered being for the present choked up or
                    disordered, the remembrance of those objects about which it is wont to employ
                    itself, and even of the words (or other signs) in which it uses to reason, and
                    to preserve the deductions and conclusions it makes, are all suspended, at least
                    for the time; and so its tables being covered, its books closed, and its tools
                    locked up, the requisites for reasoning are wanting, and no subject offers
                    itself to exercise its thoughts, it having yet had little or no opportunity to
                    take in higher objects and more refined matter for contemplation. And, to
                    conclude, if it be demanded, why any one should imagine that the soul may think,
                    perceive, act, after death, when it doth not do this in sleep, &amp;c.? The
                    answer is, because those enclosures and impediments which occasioned the
                    forementioned intermissions, and those great limitations under which it labours
                    at all times, will be removed with its enlargement out of the body. When it
                    shall in its proper vehicle be let go, and take its flight into the open fields
                    of heaven, it will then be bare to the immediate impressions of objects; and why
                    should not those impressions which affected the nerves, that moved and affected
                    the vehicle and soul in it, affect the vehicle immediately when they are
                    immediately made upon it, without the interposition of the nerves? The hand
                    which feels an object at the end of a staff, may certainly be allowed to feel
                    the same much better by immediate contact without the staff.” Nor was the
                    opinion, that the soul is united to some fine vehicle, which dwells with it in
                    the brain, and goes off with it at death, peculiar to Mr Wollaston. It was
                    thought extremely probable by Dr Hartley, and shall afterwards be shown to have
                    been a very ancient opinion; but we do not quote it at present as either well or
                    ill founded, but only as sufficient, in conjunction with the reasoning of its
                    author, to obviate the force of Dr Priestley’s second illustration of his
                    argument for the materiality of mind, provided the argument itself be not more
                    powerful than any which the immatcrialists can bring against it.</p>
                <p>The doctor’s third illustration we have already obviated, when we accounted for
                    the mind and the body mutually affecting each other; and we might refer to Dr
                    Price’s answer to the fourth, as being, in our opinion, a full confutation of
                    it. But as that author’s notions of mind and ideas differ in some respects from
                    our own, we shall examine this objection to the doctrine of the immaterialists,
                    upon principles which Dr Priestley would perhaps have been more inclined to
                    admit.</p>
                <p>That the sentient principle in man, if it be immaterial, can have no extension,
                    is a truth which,χwe think, cannot be controverted; and if so, every thing in
                    that principle must be simple and indivisible. Thus far we agree with Dr
                    Priestley; but with respect to what follows we differ from him entirely. The
                    agitation in the brain, which is the immediate cause of sensation, must indeed
                    correspond to the impression <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >extra</hi> by which it is produced, and therefore must have the property of
                    extension; but that agitation, whatever it be, is not itself sensation, any more
                    than a bludgeon is a blow, or a sword is a wound. Dr Priestley, indeed, in
                    answer to Dr Price, affirms that, according to Hartley’s theory, ideas are only
                    vibrations in the brain; but whoever shall take the trouble to examine that
                    theory himself, will not find that its author ever advances such an opinion, or
                    considers vibrations as‘any thing more than the instruments by which sensations
                    and ideas are excited in the sentient principle. A real and proper idea, as we
                    have often repeated, is nothing else than a fainter sensation; but no sensation,
                    from whatever cause it may proceed, is itself extended; nor could we, without
                    memory, the reasoning faculty, and the power of local motion, have acquired from
                    mere sense any notion of extension at all. (See Sect. III. Chap. I. Part I.)
                    Sensations and ideas are those appearances, if we may say so, which vibrations
                    or some other motion in the brain excite in the mind; but a half appearance is
                    an absurdity. A man may view half a tree with his eyes, and he may contemplate
                    the idea of half a tree in his mind, but he cannot have half a view or half an
                    idea of any thing. Sensations and ideas result from the mutual agency of the
                    brain and sentient principle upon each other; and if the agency of the brain be
                    vibration, more of it may vibrate at one time than at another; but surely the
                    mere relation between its agency at any time and the agency of the mind, can
                    neither have extension nor be divisible, for who ever thought of extending or
                    dividing relations? On this subject it is extremely difficult to write with
                    perspicuity and precision, and what we have said may very possibly be
                    misunderstood. Our notion is to our own mind clear and determinate; but
                    language, which was not invented by metaphysicians, wants words in which it may
                    be properly expressed. Perhaps the reader may understand what we mean, when we
                    say that a sensation or an idea is the instantaneous effect of the mutual agency
                    of the brain and sentient principle. Of this we think every man, by a little
                    attention, may be perfectly convinced, though it may be impossible ever to
                    discover the precise nature of this agency; and if so, it is plain that
                    sensations and ideas cannot be divided, for no instantaneous effect of any kind
                    is divisible. A sensation, and of course a simple and original idea, neither has
                    extension itself, nor suggests the notion of extension <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi><hi rend="italic">extra.</hi> By running the hand or any other member
                    along a solid body, we feel continued resistance; this feeling, or the idea of
                    this feeling, becomes in time so closely associated with all our sensations of
                    touch and sight, that the one cannot be separated from the other, and these
                    associations are what Dr Priestley calls extended ideas. Upon the whole, then,
                    we think it apparent that our sensations, and the relicts of our sensations, are
                    unextended and indivisible; and that though they suggest to us the existence of
                    extended things <hi rend="italic">ah extra,</hi> the sentient being may be
                    unextended and indivisible.</p>
                <p>Having thus examined Dr Priestley’s auxiliary arguments for the materiality of
                    mind, we now proceed to consider his main and direct proof. To this, as we have
                    observed, so able a reply has been made, that it would be injustice to our
                    readers not to lay it befofe them, in the words of its author. “I readily
                    acknowledge,” says this acute and spirited essayist,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Essays, Philosophical, Historical, and
                    Literary, vol. ii.</p></note> “that the power of sensation or perception never
                    having been found but in conjunction with a certain organized system of matter,
                    we ought, as philosophers, to conclude that this power necessarily exists in,
                    and results from, that organized system, unless it can be shown to be
                    incompatible with other known properties of the same substance. On the other
                    hand, it must be admitted, that constant conjunction implies necessary
                    connections only when reasons cannot be discovered to prove the conjunction to
                    be accidental and arbitrary. In the present instance it is alleged, that
                    discerptibility is a property of matter absolutely incompatible with the
                    property of sensation or perception; or, in other words, that sensation is a
                    power or property incapable of division. But as the power of the entire system
                    is clearly nothing more than the sum or aggregate of the powers of all the
                    parts, it necessarily follows, that the primary particles of which the system is
                    composed must, upon the material hvpothesis, possess<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208584" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8584-0674"/> distinct powers of
                    sensation, and that those powers combined constitute the indivisible power of
                    sensation belonging to the system ;,or, in other words, that the indivisible
                    power of sensation is a divisible power, nay, an infinitely divisible power, if
                    matter be, as philosophers in general allow, an infinitely divisible substance,
                    a conclusion obviously and grossly ridiculous. We are then compelled to
                    acknowledge that sensation or perception is not the property of a material
                    substance; that is, if the common mode of expression be retained, it is the
                    property of an immaterial substance; or, to avoid verbal contention, it is a
                    property not resulting from, or necessarily connected with, the organical
                    system, but a property wholly foreign, superinduced, and adventitious.</p>
                <p>“In opposition to this reasoning, the materialists affirm, that entire systems
                    may possess, and they think themselves warranted to pronounce that organized
                    systems of matter actually do possess, powers essèntially different from those
                    which inhere in the several parts. Amongst various familiar though striking
                    illustrations of this truth, it has been said, that a rose possesses the
                    property of sweetness or fragrance, a globe the property of sphericity, a
                    harpsichord the property or power of producing harmony, <hi rend="italic">aqua
                    regia</hi> the property of dissolving gold, &amp;c. though the component
                    particles of these different organized systems arc themselves totally destitute
                    of the powers and properties here enumerated.</p>
                <p>“The immaterialists, in reply, assert that it is not only false in fact, but a
                    direct contradiction, and an absolute impossibility in the nature of things,
                    that a system should possess any property which does not inhere in its component
                    parts. To assert that the power of the whole is the sum or aggregate of the
                    powers of all the parts, is an identical and self-evident proposition, the whole
                    and all the parts being terms precisely synonymous. Whoever, therefore, calls in
                    question the truth of this axiom, must maintain that the power of the whole is
                    something different from the power of all the parts, or that the power of the
                    whole is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the power of the whole.</p>
                <p>“It will be easy to demonstrate the correspondence of facts with this plain and
                    simple theory. For this purpose, it is necessary to observe, that the properties
                    of matter, or what are generally denominated such, may be divided into real and
                    nominal, which Locke and others have called primary and secondary qualities.
                    Figure, magnitude, and motion, are qualities really inherent in matter; but
                    figure, magnitude, and motion, eternally varied, can produce only different
                    combinations of figure, magnitude, and motion. There are also powefs or
                    qualities, vulgarly considered as inherent properties of matter organically
                    disposed, which are really and truly qualities or affections of the mental or
                    percipient principle, and have no existence when not perceived. Thus the
                    sweetness or fragrance of the rose, considered as mere sweetness and fragrance,
                    can be nothing but an affection of the mind; considered as a quality of the
                    rose, they can mean nothing more than a certain arrangement, configuration, and
                    motion of parts, which in some inexplicable manner produces the sensation of
                    sweetness. In this instance, therefore, the power of the whole is plainly the
                    aggregate of the powers residing in the parts, by the motion and organization of
                    which a certain effect is produced upon a foreign and percipient substance.</p>
                <p>“But a globe, we are told, possesses the property of sphericity, though not a
                    single particle amongst that infinite number of which the globe is constituted
                    is itself of a spherical form. The fallacy of this illustration is, however, as
                    easily demonstrable as that of the former. The sphericity of a globe is
                    evidently the sum or aggregate of the curvilineal or convex parts which compose
                    its surface; and the property of the whole is neither more nor less than the
                    combined properties of all its parts. No one doubts, that by new compositions or
                    arrangements of material particles possessing magnitude, figure, and motion, an
                    endless diversity of phenomena may be produced, to which it may be necessary to
                    apply new names. New names, however, do not constitute new properties; and
                    though we give to a globe the appellation of an entire system, and ascribe to it
                    the property of sphericity, we know at the same time that it is really nothing
                    more than a collection of thousands of millions of particles, actually separate
                    and distinct, arranged in that particular form which we denominate spherical.
                    But this can never be regarded as in the remotest manner analogous to the
                    creation of the power of perception, in consequence of a certain organical
                    arrangement or disposition of impercipient particles. Though sphericity is,
                    indeed, the property of the entire sphere, yet every part of the sphere, if
                    divided, possesses its share of sphericity. But if the percipient principle be
                    divided, what would become of the power of perception? A sphere equally divided
                    becomes two hemispheres; does a perception, when divided in like manner, become
                    two demi-perceptions?</p>
                <p>“The same reasonings may easily be transferred, and applied to the harpsichord.
                    Can any one be absurd enough to affirm that the power of harmony resides in the
                    harpsichord, as the power of perception does in the mind? After the utmost skill
                    of the artificer has been exerted, we discover nothing more in the harpsichord
                    than new modifications of the old properties of figure, magnitude, and motion,
                    by means of which certain vibrations are communicated to the air, which,
                    conveyed by the medium of the auditory nerve*s to the sensorium, produce the
                    sensation of harmonic sounds. These new modifications are therefore attended,
                    indeed, with new and very wonderful effects; but then those effects are produced
                    upon, and are themselves modifications of, the sentient or percipient faculty.
                    And though it is wholly incomprehensible to us in what manner these effects,
                    that is, these sensations, are produced, we well know, and perfectly comprehend,
                    that they arc not new powers belonging to any organized system of matter; that
                    they have no existence but in a mind perceiving them; and that they are far from
                    militating against that grand and universal axiom, that the power of the whole
                    is nothing more than the united powers of all the parts.</p>
                <p>“As to the last instance adduced, of the power of <hi rend="italic">aquo
                    regia</hi> to dissolve gold, though neither the spirit of salt, nor the spirit
                    of nitre of which it is compounded, separately possesses that power, it is
                    plain, that from the union of these two substances, certain new modes of
                    configuration and motion result; and the solution of gold is the consequence of
                    this new arrangement and motion of the parts. But the particles of which the
                    menstruum is composed were always possessed of the properties of figure and
                    motion; and what is styled a new property is clearly nothing more than a new
                    effect of the old properties differently modified. In a word, the advocates for
                    materialism may safely be challenged to produce, in the whole compass of nature,
                    a case which bears the least analogy to that which these instances are most
                    unphilosophically adduced to prove and to illustrate. It is an absurdity which
                    transubstantiation itself does not exceed, to maintain that a whole is in
                    reality any thing different from its component parts; and all nature rises up in
                    confutation of an assertion so monstrous and extravagant To affirm that
                    perception can arise from any combination of impercipient particles, is as truly
                    ridiculous as to affirm that a combination of the seven primary colours with the
                    four cardinal virtues may constitute a planet. It is equivalent to an assertion,
                    that an epic poem might be composed of parallelograms, cones, and triangles. In
                    a word, it is an absurdity not less real, and a little less obvious, than that
                    of the blind man who thought that the idea of a scarlet colour resembled the
                    sound of a trumpet.” <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208597"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8597-0675"/>If matter be taken in the common acceptation to be
                    a solid, extended, and inert substance, this reasoning for the immateriality of
                    the sentient principle in man appears to us to have the force of demonstration,
                    which no difficulties or partial objections, arising from our inability to
                    conceive the band of union between two such heterogeneous substances as mind and
                    body, can ever weaken, and far less overturn. But the modern materialists deny
                    that matter is either solid or inert. “All those facts,” say they, “which led
                    philosophers to suppose that matter is impenetrable to other matter, later and
                    more accurate observations have shown to be owing to something else than
                    solidity and impenetrability, viz. a power of repulsion, which fot that reason
                    they would substitute in its place. The property of attraction or repulsion,
                    says Dr Priestley, appears to me not to be properly what is imparted to matter,
                    but what really makes it to be what it is; insomuch that, without it, it would
                    be nothing at all; and as other philosophers have said, ‘ Take away solidity,
                    and matter vanishes,’ so I say, ‘ Take, away attraction and repulsion, and
                    matter vanishes.’” If this be admitted, the ingenious author hopes that we shall
                    not consider matter with that contempt and disgust with which it has generally
                    been treated, there being nothing in its real nature that can justify such
                    sentiments respecting it.</p>
                <p>We know not why, upon any hypothesis, matter should be viewed with contempt and
                    disgust. Whether penetrable or impenetrable, every consistent theist considers
                    it as one of the creatures of God, perfectly fitted to answer all the purposes
                    for which' it was intended; but were it really destitute of solidity, and
                    endowed with the powers of attraction and repulsion, we should still be obliged
                    to consider it as incapable of the powers of sensation and thought. If we have
                    any notion at all of what is meant by centres of attraction and repulsion (of
                    which indeed we are far from being confident), it appears to us to be
                    intuitively certain, that nothing can be the result of any possible combination
                    of such centres, but new and more enlarged spheres of attraction and repulsion.
                    But surely consciousness, sensation, and will, are as different from attraction
                    and repulsion, as a cube is from the sound of a trumpet, or as the sensations of
                    a felon in the agonies of death are from the attraction of the rope by which he
                    is hanged. If this be admitted, and we are persuaded that it will not be denied
                    by any man whose understanding is not clouded by an undue attachment to
                    paradoxes, the sentient principle cannot possibly be matter; for if, when the
                    powers of attraction and repulsion are taken away, matter vanishes, and if
                    consciousness and sensation are not attraction and repulsion, it is not more
                    evident that three and two are not nine, than that the substance which attracts
                    and repels cannot be that which is conscious and percipient.</p>
                <p>Locke, who was certainly no materialist, as he repeatedly affirmed, and indeed
                    demonstrated, that thought could never be the result of any combinations of
                    figure, magnitude, and motion, Was nevertheless of opinion that God by his
                    almighty power might endow some systems of matter with the faculties of thinking
                    and willing. It is always with reluctance that we controvert the opinions of so
                    great a man; and it is with some degree of horror that we venture in any case to
                    call in question the power of Omnipotence. But Omnipotence itself cannot work
                    contradictions; and it appears to us nothing short of a contradiction to suppose
                    the individual power of perception inhering in a system which is itself extended
                    and made up of a number of separate and distinct substances. For let us suppose
                    such a system to be six feet long, three feet broad, and two feet deep (and we
                    may as well suppose a system of these dimensions to be percipient as one that is
                    smaller), then it is plain that every idea must be extended, and that part of it
                    must be in one place and part in another. If so, the idea of a square inch will
                    be six feet long, three feet broad, and two feet deep; and, what is still harder
                    to be digested, the several parts of this idea will be at a great distance from
                    each other, without any bond of union amongst them. The being which apprehends
                    one extremity of the idea is, by the supposition, six feet distant from the
                    being which apprehends the other extremity; and although these two distinct
                    beings belong to one system, they are not only separable, but actually separated
                    from each other, as all the particles of matter are. What is it, then, that
                    apprehends as one the whole of this extended idea? Part of it may be apprehended
                    by one particle of matter, and part of it by another; and there is nothing which
                    apprehends or can apprehend the whole. Perhaps it will be said, that the power
                    of apprehension is not divided into parts, but is the power of the one system,
                    and therefore apprehends at once the whole idea. But a power ór faculty cannot
                    be separated from its subject, power which inheres in nothing being confessedly
                    impossible; and a material system is not one subject in which any individual
                    power or faculty can inhere. There must, therefore, be united to the system some
                    one being, which is the subject of thought, and which is unextended as well as
                    indivisible. This, we say, follows undeniably. For let us suppose that an
                    extended being without separate parts is possible, and that such a being is
                    percipient; it is obvious that the whole of any one of its perceptions could not
                    be in one place. Now, although we should grant to Dr Priestley and other
                    materialists that every idea of an extended substance has itself three
                    dimensions, and is incorporated and commensurate with the whole percipient
                    system; what, upon this supposition, shall we think of consciousness and of the
                    perception of truth? Is consciousness or truth extended? If so, one side or
                    superficies of consciousness, or of a truth, may be greater or less than
                    another, above or below, to the right or to the left; and it will be very proper
                    and philosophical to speak of the length, breadth, and depth, of consciousness
                    or of truth. But surely to talk of the place or the extension of these things,
                    is as absurd as to talk of the colour of sound, or the sound of a triangle; and
                    we might as well say that consciousness is green or red, as that it is an ell or
                    an inch long; and that truth is blue, as that it has three dimensions.</p>
                <p>This reasoning is somewhat differently stated by Cudworth, who observes, that if
                    the soul be an extended substance, “it must of necessity be either a physical
                    point (that is, the least extension possible, if there be any such least
                    extension), or else it must consist of more such physical points joined
                    together. As to the former of these, it is impossible that one single atom, or
                    smallest point of extension, should be able to perceive distinctly all the
                    variety of things, that is, take notice of all the distinct and different parts
                    of an extended object, and have a description or delineation of the whole of
                    them upon itself (for that would be to make it the least, and not the least,
                    possible extension at the same time). Besides, to suppose every soul to be but
                    one physical point, or the smallest possible extension, is to suppose such an
                    essential difference in matter or extension, as that some of the points thereof
                    should be naturally devoid of all life, sense, and understanding; and others,
                    again, naturally sensitive and rational. And evert should this absurdity be
                    admitted, it would yet be utterly inconceivable hoav there should be one, and
                    but one, sensitive and rational atom in every man; how this atom of so small
                    dimensions should actuate the whole system, and how it should constantly remain
                    the same from infancy to old age, whilst all the other parts of the system
                    transpire perpetually, and are succeeded by new matter.</p>
                <p>“But if, according to the second hypothesis, souls be extended substances,
                    consisting of many points one without another, and all concurring in every
                    sensation, then must every one of these points perceive either a point only of
                    the object, or else the whole. Now, if every point of the ex <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208610" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8610-0676"/>tended soul perceives only a
                    point of the object, then there is no one thing in us that perceives the whole,
                    or that can compare one part of the object with another. On the other hand, if
                    every point of the extended soul perceive the whole object at once, then would
                    there be innumerable perceptions of the same object in every sensation, as many,
                    indeed, as there are points in the extended soul. And from both these
                    suppositions it would alike follow that no man is one single percipient or
                    person, but that in every man there are innumerable distinct percipients or
                    persons; a conclusion directly contrary to the infallible evidence of
                    consciousness.”</p>
                <p>Cogent as these arguments for the immateriality of the sentient principle appear
                    to be, they have nevertheless been treated with the most sovereign contempt by a
                    writer who professes to be a disciple of Dr Priestley’s, but who seems not to
                    have learned the modesty or the candour of his master. Dr Priestley labours to
                    prove, that to account for the phenomena of perception and volition, &amp;c. it
                    is not necessary to suppose an immaterial principle in man. Mr Cooper with
                    greater boldness affirms, and undertakes to demonstrate, with all the parade of
                    mathematical precision, that such a principle is impossible.<note

                    and Political, vol. i.</p></note> Though the authority of this philosopher in
                    such inquiries as depend not immediately upon the retort and the furnace, is
                    certainly not great, he yet utters his dogmas with such confidence, that it may
                    not be improper to examine the chief arguments upon which they rest.</p>
                <p>“Suppose,” says he, “the soul to have no common property with matter, then no
                    thing can act upon any other but by means of some common property. Of this we
                    have not only all the proof that induction of known and acknowledged cases can
                    furnish, but that additional proof also which arises from the impossibility of
                    conceiving how the opposite proposition can be true. But by the supposition the
                    soul has no property in common with matter, and therefore the soul cannot act
                    upon matter. But by the supposition of every system of immaterialism (except
                    those of Malebranche, Berkeley, and Leibnitz), it is deemed an essential
                    property of the soul that it acts upon the body, or upon matter; therefore the
                    soul can and cannot act upon matter at the same time, and in the same respect.
                    But this is a contradiction in terms; and as two contradictions cannot both be
                    true at the same time, the supposition of the existence of an immaterial soul
                    cannot be true; that is, the soul does not exist.”</p>
                <p>This reasoning, as the reader will observe, is carried on with all the pomp of
                    mode and figure. The propositions hang upon each other like the several steps of
                    an algebraical process; but as in such processes one error unwarily admitted
                    produces a false result, so in demonstrative reasonings one unsound argument
                    admitted into the premises is necessarily productive of error in the conclusion.
                    λVhen the author affirms, “that no thing can act upon any other but by means of
                    some common property,” he affirms, without the shadow of proof, what is
                    certainly not self-evident. He says, indeed, that of this we have all the proof
                    that induction of known and acknowledged cases can furnish; but unless
                    consciousness be calculated to deceive us, this is unquestionably a mistake.
                    Matter, he repeatedly affirms, has no other properties than those of attraction
                    and repulsion; but a man moves his arm by a mere energy of will, and, therefore,
                    according to this demonstrator, an energy of will must be either material
                    attraction or material repulsion. If so, it is reasonable to conclude that when
                    a man draws his hand towards his head, the centre of his brain exerts its power
                    of attraction; and that when he extends his arm at full length before him, the
                    same centre exerts its power of repulsion. We beg pardon of our readers for
                    detaining them one moment upon such absurdities as these; yet we cannot dismiss
                    the argument without taking the liberty to ask our all-knowing author, how it
                    comes to pass that the same centre sometimes attracts and sometimes repels the
                    same substance at the same distance; nay, that it both attracts and repels
                    substances of the same kind, at equal distances, and at the very same instant of
                    time? This must be the case when a man puts one hand to his head and thrusts
                    another from him; and, therefore, if these operations be the effect of
                    attraction and repulsion, it must be of attraction and repulsion to which
                    induction of known and acknowledged cases furnishes nothing similar or
                    analogous, that is, of such attraction and repulsion as, according to Mr
                    Cooper’s mode of reasoning, does not exist. The truth is, that we are not more
                    certain that we ourselves exist, than that an energy of will is neither
                    attraction nor repulsion; and, therefore, unless all matter be endued with will,
                    it is undeniable that, whatever be the substance of the soul, one thing acts
                    upon another by a property not common to them both. In what manner it thus acts,
                    we pretend not to know; but our ignorance of the manner of any operation is no
                    argument against the reality of the operation itself, when we have for it the
                    evidence of consciousness and daily experience; and when the author shall have
                    explained to general satisfaction how material centres attract and repel each
                    other at a distance, we shall undertake to explain how one thing acts upon
                    another with which it has no common properties.</p>
                <p>Suspicious, as it should seem, that this reasoning has not the complete force of
                    mathematical demonstration, the author supports his opinion by other arguments.
                    “Whatever we know,” says he, “we∖know by means of its properties, nor do we in
                    any case whatever certainly know any thing but these; and we infer in all cases
                    the existence of any thing which we suppose to exist from the existence of its
                    properties. In short, our idea of any thing is made up of a combination of our
                    ideas of its properties. Gold is heavy, ductile, tenacious, opaque, yellow,
                    soluble in <hi rend="italic">aqua regia,</hi> &amp;c. Now, let any one suppose
                    for an instant that gold is deprived of all these, and becomes neither heavy,
                    nor ductile, tenacious, opaque, yellow, soluble, &amp;c.; what remains? will it
                    be gold? Certainly not. If it have other properties, it is another substance. If
                    it have no properties remaining, it is nothing. For nothing is that which hath
                    no properties. Therefore, if any thing lose all its properties, it becomes
                    nothing; that is, it loses its existence. Now the existence of the soul is
                    inferred, like the existence of every thing else, from its supposed properties,
                    which are the phenomena of thinking, such as perception, recollection, judgment,
                    and volition. But in all cases of perfect sleep, of the operation of a strong
                    narcotic, of apoplexy, of swooning, of drowning where the vital powers are not
                    extinguished, of the effects of a violent blow on the back part of the bead, and
                    all other leipothymic affections, there is neither perception, recollection,
                    judgment, nor volition; that is, all the properties of the soul are gone, are
                    extinguished. Therefore, the soul itself loses its existence for the time. If
                    any man shall say, that these properties are only suspended for the time, I
                    would desire him to examine what idea he annexes to this suspension; whether it
                    be not neither more nor less than that they are made not to exist for the time.
                    Either no more is meant, or it is contradictory to matter of fact; and,
                    moreover, if more be meant, it may easily be perceived to involve the archetypal
                    existence of abstract ideas, and to contradict the axiom <hi rend="italic"
                    >impossibile</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">idem esse</hi><hi

                    facs="nls:194208623" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8623-0677"/>For the benefit of
                    short-sighted inquirers, it is to be wished that the author had favoured the
                    public with this proof, which might have been so easily brought forward; for we
                    can discern no connection whatever between the suspension of the exercise of the
                    powers of the mind, and the archetypal existence of abstract ideas, or the
                    absurd proposition that it is possible for the same thing to be and not to be.
                    We think, however, that we understand enough of this reasoning which he has
                    given us, to be able to pronounce with some confidence that it is nothing to the
                    purpose. For, in the first place, we beg leave to observe, that between the
                    properties of gold and the powers of thinking, &amp;c. there is no similarity;
                    and that what may be true when affirmed of the one, may be false when affirmed
                    of the other. The powers of the mind are all more or less active; but the
                    enumerated properties of gold are all passive. We know by the most complete of
                    all evidence, that the exercise of power may be suspended, and yet the power
                    itself remain unimpaired; but to talk of the suspension of the energies of what
                    was never energetic, if it be not to contradict the axiom, <hi rend="italic"
                    >impossibile</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">idem esse</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">non esse,</hi> is certainly to employ
                    words which have no meaning. Yet even this argument from the properties of gold
                    might have led the author to suspect that something else may be meant by the
                    suspension of the exercise of powers, than that those powers are made not to
                    exist for the time. In a room perfectly dark, gold is not yellow; but does it
                    lose any of its essential properties, and become a different substance, merely
                    by being carried from light to darkness? Is a man, whilst in a dark room,
                    deprived of the faculty of sight, and is one of the powers of his mind made not
                    to exist for the time? The author will not affirm that either of these events
                    takes place. He will tell us that gold exhibits not its yellow appearance merely
                    because the proper medium of light passes not from it to. the eye of the
                    percipient, and that it is only for want of the same medium that nothing is seen
                    by us in perfect darkness. Here, then, by his own confession, is a power of the
                    mind, and a property of an external object, both suspended in their energies,
                    without being annihilated; and no proof has yet been brought that all the powers
                    of the mind may not in the same manner be suspended in their energies without
                    being made not to exist. As light is necessary to vision, but is not itself
                    either the thing which sees or the thing which is seen, so may the brain be
                    necessary to the phenomena of thinking, without being either that which thinks,
                    or that which is thought upon; and as actual vision ccases when light is
                    withdrawn, although the eye and the object both continue to exist, so may the
                    energy of thinking cease when the brain is rendered unfit for its usual office,
                    although the being which thinks, and the power of thought, continue to exist,
                    and to exist unimpaired. That this is actually the case, every man must be
                    convinced who believes that in thinking he exerts the same powers to-day which
                    he exerted yesterday; and therefore our author’s second demonstration of the
                    nonexistence of mind is, like his first, founded upon assertions which cannot be
                    granted.</p>
                <p>Another of these pretended demonstrations is as follows: “If the soul exist at
                    all, it must exist somewhere; for it is impossible to frame to one’s self an
                    idea of any thing existing, which exists nowhere. But if the soul exist
                    somewhere, by the terms it occupies space, and therefore is extended; but
                    whatever has extension, has figure in consequence thereof. The soul, then, if it
                    exist, hath the properties of extension and figure in common with matter.
                    Moreover, by the supposition of every immaterial hypothesis (except those of
                    Malebranche, Berkeley, and Leibnitz), it acts upon body, or upon matter; that
                    is, it attracts and repels, and is attracted and repelled, for there is no
                    conceivable affection of matter but what is founded on its properties of
                    attraction and repulsion; and if it be attracted and repelled, its re-action
                    must be attraction and repulsion. The soul, then, has the properties of
                    extension, figure, attraction, and repulsion, or solidity. But these comprise
                    every property which matter, as such, has ever been supposed to possess.
                    Therefore the soul is matter, or material. But by the supposition it is
                    immaterial; therefore it does not exist. For nothing can exist whose existence
                    implies a contradiction.”</p>
                <p>Mr Cooper, we see, still proceeds in the direct road of mathematical
                    demonstration; but in the present instance we beg leave to stop him in the very
                    beginning of his course, and to ask him <hi rend="italic">whère</hi> the
                    universe exists? When he shall have given such an answer to this question as men
                    of common sense may be able to comprehend, we may perhaps attempt to tell him
                    where an un extended soul exists. If this demonstration be not a collection of
                    words without meaning, the existence of space as a real thing is taken for
                    granted. Space, therefore, has extension, and of course figure; but we believe
                    Mr Cooper will find some difficulty in ascertaining the figure of infinite
                    space. The mind certainly acts upon body. For this we have the evidence of
                    consciousness and experience; but we have no evidence whatever that it must
                    therefore attract and repel, and be attracted and repelled. It has been already
                    observed, that the mind, whatever be its substance, acts upon the body by
                    energies of will. What these are, every man knows with the utmost certainty and
                    precision; whilst we may venture to assert, that no man knows precisely what
                    corpuscular attraction and repulsion are, even supnposig the existence of such
                    powers to be possible. When we speak of attraction and repulsion, we have some
                    obscure notion of bodies acting upon each other at a distance; and this is all
                    that we know of the matter. But when we think of an energy of the human will,
                    the idea of distance neither enters nor can enter into our notion of such an
                    energy. These are facts which we pretend not to prove by a mathematical or a
                    chemical process. Every man must be convinced of their truth by evidence more
                    complete than any proof, viz. immediate consciousness of his own thoughts and
                    volitions. This being the case, we may turn Mr Cooper’s artillery against
                    himself, and, because mind acts upon body by powers different from attraction
                    and repulsion, argue that body neither attracts nor repels; and were it true, as
                    it is certainly false, that one thing could not act upon another but by means of
                    some property common to both, we might infer that every atom of matter is
                    endowed with the powers of volition and, intelligence, and, by consequence, that
                    every man is not one but ten thousand conscious beings; a conclusion which our
                    philosopher seems not inclined to admit.</p>
                <p>Having finished his <hi rend="italic">demonstrations,</hi> the author states
                    other objections to the doctrine of immaterialism, which, as they are not his
                    own, nor new, have greater weight. “It appears no more than reasonable,” says
                    he, “that if the doctrine of materialism be rejected as inadequate to explain
                    the phenomena, these latter should at least be explained in some manner or other
                    better upon the <hi rend="italic">substituted</hi> than <hi rend="italic"
                    >rejected</hi> hypothesis; so that it is reasonable to require of an
                    immaterialist that his supposition of a distinct soul should explain the <hi
                    rend="italic">rationale</hi> of the phenomena of thinking. But, strange to say,
                    so far from attempting to explain these phenomena on the immaterial hypothesis,
                    it is acknowledged on all hands, that, even on this hypothesis, the phenomena
                    are inexplicable.” This objection it would certainly be no difficult task to
                    obviate; but from that trouble, small as it is, we are happily exempted by the
                    objector himself. “I would have it understood,” says he, “that no materialist
                    ever undertook to say how perception results from our organization. What a
                    materialist undertakes to assert is, that perception, whatever it be, or however
                    it results from, does actually result from our organization.” According to Mr
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208636" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8636-0678"/>Cooper, then,
                    the <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi> of thinking is equally inexplicable by
                    materialists and immaterialists; and the truth is, that we know the <hi
                    rend="italic">rationale</hi> of hardly any one operation in nature. W e see that
                    the stroke of a racket produces motion in a billiard ball; but how it does so,
                    we believe no man can say. Of the fact, however, we are certain; and we know
                    that the motion is produced by some power, about the effects of which we can
                    reason with precision. In like manner we know with the utmost certainty, that we
                    ourselves possess the powers of perception and volition; and that these powers
                    cannot be conceived as either an ell or an inch in length. How they resdlt from
                    the mutual agency of an immaterial and material substance upon each other, we
                    are indeed profoundly ignorant; but that such is the fact, and that they are not
                    the result of mere organization, we must necessarily believe, so long as it is
                    true that the power of the entire system is nothing more than the sum or
                    aggregate of the powers of all its parts. The immaterial hypothesis contains in
                    it something inexplicable by man. The material hypothesis likewise contains, by
                    the confession of its advocates, something that is equally inexplicable; and is,
                    besides, burdened with this glaring contradiction, that the whole is something
                    different from all its parts. It is therefore no “singular phenomenon in
                    literary history, that one hypothesis should be rejected as inadequate to
                    account for appearances, and that the hypothesis substituted should, even by the
                    acknowledgment of its abettors, be such as not only not to explain the <hi
                    rend="italic">rationale</hi> of the appearances, but, from the nature of it, to
                    preclude all hopes of such an explanation.” This is exactly the case with
                    respect to a <hi rend="italic">vacuum</hi> in astronomy. That hypothesis does
                    not in the least tend to explain the <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi> of the
                    motions of the planets; but yet it must be admitted in preference to a <hi
                    rend="italic">plenum,</hi> because upon this last hypothesis motion is
                    impossible.</p>
                <p>“Supposing the existence of the soul, it is an unfortunate circumstance,” says Mr
                    Cooper, “that we cannot properly assert positively any thing of it at all. Were
                    this the case, it would indeed be a very unfortunate circumstance; but can we
                    not assert positively as many things of the soul as we can of the body? Can we
                    not say with as much propriety and certainty, that the soul has the powers of
                    perception and volition, &amp;c. as that the body is solid and extended, or as
                    that matter has the powers of attraction and repulsion ?” We know perfectly what
                    perception and volition are, though we cannot have ideas or mental images of
                    them; and if our author knows what attraction and repulsion are, we believe he
                    will not pretend to have ideas of them entirely abstracted from their objects.
                    “But granting the soul’s existence, it may be asked,” says he, “of what use is
                    an hypothesis of which no more can be asserted than its existence?” We have just
                    observed that much more can be asserted of the soul than its existence, viz.
                    that it is something of which perception and will are properties; and he himself
                    asserts nothing of matter, but that it is something of which attraction and
                    repulsion are properties.</p>
                <p>“This soul, of which these gentlemen (the immaterialists) are conscious, is
                    immaterial essentially. Now I deny,” says our author, “that we can have any idea
                    at all of a substance purely immaterial.” He elsewhere says, that nothing can
                    exist which is not extended, or that extension is inseparable from our notions
                    of existence. Taking the word <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> in its proper sense,
                    to denote that appearance which external objects make in the imagination, it is
                    certainly true that we can have no idea of an immaterial substance; but neither
                    have we, in that sense, any idea of matter abstracted from its qualities. Has Mr
                    Cooper any idea of that which attracts and repels, or of attraction and
                    repulsion, abstracted from their objects? He may perhaps have, although we have
                    not very adequate ideas of bodies acting upon each other at a distance; but as
                    he takes the liberty to substitute assertions for arguments, we beg leave in our
                    turn to assert, that those ideas neither are, nor can be, more, clear and
                    adequate than our notion of perception, consciousness, and will, united in one
                    being.</p>
                <p>That extension is no otherwise inseparable from our notions of existence than by
                    the power of an early and perpetual association, is evident from this
                    circumstance, that, had we never possessed the senses of sight and touch, we
                    never could have acquired any idea at all of extension. No man who has thought
                    on the subject will venture to affirm, that it is absolutely impossible for an
                    intelligent being to exist with no other senses than those of smell, taste, and
                    hearing. Now it is obvious that such a being must acquire some notion of
                    existence from his own consciousness. But into that notion extension could not
                    possibly enter; for neither sounds, tastes, smells, nor consciousness, are
                    extended; and it is a fundamental article of the materialist’s creed, that all
                    our ideas are relicts of sensation. Since, then, existence may be conceived
                    without extension, it may be inferred that they are not inseparable from each
                    other; and since cogitation cannot be conceived with extension, we may
                    reasonably conclude, that the being which thinks is not extended.</p>
                <p>Mr Cooper, indeed, with his master, talks of extended ideas and extended
                    thoughts. But we must assert, in the words of Cudworth, that “we cannot conceive
                    a thought to be of such a certain length, breadth, and thickness, measurable by
                    inches, feet, and yards; that we cannot conceive the half, or third, or
                    twentieth part of a thought; and that we cannot conceive every thought to be of
                    some determinate figure, such as round or angular, spherical, cubical,
                    cylindrical, or the like. Whereas if extension were inseparable from existence,
                    thoughts must either be mere nonentities, or extended into length, breadth, and
                    thickness; and consequently all truths in us being nothing but complex thoughts,
                    must be long, broad, and thick, and of some determinate figure. The same must
                    likewise be affirmed of volitions, appetites, and passions, and of all other
                    things belonging to cogitative beings, such as knowledge and ignorance, wisdom
                    and folly, virtue and vice, that these are either all of them absolute
                    nonentities, or else extended into three dimensions, and measurable not only by
                    inches and feet, but also by solid measures, such as pints and quarts. But if
                    this be absurd, and if these things belonging to soul and mind, though doubtless
                    as great realities at least as the things which belong to body, be unextended,
                    then must the substances of souls or minds be themselves unextended, according
                    to that of Plotinus, νους où <hi rend="italic">διαστuς α&lt;ρ</hi> ’ iαuπoυ, and
                    therefore the human soul cannot be material.”</p>
                <p>Mr Cooper employs many other arguments to prove the materiality of the sentient
                    principle in man; but the force of them extends no farther than to make it in
                    the highest degree probable, that the mind cannot exert its faculties except in
                    union with some organized corporeal system. This is an opinion which we do not
                    feel ourselves inclined to controvert; and therefore we shall not make any
                    particular remarks upon that part of our author’s reasonings. That an immaterial
                    and indiscerptible being, such as the soul, is not liable to be dissolved with
                    the body, is a fact which cannot be controverted; for that which has no parts
                    can perish only by annihilation; and of annihilation the annals of the world
                    afford no instance. That an immaterial being, endowed with the powers of
                    perception and volition, &amp;c. may be capable of exerting these powers in a
                    state of separation from all body, and that at least one immaterial Being does
                    actually so exert them, or other powers analogous to them, are truths which no
                    man whose arrogance does not surpass his judgment will venture to deny; but the
                    question at present between the most rigid immaterialists and their <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194208649" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8649-0679"/> opponents is,
                    whether there be ground to think that the human soul is such a being?</p>
                <p>Now, when Mr Baxter and his followers confidently affirm, that human perception
                    must necessarily subsist after the dissolution of the present mortal and
                    perishable system, and that the soul, when disencumbered of all body, will have
                    its faculties greatly enlarged, they affirm what to us appears incapable of
                    proof. That a disembodied soul may perceive, and think, and act, and that its
                    powers of intellection may have a wider range than when they were circumscribed
                    by a corporeal system, which permitted their action upon external objects only
                    through five organs of sense, is certainly possible; and the argument by which
                    the materialists pretend to prove that it is not possible, is one of the most
                    contemptible sophisms that ever disgraced the history of philosophy. To affirm,
                    that because our intellectual powers, Jn their embodied state, seem to decay
                    with the system to which they are united, the mind, when set free, must
                    therefore have no powers at all, is equally absurd as to say, that because a man
                    shut up in a room which has but one window sees objects less and less distinctly
                    as the glass becomes more and more dimmed, he must in the open air be deprived
                    of the power of vision. But because the human soul may, for any thing that we
                    see to the contrary, subsist, and think, and act, in a separate state, it does
                    not therefore necessarily follow that it will do so; and every thing that we
                    know of its nature and its energies leads us to think, that without some kind of
                    body by which to act as by an instrument, all its powers would continue dormant.
                    There is not the shadow of a reason to supposé that it existed and was conscious
                    in a prior state; and as its memory at present unquestionably depends upon the
                    state of the brain, there is all the evidence of which the case will admit, that
                    if it should subsist in a future state divested of all body, though it might be
                    endowed with new and enlarged powers of perception, it could have no
                    recollection of what it did and suffered in this world, and therefore would not
                    be a fit object either of reward or of punishment.</p>
                <p>This consideration has compelled may thinking men, both Pagans and Christians, to
                    suppose that at death the soul carries with it a fine material vehicle, which is
                    its immediate sensorium in this world, and continues to be the seat of its
                    recollection in the next. Such, as we have seen, was the opinion of Mr Wollaston
                    and Dr Hartley; it was likewise the opinion of Cudworth and Locke, who held that
                    the Supreme Being alone is the only mind wholly separated from matter; and it is
                    an opinion which even Dr Clarke, one of the ablest advocates for immaterialism,
                    would not venture positively to deny. Nor is this opinion peculiar to a few
                    moderns. Cudworth, after giving a vast number of quotations from Pythagoreans
                    and Platonists, which prove to a demonstration that they held the Deity to be
                    the only mind which perceives and acts without the instrumentality of matter,
                    observes, “From what hath been said, it appeareth that the most ancient asser
                    tors of the incorporeity and immortality of the human soul yet supposed it to be
                    always conjoined with some body.” Thus Hierocles plainly: “The rational nature
                    having always a kindred body, so proceeded from the demiurgus, that neither
                    itself is body, nor yet can it be without body; but although itself be
                    incorporeal, yet its whole form is terminated in a body.” Agreeably to this, the
                    definition which he gives of a man is, “a rational soul, together with a kindred
                    immortal body ;” and he affirms, that our present animated terrestrial body, or
                    mortal man, is nothing but s'ιδωλov αh)gωnou, “the image of the true man,” or an
                    accession from which it may be separated. Neither does he affirm this only of
                    human souls, but also of all other rational beings whatsoever below the Supreme
                    Deity, that they always naturally actuate some body.</p>
                <p>Wherefore a demon or angel, which by Hierocles are used as synonymous words, is
                    also defined by him, after the <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> same manner, to be
                    “a rational soul, together with a lucid* body.” And accordingly, Proclus upon
                    Plato’s Timaeus affirms, “That every demon, superior to human souls, hath both
                    an intellectual soul and an ethereal vehicle, the entireness thereof being made
                    up or compounded of these two things.” So that there is hardly any other
                    difference between demons or angels and men, according to these philosophers,
                    but only this, that the former are lapsable into aerial bodies only, and no
                    further; but the latter into terrestrial also. Now, Hierocles positively affirms
                    this to have been the true cabbala and genuine doctrine of the ancient
                    Pythagoreans, entertained afterwards by Plato: “And this was the doctrine of the
                    Pythagoreans, which Plato afterwards declared; he resembling every soul both
                    human and divine (that is, in our modern language, every created rational being)
                    to a winged chariot and a driver or charioteer both together ;” meaning by the
                    chariot an animated body, and by the charioteer the incorporeal soul actuating
                    it.</p>
                <p>That this Pythagorean opinion of the Deity’s being the only mind which thinks and
                    acts without material organs was very generally received by the ancient
                    Christians, might be proved by a thousand quotations. We shall content ourselves
                    with producing two from the learned Origen: “Solius Dei,” says this philosophic
                    father of the church, “id est, Patris, Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, naturae id
                    proprium est, ut sine materiali substantia, et absque ulla corporeae adjectionis
                    societate, intelligatur subsistere.” “Materialem substantiam opinione quidem et
                    intellectu solum separari, a naturis rationalibus, et pro ipsis, vel post ipsas
                    affectam videri; sed nunquam sine ipsa eas vel vixisse, vel vivere: solius
                    namque Trinitatis incorporea vita exis-tere putabitur.” Should Mr Cooper and his
                    friends ask, What is the use of a soul which cannot act without the
                    instrumentality of matter? or why we should suppose the existence of such a
                    substance? we beg leave, in our turn, to inquire of these gentlemen, What is the
                    use of a brain which cannot see without eyes? and why they should suppose all
                    our sensations to terminate in such an internal system, since the vulgar
                    certainly suppose their sensations to subsist in their respective organs? How
                    this ancient notion, which makes body so essential a part of man, is consistent
                    with the immortality of the human soul, we shall inquire in a subsequent
                    chapter; in which we shall endeavour to ascertain what kind of immortality we
                    have reason to expect, and upon what evidence our expectation must rest.
                    Previously to this inquiry, however, it is necessary to enter upon another,
                    which is of the first importance, and which every materialist has endeavoured to
                    perplex; we mean that which concerns personal identity; for if, as has been
                    often said, no man is the same person two days successively, it is of but little
                    importance to us whether the soul be mortal or immortal.</p>
                <p>c∏AP. III.—OF PERSONAL IDENTITY.</p>
                <p>Whether we are to exist in a future state, as it is the most important question
                    which can possibly be asked, so it is the most intelligible one which can be
                    expressed in language. Vet strange perplexities have been raised about the
                    meaning of that identity or sameness of person which is implied in the notion of
                    our living now and hereafter, or indeed in any two successive moments; and the
                    solution of these difficulties has been stranger than even the difficulties
                    themselves. To repeat all that has been said on the subject would swell this
                    chapter to a disproportionate bulk. We shall therefore content ourselves with
                    laying before our readers the sentiments of Bishop Butler, and the fancies<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194208662" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8662-0680"/> and
                    demonstrations of the philosopher of Manchester. We are induced to adopt this
                    course, because we think that the illustrious Bishop of Durham has exhausted the
                    subject, by stating fairly the opinions which he controverts, and by
                    establishing his own upon a foundation which cannot be shaken, and which are
                    certainly not injured by the objections of Mr Cooper.</p>
                <p>“When it is asked,” says this philosophical prelate,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dissertation first, subjoined to the Analogy
                    of Religion, Natural and Revealed.</p></note> “in what personal identity
                    consists? the answer should be the same as if it were asked in what consists
                    similitude or equality? that all attempts to define would but perplex it. Yet
                    there is no difficulty at all in ascertaining the idea or notion: For as, upon
                    two triangles being compared or viewed together, there arises to the mind the
                    notion of similitude, or upon twice two and four the notion of equality; so
                    likewise, upon comparing the consciousness of one’s self or one’s own existence
                    in any two moments, there as immediately arises to the mind the notion of
                    personal identity. And as the two former comparisons not only give us the
                    notions of similitude and equality, but also show us that two triangles are
                    similar, and that twice two and four are equal; so the latter comparison not
                    only gives us the notion of personal identity, but also shows us the identity of
                    ourselves in these two moments, the present, suppose, and that immediately past,
                    or the present and that a month, a year, or twenty years past. In other words,
                    by reflecting upon that which is myself now, and that which was myself twenty
                    years ago, I discern they are not two, but one and the same self.</p>
                <p>“But though consciousness of what is present and remembrance of what is past do
                    thus ascertain our personal identity to ourselves, yet, to say that remembrance
                    makes personal identity, or is necessary to our being the same persons, is to
                    say that a person has not existed a single moment, nor done one action, but what
                    he can remember, indeed none but what he reflects upon. And one should really
                    think it self-evident, that consciousness of personal identity presupposes, and
                    therefore cannot constitute, personal identity, any more than knowledge, in any
                    other ease, can constitute truth, which it presupposes.</p>
                <p>“The inquiry, what makes vegetables the same in the common acceptation of the
                    word, does not appear to have any relation to this of personal identity; because
                    the word <hi rend="italic">same,</hi> when applied to them and to person, is not
                    only applied to different subjects, but is also used in different senses. When a
                    man swears to the same tree, as having stood fifty years in the same place, he
                    means only the same as to all the purposes-of property and uses of common life,
                    and not that the tree has been all that time the same in the strict
                    philosophical sense of the word; for he does not know whether any one particle
                    of the present tree be the same with any one particle of the tree which stood in
                    the same place fifty years ago. And if they have not one common particle of
                    matter, they cannot be the same tree in the proper and philosophie sense of the
                    word <hi rend="italic">same</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it being evidently a
                    contradiction in terms to say they are, when no part of their substance and no
                    one of their properties is the same; no part of their substance, by the
                    supposition; no one of their properties, because it is allowed that the same
                    property cannot be transferred from one substance to another; and, therefore,
                    when we say that the identity or sameness of a plant consists in a continuation
                    of the same life, communicated under the same organization to a number of
                    particles of matter, whether the same or not, the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >same,</hi> when applied to life and to organization, cannot possibly be
                    understood to signify what it signifies in this very sentence, when applied to
                    matter. In a loose and popular sense, then, the life, and the organization, and
                    the plant, are justly said to be the same, notwithstanding the perpetual change
                    of the parts. But, in a strict and philosophical manner of speech, no man, no
                    being, no mode of being, no any thing, can be the same with that with which it
                    has indeed nothing the same. Now sameness is used in this latter sense when
                    applied to persons. The identity of these, therefore, cannot subsist with
                    diversity of substance.</p>
                <p>“The thing here considered, and demonstratively, as I think, determined, is
                    proposed by Mr Locke in these words: Whether it (that is, the same self or
                    person) be the same identical substance? And he has suggested what is a much
                    better answer to the question than that which he gives it in form; for he
                    defines a person a thinking intelligent being, &amp;c. and personal identity,
                    the sameness of a rational being; and then the question is, whether the same
                    rational being is the same substance? which needs no answer; because being and
                    substance are in this place synonymous terms. The ground of the doubt, whether
                    the same person be the same substance, is said to be this, that the
                    consciousness of our own existence in youth and in old age, or in any two joint
                    successive moments, is not the same individual action, that is, not the same
                    consciousness, but different successive consciousnesses. Now it is strange that
                    this should have occasioned such perplexities; for it is surely conceivable that
                    a person may have a capacity of knowing some object or other to be the same now
                    which it was when he contemplated it formerly; yet in this case, where, by the
                    supposition, the object is perceived to be the same, the perception of it in any
                    two moments cannot be one and the same perception. And thus, though the
                    successive consciousnesses which we have of our own existence are not the same,
                    yet are they consciousnesses of one and the same thing or object; of the same
                    person, self, or living agent. The person of whose existence the consciousness
                    is felt now, and was felt an hour or a year ago, is discerned to be, not two
                    persons, but one and the same person; and therefore is one and the same.</p>
                <p>“Mr Locke’s observations upon this subject appear hasty; and he seems to profess
                    himself dissatisfied with the suppositions which he has made relating to it. But
                    some of those hasty observations have been carried to a strange length by
                    others, whose notion, when traced and examined to the bottom, amounts, I think,
                    to this: ‘ That personality is not a permanent, but a transient thing; that it
                    lives and dies, begins and ends, continually; that no one can anymore remain one
                    and the same person two moments together, than two successive moments can be one
                    and the same moment; that our substance is indeed continually changing; but
                    whether this be so or not, is, it seems, nothing to the purpose, since it is not
                    substance, but consciousness alone, which constitutes personality; which
                    consciousness, being successive, cannot be the same in any two moments, nor
                    consequently the personality constituted by it.”<note anchored="true"

                    must follow, that it is a fallacy upon ourselves to charge our present selves
                    with any thing we did, or to imagine our present selves interested in any thing
                    which befell us yesterday; or that our present self will be interested in what
                    will befall us to-morrow; since our present self is not in reality the same with
                    the self of yesterday, but another self or person coming in its stead, and
                    mistaken for it; to which another self will succeed to-morrow. This, we say,
                    must follow; for if the self or person of to-day and that of to-morrow are not
                    the same, but only similar persons, the person of to-day is really no more
                    interested in what will befall the person of to-morrow, than in what will befall
                    any other person. It may be thought, perhaps, that this is not <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208675" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8675-0681"/>a just representation of the
                    opinion we are speaking of, because those who maintain it allow that a person is
                    the same as far back as his remembrance reaches; and indeed they employ the
                    words identity and same person, nor will language permit these words to be laid
                    aside. But they cannot, consistently with themselves, mean that the person is
                    really the same; for it is self-evident, that the personality cannot be really
                    the same, if, as they expressly assert, that in which it consists is not the
                    same. “And as, consistently with themselves, they cannot,” says Butler, “so I
                    think it appears they do not, mean that the person is really the same, but only
                    that he is so in a fictitious sense, in such a sense only as they assert; for
                    this they do assert, that any number of persons whatever may be the same person.
                    The bare unfolding this notion, and laying it thus naked and open, seems the
                    best confutation of it. However, since great stress is said to be put upon it, I
                    add the following things:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">First,</hi> This notion is absolutely
                    contradictory to that certain conviction, which necessarily and every moment
                    rises within us, when we turn our thoughts upon ourselves, when we reflect upon
                    what is past, and look forward to what is to come. All imagination of a daily
                    change of that living agent which each man calls himself, for another, or of any
                    such change throughout our whole present life, is entirely borne down by our
                    natural sense of things. Nor is it possible for a person in his wits to alter
                    his conduct with regard to his health or affairs, from a suspicion, that though
                    he should live to-morrow, he should not however be the same person he is
                    to-day.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> It is not an idea or
                    abstract notion, or quality, but a being only, which is capable of life and
                    action, of happiness and misery. Now all beings confessedly continue the same
                    during the whole time of their existence. Consider, then, a living being now
                    existing, and which has existed for any time alive: this living being must have
                    done, and suffered, and enjoyed, what it has done, and suffered, and enjoyed,
                    formerly (this living being, I say, and not another), as really as it does, and
                    suffers&gt; and enjoys, what it does, and suffers, and enjoys this instant. All
                    these successive actions, sufferings, and enjoyments, are actions, enjoyments,
                    and sufferings, of the same living being; and they are so prior to all
                    considerations of its remembering or forgetting, since remembering or forgetting
                    can make no alteration in the truth of past matter of fact. And suppose this
                    being endued with limited powers of knowledge and memory, there is no more
                    difficulty in conceiving it to have a power of knowing itself to be the same
                    being which it was some time ago, of remembering some of its actions,
                    sufferings, and enjoyments, and forgetting others, than in conceiving it to
                    know, or remember, or forget, any thing else.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> Every person is conscious
                    that he is now the same person or self he was as far back as his remembrance
                    reaches; since, when anyone reflects upon a past action of his own, he is just
                    as certain of the person who did that action, namely, himself (the person who
                    now reflects upon it), as he is certain that the action was at all done. Nay,
                    very often a person’s assurance of an action having been done, of which he is
                    absolutely assured, arises wholly from the consciousness that he himself did it;
                    and this he, person, or self, must either be a substance or the property of some
                    substance. If he, if person, be a substance, then consciousness that he is the
                    same person, is consciousness that he is the same substance. If the person, or
                    he, be the property of a substance, still consciousness that he is the same
                    property is as certain a proof that his substance remains the same, as
                    consciousness that he remains the same substance would be; since the same
                    property cannot be transferred from one substance to another.</p>
                <p>“But though we are thus certain that we are the same agents, living beings, or
                    substances, now, which we were as far back as our remembrance reaches, yet it is
                    asked whether we may not possibly be deceived in it. And this question may be
                    asked at the end of any demonstration whatever, because it is a question
                    concerning the truth of perception by memory; and he who can doubt whether
                    perception by memory can in this case be depended upon, may doubt also whether
                    perception by deduction and reasoning, which also include memory, or indeed
                    whether intuitive perception itself, can be depended upon. Here, then, we can go
                    no farther; for it is ridiculous to attempt to prove the truth of our faculties,
                    which can no otherwise be proved than by the use or means of those suspected
                    faculties themselves.”</p>
                <p>This reasoning, which we believe will to most men appear unanswerable, Mr Cooper
                    hopes to overturn by the following observations<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tracts, &amp;c.</p></note>: If all
                    imagination of a daily change in us be borne down by our natural sense of
                    things, then,” says be, “does our natural sense of things positively contradict
                    known fact; for a daily, a momentaneous, change in us, that is, in our bodies,
                    does actually take place.” True, a daily change in our bodies does take place,
                    and so likewise does a daily change in our clothes; but surely no man was ever
                    led by his natural sense of things to suppose that his limbs or external organs
                    were the seats of sensation and will, any more than that his coat or his shoes
                    were any real parts of his trunk or of his feet. But it is only that which
                    thinks and wills that any man considers, in this case, as himself or his person;
                    and if our natural sense of things, or consciousness, tells us, that what thinks
                    and wills has continued the same from a distance of time as far back as we can
                    remember, it is certain, that whether it be material or immaterial, it has
                    continued from that period, otherwise we cannot be certain of any thing. “But,”
                    says our philosopher, “other known and ascertained facts are frequently borne
                    down by our natural sense of things: For how many thousand years before the days
                    of Copernicus was the motion of the earth round the sun entirely borne down by
                    our natural sense of things, which made us give full credit to the motion of the
                    sun round the earth? Do not the generality of mankind believe, upon the evidence
                    of their natural sense of things, that every part of their body remains exactly
                    the same to-day as it was yesterday ?”</p>
                <p>To the former of these questions we answer positively, that before the days of
                    Copernicus the motion of the earth round the sun was not borne down by our
                    natural sense of things, but by ill-founded hypotheses and inconclusive
                    reasonings. By the natural sense of things, nothing can be meant, in this place,
                    but the evidence of consciousness, or of external sensation; but the actual
                    motion either of the sun or of the earth is not perceived either by
                    consciousness or by sensation. Of consciousness nothing is the object but the
                    internal energies and feelings of our own minds; and, with regard to the motion
                    of the sun or of the earth, nothing is perceived by the sense of sight but that,
                    after considerable intervals of time, these two great bodies have repeatedly
                    changed their places in the heavens with respect to each other. This is all that
                    on this subject our natural sense of things leads us to believe; and is not this
                    infallibly true? Afterwards, indeed, by taking for granted the truth of
                    propositions, for which neither sense nor consciousness affords the shadow of
                    evidence, the vulgar now, and all mankind formerly, reasoned themselves into the
                    opinion, that the earth stands still, and that the sun moves round it. In vulgar
                    philosophy it is taken for granted, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208688"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8688-0682"/>that in the universe there is not a relative but
                    an absolute upwards and an absolute downwards; that our heads are absolutely
                    upward, and our feet downward; and that were the earth to revolve round its
                    axis, these positions would be reversed, that our heads would be placed beneath
                    our feet, and that we ourselves would fall from the earth into empty space. Upon
                    these false hypotheses the vulgar reason correctly. They know that bodies cannot
                    change their place without motion; they know that in the time of their
                    remembrance the sun and the earth have been perpetually varying their places
                    with respect to each other; they know that they themselves have never fallen,
                    nor had a tendency to fall, into empty space; and hence they infer that it is
                    the sun, and not the earth, that moves. But will any man say that the absurd
                    suppositions from which this conclusion is logically deduced, have the evidence
                    either of sensation or of consciousness, as the permanency of that living agent
                    which each man calls himself has?</p>
                <p>To our author’s second question we likewise reply with confidence, that the
                    generality of mankind do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> believe, upon their natural
                    sense of things, that every part of their body remains exactly the same to-day
                    as it was yesterday. It would be strange indeed if they did, after having
                    repeatedly experienced the waste of increased perspiration or sweating; after
                    having witnessed men emaciated by sickness, and again restored to plumpness in
                    health; and after having perhaps lost whole limbs, which certainly their natural
                    sense of things teaches them to consider as parts of their body. In all these
                    cases the generality of mankind are as sensible of changes having taken place in
                    their bodies as he who has attended ever so closely to physiological inquiries,
                    although not one of them has the least imagination of a change having taken
                    place in the living agent which each man calls himself.</p>
                <p>Bishop Butler observes, that if the living agent be perpetually changing, it is a
                    fallacy upon ourselves to charge our present selves with any thing which we did,
                    to imagine our present selves interested in any thing which befell us yesterday,
                    or that our present self will be interested in what will befall us to-morrow. To
                    this judicious observation our daring philosopher replies, “that as the man of
                    to-morrow, though not in all points the same with, yet depends for his existence
                    upon, the man of to-day, there is sufficient reason to care about him.” Could he
                    have said, that as the man of to-day depends for his éxistence on the man of
                    to-morrow, there is sufficient reason for the present man to care about the
                    future man; or that as the man of to-morrow depends for his existence on the man
                    of today, there is to-day sufficient reason for the future man to care about the
                    present man; we should, in either case, if the anachronism had been kept out of
                    sight, have seen the force of his argument. Every man has sufficient reason to
                    care about the ox upon which he is to be fed; but we cannot so clearly perceive
                    what reason the ox has to care about the man.</p>
                <p>Not satisfied, it would seem, with this reply, our author proceeds to affirm,
                    “that the man of to-morrow, possessing a reminiscence of the actions of the man
                    of to-day, and knowing that these actions will be referred to him both by
                    himself and others (which is certainly knowing that both himself and others are
                    most iniquitous wretches), they cannot be indifferent to the man of to-day, who
                    looks forward to the properties of the man of to-morrow that is, the
                    reminiscence and knowledge of a future man constitute all the relation that
                    subsists between a present man and his actions, a discovery worthy of an
                    original genius. But as on the subject of personal identity we pretend to no
                    originality, we shall leave this proposition to the meditation of our readers,
                    and take the liberty to ask our autho¢ a question or two respecting this same
                    reminiscence.</p>
                <p>which he is graciously pleased to acknowledge as a property.</p>
                <p>He defines identity, “the continued existence of any being unaltered in substance
                    or in properties ;” and he repeatedly acknowledges that no identical quality or
                    property can be transferred from one subject to another. Let us now suppose that
                    a man has a reminiscence of an individual action performed a month ago, and that
                    this reminiscence is accompanied with a consciousness that the action was
                    performed by himself. This supposition, whether true or false, may certainly be
                    made; for it implies nothing more than what every man firmly believes of himself
                    in every act of remembrance. Let us again suppose, that, at the distance of ten
                    or of twenty years, the man known by the same name has a reminiscence of the
                    same action, with a consciousness that he himself performed it. Is this
                    reminiscence the same with the former, or is it a different reminiscence? If it
                    be the same, either the person remembering at the distance of ten or twenty
                    years is the same with him who remembered at the distance of a month, or there
                    is an identical quality transferred from one substance to another, which is
                    admitted to be impossible. If reminiscence be itself a real and immediate
                    quality of any substance, and not the mere energy of a power, and if the one
                    reminiscence be different from the other, the subjects in which these two
                    different qualities inhere must likewise be different. Yet the man who has the
                    reminiscence at the distance of a month, has the evidence of consciousness that
                    the action was performed by him; and the man who has the reminiscence at the
                    distance of ten or twenty years, has likewise the evidence of consciousness that
                    the same action was performed by him, and not by another. By the confession of
                    Hume and of all philosophers, consciousness never deceives; but here is the
                    evidence of one consciousness in direct opposition to another; and therefore,,
                    as two contradictory propositions cannot both be true, either the one
                    reminiscence is the same with the other, or reminiscence is no real quality.
                    That one act of reminiscence should be numerically the same with another which
                    followed it at the distance of twenty years, is plainly impossible; whence it
                    should seem, that reminiscence itself is no real and immediate quality of any
                    substance. But if this be so, what is reminiscence? We answer, It is plainly
                    neither more nor less than the energy of a power which, though dormant between
                    its energies, remains unchanged from the one to the other, and which being
                    itself the real and immediate quality of a subject, that subject must likewise
                    remain unchanged. That powers may remain dormant, and yet unchanged, every man
                    must be convinced, who, having struck any thing with his hand, knows that he has
                    power to repeat the stroke, and yet does not actually repeat it. Two blows with
                    the hand immediately following each other arc numerically different, so that the
                    one cannot with truth be said to be the other; but we have the evidence of
                    external sense, that they are both struck by the same member. In like manner,
                    two energies of reminiscence directed to the same object, and succeeding each
                    other at any interval of time, cannot possibly be one and the same energy; but
                    as the latter energy may include in it the former as well as the object
                    remembered by both, we have the evidence of consciousness that both are energies
                    of the same power; and we have seen, that to suppose them any thing else, may be
                    demonstrated to involve the grossest absurdities and contradictions.</p>
                <p>Mr Cooper has other arguments to obviate the force of Bishop Butler’s
                    demonstration of personal identity; such as, that a “high degree of similarity
                    between the two succeeding men is sufficient to make the one care about the
                    other; and, that “a good man, knowing that a future being will be punished or
                    rewarded as the actions of the present man deserve, will have a sufficient
                    motive to do right and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208701"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8701-0683"/>to abstain from wrong.” But if there be any one of
                    our readers who can suffer himself to be persuaded by such assertions as these,
                    that the living agent which he calls himself is perpetually changing, and at the
                    same time that such change is consistent with the expectation of future rewards
                    and punishments, he would not be reclaimed from his error by any reasoning of
                    ours. We shall therefore trust such trifling to every man’s judgment, and
                    proceed to examine our author’s demonstration, that personal identity has no
                    existence. But here it is no part of our purpose to accompany him through his
                    long chemical ramble, or to controvert his arguments for the non-identity of
                    vegetable and animal bodies. The only thing to which, after Bishop Butler, we
                    have ascribed identity, is that which in man is sentient and conscious; and the
                    non-identity of this thing, whatever it be, Mr Cooper undertakes to demonstrate
                    from the known properties of sensations and ideas.</p>
                <p>This demonstration sets out with a very ominous circumstance. The author, after
                    conducting impressions <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">extra</hi>
                    from the extremities of the nerves to the brain, affirms, that sensations and
                    ideas are nothing hut “motions in the brain perceived ;” that is, when a man
                    thinks he is looking at a mountain, not only at rest, but to appearance
                    immoveable, he is grossly deceived; for he perceives nothing all the while but
                    motion in his brain. Were not the desirc of advancing novelties and paradoxes
                    invincible in some minds, we should be astonished at finding such an assertion
                    as this fall from the pen of any man who had paid the slightest attention to the
                    different energies of his own intellect. Motions in the brain, as we have
                    repeatedly observed, arc the immediate causes of our sensations; but is it
                    conceivable, is it possible, that any thing should be the cause of itself? The
                    motion of a sword through the heart of a man is the immediate cause of that
                    man’s death; but is the sword or its motion death itself, or can they be
                    conceived as being the sensations of the man in the agonies of death? But
                    sensations and ideas, whatever they be, exist in succession; and therefore,
                    argues our demonstrator, no two sensations or ideas can be one and the same
                    sensation or idea. The conclusion is logically inferred; but what purpose can it
                    possibly serve? What purpose? Why, it seems “sensations and ideas are the only
                    cxistences whose existence we certainly know (a charming phrase, the existence
                    of existences, and as original as the theory in which it makes its appearance);
                    and therefore, from the nature of sensations and ideas, there is no such thing
                    as permanent identity. Indeed! what then, we may be permitted to ask, is the
                    import of the word <hi rend="italic">we</hi> in this sentence? Does it denote a
                    series of sensations and ideas, and does each sensation and each idea certainly
                    know not only itself, but all its ancestors and all its descendants? Unless this
                    be admitted, we are afraid that some other existence besides sensations and
                    ideas must be allowed to be certainly known, and even to have something of a
                    permanent identity. Nay, we think it has been already demonstrated (see the
                    Chapter on Time), that were there not something permanent, there could he no
                    time, and of course no notion of a first and last, or indeed of succession,
                    whether of sensations or ideas. And therefore, if we have such a notion, which
                    the author here takes for granted, and upon which, indeed, his demonstration
                    rests, it follows undeniably that there is something permanent, and that we know
                    there is something permanent, which observes the succession of sensations and
                    ideas.</p>
                <p>All this, indeed, Mr Cooper in effect grants; for he is not much startled at the
                    appearance of contradictions in his theory. “I find,” says he, “by perpetually
                    repeated impressions which I perceive, that my hands, body, limbs, &amp;c. are
                    connected, are parts of one whole. I find, by perpetually repeated perceptions,
                    also, that the sensations excited by them are constantly similar, and constantly
                    different from the sensations excited by others.” He has, then, repeated
                    perceptions; but how can this be possible, if he be not different from the
                    perceptions, and if he do not remain unchanged whilst the perceptions succeed
                    each other at greater or less intervals of time? A striking object passing with
                    rapidity before the eyes of a number of men placed beside each other in a line
                    of battle, would undoubtedly excite a succession of sensations; but surely that
                    succession would not take place in the mind of any individual in the line, nor
                    could any single man in this case say with truth that he had repeated
                    perceptions of the object. In like manner, were that which is sentient
                    perpetually changing, no man could possibly say or suppose that he had repeated
                    perceptions of any thing; for, upon this supposition, the man of to-day would
                    have no more connection with the man who bore his name yesterday, or twenty
                    years ago, than the man in the line had with the first.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, we cannot help thinking that Bishop Butler’s demonstration of
                    personal identity remains unshaken by the batteries of Mr Cooper. It rests,
                    indeed, upon the solid basis of consciousness and memory; and if implicit credit
                    be not given to the evidence of these faculties, we cannot proceed a single step
                    in any inquiry whatever, nor be certain of the truth even of a mathematical
                    demonstration.</p>
                <p>But as we have ourselves supposed, that to sensation, reminiscence, and every
                    actual energy of the mind of man, the instrumentality of some material system is
                    necessary, it may perhaps be thought incumbent on us to show how the perpetual
                    flux of the particles of matter which compose the brain, as well as all the
                    other parts of the body, can consist with the identity of the person who
                    perceives, remembers, and is conscious. If this cannot be done, our hypothesis,
                    ancient and plausible as it is, must be given up; for of personal identity it is
                    impossible to doubt. In this case, however, we perceive no difficulty; for if
                    there be united to the brain an immaterial being, which is the subject of
                    sensation, consciousness, and will, it is obvious that all the intellectual
                    powers which properly constitute the person must be inherent in that being. The
                    material system, therefore, can be necessary only as an instrument to excite the
                    energies of those powers; and since the powers themselves remain unchanged, why
                    should we suppose that their energies may not be continually exerted by
                    successive instruments of the same kind, as well as by one permanent instrument?
                    the powers of perception and volition are not in the material system, any more
                    than the sensation of seeing is in the rays of light, or the energy of the
                    blacksmith in the hammer with which he beats the anvil. Let us suppose a man to
                    keep his eye for an hour steadily fixed upon one object. It will not surely be
                    denied, that if this could be done, he would have one uninterrupted and unvaried
                    perception of an hour’s duration, as measured by the clock. Yet it is certain
                    that the rays of light which alone could occasion that perception would be
                    perpetually changing. In like manner, a blacksmith, whilst he continues to beat
                    his anvil, continues to excrt the same power, whether he uses one hammer all the
                    time, or a different hammer at each stroke. The reason is obvious. The eye, with
                    all its connections of brain and mind in the one case, and the person of the
                    smith in the other, remain unchanged; and in them alone reside the faculty of
                    sensation, and the power of beating, though neither the faculty nor the power
                    can be exerted without material instruments. But were it possible that millions
                    of men could in the space of an hour take their turns in rotation with each new
                    ray of light, it is self-evident that in this case there would be nothing
                    permanent in sensation; and therefore there could not be one uninterrupted and
                    unvaried perception, but millions of perceptions, during the hour, totally
                    distinct from and unconnected with each other. Let us now suppose a man <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194208714" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8714-0684"/> to fix his eye
                    upon an object for the space of a minute, and at the distance of a day or a
                    month to fix it upon the same object a second time. He could not, indeed, in
                    this case, have one uninterrupted and unvaried perception, but he would be
                    conscious of the energy of the very same faculty the second time as well as the
                    first. Whereas, were one man to view an object to-day, and another to view the
                    same object to-morrow, it is obvious that he who should be last in the
                    succession could know nothing of the energy of that faculty by which the object
                    was perceived the first day, because there would not be anything common to the
                    two perceptions.</p>
                <p>Thus, then, we see that personal identity may with truth be predicated of a
                    compound being, though the material part be in a perpetual flux, providod the
                    immaterial part remain unchanged; and that of such a being only is a
                    resurrection from the dead possible. For since the motions of the brain do
                    nothing more than excite to energy the permanent powers of the mind, it is of no
                    sort of consequence to that energy whether there motions be continued by the
                    same numerical atoms, or by a perpetual succession of atoms arranged and
                    combined in the very same manner. We shall, therefore, be the same persons at
                    the resurrection as at present, whether the mind be united to a particular
                    system composed of any of the numberless atoms which have in succession made
                    parts of our present bodies, or to a system composed of totally different atoms,
                    provided that new system be organized in exactly the same manner with the brain
                    or material vehicle which is at present the immediate instrument of perception.
                    This, we say, is self-evident; but were the immaterial part to change with the
                    changing body, a resurrection of the same persons would be plainly
                    impossible.</p>
                <p>CHAP. IV.—OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL.</p>
                <p>Wherever men have been in any degree civilized, and in some nations where they
                    have been in the most savage state, it has been the general persuasion that the
                    mind or soul subsists after the dissolution of the body. The origin of this
                    persuasion, about which disputes have been raised, no Christian hesitates to
                    attribute to revelation. The Egyptians, from whom the Greeks derived many of
                    their theological and philosophical principles, appear to have taught the
                    immortality of the soul, not as a truth discovered by the exertions of human
                    reason, but as a dogma derived to them from the earliest ages by tradition. This
                    indeed may be confidently inferred from the character and conduct of their first
                    Greek disciples. Those early wise men who fetched their philosophy immediately
                    from Egypt, brought it'home as they found it, in detached and independent
                    portions. 2lfterwards, when schools were formed, and when man began to
                    philosophize by hypothesis and system, it was eagerly inquired upon what
                    foundation in nature the belief of the soul’s immortality could rest; and this
                    inquiry gave rise to the various disquisitions concerning the substance of the
                    soul, which have continued to exercise the ingenuity of the learned to the
                    present day. It was clearly perceived, that if consciousness, thought, and
                    volition, be the result of any particular modification of matter and motion, the
                    living and thinking agent must perish with the dissolution of the system; and it
                    was no less evident, that if the being which perceives, thinks, and wills, be
                    not material, the mind of man may subsist after the resolution of the body into
                    its component particles. Ihe discovery of the immateriality of the mind was
                    therefore one step towards the proof of its immortality; and, in the opinion of
                    many philosophers, whose hopes ought to rest upon a surer basis, it was alone a
                    complete proof. “They who hold sensitive perception in brutes,” says a pious
                    writer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the
                    Procedure, Extent, and Limits of the Understanding.</p></note><hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi><hi rend="italic">to</hi> be an argument for the immateriality of their
                    souls, find themselves under the necessity of allowing those souls to be
                    immortal.”</p>
                <p>The philosophers of ancient Greece, however, did not feel themselves under any
                    such necessity. Whatever were their opinions respecting the souls of brutes,
                    they clearly perceived that nothing which had a beginning of existence could be
                    naturally immortal, whether its substance were material or immaterial. “There
                    never was any of the ancients before Christianity,” says the accurate Cudworth,
                    “that held the soul’s future permanency after death, who did not likewise assert
                    its pre-existence; they clearly perceiving, that if .it were once granted that
                    the soul was generated, it could never be proved but that it might be also
                    corrupted. And therefore, the assertors of the soul’s immortality commonly began
                    here, first to prove its preexistence, proceeding thence to establish its
                    permanency after death. This is the method of proof used in Plato: “Our soul was
                    somewhere before it came to exist in this human form, and thence it appears to
                    be immortal, and as such will subsist after death.”</p>
                <p>To give this argument for immortality any strength, it must be taken for granted,
                    not only that the soul existed in a prior state, but that it existed from all
                    eternity; for it is obvious, that if it had a beginning in any state, it may
                    have an end either in that state or in another. Accordingly, Plato asserts in
                    plain terms its eternity and self-existence; which, as we learn from Cicero, he
                    infers from its being the principle of motion in man. “Quin etiam caeteris, quae
                    moventur, hic fons, hoc principium est movendi. <hi rend="italic">Principii
                    autem nulla est origo.</hi> Nam ex principio oriuntur omnia: ipsum autem nulla
                    ex re alia nasci potest: nec enim esset id principium, quod gigneretur

                    contemptible reasoning; but the opinion which it was intended to prove was held
                    by all the philosophers. They were unanimous in maintaining the <hi

                    he tells us that this opinion passed from Pherecydes Syrus to Pythagoras, and
                    from Pythagoras to Plato, expresses their notion of the soul’s duration by the

                    that which has neither beginning nor end.</p>
                <p>Indeed, none of the philosophers of ancient Greece appear to have believed a
                    creation (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Creation)</hi> possible; for it was a maxim
                    universally received amongst them, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    that nothing can come from nonentity or go to nonentity. This maxim, as held by
                    the theistical philosophers, the learned Cudworth labours to interpret in a
                    sense agreeable to our notions of the origin of the world; but even the
                    questions urged by himself must convince every competent reader that on this
                    occasion he labours in vain. For instance, when Aristotle writes of Parmenides
                    and Melissus, that “They say that no real entity is either made or destroyed,”
                    what can be his meaning, except that those philosophers taught that nothing
                    could be either created or annihilated? He testifies the same thing of
                    Xenophanes and Zeno, when he says that it was a fundamental principle of their
                    philosophy, “That it is impossible that any thing should be made out of nothing
                    ;” and of Empedocles, when he relates, “That’ he acknowledges the very <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194208727" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8727-0685"/>same thing with
                    other philosophers, namely, that it is impossible that any thing should be made
                    out of nothing, or perish into nothing.” But it is needless to multiply
                    quotations respecting the opinions of single philosophers. Of all the
                    physiologers before himself and Plato, Aristotle says, without exception, “That
                    they agree in this opinion, that it is impossible that any thing should be made
                    out of nothing;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Physic,</hi> lib. i. cap. v.</p></note> and he calls this the
                    common principle of naturalists, plainly intimating, that they considered it as
                    the greatest absurdity to suppose that any real entity in nature could either be
                    brought from nothing or reduced to nothing.</p>
                <p>The author of the Intellectual System, in order, perhaps, to hide the impiety of
                    this principle, endeavours to persuade his readers that it was urged only
                    against the hypothesis of forms and qualities of bodies considered as real
                    entities, distinct from matter. But how it could be supposed to militate against
                    that particular opinion, and not against the possibility of all creation, is to
                    us perfectly inconceivable. The father of the school which analyzed body into
                    matter and form, together with by far the greater part of his followers, taught
                    the eternity of both these principles, and therefore maintained, as strenuously
                    as any atomist, the universal maxim, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nihilo</hi><hi rend="italic">nihil jit.</hi> Even Plato himself, whose doctrine
                    of ideas is supposed to wear a more favourable aspect than Aristotle’s forms, to
                    the truths of revealed religion, taught the eternity of matter; but whether as a
                    self-existing substance, or only as an emanation from the Deity, is a question
                    which has been disputed. That he admitted no proper creation, may be confidently
                    inferred from Plutarch, who, writing upon the generation of animals, according
                    to the doctrine laid down in the Timaeus, has the following passage: “It is
                    therefore better for us to follow Plato, and to say and sing that the world was
                    made by God. For as the -world is the best of all works, so is God the best of
                    all causes. Nevertheless, the substance or matter out of which the world was
                    made, was not itself made, but was always ready at hand, and subject to the
                    artificer, to be ordered and disposed by him. For the making of the world was
                    not the production of it out of nothing, but out of an antecedent bad and
                    disorderly state, like the making of a house, garment, or statue.”<note

                <p>If, then, this be a fair representation of the sentiments of Plato, and surely
                    the author understood those sentiments better than the most accomplished modern
                    scholar can pretend to do, nothing is more evident than that the founder of the
                    academy admitted of no proper creation, but only taught that the matter which
                    had existed from eternity in a chaotic state, was in time reduced to order by
                    the Demiurgos or Supreme Being. And if such were the sentiments of the divine
                    Plato, we cannot hesitate to adopt the opinion expressed by the excellent
                    Mosheim, which the reader will probably bo pleased to have in his own words: “Si
                    a Judaeis discedas, nescio an ullus antiquorum philosophorum mundum negaverit
                    aeternum esse. Omnes mihi aeternum professi videntur esse mundum: hoc uno vero
                    disjunguntur, quod nonnulli ut Aristoteles, formam et materiam simul hujus
                    orbis, alii vero, quorum princeps facile Plato, materiam tantum aeternam, formam
                    vero, a Deo comparatam, dixerunt.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Now, it is a fact so generally known, as not to stand in need of being proved by
                    quotations, that there was not amongst them a single man who believed in the
                    existence of mind as a being more excellent than matter, and essentially
                    different from it, who did not hold that the superior was at least of equal
                    antiquity with the inferior substance. So true is this, that Synesius, though a
                    Christian, yet having been educated in one of the schools of philosophy, could
                    not be induced, even by the hopes of a bishopric, to dissemble this sentiment:
                    “I shall never be persuaded to think my soul younger than my body.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi>
                    105.</p></note> This man probably believed, upon the authority of the
                    Scriptures, that the matter of the visible world was created in time; but he
                    certainly held, with his philosophic masters, that his own soul was as old as
                    any atom of it, and that it had consequently existed in a prior state before it
                    animated his present body.</p>
                <p>Those who maintained that the world was uncreated, maintained upon the same
                    principle that their souls were likewise uncreated; and as they conceived that
                    all bodies were formed of one first matter, so they conceived all souls to be
                    either emanations from the one first Mind, or discerpted parts of it. Aristotle,
                    who distinguishes between the intellectual and the sensitive souls, says
                    expressly of the former, that it “enters from without, and is divine ;” adding
                    this reason for his opinion, that “its energy is not blended with that of the
                    body.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Eclog.
                    Phys.</hi> c. xx.</p></note> that “every thing was made out of one, and would
                    again be resolved into one.” But let Seneca speak for them all. “Quid est autem,
                    cur non existimes in eo divini aliquid existere, qui Dei pars est? Totum hoc,
                    quo continemur, et unum est, et Deus: et sor cii ejus sumus, et membra.”<note

                    92.</p></note> “Why should you not believe something to be divine in him, who is
                    indeed part of God? That whole in which we are contained is one, and that one is
                    God; we being his companions and members.” Epictetus says, “The souls of men
                    have the nearest relation to God, as being parts or fragments of him, discerpted
                    and torn from his substance.” Plato writes to the very same purpose, when,
                    without any softening, he frequently calls the soul God, and part of God. And
                    Plutarch says, that “Pythagoras and Plato held the soul to be immortal; for
                    that, launching out into the soul of the universe, it returns to its parent and
                    original.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    cap. vii.</p></note> He, at the same time, declares his own opinion to be, that
                    “the soul is not so much the work and production of God, as a part of him; nor
                    is it made by him, but from him and out of him.”<note anchored="true"

                    >Quaest.</hi></p></note> But it is needless to multiply quotations. Cicero
                    delivers the common sentiments of his Greek masters on this head, when he
                    says,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Divinatione,</hi> lib. i. cap. xlix.</p></note> “A
                    natura deorum, ut doctissimis sapientissi-misque placuit, haustos animos et
                    libatos habemus.” And again: “Humanus autem animus decerptus ex mente divina:
                    cum alio nullo, nisi cum ipso Deo (si hoc fas est dictu), comparari potest.”</p>
                <p>Whilst the philosophers were thus unanimous in maintaining the soul to be a part
                    of the self-existent substance, they differed in opinion, or at least expressed
                    themselves differently, as to the mode of its separation from its divine parent.
                    Cicero and the Stoics talk as if the Supreme Mind were extended, and as if the
                    human soul were a part literally torn from that mind, as a limb can be torn from
                    the body. The Pythagoreans and Platonists seem to have considered all souls as
                    emanations from the divine substance rather than as parts torn from it, much in
                    the same way as rays of light are emanations from the sun. Plato, in particular,
                    believed in two self-existent principles, namely, God and matter. The former he
                    considered as the Supreme Intelligence, incorporeal, without beginning, end. or
                    change; and distinguished it by the appellation of <hi rend="italic">το αγa0ον,
                    the Good.</hi> Matter, as subsisting from eternity, he <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208740" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8740-0686"/>considered as without any one
                    form or quality whatever, and as having a natural tendency to disorder. Of this
                    chaotic mass God formed a perfect world, after the eternal pattern in his own
                    mind, and endowed it with a soul or emanation from himself. In the language of
                    Plato, therefore, the universe, being animated by a soul which proceeds from
                    God, is called the son of God; and several parts of nature, particularly the
                    heavenly bodies, are gods. The human soul, according to him, is derived by
                    emanation from God, through the intervention of this soul of the world; and
                    receding farther from the first intelligence, it is inferior in perfection to
                    the soul of the world, though even that soul is debased by some material
                    admixture. To account more fully for the origin and present state of human
                    souls, Plato supposes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Enfield’s Abridgement of Brucher’s History of Philosophy.</p></note> that
                    “when God formed the universe, he separated from the soul of the world inferior
                    souls, equal in number to the stars, and assigned to each its proper celestial
                    abode; but that those souls (by what means, or for what reason, does not appear)
                    were sent down to the earth into human bodies, as into sepulchres or prisons.”
                    He ascribes to this cause the depravity and misery to which human nature is
                    liable, and maintains, that it “is only by disengaging itself from all animal
                    passions, and rising above sensible objects to the contemplation of the world of
                    intelligence, that the soul of man can be prepared to return to its original
                    state.” Not inconsistently with this doctrine, the same philosopher frequently
                    speaks of the soul of man as consisting of three parts, or rather he seems to
                    have thought that man has three souls; the first the principle of intelligence,
                    the second of passion, and the third of appetite; and to each he assigns its
                    proper place in the human body. But it was only the intellectual soul that he
                    considered as immortal.</p>
                <p>Aristotle taught, in terms equally express, that the human soul is a part of God,
                    and of course that^ts substance is of eternal and necessary existence. Some of
                    his followers, indeed, although they acknowledged two first principles, the
                    active and the passive, yet held, with the Stoics, but one substance in the
                    universe; and to reconcile these two contradictory propositions, they were
                    obliged to suppose matter to be both active and passive. Their doctrine on this
                    subject is thus delivered by Cicero: “De natura ita dicebant, ut eam dividerent
                    in res duas, ut altera esset efficiens, altera autem quasi huic se praebens, ea
                    quae efficeretur aliquid. In eo, quod efficeret, vim esse censebant; in eo autem
                    quod efficeretur, materiam quandam; in <hi rend="italic">utroque tamen
                    udrumque.</hi> Neque enim materiam ipsam coherere potuisse, si nulla vi
                    contincretur, neque <hi rend="italic">vim sine aliqua materia;</hi> nihil est
                    enim, quod non alicubi esse cogatur.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Academica,</hi> lib. i. cap.
                    vi.</p></note> “They divided nature into two things, as the first principles;
                    one of which is the efficient or artificer, the other that which offers itself
                    to him for things to be made out of it. In the efficient principle, they
                    acknowledged active force; in the passive, a certain matter; but so that in <hi
                    rend="italic">each both of these were together</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    forasmuch as neither the matter could cohere together unless it were contained

                    without matter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> because that is nothing which may
                    not be compelled to be somewhere.” Agreeably to this strange doctrine, Arrian,
                    the interpreter of Epietetus, says of himself, “I am a man (a part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">το</hi> παv, or <hi rend="italic">universe),</hi> as an hour is
                    part of the day.”</p>
                <p>Aristotle himself is generally supposed to have believed in the eternal existence
                    of two substances, mind and matter; but, treating of the generation of animals,
                    he says,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Generatione Animalium,</hi> lib. iii.

                    after a manner all things are full of mind; wherefore they arc quickly completed
                    (or made complete animals) when they have received a portion of that heat.” This
                    heat, from which, according to Cicero,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Tuscul.</hi> lib. i. cap. iii.</p></note>
                    the Stagyrite derived all souls, has, it must be confessed, a very material
                    appearance; insomuch that the learned Mosheim seems to have been doubtful
                    whether he admitted of any immaterial principle in man. But for this doubt there
                    appears to us to be no solid foundation. Aristotle expressly declares, that
                    “this heat is not fire, nor any such power, but a spirit which is in the seeds
                    or elementary principles of bodies.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    iii.</p></note> And as the excellent person himself acknowledges that Aristotle
                    taught the existence of two principles, God and matter, not indeed subsisting
                    separately, but eternally linked together by the closest union, we think it
                    follows undeniably, that this heat, from which he derived all souls, must be
                    that mind which he called God, and which he considered as the actuating soul of
                    the universe.</p>
                <p>Upon these principles neither Aristotle nor the Stoics could believe, with Plato,
                    that in the order of nature there was first an emanation from the Supreme Mind
                    to animate the universe, and then through this universal soul other emanations
                    to animate mankind. The Stagyrite believed that the Supreme Mind himself is the
                    soul of the world, and that human souls are immediately derived from him. The
                    genuine Stoics, acknowledging but one substance, of necessity considered both
                    the souls and bodies of men as portions of that substance, which they called <hi

                    distinction between body and mind. But, however the various schools differed as
                    to those points, they were unanimous as to the soul’s being a part of the
                    self-existing substance; and Cicero gives their whole system from Pacuvianus, in
                    words which cannot be misunderstood:</p>
                <p>Quicquid est hoc, omnia animat, format, alit, auget, creat, Sepelit, recipitque

                <p>To these verses he immediately subjoins the following query: “Quid est igitur,

                    the same principle he elsewhere argues, not merely for the immortality, but for
                    the eternity and necessary existence, of the soul: “Animorum nulla in terris
                    origo inveniri potest: His enim in naturis nihil inest, quod vim memoriae
                    mentis, eogitationis habeat; quod et praeterita teneat, et futura provideat, et
                    complecti possit praesentia; quae sola divina sunt. Nèe invenietur unquam, unde
                    ad hominem venire possint, nisi a Deo. Ita quicquid est illud, quod sentit, quod

                    the soul in the most effectual manner; for it is obvious, that what had not a
                    beginning can never have an end, but must be of eternal and necessary existence.
                    But when the ancients attributed a proper eternity to the soul, we must not
                    suppose that they understood it to be eternal in its distinct and personal
                    existence. They believed that it proceeded or was discerpted in time from the
                    substance of God, and would in time be again resolved into that substance. This
                    they explained by a close vessel filled with sea-water, which, swimming a while
                    upon the occan, does, upon the vessel’s breaking, flow in again, and mingle with
                    the common mass.</p>

                    souls immediately to the Universal Spirit; but those which had contracted much
                    defilement were sent into a succession of other bodies, to be purged and

                <p>A doctrine similar to this of Plato has been held from time immemorial by the
                    Brahmins in India, whose sacred books teach, “That intellect is a <hi

                    universe, breathed into all creatures, to animate them for a certain time; that

                    ocean from which it first arose; that the souls of men are distinguished from
                    those of other animals, by being endowed with reason and with a consciousness of
                    right and wrong; and that the soul of him who adheres to right as far as his

                    their grief is over, they're-animate other bodies; and when they arrive through

                <p>Whether the Greeks derived their notions of the divinity and transmigration of
                    souls from the east, or whether both they and the Brahmins brought the same
                    doctrines at different periods from Egypt, it is foreign to the purpose of this
                    article to inquire. Certain it is, that the philosophers of Greece and India
                    argued in the very same manner, and upon the very same principles, for the
                    natural immortality of the soul; and that the immortality which they taught was
                    wholly incompatible with God’s moral government of the world, and with a future
                    state of rewards and punishments. That this is true of the doctrine of the
                    Brahmins, is evident from the last-quoted sentence; for if the soul, when
                    absorbed into the Divine essence, loses all consciousness of what it did and
                    suffered in the body, it cannot possibly be rewarded for the virtues it
                    practised upon earth. That the philosophers of Greece taught the same cessation
                    of consciousness, might be inferred with the utmost certainty, even though we
                    had not Aristotle’s express declaration to that purpose. For as they all
                    believed their souls to have existed before these were infused into their
                    bodies, and as each must have been conscious that he remembered nothing of his
                    former state, it was impossible to avoid concluding, that in the future state of
                    his soul as little would be remembered of the present. Accordingly Aristotle
                    teaches, that “the active intellect only is immortal and eternal, but the
                    passive corruptible.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    thinks this a very doubtful and obscure passage; but Warburton, whose natural
                    acuteness often discovered the sense of ancient authors when it had escaped the
                    sagacity of abler scholars, has completely proved, that by the active intellect
                    is meant the substance of the soul, and by the passive its particular
                    perceptions. It appears therefore that the Stagyrite, from the common principle
                    of the soul’s being a part of the Divine substance, draws a conclusion against a
                    future state of rewards and punishments; which, though all the philosophers,
                    except Socrates, embraced, yet all were not so forward to avow.</p>
                <p>That the hypothesis of the soul’s being a part of the Divine substance is a gross
                    absurdity, we surely need not spend time in proving. The argument long ago urged
                    against it by St Augustin must ere now have occurred to every reader. In the
                    days of that learned father of the church, it was not wholly given up by the
                    philosophers; and, in his excellent work of the City of God, he thus exposes its
                    extravagance and impiety: “Quid infelicius credi potest, quam Dei partem
                    vapulare, cum puer vapulat? Jam vero partes Dei fieri lascivas, iniquas, impias,
                    atque omnino damnabiles, quis ferre potest nisi qui prorsus insanit ?”</p>
                <p>But although this hypothesis be in the highest degree absurd, and wholly
                    untenable, we apprehend it to be the only principle from which the natural or
                    essential immortality of the soul can possibly be inferred. If the soul had a
                    beginning, it may have an end; for nothing can be more evident, than that the
                    being which had not existence of itself, cannot of itself have perpetuity of
                    existence. Human works, indeed, continue in being after the power of the workman
                    is withdrawn from them; but between human works and the Divine there is this
                    immense difference, that the former receive from the artist nothing but their
                    form, whereas the latter receive from the Creator both their form and their
                    substance. Forms are nothing but modifications of substance; and as substances
                    depend upon God and not upon man, human works are continued in being by that
                    fiat of the Creator, which made the substances of which they are composed
                    susceptible of different forms, and of such a nature as to retain for a period
                    of time whatever form may be impressed upon them. Human works, therefore, are
                    continued in being by a power different from that by which they are finished;
                    but the works of God depend wholly upon that power by which they were originally
                    brought into existence; and were the Creator to withdraw his supporting energy,
                    the whole creation would sink into nothing.</p>
                <p>Self-evident as this truth certainly is, some eminent philosophers seem to have
                    questioned it. “No substance or being,” says Mr Baxter,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Inquiry into the Nature of the Human Soul,
                    vol. i. sect. 3.</p></note> “can have a natural tendency to annihilation, or to
                    become nothing. That a being which once exists should cease to exist, is a real
                    effect, and must be produced by a real cause. But this could not be planted in
                    the nature of any substance or being to become a tendency of its nature; for it
                    could not be a free cause, otherwise it must be a being itself, the subject of
                    the attribute freedom, and therefore not the property of another being, nor a
                    necessary cause, for such a cause is only the effect of something imposing that
                    necessity, and so no cause at all.”</p>
                <p>That the author’s meaning in this argument is good, cannot, we think, be
                    controverted; but assuredly he has not expressed himself with his usual
                    accuracy. He seems to confound causes with the absence of causes, and the
                    effects of the former with the consequences of the latter. The visible world was
                    brought into existence by the actual energy of the power of God; and as the
                    visible world had nothing of itself, it can remain in existence only by a
                    continuance of the same energy. This energy, therefore, is at the present moment
                    as real a cause as it was six thousand years ago, or at any period when it may
                    have been.first exerted; and the visible world is its real and permanent effect.
                    But would the ceasing of this energy be likewise a cause? It would certainly be
                    followed by the annihilation of the visible world, just as the withdrawing of
                    the sunbeams would be followed by darkness on the earth. Yet as no one has ever
                    supposed that darkness, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208766"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8766-0688"/>a nonentity, is a positive effect of the sun or of
                    his beams, but only a mere negative consequence of their absence; so, we think,
                    no one who believes in creation can consider that destruction which would
                    inevitably follow the withdrawing of the energy by which all things are
                    supported, as the positive effect of a contrary energy, or as any thing more
                    than a negative consequence of the ceasing of that volition or energy of power
                    by which God at first brought things into existence. For “where the foundation
                    of existence lies wholly in the power of an infinite being producing, the ground
                    of the continuance of that existence must be wholly in the same power
                    conserving; which has, therefore, with as much truth as frequency, been styled a
                    continued creation.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    where this question is treated in a very masterly manner, by one of the ablest
                    metaphysicians of the seventeenth century.</p></note></p>
                <p>The force of this reasoning Mr Baxter certainly saw, when he said, that “a
                    tendency to persevere in the same state of nature, and a tendency to change it,
                    are contradictories, and impossible to be planted in the same subject at once;
                    or, not to urge the contradiction, if the last prevailed, the remaining in the
                    same state for any given time would be impossible. We forget the true cause of
                    all these tendencies, the will of God, which it is absurd to suppose contrary to
                    itself. The tendency in matter to persevere in the same state of rest or motion,
                    is nothing but the will of the Creator, who preserves all things in their
                    existence and manner of existence; nor can we have recourse to any other cause
                    for the preservation of immaterial substance in its existence. Therefore these
                    tendencies are to be ascribed to the will of God, and it is absurd to suppose
                    them contrary.”</p>
                <p>All this is unquestionably true. The existence or nonexistence of matter and of
                    created spirits depends wholly upon the will of God; and we cannot suppose him
                    to be willing to-day the reverse of what he willed yesterday, because we know
                    that all his volitions are directed by unerring wisdom. We have likewise the
                    evidence of experience, that nothing is ever suffered to perish except
                    particular systems, which perish only as systems by a decomposition of their
                    parts. A being which, like the soul, has no parts, can suffer no decomposition;
                    and therefore, if it perish, it must perish by annihilation. But of annihilation
                    there has not hitherto been a single instance; nor can we look for a single
                    instance, without supposing the volitions of God to partake of that unsteadiness
                    which is characteristic of man. Corporeal systems, when they have served their
                    purpose, are indeed resolved into their component parts; but the matter of which
                    they were composed, so far from being lost, becomes the matter of other systems
                    in endless succession. Analogy, therefore, leads us to conclude, that when the
                    human body is dissolved, the immaterial principle by which it was animated will
                    continue to think and act, either in a state of separation from all body, or in
                    some material vehicle to which it is intimately united, and which goes off with
                    it at death; or else that it will be preserved by the Father of Spirits, for the
                    purpose of animating a body in some future state. λVhen we consider the
                    different states through which that living and thinking individual, which each
                    man calls himself, goes, from the moment that it first animates an embryo in the
                    womb, to the dissolution of the man of fourscore; and when we reflect likewise
                    on the wisdom and immutability of God, together with the various dissolutions of
                    corporeal systems, in which we know that a single atom of matter has never been
                    lost; the presumption is certainly strong, that the soul shall subsist after the
                    dissolution of the body. But when we take into the consideration the moral
                    attributes of God, his justice and goodness, together with the unequal
                    distribution of happiness and misery in the present world, this presumption from
                    analogy amounts to a complete moral proof that there shall be a future state of
                    rewards and punishments; and if we estimate the duration of the rewards by the
                    benevolence of him by whom they are to be conferred, we cannot imagine them
                    shorter than eternity.</p>
                <p>CHAP. V.—OF <hi rend="smallcaps">necessity</hi> AND LIBERTY.</p>
                <p>In the preceding chapter, we have adverted to that great moral proof of a future
                    state, and the immortality of the soul, which arises from the relation in which
                    man, as a being accountable for hiδ conduct, stands to a God of almighty power,
                    infinite wisdom, and perfect justice. But the circumstance of accountableness
                    implies freedom of agency; for it is contrary to all our notions of right and
                    wrong that a man should be either rewarded or punished for actions which he was
                    necessitated or compelled to perform.</p>
                <p>Human actions are of three kinds: One where we act by instinct, without any view
                    to consequences; one where we act by will, in order to obtain some end; and one
                    where we act against will. It is the second kind of actions only which confers
                    upon the agent merit or demerit. With respect to the first, he acts blindly (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Instinct),</hi> without deliberation or choice; and the
                    external act follows from the instinctive impulse, no less necessarily than a
                    stone by its gravity falls to the ground. With respect to the last, he is rather
                    an instrument than an agent; and it is universally allowed, that were a strong
                    man to put a sword into the hand of one who is weaker, and then to force it
                    through the body of a third person, he who held the sword would be as guiltless
                    of the murder as the sword itself. To be entitled to rewards, or liable to
                    punishment, a man must act voluntarily; or, in other words, his actions must
                    proceed from that energy of mind which is termed volition; and we believe it has
                    never been denied, that all men have power to do whatsoever they will, both with
                    respect to the operations of their minds and to the motions of their bodies,
                    uncontrolled by any foreign principle or cause. “Every man,” says Dr Priestley,
                    “is at liberty to turn his thoughts to whatever subject he pleases, to consider
                    the reasons for or against any scheme or proposition, and to reflect upon them
                    as long as he shall think proper; as well as to» walk wherever he pleases, and
                    to do whatever his hands and other limbs are capable of doing.” Without such
                    liberty as this, morality is inconceivable.</p>
                <p>But although philosophers have in general agreed with respect to the power which
                    a man has to perform such actions as he wills, they have differed widely in
                    opinion respecting the nature of his volitions. That these are the result of
                    motives, has seldom or never been questioned; but w hether that result be
                    necessary, so that the agent possesses no self-determining power to decide
                    between different motives, has been warmly disputed by men equally candid,
                    impartial, and intelligent. The principal writers on the side of necessity are,
                    Hobbes, Collins, Hume, Leibnitz, Lord Kames, Hartley, Edwards, Priestley, and
                    perhaps Locke. On the other side are, Clarke, King, Law, Reid, Butler, Price,
                    Bryant, Wollaston, Horsley, Beattie, and Gregory. To give a short view of this
                    celebrated question is all that our limits will permit; and as we do not think
                    ourselves competent to settle the dispute, it were perhaps a thing desirable to
                    give the opposite reasonings in the words of those eminent authors themselves.
                    It <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208779" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8779-0689"/>must,
                    however, be obvious to the reader, that the style and manner of so many
                    different writers are extremely various, and that to introduce them all into our
                    abstract would render the whole a mass of confusion. We shall, therefore, select
                    one writer to plead the cause of necessity, supplying his defects from those
                    who, though inferior to him on the whole, may yet have argued more ably on some
                    particular points which the question involves; and to this combined reasoning we
                    shall subjoin such answers as to us appear most conclusive. Hartley, Hume, and
                    Priestley, are perhaps the most profound reasoners on the side of necessity; but
                    there is so much more perspicuity in the arguments of Lord Kames, that we cannot
                    help preferring them, as being upon the whole better calculated to give the
                    ordinary reader a fair view of the subject.</p>
                <p>“Into actions done with a view to an end,” says his lordship,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sketches of the History of
                    Man, book iii. sketch ii. part i. sect. 8.</p></note> “desire and will enter;
                    desire to accomplish the end goes first; the will to act, in order to accomplish
                    the end, is next; and the external act follows of course. It is the will, then,
                    that governs every external act done as a mean to accomplish an and; and it is
                    desire to accomplish the end that puts the will in motion; desire, in this view,
                    being commonly termed the motive to act. But what is it that raises desire? The
                    answer is ready: It is the prospect of attaining some agreeable end, or of
                    evading one that is disagreeable. And if it be inquired, what makes an object
                    agreeable or disagreeable? the answer is equally ready: It is our nature that
                    makes it so. Certain visible objects are agreeable, certain sounds and certain
                    smells: other objects of these senses are disagreeable. But there we must stop,
                    for we are far from being so intimately acquainted with our own nature as to
                    assign the causes.</p>
                <p>“With respect to instinctive actions, no person, I presume, thinks that there is
                    any freedom. With respect to voluntary actions, done in order to produce some
                    effect, the necessity is the same, though less apparent at first view. The
                    external action is determined by the will, the will is determined by desire, and
                    desire by what is agree-ble or disagreeable. Here is a chain of causes and
                    effects, not one link of which is arbitrary, or under command of the agent: he
                    cannot will but according to his desire; he cannot desire but according to what
                    is agreeable or disagreeable in the objects perceived: nor do these qualities
                    depend on his inclination or fancy; he has no power to <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> make a beautiful woman ugly, nor to make a rotten carcass smell
                    sweetly.</p>
                <p>“Many good men, apprehending danger to morality from holding our actions to be
                    necessary, endeavour to break the chain of causes and effects above mentioned;
                    maintaining, that whatever influence desire or motives may have, it is the agent
                    himself who is the cause of every action; that desire may advise, but cannot
                    command; and, therefore, that a man is still free to act in contradiction to
                    desire and to the strongest motives.</p>
                <p>“That a being may exist which in every case acts blindly and arbitrarily, without
                    having any end in view, I can make a shift to conceive; but it is difficult for
                    me even to imagine a thinking and rational being, that has affections and
                    passions, that has a desirable end in view, that can easily accomplish this end,
                    and yet after all can fly or remain at rest, without any cause, reason, or
                    motive, to sway it. If such a whimsical being can possibly exist, I am certain
                    that man is not that being. There is not, perhaps, a person above the condition
                    of a changeling but can say why he did so and so, what moved him, what he
                    intended. Nor is a single fact stated to make us believe t⅛at ever a man acted
                    against his own will or desire who was not compelled by external force. On the
                    contrary, constant and universal experience proves that human actions are
                    governed by certain inflexible laws; and that a man cannot exert his self-motive
                    power but in pursuance of some desire or motive.</p>
                <p>“Had a motive always the same influence, actions proceeding from it would appear
                    no less necessary than the actions of matter. The various degrees of influence
                    that motives have on different men at the same time, and on the same man at
                    different times, occasion a doubt, by suggesting a notion of chance. Some
                    motives, however, have such influence as to leave no doubt: a timid female has a
                    physical power to throw herself into the month of a lion roaring for food, but
                    she is withheld by terror no less effectually than by cords: if she should rush
                    upon a lion, would not every one conclude that she was frantic? A man, though in
                    a deep sleep, retains a physical power to act, but he cannot exert it. A man,
                    though desperately in love, retains a physical power to refuse the hand of his
                    mistress; but he cannot exert that power in contradiction to his own ardent
                    desire, more than if he were fast asleep. Now, if a strong motive have a
                    necessary influence, there is no reason for doubting but that a weak motive must
                    also have its influence, the same in kind, though not in degree. Some actions,
                    indeed, are strangely irregular; but let the wũldest actions be scrutinized,
                    there will always be discovered some motive or desire, which, however whimsical
                    or capricious, was what influenced the person to act. Of two contending motives,
                    is it not natural to expect that the stronger will prevail, however little its
                    excess may be? If there be any doubt, it must arise from a supposition that a
                    weak motive may be resisted arbitrarily. W*here, then, are we to fix the
                    boundary between a weak and a strong motive? If a weak motive can be resisted,
                    why not one a little stronger, and why not the strongest? Between two motives
                    opposing each other, however nearly balanced, a man has not an arbitrary choice,
                    but must yield to the stronger. The mind, indeed, fluctuates for some time, and
                    finds itself in a measure loose: at last, however, it is determined by the more
                    powerful motive, as a balance is by the greater weight after many
                    vibrations.</p>
                <p>“Such, then, are the laws that govern our voluntary actions. A man is absolutely
                    free to act according to his own will; greater freedom than which is not
                    conceivable. At the same time, as man is made accountable for his conduct to his
                    Maker, to his fellow-creatures, and to himself, he is not left to act
                    arbitrarily; for at that rate he would be altogether unaccountable: his will is
                    regulated by desire, and desire by what pleases or displeases him. Thus, with
                    regard to human conduct, there is a chain of laws established by nature, no one
                    link of which is left arbitrary. By that wise system, man is made accountable;
                    by it he is made a fit subject for divine and human government; by it persons of
                    sagacity foresee the conduct of others; by it the prescience of the Deity with
                    respect to human actions is clearly established.”</p>
                <p>Of the doctrine of necessity, a more perspicuous or plausible view than this is
                    not to be found in any work with which we are acquainted. It is indeed
                    defective, perhaps, as his lordship only hints at the nature of that relation
                    which subsists between motive and action; but, from his comparing the
                    fluctuations of the mind between two contending motives, to the vibrations of a
                    balance with different weights in the opposite scales, there is no room to doubt
                    but that he agreed exactly in opinion with Mr Hume and Dr Priestley.</p>
                <p>Now, both these writers hold, that the relation of motives to volition and action
                    is the very same with that which subsists between cause and effect in physics,
                    as far as they are both known to us. “It is universally allowed,” says <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194208792" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8792-0690"/> Mr Hume,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Inquiry concerning Human
                    Understanding, sect. 8.</p></note> “that matter, in all its operations, is
                    actuated by a necessary force; and that every natural effect is so precisely
                    determined by the energy of its cause, that no other effect, in such particular
                    circumstances, could possibly have resulted from it. The degree and direction of
                    every motion is, by the laws of nature, prescribed with such exactness, that a
                    living creature may as soon arise from the shock of two bodies, as motion in any
                    other degree or direction than what is actually produced by it. Would we,
                    therefore, form a just and precise idea of necessity, we must consider whence
                    that idea arises when we apply it to the operation of bodies. But our idea of
                    this kind of necessity and causation arises entirely from the uniformity
                    observable in the operations of nature, where similar objects are constantly
                    conjoined together, and the mind is determined by custom to infer the one from
                    the appearance of the other. These two circumstances form the whole of that
                    necessity which we ascribe to matter. Beyond the constant conjunction of similar
                    objects, and the consequent inference from one to the other, we have no notion
                    of any necessity or connection.” He then gives a pretty long detail to prove a
                    great uniformity among the actions of men in all nations and ages; and concludes
                    that part of his argument with affirming, “not only that the conjunction between
                    motives and voluntary actions is as regular and uniform as that between the
                    cause and effect in any part of nature; but also, that this regular conjunction
                    has been universally acknowledged among mankind, and has never been the subject
                    of dispute either in philosophy or common life.” He afterwards observes, “That
                    men begin at the wrong end of this question concerning liberty and necessity,
                    when they enter upon it by examining the faculties of the soul, the influence of
                    the understanding, and the operations of the will. Let them first discuss a more
                    simple question, namely, the operations of body, and of brute unintelligent
                    matter, and try whether they can there form any idea of causation and necessity,
                    except that of a constant conjunction of objects, and subsequent inference of
                    the mind from one to another. If these circumstances form in reality the whole
                    of that necessity which we conceive in matter, and if these circumstances be
                    also universally acknowledged to take place in the operations of the mind, the
                    dispute is at an end; at least must be owned to be thenceforth merely verbal.
                    When we consider how aptly natural and moral evidence link together, and form
                    only one chain of argument, we shall make no scruple to allow that they are of
                    the same nature, and derived from the same principles. Between a connected chain
                    of natural causes and voluntary actions, the mind feels no difference in passing
                    from one link to another; nor is less certain of a future event which depends
                    upon motives and volitions, than if it were connected with the objects present
                    to the memory and senses by a train of causes, cemented together by what we are
                    pleased to call a physical necessity. The same experienced union has the same
                    effect on the mind, whether the united objects be motives, volition and action,
                    or figure and motion. We may change the names of things, but their nature and
                    their operation on the understanding never change.”</p>
                <p>Dr Priestley, in words a little different, teaches the very same doctrine which
                    was taught by Mr Hume. “In every determination of the mind,” says he,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Doctrine of Philosophical
                    Necessity illustrated.</p></note> “or in cases where volition and choice are
                    concerned, all the previous circumstances to be considered are the state of mind
                    (including every thing belonging to the will itself), and the views of things
                    presented to it; the latter of which is generally called the motive, though
                    under this term some writers comprehend them both. To distinguish the manner in
                    which events depending upon will and choice are produced, from those in which no
                    volition is concerned, the former are said to be produced voluntarily, and the
                    latter mechanically. But the same general maxims apply to them both. We may not
                    be able to determine <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> how a man will act in any
                    particular case; but it is because we are not particularly acquainted with his
                    disposition of mind, precise situation, and views of things. But neither can we
                    tell in which way the wind will blow to-morrow, though the air is certainly
                    subject to no other than necessary laws of motion.</p>
                <p>“It is universally acknowledged, that there can be no effect without an .adequate
                    cause. This is even the foundation on which the only proper argument for the
                    being of a God rests. And the necessarian asserts, that if, in any given state
                    of mind, with respect both to disposition and motives, two different
                    determinations or volitions be possible, it can be so on no other principle,
                    than that one of them shall come under the description of an effect without a
                    cause; just as the beam of a balance might incline either way, though loaded
                    with equal weights. It is acknowledged, that the mechanism of the balance is of
                    one kind, and that of the mind of another; and, therefore, it may be convenient
                    to denominate them by different words; as, for instance, that of the balance may
                    be termed a physical, and that of the mind a moral mechanism. But still, if
                    there be a real mechanism in both cases, so that there can be only one result
                    from the same previous circumstances, there will be a real necessity, enforcing
                    an absolute certainty in the event. For it must be understood, that all that is
                    ever meant by necessity in a cause, is that which produces certainty in the
                    effect.”</p>
                <p>Such is the nature of human volitions, according to every necessarian of eminence
                    who has written upon the subject since the days of Hobbes; and if this theory be
                    just, if there be a constant and inseparable conjunction of motives and actions
                    similar to that of cause and effect in physics, it is obvious, that in volition
                    the mind is as inert as body is in motion. This consequence is indeed avowed and
                    insisted upon by Hume, Priestley, and their adherents; whilst the advocates of
                    human liberty, on the other hand, contend for an absolute exemption of the will
                    from all internal necessity, arising from its own frame and constitution, the
                    impulse of superior beings, or the operations of objects, reasons, or motives.
                    By this, however, they do not mean, that between motives and volitions there is
                    no relation whatever, or that a man can ever choose evil as evil, or refuse good
                    as good. Such an assertion would be contrary to consciousness and universal
                    experience. But what they endeavour to prove is, that the conjunction of motive
                    and volition is not inseparable, like that of cause and effect in physics; that
                    a man may in most cases choose according to any one of two or more motives
                    presented to his view; that by choosing any thing, he may make it in some
                    measure agreeable by his own act, or, to speak more properly, may bend his
                    desire to it; that in volition, the mind is not inert; and that, therefore,we
                    are under no necessity to act in a particular manner in any given case
                    whatever.</p>
                <p>That the conjunction of motive and action is not constant like that of· cause and
                    effect in physics, and that by consequence the mind in forming volitions is not
                    inert, has been evinced by Dr Gregory with the force and precision of
                    mathematical demonstration. Former writers on the side of liberty had often
                    observed, that upon the supposition of the inertia of mind, a man, with equal
                    and opposite motives presented at once to his view, would, during their
                    continuance, remain perfectly at rest, like a balance equally loaded in both
                    scales. The observation is <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208805"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8805-0691"/>admitted to be just by all the advocates for
                    necessity; but they contrive to evade its consequences, by denying that in any
                    given ease a man can be at once assailed by two equal and opposite motives.
                    Thus, when it is said that a porter, standing with his face due north, must
                    remain in that position at perfect rest, as long as equal motives shall at once
                    be offered to him for travelling eastward and westward, the necessarians admit
                    the force of the argument; but when it is added that a guinea, offered for every
                    mile that he should travel in each of these opposite directions, ought therefore
                    to fix him at rest till one of the offers be withdrawn, they deny that the
                    desire of gaining the guineas is the whole of the motives which operate upon his
                    mind. He may have, say they, some secret reason which we cannot discern for
                    preferring the one direction to the other; and that reason, added to the guinea,
                    will make him go eastward or westward, just as an ounce thrown into either scale
                    of a balance poised by equal weights will make that scale preponderate. Though
                    we think that this solution of the difficulty can satisfy no man who is not
                    already biassed to the necessarian system; and though, even were it to be
                    admitted, it seems to militate against the constant conjunction of motives and
                    actions, unless it can be proved that the porter must travel the road which he
                    has been necessitated to choose with reluctance and a heavy heart; yet as it may
                    admit of endless quibbling upon ambiguous words, the philosophical world is much
                    indebted to Dr Gregory<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Essay on the Relation between Motive and Action.</p></note> for an argument
                    which, in our opinion, can neither be overturned nor evaded, and which
                    demonstrates that the conjunction of motive and action cannot be constant and
                    inseparable, like that of cause and effect in physics.</p>
                <p>His reasoning is to this purpose: Suppose a porter to be offered a guinea for
                    every mile that he shall travel directly eastward. If there be no physical cause
                    or moral motive to keep him at rest, or to induce him to move in another
                    direction, there cannot be a doubt, upon either hypothesis, but he will gladly
                    embrace the proposal, and travel in the direction pointed out to him, till he
                    shall have gained as much money as to satisfy his most avaricious desires. The
                    same thing would have happened if a guinea had been offered for every mile that
                    he should travel due south. In these two eases taken separately, the relation
                    between the man’s motions and his actions would be strikingly analogous to that
                    between a single impulse and motion in physies. Let us now suppose the two
                    offers to be made at the same instant, and the man to be assured, that if he
                    travel eastward he can have no part of the reward promised for his travelling to
                    the south, and that if he travel southward he can have no part of the Reward
                    promised for his travelling to the east. What is he to do in this case? If his
                    mind be inert in volition, and if the two motives operate upon him with the same
                    necessity that causes operate in physics, it is obvious that the man could
                    travel neither towards the east nor towards the south, but in a diagonal
                    direction from north-west to south-east; and this he must do willingly, although
                    perfeetly satisfied that he could gain nothing by his journey. As this inference
                    is contrary to fact and universal experience, the doctor very justly concludes
                    that the premises from which it is deduced by mathematical reasoning must also
                    be false and absurd; or, in other words, that the relation between motive and
                    action cannot be that of constant conjunction, like the relation between cause
                    and effect in physics.</p>
                <p>He uses many arguments of the same kind, and equally convincing, to prove the
                    absurdity of supposing the inert-ιess of mind, and only an occasional
                    conjunction of ιno- .ives and actions; but we forbear to quote them, both
                    because we wish his book to be read, and because we think the single argument
                    which we have borrowed from him sufficient to demolish the theory of Priestley
                    and Hume, which rests wholly upon the hypothesis of the constant conjunction of
                    motive and action.</p>
                <p>But is it then not really true, that the external action is determined by the
                    will, the will by desire, and desire by what is agreeable or disagreeable? That
                    the external action is universally determined by the will, is certainly true;
                    but that the will is necessitated and universally determined by the desire, is
                    as certainly false. If Potiphar’s wife was handsome, and made her proposals to
                    Joseph with any degree of female address, and if his constitution was like that
                    of other young men, there cannot be a doubt but that he felt a desire to do what
                    she requested of him; yet we know that he willed to do otherwise, and, in direct
                    opposition to his desire, fled from the room. Perhaps it may be said, that his
                    volition to flee was the effect of a contrary and stronger desire not to sin
                    against God; but this is confounding the reader, by calling two energies of
                    mind, between which there is little or no similarity, by the same name. He
                    perceived, or knew, that to comply with his mistress’s request would be to sin
                    against God; he knew that he ought not to sin against God, and therefore he
                    chose or determined himself not to do it. We can easily conceive how the
                    .presence, attitudes, and address, of the lady' might be agreeable to him, and
                    excite desire. There may very possibly be more than one of our readers who,
                    during the course of their lives, have experienced something of the same kind;
                    but could abstract truth be in the same way agreeable, so as to excite in his
                    mind a desire of virtue sufficient to annihilate or banish the desire of the
                    woman? As well may it be said that one sensation can annihilate another, that
                    the beautiful colours of the rainbow can remove the sensation of stench from the
                    mind of him who is plunged into the midst of a dunghill, or that the smell of a
                    rose can make a man insensible to the pain of a stroke inflicted by a bludgeon.
                    In fact, sensual desire, and the perception of duty, are things so totally
                    different, that to consider them as operating against each other, like different
                    weights in the opposite scales of a balance, is as absurd as to suppose that
                    sound can operate against colour, or colour against smell. A man may prefer
                    sound to colour, or colour to smell, and. act accordingly; but the determination
                    must be wholly his own, unless these two sensations be themselves either agents
                    or physical causes of the same kind, like the weights in the opposite scales of
                    the balance.</p>
                <p>•The advocates for liberty do not pretend, that in matters of importance a man
                    ever actsavithout some motive or reason for his conduct. All that they insist
                    upon is, that between two or more motives of different kinds he has a liberty of
                    choice, and that he does not always determine himself by that which he knows to
                    be the greatest. Without such freedom, they think men might be often brought
                    into situations where they could not act at all, and where inaction would at the
                    same time be in the highest degree absurd. Thus, were two bags of gold,
                    containing each a thousand or ten thousand guineas, to be placed on the same
                    table, before a man whose family is perishing for want, and were the man to be
                    told that he might take either of them, but not both, is it conceivable that he
                    would be held in perpetual suspense between the two? No; he would instantly and
                    with alacrity take up one of them, without feeling the least regret for the want
                    of the other. This action would, indeed, be the consequence of a very powerful
                    motive, the desire to obtain honestly that wealth of which he and his family
                    stood so much in need. That motive, however, being general, would draw him
                    equally to both <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208818" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8818-0692"
                    />bags; and it remains with the necessarians to say by what else than a
                    self-determining power he could take either the one or the other. When it is
                    affirmed, that such self-determination would be an effect without a cause, the
                    advocates of liberty cannot help thinking that their antagonists are guilty of
                    advancing as an argument a <hi rend="italic">petitio principii</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for the affirmation is true only if the mind in volition be
                    inert, and the <hi rend="italic">inertia</hi> of the mind is the sole question
                    at issue. If the mind be not inert, it is plain, that in consequence of a man’s
                    self-determination, no effect'would be produced without a sufficient cause. At
                    any rate, motives cannot be causes. In the proper sense of the word, a cause is
                    that which produces an effect; but the production of an effect requires active
                    power; and power being a quality, must be the quality of some being by whom it
                    may be exerted. Power maybe dormant, and therefore power without will produces
                    no effect. Arc motives, then, real beings endowed with power and will? No; they
                    are only views of things or mental conceptions, which in the strictest sense of
                    the word are passive; and between two motives the mind determines itself,
                    without receiving an impulse from either.</p>
                <p>Nor is it only between motives of equal force that men have the power of
                    determining themselves. Whoever believes in a future state of rewards and
                    punishments, and yet acts in a manner which he knows to be offensive to Him who
                    is to be the future and final judge, unquestionably prefers to the strongest of
                    all motives, another which even to himself appears to have comparatively but
                    very little strength. Whether there be men who occasionally act in this manner,
                    is a question which can be decided only by an appeal to every one’s
                    consciousness. That there are, we can have no doubt; for we never met with a
                    single individual, not biassed by system, who was not ready to acknowledge, that
                    during the course of his life he had done many things, which at the time of
                    action he clearly perceived to be contrary to his true interest. Without a
                    self-determining power in his mind, this could never be the case. Did motives
                    operate with the necessity of physical causes, it is obvious that in every
                    possible situation the strongest must constantly prevail; and that he who in
                    certain circumstances had in time past done any particular thing, would on a
                    return of the same circumstances do the very same thing in every time future. Dr
                    Priestley, indeed, wishes to persuade his readers that this is actually the
                    case. “In every determination of the mind,” says he, “or in cases where volition
                    and choice are concerned, all the previous circumstances to be considered are
                    the state of mind (including every thing belonging to the will itself), and the
                    various views of things presented to it ;” and he affirms, that “whenever the
                    same precise circumstances occur twice, the very same determination or choice
                    will certainly be made the second time that was made the first.” This is an
                    assertion of which no man can controvert the truth, for it is an identical
                    proposition. If in the circumstances previous to the determination of the mind,
                    every thing belonging to the will itself must be included, it is self-evident,
                    that he who in any given circumstances has acted a particular part, will, on a
                    return of these circumstances, act the same part a second time; for this is only
                    saying, that he who bn two different occasions shall exert volitions of the same
                    tendency, will not on these occasions exert volitions of which the tendencies
                    are different. But the question to be decided is, whether a man, in the same
                    general state of mind, possessed of the same degree of health, and conscious of
                    the same appetites, must, in external circumstances perfectly alike, necessarily
                    exert at all times the same volitions. That the human mind is under no such
                    necessity, we think every man’s consciousness and experience may abundantly
                    satisfy him; for there arc, perhaps, but very few who have not at one time
                    resisted temptations, to which at another they have chosen to yield.</p>
                <p>That there is a relation between motives and actions, must be confessed; but that
                    relation is neither necessity nor constant conjunction. If it were, all actions
                    would be perfectly rational; and folly, as well as merit and demerit, would be
                    banished from the conduct of men. What is the particular nature of that relation
                    which subsists between the voluntary actions of men, and the motives from which
                    they proceed, can be known to every individual only by an attentive and
                    unbiassed reflection on the operations of his own mind. Without this reflection,
                    no man can be made to understand it by the reasonings of philosophers, and with
                    it no man can need the aid of those reasonings. That a self-determining power,
                    such as that for which we plead, contributes to the sum of human happiness, has
                    been shown by Archbishop King and his ingenious translator, who have proved,
                    with the force of demonstration, that the mind can take pleasure in the object
                    of its choice, although that object be in itself neither agreeable nor
                    disagreeable to our natural appetites; and that if it could not, it would be in
                    vain in such a world as ours to hope for any portion of felicity. Into that
                    detail our limits will not permit us to enter; but to the reader who wishes for
                    further information, we beg leave to recommend the last edition of King’s Origin
                    of Evil, by Dr Law, late bishop of Carlisle; without, however, vouching for the
                    truth of all the opinions advanced by either of those learned writers.</p>
                <p>Before we conclude this chapter, it may be proper to observe here, that it is
                    only in volition that we are conscious of any original active power in
                    ourselves, and that without such consciousness we could never have acquired the
                    notion of active power. In our desires and appetites, we neither are active nor
                    suppose ourselves active. Lord Kames, and most necessarians, confound desire
                    with volition; but that they are perfectly distinct is plain from this
                    circumstance, that we daily desire many things which we know to be wholly out of
                    our own power,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Reid’s
                    Essays on the Active Powers of Man.</p></note> whereas no man ever willed what
                    he did not believe to be in his own power. We all desire or wish that our
                    children may be virtuous, wise, and happy; and although we are conscious that it
                    is not in our power to make them so, we cannot banish the desire from our
                    breasts. But madmen only have ever willed virtue, and wisdom, and happiness, to
                    any person; and if there ever was a man so extravagantly mad as to exert such a
                    volition as this, he must at the time have fancied himself a divinity, and
                    therefore believed that the object of his volition depended upon himself. When
                    the astronomer, whose character is so admirably drawn by our great master of
                    moral wisdom,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ilasselas,
                    Prince of Abyssinia.</p></note> fancied himself the regulator of the weather and
                    the distributor of the seasons, he might will either rain or sunshine as he
                    thought proper, because he considered the object of his volition as depending
                    upon a power imparted to him from heaven; but though he might desire, he could
                    notwill, the rising or the falling of winds, for these he confessed were not
                    subjected to his authority. In a word, without freedom in volition, power is
                    inconceivable; and therefore it is as certain that we are free agents, as that

                <p>It has been already observed, that as of bodies there are various kinds, endowed
                    with various properties; so theprobability<pb break="no" facs="nls:194208831"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8831-0693"/> is, that of minds endowed with different powers,
                    or different degrees of power, the variety may be as great, or perhaps greater.
                    The existence and powers of our own minds are made known to us by consciousness
                    and reflection; and, from our dependent state, and the mutability of the objects
                    around us, we are necessarily led to infer the existence of another mind, which
                    is independent, unchangeable, eternal, and the cause of all things which have a
                    beginning of existence. Between that mind and our own we can hardly avoid
                    believing that there are many orders of “thrones, dominations, princedoms,
                    virtues, powers ;” but as we possess no intuitive knowledge of such intermediate
                    beings, and cannot, from any thing which we perceive, discern the necessity of
                    their existence, they are not properly the object of science. The existence,
                    however, and many of the attributes, of the One First Cause, are capable of the
                    strictest demonstration; “for the invisible things of him from the creation of
                    the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are made.”</p>
                <p>Of this great truth, the most important by far which can occupy the mind of man,
                    many demonstrations have been given both by divines and by philosophers. We
                    shall lay before our readers such an one as to us appears perfectly conclusive,
                    being founded on the intuitive knowledge which we have of our own existence, and
                    therefore independent of all theories about the nature and reality of the
                    material world.</p>
                <p>Every man, whether he adopt the common theory or that of Berkeley respecting
                    matter, is conscious that he himself exists, and must therefore grant that
                    something now exists. But if any thing exists now,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Mites to King’s Origin of
                    Evil.</p></note> then must something have existed always; otherwise that thing
                    which now exists must either have been created by nothing, that is, have been
                    caused by no cause, or else it must have created itself, acting before it
                    existed. Both these suppositions are so palpably absurd, that no atheist has
                    avowed them, either amongst the ancients or the moderns. We must therefore
                    admit, either that there is some one independent being, which now exists, and
                    always has existed; or that the things which we know to exist at present (every
                    man’s self, for instance) were produced by something which had its existence
                    from something else, which also depended upon some other cause, and so on in an
                    infinite series of caused or successive beings; But this last supposition,
                    though it has been often made, is as grossly absurd as either of the two former.
                    For of this infinite series, either some one part has not been successive to any
                    other, or else all the several parts of it have been successive. If some one
                    part of it was not successive, then it had a first part, which destroys the
                    supposition of its infinity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>T <hi rend="italic">ως ἀπειgωγ ὀυϰ ἐστw ὀυδεv πgωτoγ</hi>

                    all the several parts of it have been successive, then have they all once been
                    future; but if they have all been future, a time may be conceived when none of
                    them had existence; and if so, then it follows, either that all the parts, and
                    consequently the whole of this infinite series, must have arisen from nothing,
                    which is absurd; or else that there must be something in the whole besides what
                    is contained in all the parts, which is also absurd.</p>
                <p>As the possibility or impossibility of an infinite series of dependent beings is
                    the main question at issue between the atheists and us, we shall state the
                    preceding reasoning in a manner somewhat different. For this purpose, let us
                    suppose some one to affirm that the course of generation has had no beginning,
                    and consequently that the number of successive births has been infinite. We
                    would ask such a person, whether, before the birth of Abraham, for example,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See an Essay towards an
                    Eviction of the Attributes of God, by Seth Ward. Printed at Oxford,
                    1055.</p></note> there had passed an infinite series of generations or not? If
                    not, the course of generation must have had a beginning, which is the conclusion
                    for which we contend. But if the series past was infinite, then at the birth of
                    Joseph, the great-grandson of Abraham, it is evident that more generations were
                    past, and that the number then was greater than that which was supposed to be
                    infinite; so that upon this supposition we have a number that is both infinite
                    and not infinite, which is a manifest contradiction. Should it be said that the
                    number of generations was infinite, as well at the birth of Abraham as at the
                    birth of Joseph; it will then follow, that one infinite may be greater than
                    another of the very same kind, and consequently that an infinite may be bounded,
                    that is, be finite. But should it be alleged, that the number of births at
                    Abraham’s was finite, and became infinite when it reached to Joseph’s, it will
                    then follow that one finite number added to another may make an infinite number,
                    which is directly contrary to every possible notion of infinity. We might argue
                    in the same manner against an infinite series of every kind, the very
                    supposition of which involves the most palpable contradictions. (See the Chapter
                    on Infinity and Eternity.)</p>
                <p>From the impossibility of an infinite series it necessarily follows, that there
                    exists, and must have existed from eternity, some one independent being, whose
                    duration cannot be commensurate with succession, and to whom the relation of
                    time is not applicable. Here will some atheists presently imagine, that by the
                    same mode of reasoning they may disprove the existence of God; for do not they
                    who thus destroy the eternity of the world, destroy at the same time the
                    eternity of the Creator? If time itself be not eternal, how can the Deity or any
                    thing else be so?</p>
                <p>In urging these questions, it must be taken for granted that time is essential to
                    all existence, and that God cannot be eternal otherwise then by a successive
                    flux of infinite time. But it has been already shown, in treating of time, that
                    successive duration is not essential to existence; that we can even conceive
                    existence without succession; and it may here be added, that if we suppose a
                    perfect being alone in nature, we shall find it impossible to imagine any
                    succession of ideas, any flux of moments, or any alteration or increase whatever
                    in his knowledge and essence. Such duration as we are acquainted with can have
                    no relation to an immutable Being, whilst supposed to exist alone; but as soon
                    as he determined to exercise his several attributes in the production of
                    something distinct from himself, then, and not till then, have we reason to
                    think that time, succession, and increase, began. These atheistical questions,
                    therefore, instead of containing an objection to the existence of a Deity,
                    afford a plain demonstration of it; for since it is more evident that something
                    now exists, than that something must have existed from eternity, and since it
                    has been shown, that neither the world in its present state, nor time, nor
                    indeed any thing capable of change or succession, can possibly be eternal, it
                    follows that there must necessarily be some Being who, in the order of nature,
                    is before time, and who, in the stability and immutable perfection of his own
                    intelligence, comprehends at once his yesterday, to-day, and for ever. “The
                    atheists,” says the excellent Cudworth,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Intellectual System, book i. chap. 5.</p></note> “can here

                    standing eternity of the Deity (which with so much reason hath been contended
                    for by the ancient genuine theists) were nothing but a pitiful small moment of
                    time standing still, and as if the duration of all beings whatsoever must needs
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208844" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8844-0694"/>be like our
                    own; whereas the duration of every thing must of necessity be agreeable to its
                    nature; and therefore, as that whose imperfect nature is ever flowing like a
                    river, and consists in continual motion and changes one after another, must
                    needs have accordingly a successive and flowing duration sliding perpetually
                    from present into past, and always hasting on towards the future, expecting
                    something of itself which is not yet in being; so must that whose perfect nature
                    is essentially immutable have permanent and unchanging duration, never losing
                    any thing of itself once present, nor yet running forward to meet something of
                    itself which is not yet in being.”</p>
                <p>From the eternity of the Supreme Being we necessarily infer his independence or
                    self-existence; for that which never had a beginning of existence cannot
                    possibly have any cause of that existence, or in any manner depend upon any
                    other being, but must exist of itself, or be self-existent. Eternity <hi
                    rend="italic">ad partem post,</hi> or necessary existence, or the impossibility
                    of ever ceasing to be, follows from independence; for to the nature of that
                    which exists without any cause, existence must be essential. But a being whose
                    existence is of itself, and essential to its nature, cannot be indifferent to
                    existence or non-existence, but must exist necessarily. And here it may be
                    proper to observe, that the word <hi rend="italic">necessity,</hi> when applied
                    to existence, may be taken in two acceptations very different from each
                    other;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Notes to King on
                    Evil; and Law’s Inquiry into the Ideas of Space, &amp;c.</p></note> either as it
                    arises from the relation which the existence of that being, of which it is
                    affirmed, has to the existence of other things; or from the relation which the
                    actual existence of that thing has to the manner of its own existence.</p>
                <p>In the former sense, when necessity of existence has relation to the existence of
                    other things, it denotes that the supposition of the non-existence of that thing
                    of which necessity is affirmed, implies the non-existence of things which we
                    know to exist. Thus, some independent being does necessarily exist; because, to
                    suppose no independent being, implies that there are no dependent beings, the
                    contrary of which we know to be true. In the second sense, when the necessity of
                    existence arises from the relation which the actual existence of any thing has
                    to the manner of its own existence, necessity means, that the thing of which it
                    is affirmed exists after such a manner as that it never could in time past have
                    been non-existent, nor can in time future cease to be. Thus, every independent
                    being, as it exists without a cause, is necessarily existing, because existence
                    is essential to such a being; so that it never could begin to exist, and never
                    can cease to be. For to suppose a being to begin to exist, or to lose its
                    existence, is to suppose a change from nonentity to entity, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >vice versa;</hi> and to suppose such a change is to suppose a cause upon which
                    that being depends. Every being, therefore, which is independent, that is, which
                    had no cause of its existence, must exist necessarily, and cannot possibly have
                    begun to exist in time past, or cease to be in time future.</p>
                <p>These two kinds of necessity, as applied to existence, though they have been
                    often confounded, are in themselves perfectly distinct; for though a being
                    cannot be necessarily existent in the former sense without being so in the
                    latter also, yet may it be necessarily existent in the latter sense without
                    being so in the former. For any thing that we know to the contrary, there may be
                    two or more beings existing necessarily in the latter sense of the word
                    necessity, that is, with regard to independence and the manner of their own
                    existence; but in the former sense of the word, or in relation to this system,
                    there can be but one necessarily existent being; for it is obvious that no more
                    are necessary to account for the production of the dependent beings which we
                    know to exist. To suppose the non-existence of all independent beings, implies
                    the non-existence of all dependent beings, ourselves, and every thing else; but
                    to suppose the non-existence of all independent beings except one, involves in
                    the supposition no such absurdity.</p>
                <p>Thus the phenomena of nature lead us, by the strictest reasoning, to one First
                    Cause, which is sufficient for their production; and therefore none but one
                    First Cause canin this sense of the word be necessary. And though several more
                    independent beings might possibly exist, yet they would be no gods to us; they
                    would have no relation to us demonstrable by reason, nor we any thing to do with
                    them. For if the supposition of their existence were not requisite to the
                    production of this system, which it obviously would not be, we could not
                    perceive any necessity for it at all; we could never discover it by our own
                    faculties, and therefore it could be nothing to us. And although two or three
                    such beings should exist, and act in the formation and government of their
                    respective systems, or agree in one; yet, till their existence and operations
                    were made known to us, and a natural relation discovered, nothing could be due
                    from us to them. They would have no religious or moral relations to us; and we
                    should have no reason to call more than one of them our creator, preserver, and
                    governor, which is the proper sense of the word God.</p>
                <p>To show in this manner that there is only one eternal self-existent Being, which
                    bears the relation of God to us, seems to be going as far as is necessary, or as
                    natural light will lead us. Those who endeavour to demonstrate that there cannot
                    possibly be more than one self-existent Being, either reason in a circle, or
                    proceed upon principles which their antagonists cannot be compelled to admit.
                    When they deduce the divine unity from independence or omnipotence, they
                    evidently presuppose it in their definition of these attributes; and when they
                    infer it from the nature of space and duration, which they consider as modes of
                    the self-existent Being, they take it for granted that space and duration have a
                    real existence, independently of us and our thoughts; and that the one is
                    infinite and the other eternal, contrary to what has been already proved, we
                    think, with the force of demonstration. The celebrated Dr Clarke made much use
                    of space and duration in his attempt to demonstrate that there can be but one
                    self-existent Being; but he argues for the same thing from the nature of
                    necessity as applied to existence.</p>
                <p>“Necessity,” says he,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God, Prop. vii.</p></note>
                    “absolute in itself, is simple and uniform and universal, without any possible
                    difference, diffbrmity, or variety, whatsoever; and all variety or différence of
                    existence must needs arise from some external cause, and be dependent upon it,
                    and proportionable to the efficiency of that cause, whatsoever it be. Absolute
                    necessity, in which there can be no variation in any kind or degree, cannot be
                    the ground of existence of a number of beings, however similar and agreeing;
                    because, without any other difference, even number is itself a manifest
                    diffbrmity or inequality (if I may so speak) of efficiency or causality.”</p>
                <p>Such is this great man’s first argument from necessity, to prove that there
                    cannot be more-than one self-existent Being. But what is this necessity which
                    proves so much? It is the ground of existence, he says, of that which exists of
                    itself; and if so, it must, in the order of nature, and in that of our
                    conceptions, be antecedent to that being of whose existence it is the ground.
                    Concerning such a principle, there are but three suppositions which can possibly
                    be made; and all of them may be shown to be absurd and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208857" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8857-0695"/>contradictory. We may suppose
                    either the substance itself, some property of that substance, or something

                    of nature to the first cause.</p>
                <p>One would think, from the turn of the argument which here represents this
                    antecedent necessity as efficient and causal, that it were considered as
                    something extrinsic to the first cause.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    force of argument, they must be so understood, just as we understand them of any
                    external cause producing its effect. But as an extrinsic principle is absurd in
                    itself, and is besides rejected by Dr Clarke, who says expressly, that “of the
                    thing which derives not its being from any other thing, this necessity or ground
                    of existence must be in the thing itself,” we need not say a word more of the
                    last of these suppositions.</p>
                <p>Let us then consider the first; let us take the substance itself, and try whether
                    it can be conceived as prior or antecedent to itself in our conceptions, or in
                    the order of nature. Surely we need not observe that nothing can be more absurd
                    or contradictory than such a supposition. Dr Clarke himself repeatedly affirms,
                    and it would be strange indeed if he did not affirm, that no being, no thing
                    whatever, can be conceived as in any respect prior to the first cause.</p>
                <p>The only remaining supposition is, that some attribute or property of the
                    self-existent Being may be conceived as in the order of nature antecedent to
                    that being. But this, if possible, is more absurd than either of the two
                    preceding suppositions. An attribute is attributed to its subject as its ground
                    or support, and not the subject to its attribute. A property, in the very notion
                    of it, is proper to the substance to which it belongs, and subsequent to it both
                    in our conceptions and in the order of nature. An antecedent attribute, or
                    antecedent property, is a solecism as great, and a contradiction as flat, as an
                    antecedent subsequent or subsequent antecedent, understood in the same sense and
                    in the same syllogism. Every property or attribute, as such, presupposes its
                    subject, and cannot otherwise be understood. This is a truth so obvious and so
                    forcible, that it sometimes extorts the assent even of those who upon other
                    occasions labour to obscure it. It is confessed by Dr Clarke,<note

                    Letter.</p></note> that “the scholastic way of proving the existence of the
                    self-existent Being from the absolute perfection of his nature, is <hi
                    rend="italic">ιιστεgον πgοτεξον.</hi> For all or any perfections,” says he,
                    “presupposes existence, which is a <hi rend="italic">petitio principii”</hi> If
                    therefore properties, modes, or attributes in God, be considered as perfections
                    (and it is impossible to consider them as any thing else), then, by this
                    confession of the great author himself, they must all or any of them presuppose
                    existence. It is indeed immediately added in the same place, “that bare
                    necessity of existence does not presuppose, but infer existence ;” which is true
                    only if such necessity be supposed to be a principle extrinsic, the absurdity of
                    which supposition has been already shown, and is indeed universally confessed.
                    If it be a mode or a property, it must presuppose the existence of its subject,
                    as certainly and as evidently as it is a mode or a property. It might perhaps
                    <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> infer the existence of its subject, as
                    effects may infer a cause; but that it should in the other way <hi rend="italic"
                    >a priori,</hi> is altogether as impossible as that a triangle should be a
                    square, or a globe a parallelogram.</p>
                <p>Doubtful, as it would seem, of the force of his first argument, which even those
                    who pretend to be convinced )y it acknowledge to be obscure, the doctor gives a
                    second, vhich we must confess appears to us to be still more ob scure, and if
                    possible less conclusive. “To suppose two or more distinct beings existing of
                    themselves necessarily and independent of each other, implies,” he says, “this
                    contradiction, that each of them being independent from the other, they may
                    either of them be supposed to exist alone; so that it will be no contradiction
                    to suppose the other not to exist; and consequently neither of them will be
                    necessarily' existing. Whatsoever therefore exists necessarily is the one simple
                    essence of the self-existent Being; and whatsoever differs from that is not
                    necessarily existing, because in absolute necessity there can be no difference
                    or diversity of existence.</p>
                <p>“Necessity is used here in two different senses,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Law’s Inquiry into the Ideas of Space,
                    &amp;c· chap, vi.</p></note> both as absolute and relative. In the former,
                    neither of the two beings can exist without the other, that is, without our
                    supposing the other to exist also, since that is equally necessary. In the
                    latter, either of them may exist alone, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> as without
                    the help of the other, or without the supposition of the other as requisite to
                    its own existence. The consequence, therefore, that either of them may exist
                    alone, and so neither of them is necessary·, is a mere equivocation on
                    necessity, using it both in an absolute and relative sense at the same time.”
                    But as this is a question of the highest importance., and as the author was a
                    m¾n of great worth, we shall consider his argument upon the supposition that the
                    word <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> has from the beginning to the end of it
                    the same invariable meaning.</p>
                <p>It has already been observed, that there are only two senses in which the word
                    <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> can be applied to the existence of any being;
                    and whether it be here used in the one or the other of these senses, the
                    reasoning, if resolved into a syllogism, will appear to be inconclusive. If the
                    word be taken in that sense of necessity which arises from the relation that
                    dependent beings which we know to exist bear to some one independent Being, the
                    argument will stand thus :—From a known effect no more causes can be necessarily
                    inferred than what are sufficient to account for that effect; but one
                    self-existent and independent Being is sufficient to account for all the
                    phenomena of nature; therefore, from the phenomena, &amp;c. no more than one
                    such being can be necessarily inferred to exist.</p>
                <p>But although no more than one independent being can in this sense of the word
                    necessarily exist, it by no means follows from this syllogism, that two or more
                    such beings may not possibly exist. It is, indeed, a plain contradiction to say,
                    that two or more self-existent beings are in this sense necessary; but surely
                    there is no contradiction in saying that two or twenty of such beings are
                    possible. We could not, therefore, by this argument convict a person of
                    absurdity, who should affirm that two or more independent beings actually exist.
                    We might indeed deny the existence of them all but one, because one is
                    sufficient to account for those phenomena, from which alone we know that any
                    independent being exists; but because one of them might be supposed to exist
                    alone, so that it would be no contradiction to suppose the other not to exist;
                    we know not how the doctor came to affirm, in direct opposition to his own
                    demonstration, that not one of them would be necessarily existing.</p>
                <p>Necessity, as applied to existence, in the other sense of the word, arises, as we
                    have seen, from the relation which the actual existence of the being of which it
                    may be affirmed, has to the manner of that being’s existence. It is the same
                    necessity, we are told,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Answer to the Sixth Letter from a Gentleman in Gloucestershire.</p></note>
                    with that which is the cause of the unalterable proportion between two and four;
                    and it is considered as the formal cause or ground of the existence of an
                    independent being. Were it not for the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208870"

                    cause</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ground of existence,</hi> we should have no
                    objection to this account of that necessity by which a being independent
                    undoubtedly exists; but this kind of necessity is a principle which will not
                    support the superstructure which the learned author labours to raise upon it.
                    The same necessity which is the cause of the unalterable proportion between two
                    and four, is likewise the cause of the unalterable proportion between three and
                    six, between four and eight, and between five and ten, &amp;c. But if it can be
                    the cause of so many different proportions of the same kind, why may it not be
                    the formal cause or ground of existence to as many independent beings of the
                    same kind, as well as to one? The following syllogism we apprehend to be
                    legitimate both in mode and figure, and its conclusion is directly contrary to
                    the proposition which the doctor deduces from the same notion of necessity.</p>
                <p>If necessity, considered as a formal cause or ground of existence, be in one
                    instance of its causality the formal cause or ground of existence to many things
                    of the same kind, it may likewise, in every other instance of its causality, be
                    the formal cause or ground of existence to many things of the same kind. But
                    such necessity, in that instance ofMts causality where it is the formal cause or
                    ground of existence to the unalterable proportion between two and four, is the
                    formal cause or ground of existence to many proportions of the same kind.
                    Therefore, the same necessity in that other instance of its causality where it
                    is said to be the formal cause or ground of existence to one independent being,
                    may undoubtedly be the formal cause or ground of existence to many independent
                    beings of the same kind.</p>
                <p>Thus it appears that necessity, in any sense in which it can be properly affirmed
                    of existence, cannot be the foundation of any argument to prove the
                    impossibility of more than one self-existent being. It is indeed a principle
                    from which we apprehend that no positive conclusion whatsoever can be deduced by
                    reasoning <hi rend="italic">a priori.</hi> That necessity of existence may be
                    predicated of a being which is independent and uncreated, is self-evident;
                    because to the nature of such a being existence is essential. But whilst that
                    nature itself remains wholly incomprehensible by us, it is impossible that we
                    should discover, by our own unassisted reason, whether it can be the nature of
                    only one, or of more than one, independent being. To argue from necessity, as if
                    it were the cause or ground of existence to such a being, is certainly absurd,
                    if it be not impious; for if that to which existence is essential, does not
                    exist without any cause efficient or formal, we shall be obliged to inquire
                    after a cause or ground of this cause, and thus be involved in all the
                    absurdities and contradictions of an infinite series. We have insisted the
                    longer on this point, because necessity, as the foundation of the argument <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori,</hi> has sometimes been employed to very bad purposes.
                    Attempts have indeed been made, from the notion of necessary existence, to prove
                    that the Supreme Being cannot be a free agent, and to set the first principles
                    of the religion of nature at variance with those which are revealed in the
                    Scriptures.</p>
                <p>But although we are firmly persuaded that the divine unity cannot be demonstrated
                    <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> we are far from thinking it incapable of any
                    proof. On the contrary, the common arguments <hi rend="italic">a
                    posteriori,</hi> drawn from the order and harmony of the world, have always
                    satisfied us, and in our opinion must satisfy every person capable of
                    proportioning his assent to evidence, that the Creator and Preserver of such a
                    system has but one will and one intelligence, and therefore is himself but one
                    being. But proof is one thing, and demonstration is, in the proper sense of the

                <p>The being which is self-existent and independent must be also omnipotent. That
                    such a being has active power in some degree, is shown at the same time and by
                    the same medium that we prove his existence; and since he depends upon no cause
                    for his existence or his power, he cannot depend upon any for the exertion of
                    that power, and consequently no limits can be applied to it. Limitation is an
                    effect of some superior cause, which in the present instance there cannot be;
                    consequently, to suppose limits where there can be no limiter, is to suppose an
                    effect without a cause. For a being to be limited or deficient in any
                    respect,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Notes to King
                    on Evil.</p></note> is to be dependent in that respect on some other being which
                    gave it just so much and no more; consequently that being which in no respect
                    depends upon any other is in no respect limited or deficient. In all beings
                    capable of increase or diminution, and consequently incapable of perfection or
                    absolute infinity, limitation or defect is indeed a necessary consequence of
                    existence, and is only a negation of that perfection which is wholly
                    incompatible with their nature; and therefore in these beings it requires no
                    further cause. But in a being naturally capable of perfection or absolute
                    infinity, all imperfection or finiteness, as it cannot flow from the nature of
                    that being, appears to require some ground or reason; which reason, as it is
                    foreign to the being itself, must be the effect of some other external cause,
                    and consequently cannot have place in the first cause. That the self-existent
                    being is capable of perfection or absolute infinity must be granted, because he
                    is manifestly the subject of one infinite or perfect attribute, namely eternity,
                    or absolute invariable existence. In this respect his existence has been shown
                    to be perfect, and therefore it may be perfect in every other respect also. Now
                    that which is the subject of one finite attribute or perfection, must have all
                    its attributes infinitely or in perfection; since to have any perfections in a
                    finite limited manner, when the subject and these perfections are both capable
                    of strict infinity, would be the absurdity before mentioned of positive
                    limitation without a cause. To suppose this eternal and independent being
                    limited in or by its own nature, is to suppose some antecedent nature or
                    limiting quality superior to that being, to the existence of which no thing, no
                    quality, is in any respect antecedent or superior. And to suppose that there is
                    no such thing as active power in a <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208883"

                    power, is the grossest of all absurdities. The same method of reasoning will
                    prove that knowledge and every other perfection is infinite in the Deity, when
                    once we have proved that perfection to belong to him at all; at least it will
                    show, that to suppose it limited is unreasonable, since we can find no manner of
                    ground for limitation in any respect; and this is as far as we require to go, or
                    perhaps as natural reason will lead us.</p>
                <p>Of the omnipotence of the Supreme Being, some philosophers, as well theists as
                    atheists, have talked very absurdly. Hobbes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    a view to make this attribute appear impossible and ridiculous, affirms “that
                    God by his omnipotence or infinite power could turn a tree into a syllogism.”
                    And Descartes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    childishly asserts, that all things whatever, even abstract truth and falsehood,
                    do so depend upon the arbitrary will and power of God, as that if he had
                    pleased, “twice two should not have been four, nor the three angles of a plane
                    triangle equal to two right ones.” But the true motion of Omnipotence, so far
                    from implying a power to turn a tree into a syllogism, or to make twice two not
                    equal to four, implies only that the Being possessed of it can actually perform
                    whatever can be conceived by the most perfect understanding, conception in this
                    case being the measure of possibility. Now every thing may be conceived by a
                    mind sufficiently enlarged, which does not involve in it a direct contradiction;
                    but what we clearly discern to imply a contradiction, such as that a thing may
                    be and not be at the same instant, cannot be conceived by any intellect, or made
                    to exist by any power. And thus has this attribute of the Deity been always
                    stated, not only by the wiser Christians, but also by most of the ancient
                    philosophers, who expressly admit that “nothing is exempted from the divine
                    power, but only to make that which has been done to be undone.”</p>
                <p>And here it may be asked, whether creation, in the proper sense of the word, be
                    within the compass of infinite power. All the ancient philosophers, who were
                    unenlightened by the rays of divine revelation, held that it is not;<note

                    grounding their opinion on the well-known maxim, <hi rend="italic">Ex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nihilo</hi><hi rend="italic">nihil fit.</hi> But this maxim will
                    support no such conclusion. The ancients, or at least the Peripatetic school,
                    with the metaphysics of which we are bestacquainted, considered fortr kinds of
                    causes, the efficient, the material, the formal, and the final; and though they
                    extended the maxim to the first two, if not to all these causes, it is a
                    self-evident truth only when applied to the efficient cause. Without the actual
                    exertion of power, it is indeed most certain that nothing could have been
                    brought into existence; but it is so far from being clear that pre-cxistent
                    matter, or, as Aristotle chose to express himself, a material cause, must be
                    supposed for infinite power to operate upon, that we think every man may
                    discover complete evidence of the contrary in himself. That sensation,
                    intelligence, consciousness, and volition, are not the result of any
                    modifications of figure and motion, is a truth as evident as that consciousness
                    is not swift, nor volition square. If, then, these be the powers or properties
                    of a being distinct from matter, which we think capable of the most complete
                    proof, every man who does not believe that his mind has existed and been
                    conscious from eternity, must be convinced that the power of creation has been
                    exerted in himself. If it be denied that there is any immaterial substance in
                    man, still it must be confessed, that, as matter is not essentially conscious,
                    and cannot be made so by any particular organization,-there is some real thing
                    or entity, call it what you plcase, which has either existed and been conscious
                    from eternity, or which has been in time brought from nonentity into existence
                    by an exertion of infinite power.</p>
                <p>To this perhaps some one may object, that upon our own supposition of the
                    inability of the human mind to exert its faculties except in union with some
                    material and organized system, the mind of every man may have existed from
                    eternity without being conscious of its own existence; and that, therefore, we
                    have in ourselves no evidence of creation, but only of the union of two
                    self-existent substances, which, in their prior state, had been distinct and
                    separate from each other. But such an objection as this which we have now stated
                    can arise from nothing but misapprehension of our hypothesis, and of the reasons
                    by which it has been supported. We suppose, that to the exertion of the human
                    faculties, a body of some kind or other may be necessary as an instrument, not
                    merely from what we observe of the dependence of perception and memory upon the
                    state of the brain, but because we cannot conceive a Creator of infinite wisdom
                    and goodness to immerse in systems of matter, minds to which he knows that such
                    systems must always be useless, and often hurtful. We believe, therefore, that
                    our souls and bodies were created and formed for each other; but as our present
                    adversaries admit not of a Creator, we must ask them, How their self-existent
                    souls have been disposed of from eternity, and by what power they have all in
                    due succession been united each to its proper body? As before the union they
                    were not conscious, they could not unite themselves; and to suppose them united
                    by sonic superior intelligence, is to suppose them in some respects dependent
                    upon that intelligence, which seems not to accord with their self-existence.
                    Whatever is self-existent and eternal must be independent; and if possessed of
                    any power, it cannot be conceived to have that power limited. We repeat,
                    therefore, that every man has in himself sufficient evidence that creation is
                    possible; for if infinite power can create an immaterial and percipient being,
                    it may surely be supposed capable of creating dead and unintelligent matter.</p>
                <p>But the creation of the material system may be shown to be in the highest degree
                    probable by other arguments. The same reasoning which proves the impossibility
                    of an infinite series and of eternal time, proves that the universe cannot have
                    existed from eternity in its present state. But if it has not existed from
                    eternity in its present state, it belongs to the opponents of creation to say
                    what was its former state. We talk indeed of chaos; but such language, when a
                    Creator is not admitted, is most unphilosophical trifling. It appears from the
                    most accurate inquiries which have been made into the substance and essence of
                    body,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Baxter’s Inquiry
                    into the Nature of the Human Soul.</p></note> that the atoms of which each mass
                    is composed are held together by a foreign force. If by chaos be meant matter,
                    when this force is supposed to be removed, we must beg leave to say, that of
                    such a substance we have neither idea nor notion, and cannot distinguish it from
                    nonentity. The original atoms of matter we believe indeed to require no other
                    agency to keep each entire than that fiat by which it was created; but still, as
                    those atoms are conceived to be solid and extended, they must be capable of
                    division by infinite power; and if that fiat or influence which makes them solid
                    and extended were removed, they would lose solidity and extension, and of course
                    become nothing. So far is it, thérefore, from being true, that the creation of
                    matter appears to be impossible, that we are compelled by every thing which we
                    know of it to believe that matter cannot possibly be self-existent.</p>

                    new substance, men are apt to measure all things by their own scantling, and to
                    suppose it universally impossible for any power whatever thus to create. But
                    since it is certain, that imperfect beings can themselves produce some things
                    out of nothing pre-existing, as new cogitations, new local motion, and new
                    modifications of things corporeal, it is surely reasonable to think that an
                    absolutely perfect being can do something more, that is, create new substances,
                    or give them their whole being. And it may well be thought as easy for God, or
                    an Omnipotent Being, to make a whole world, matter and all, <hi rend="italic">εξ
                    ουκ l&gt;ντων,</hi> as it is for us to create a thought or to move a finger, or
                    for the sun to send out rays or a candle light; or, lastly, for an opaque body
                    to produce an image of itself in a glass or water, or to project a shadow; all
                    these imperfect things being but the energies, rays, images, or shadows of the
                    Deity. For a substance to be made out of nothing by God, or a Being infinitely
                    perfect, is not for it to be made out of nothing in the impossible sense,
                    because it comes from Him who is all. Nor can it be said to be impossible for
                    any thing whatever to be made by that which hath not only infinitely greater
                    perfection, but also infinite active power. It is indeed true, that infinite
                    power itself cannot do things in their own nature impossible; and, therefore,
                    those who deny creation, ought to prove, that it is absolutely impossible for a
                    substance, though not for an accident or modification, to be brought from
                    non-existence into being. But nothing is in itself impossible which does not
                    imply contradiction; and though it be a contradiction to be and not to be at the
                    same time, there is surely no contradiction in conceiving an imperfect being,
                    which before was not, afterwards to be.” To call in question the possibility of
                    creation, because we have no adequate conception how a thing can be brought into
                    existence, would be in the highest degree absurd; for it may be doubted whether
                    we have adequate conceptions of any thing excepting our own ideas and their
                    various relations.</p>
                <p>That Being which is self-existent, omnipotent, and omniscient, is not a
                    necessary, but a free agent; for active power implies freedom, and infinite
                    power infinite freedom. What, therefore, has no bounds set to its power, what
                    can have no opposition made to its will, nor restraint laid on its actions, must
                    both will and act freely. If the Supreme Cause were not a being endowed with
                    liberty and choice, but a mere necessary agent, then would it follow, as Dr
                    Clarke well observes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God.</p></note> that nothing
                    which is not could possibly have been; and that nothing which is could possibly
                    not have been; and that no mode or circumstance of the existence of any thing
                    could possibly have been in any respect otherwise than it now actually is: all
                    which being evidently most false and absurd, it follows, on the contrary, that
                    the Supreme Cause is not a mere necessary agent, but a Being endued with liberty
                    and choice.</p>
                <p>To this reasoning it has been replied,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Cooper’s Tracts.</p></note> that Dr Clarke “must have known,
                    that all those who contend against the free agency of the Deity, do of course
                    acknowledge, that nothing coul d have happened, or does happen, or will happen,
                    but what actually has happened, or doth happen, or will happen; and that it is
                    most false and absurd to deny it.” It is, therefore, according to the
                    necessarians, absolutely impossible that at present there could exist upon this
                    earth more or fewer persons than are now actually <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi>
                    alive; that the earth could move in any other direction than from west to east,
                    or that there could be more or fewer planets in the solar system. Yet it is most
                    certain that there have been fewer persons on the earth than there are now; that
                    there is not a cultivated country in Europe which could not contain more p¾pple
                    than now inhabit it; that the comets move in very different directions from that
                    of west to east; and that as, until lately, we conceived there were only six
                    primary planets in the system, it is evidently possible that the system might
                    contain more. Upon the supposition, therefore, that the Supreme Being acts under
                    a physical necessity, the same things are possible and not possible at the same
                    time, which is the grossest of all absurdities. It might have been objected with
                    much more plausibility, that the First Cause cannot possibly be free, because he
                    must needs do always what is best on the whole; but it will be seen by and by,
                    that amongst different created systems, there is no reason for supposing any one
                    absolutely best.</p>
                <p>But although this Being be free, and as such the author of change in other
                    beings, yet he must himself be unchangeable; for all changes have a beginning,
                    and consequently are effects of some prior causes. But there can be nothing
                    prior to the existence of this Being, because he is eternal; neither can there
                    be any cause of his existence, because he is independent; nor consequently any
                    change in it, except we could suppose him to change himself, which is the same
                    absurdity as to produce himself, or to be at the same time both effect and
                    cause.</p>
                <p>Omniscience, as well as some of the foregoing attributes of the Supreme Being,
                    may perhaps be more easily deduced in a different manner.<note anchored="true"

                    ourselves such qualities as thought and intelligence, power and freedom, &amp;c.
                    for which we have the evidence of consciousness as much as for our own
                    existence. Indeed it is only by our consciousness of these that our existence is
                    made known’ to ourselves. We know likewise that these are perfections, and that
                    to have them is better than to be without them. We find also that they have not
                    been in us from eternity. They must, therefore, have had a beginning, and
                    consequently some cause, for the very same reason that a being which begins to
                    exist in time requires a cause. Now this cause, as it must be superior to its
                    effect, must have those perfections in a superior degree; and if it be the first
                    cause, it must have them in an infinite or unlimited degree, since bounds or
                    limitation without a limiter would, as we have already shown, be an effect
                    without a cause.</p>
                <p>It is indeed obvious that the omniscience of the Supreme Being is implied in his
                    very existence. “For all things being not only present to him, but also entirely
                    depending upon him, and having received both their being itself and all their
                    powers and faculties from him, it is manifest that as he knows all things that
                    are, and penetrates every part of their substance with his all-seeing eye, so
                    must he likewise know all possibilities of things, that is, all effects that can
                    be. For, being alone self-existent, and having alone given to all things all the
                    powers and faculties with which they are endued, it is evident that he must of
                    necessity know perfectly what all and each of these powers and faculties, which
                    are derived wholly from himself, can possibly produce. And seeing at one
                    boundless view, or more properly in his own ideas, all the possible compositions
                    and divisions, variations and changes, circumstances and dependencies of things,
                    all their possible relations one to another, and their dispositions or fitnesses

                    by every man who believed in the existence of a God, as the creator and
                    preserver of all things.</p>
                <p>Doubts, however, have been entertained by theists, and pious theists, whether
                    omniscience itself can certainly foreknow what are called contingent events,
                    such as the actions of free agents; and some few there are professing even to be
                    Christians, who have boldly pronounced such knowledge to be impossible. That we
                    have no adequate notion how events which are called contingent can be certainly
                    foreknown, must indeed be granted; but we are not, therefore, authorized to say
                    that such knowledge is impossible, unless it can be clearly shown to imply a
                    contradiction. They who suppose that it implies a contradiction, must likewise
                    suppose, that, where there is not a chain of necessary causes, there can be no
                    certainty of any future event; but this is evidently a mistake. “For let us
                    suppose that there is in man a power of beginning motion, and of acting with
                    what has been of late called philosophical freedom; and let us suppose farther
                    that the actions of such a man cannot possibly be foreknown; will there not yet
                    be in the nature of things, notwithstanding this supposition, the same certainty
                    of event in every one of the man’s actions, as if they were everso fatal and
                    necessary? For instance, suppose the man, by an internal principle of motion,
                    and an absolute freedom of mind, to do some particular action to-day, and
                    suppose it was not possible that this action should have been foreseen
                    yesterday, was there not nevertheless the same certainty of event as if it had
                    been foreseen, and absolutely necessary? That is, would it not have been as
                    certain a truth yesterday, and from eternity, that this action was in event to
                    be performed to-day, notwithstanding the supposed freedom, as it is now a
                    certain and infallible truth that it is performed? Mere certainty of event,
                    therefore, does not in any measure imply necessity.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid.</p></note> And surely it implies no
                    contradiction to suppose, that every future event which in the nature of things
                    is now certain, may now be certainly known by that intelligence which is
                    omniscient. The manner how God can foreknow future events, without a chain of
                    necessary causes, it is indeed impossible for ns to explain; yet some sort of
                    general notion of it may be conceived by us. “For, as a man who has no influence
                    over another person’s actions, can yet often perceive beforehand what that other
                    will do; and a wiser and more experienced man, with still greater probability,
                    will foresee what another, with whose disposition he is perfectly acquainted,
                    will in certain circumstances do; and an angel, with still less degrees of
                    error, may have a further prospect into men’s future actions; so it is very
                    reasonable to conceive that God, without influencing men’s wills by his power,
                    or subjecting them to a chain of necessary causes, cannot but have a knowledge
                    of future free events, as much more certain than men or angels can possibly
                    have, as the perfection of his nature is greater than that of theirs. The
                    distinct manner how he foresees these things we cannot, indeed, explain; but!
                    neither can we explain the manner of numberless other things, of the reality of
                    which, however, no man entertains a doubt.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ibid.</p></note> We must therefore admit, as long as we
                    perceive no contradiction in it, that God always knows all the free actions of
                    men, and all other beings endued with liberty, otherwise he would know many
                    things now of which he was once ignorant, and consequently his omniscience would
                    receive addition from events, which has been already shown to be contrary to the
                    true notion of infinity. In a being incapable of change, knowledge has nothing
                    whatever to do with <hi rend="italic">before</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >after.</hi> To every purpose of knowledge and power, all things are to him
                    equally present. He knows perfectly every thing that is; and what to us is
                    future he knows in the very same manner as he knows what to us is present.</p>
                <p>We have thus demonstrated the necessary existence of a being who is eternal,
                    independent, unchangeable, omnipotent, free in his actions, and omniscient; and
                    this is the being whom we worship as God. Eternity, independence, immutability,
                    omnipotence, liberty, and omniscience, which seem to be all the natural
                    attributes which we can discover in the divine nature, as they are conceived to
                    be differently combined, make us speak of him in different terms. His enjoying
                    in an absolute manner every conceivable power of perception, makes us call him a
                    Being infinitely perfect. His being capable of no want, no defect, no
                    unhappiness of any kind, denotes him to be all-sufficient in himself; and the
                    unlimited exercise of his knowledge and his power demonstrates him to be
                    omnipresent. That such a Being must be incomprehensible by us, and by every
                    creature, is a truth self-evident; and yet in all ages men of the best
                    intentions have been vainly attempting this impossibility. The manner of his
                    omniscience, for instance, has been the subject of much disputation amongst
                    those who ought to have reflected that they do not know how their own minds are
                    present to their own bodies. The celebrated Dr Clarke and his adherents, who
                    considered space as the <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of all other things,
                    insisted that God must be infinitely extended; and that, as wherever his
                    substance is, there his attributes must be, it is thus that his knowledge and
                    his power are present with every creature. But this notion labours under
                    insuperable difficulties.</p>
                <p>For, “if the divine substance be infinitely extended, then will there be part of
                    it in this place and part in that. It must be commensurate with all particular
                    beings, so that some will occupy more and some less of its dimensions. By this
                    account it will be very proper and philosophical to say, that God is not in
                    heaven, but only a part of him; and that an elephant or a mountain, a whale or a
                    wicked giant, have more of the essence or presence of God with them, than the
                    holiest or best man in the world, unless he be of equal size; all which, as has
                    been well observed,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Watts Essays; and I .aw’s Inquiries into the Ideas of Space, Time,
                    Immensity, &amp;c.</p></note> are at least harsh and grating expressions. As the
                    attributes of the Divine Being must be considered in the same manner with his
                    substance, we shall likewise, upon this notion of omnipresence, have a part of
                    his knowledge and power in this place, and a part of them in that; and of these
                    parts the one must be greater or less than the other, according to the
                    dimensions of the place with which it is commensurate; which is a supposition
                    that appears to us harsher, if possible, than even the former.</p>
                <p>“Should it be said that the divine attributes are not to be considered as having
                    parts (though we see not how they can be considered otherwise than as their
                    subject), they must then exist completely in every point of this immense
                    expansion. Be it so; and what follows? Why, every point of this infinitely
                    expanded being will be omniscient and omnipotent by itself; an inch of it will
                    have as much wisdom and power as a yard, a mile, or the whole; and, instead of
                    one infinite wisdom and power, we shall have millions. For as these parts of the
                    substance are conceived distinctly, and one individual part is not another, so
                    must the attributes be likewise conceived, and the individual power and
                    knowledge of one part be distinct from that of another.” And if so, then it
                    follows that one point of this expanded being has equal power and intelligence
                    with the whole; so that the notion of extension <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194208922" xml:id="kp-eb0714-8922-0700"/>being necessary to God’s
                    presence with every creature, involves in it the most palpable contradiction.
                    That God is at all times and in all places so present with every creature as to
                    have an absolute knowledge of and power over it, is indeed capable of the
                    strictest demonstration; but we think it great presumption to assign the
                    particular mode of his presence, especially such an one as is neither agreeable
                    to the nature of an absolutely perfect Being, nor in the least necessary to the
                    exercise of any one perfection which he can be proved to possess. Philosophers
                    and divines have offered several names for the manner in which God is present
                    with his works; but we choose rather to confess that the manner of his presence
                    is to us, and probably to every creature, wholly incomprehensible. Nor need we
                    be surprised or staggered at this, when we reflect that the manner in which our
                    own minds are present with our bodies is to us as incomprehensible as the manner
                    in which the Supreme Mind is present with every thing in the universe. That our
                    minds ’ have a power over our limbs, we know by experience; but that they are
                    not extended nor substantially diffused through them, is certain, because men
                    daily lose arms and legs, without losing any part of their understanding, or
                    feeling their energies of volition in the smallest degree weakened. But we need
                    not pursue this subject farther. It has been confessed by one of the most
                    strenuous advocates<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr
                    Jackson’s Existence and Unity, &amp;c. p. 110.</p></note> for the extension of
                    the Deity and all minds, that “there is an incomprehensibleness in the manner of
                    every thing, about which no controversy can or ought to be concerned.”</p>
                <p>The moral attributes of God may be deduced from his natural perfections, and are
                    immediate consequences of them when exercised on other beings. They may be
                    termed his secondary relative attributes, as they seem to be the perfection of
                    his external acts rather than any new internal perfections. And though the
                    existence of any moral quality or action is not capable ofstrict demonstration,
                    Decause every moral action or quality, as such, depends upon the will of the
                    agent, which must be absolutely free; yet we have as great assurance that there
                    are moral qualities in God, and that he will always act according to these
                    qualities, as the nature of the thing admits, and maybe as well satisfied
                    respecting it, as if it were capable of the most rigid demonstration. This
                    important point, however, cannot be so clearly or so firmly established by
                    abstract reasoning as by taking a scientific view of the works of creation,
                    which evince the goodness, holiness, and justice of their Author, as well as his
                    perfect wisdom and infinite power. The consideration, therefore, of the moral
                    attributes of God, together with his providence and the duties thence incumbent
                    on man, is the proper business of other articles.</p>
                <p>At present we shall only observe, that by reasoning <hi rend="italic">a
                    'priori</hi> from his existence and his natural perfections, we must necessarily
                    infer that his actions are all the result of unmixed benevolence. Every wise
                    agent has some end in view in all his actions, it being the very essence of
                    folly to act for no end; but there cannot be an end of action which is not
                    either selfish or benevolent. Selfishness is the offspring of Avant and
                    imperfection, and is therefore the source of most human actions; because men are
                    weak and imperfect beings, capable of daily additions to their happiness. When
                    the thief plunders a house at midnight, when the highwayman robs a traveller on
                    the road, and even when the assassin murders the man who never injured him, it
                    will be found that their actions spring not from an innate desire to inflict
                    misery upon others, but from a prospect of reaping some advantage to themselves.
                    The object of the thief and the robber is obvious; it is to gain money, which is
                    the means of procuring the comforts of life. Even the assassin has always the
                    same selfish end in view; either he is bribed to commit the murder, or he
                    fancies that his horrid deed will remove an obstacle from the way to his own
                    happiness. But they are not vicious men only who act from selfish
                    considerations; for much of human virtue, when traced to its source, will be
                    found to have its origin in the desire of happiness. When a man gives his money
                    to feed the hungry and to clothe the naked, he believes that he is acting
                    agreeably to the will of Him to whom he and the poor stand in the same relation,
                    and he looks for a future and eternal reward. By continuing the practice, he
                    soon acquires the habit of benevolence; after which, indeed, he looks for no
                    further reward, when performing particular actions, than the immediate pleasure
                    of doing good. This selfishness of man is the necessary consequence of his
                    progressive state. But the Being who is independent, omnipotent, omniscient,
                    and, in a word, possessed of every possible perfection, is incapable of
                    progression, or of having any accession whatever made to his happiness. He is
                    immutable, and must of necessity have been as happy from eternity, when existing
                    alone, as after the creation of ten thousand worlds. When, therefore, he willed
                    the existence of other beings, he could have nothing in view but to communicate
                    some resemblance of his own perfectionsand happiness. That he had some end in
                    view, follows undeniably from his infinite wisdom. That he could not have a
                    selfish end, follows with equal certainty from his own infinite perfection; and
                    as there is no medium, in the actions of a wise Being, between selfishness and
                    benevolence, we must necessarily conclude that the creation was the result of
                    unmixed benevolence or perfect goodness. The other moral attributes of the
                    Deity, his justice, mercy, and truth, ought therefore only to be considered as
                    so many different views of the same goodness in the Creator, and various sources
                    of happiness to the creature. These are always subordinate to and regulated by
                    this one principal perfection and brightest ray of the Divinity.</p>
                <p>“Thus we conceive his justice to be exerted on any being no farther than his
                    goodness necessarily requires, in order to make that being, or others, sensible
                    of the heinous nature and pernicious effects of sin,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Notes to King on Evil.</p></note> ʹ and
                    thereby to bring them to as great a degree of happiness as their several natures
                    are capable of. His holiness hates and abhors all wickedness, only as its
                    necessary consequences arc absolute and unavoidable misery; and his veracity or
                    faithfulness seems to be concerned for truth, only because it is connected with
                    and productive of the happiness of all rational beings; to provide the properest
                    means for attaining which great end, is the exercise of his wisdom.” Such is the
                    view of God’s moral attributes, which the abstract contemplation of his natural
                    perfections necessarily suggests; and whether this way of conceiving them be not
                    attended with less difficulty than the common manner of treating them under the
                    notion of two infinites diametrically opposite, must be left to the judgment of
                    the reader.</p>

                    death, and the like; or moral evil, as all kinds of vice. The first of these is
                    not properly an evil; for every power, faculty, or perfection, which any
                    creature enjoys, being the free gift of God, which he was no more obliged to
                    bestow than he was to confer being or existence itself, it is plain, that the
                    want of any certain faculty or perfection in any kind of creatures, which never
                    belonged to their nature, is no more an evil to them, than their never having
                    been created or brought into being at all could properly be called an evil.” To
                    this we may add, that as no created being can be self-existent and independent,
                    imperfection is unavoidable in the creation, so that the evil of defect (as it
                    is most absurdly called) must have been admitted, or nothing could ever have
                    existed but God. “The second kind of evil, which we call natural evil, is either
                    a necessary consequence of the former, as death to a creature on whose nature
                    immortality was never conferred; and then it is no more properly an evil than
                    the former: or else it is counterpoised in the whole with as great or greater
                    good, as the afflictions and sufferings of good men; and then also it is
                    properly no evil: or else it is a punishment; and then it is a necessary
                    consequence of the third and last sort of evil, viz. moral evil. And this arises
                    wholly from the abuse of liberty, which God gave to his creatures for other
                    purposes, and which it was reasonable and fit to give them for the perfection
                    and order of the whole creation; only they, contrary to God’s intention and
                    command, have abused what was necessary for the perfection of the whole, to the
                    corruption and depravation of themselves. And thus have all sorts of evils
                    entered into the world, without any diminution to the infinite goodness of its
                    Creator and Governor.”</p>
                <p>But though evil could not be totally excluded from the universe, are we not
                    authorized to infer, from the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness of the
                    Creator, that the present system is upon the whole the very best system
                    possible? Undoubtedly we are, if of possible systems there can be a best; but
                    this is so far from being evident, that we think it implies a contradiction. A
                    best of beings there is, viz. God, who is possessed of infinite perfections; but
                    there cannot be a best of creatures or of created systems. To prove this, we
                    need only reflect, that wherever creation stops, it must stop infinitely short
                    of infinity; and that how perfect soever we conceive any creature or system of
                    creatures to be, yet the distance between that and God is not lessened, but
                    continues infinite. Hence it follows that the nature of God and his omnipotence
                    is such, that whatever number of creatures he has made, he may still add to that
                    number; and that however good or perfect the system may be on the whole, he
                    might still make others equally good and perfect.</p>
                <p>The dispute, whether a being of infinite power, wisdom, and benevolence, must be
                    supposed to have created the best possible system, and the embarrassment of
                    men’s understandings about it, seem to have arisen from their taking the words,
                    <hi rend="italic">good, better,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">best,</hi> for
                    absolute qualities inherent in the nature of things, whereas in truth they are
                    only relations arising from certain appetites. They have indeed a foundation, as
                    all relations have, in something that is absolute, and denote the thing in which
                    they are founded; but yet they themselves imply nothing more than a relation of
                    congruity between some appetite and its objects. This is evident; because the
                    same object, when applied to an appetite to which it has a congruity, is good;
                    and when applied to an appetite to which it has no congruity, is bad. Thus, the
                    earth and air to terrestrial animals are good elements, and necessary to their
                    preservation; to those animals the water is bad, though it yet affords the best
                    receptacle to fishes. Good, therefore, being relative to appetite, that must be
                    reckoned the best creature by us which has the strongest appetites, and the
                    surest means of satisfying them all, and securing its own permanent happiness.
                    And though the substance of creatures is chiefly to be regarded as contributing
                    to their perfection, yet we have no way of measuring the perfection of different
                    substances, except by their qualities, that is, by their appetites, by which
                    they are sensible of good and evil, and by their powers to procure those objects
                    from which they receive that sense of things which makes them happy.</p>
                <p>It is plain, therefore, that whatever system we suppose in nature, God might have
                    made another equal to it; his infinite wisdom and power being able to make other
                    creatures equal in every respect to any that we know or can conceive, and to
                    give them equal or even stronger appetites, and as certain or more certain ways
                    of satisfying them. We see in many cases, that very different means will
                    accomplish the same end. A certain number of regular pyramids will fill a space;
                    and yet irregular ones will do it as well, if what we take from the one be added
                    to another; and the same thing may be done by bodies of the most irregular and
                    different figures in the same manner; and therefore we may very well conceive,
                    that the answering of appetites, which is all the natural good that is in the
                    world, may as well be obtained in another system as in this; provided we
                    suppose, that where the appetites of the sentient beings are changed, the
                    objects are also suited to them, and an equal congruity amongst the parts of the
                    whole introduced. This is so easily conceived, that, in an indefinite number of
                    possible worlds, we do not see why it may not be done in numberless ways by
                    infinite power and wisdom.</p>
                <p>If, then, it be plain that there might have been many other worlds, or even but
                    one, equal to this in all respects as to goodness, there could be no necessity,
                    either physical or moral, that God should create the one rather than the other,
                    because nothing could make the one better, or to him more agreeable, than the
                    other, except his own free choice. Either, therefore, God must be possessed of
                    absolute freedom, or, amongst a number of possibilities equally perfect, he
                    could not have made a choice, and so nothing would ever have been created. It is
                    not, then, as Leibnitz and others argue, the natural and necessary goodness of
                    some particular things, represented by the divine ideas, which determines God to
                    prefer them to all others, if understood of his first act of producing them; but
                    it is his own free choice, which, amongst many equal potential goods, makes some
                    things actually good, and determines them into existence. When those are once
                    supposed to exist, every thing or action becomes good which tends to their
                    happiness and preservation; and to suppose that their all-perfect Author had any
                    other end in view than their preservation and happiness, is the same absurdity
                    as to suppose that knowledge may produce ignorance; power, weakness; or wisdom,
                    folly. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. h. h. h.)</hi><pb break="no"
