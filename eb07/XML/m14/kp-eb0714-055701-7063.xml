                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MENANDER</label>, a celebrated comic poet of Athens, was the
                    son of Diopithes and Hegisistrate, and belonged to the demus of Cephissia. His
                    family was of considerable eminence at Athens, as we find his father commanding
                    the Athenian forces on the Hellespont in the war with Philip of Macedonia, B.c.
                    342. (Dionys. <hi rend="italic">Dinarch.</hi> p. 666.) Menander was born <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b c.</hi> 342, the year before the birth of Epicurus, and he
                    died <hi rend="smallcaps">b c.</hi> 291. At the time that Menander was born,
                    Demosthenes was forty years of age, and Aeschines forty-seven. Of his private
                    history the few facts that have been transmitted are of little moment. He was
                    the nephew of the poet Alexis to whom he was indebted for his education; (Suid.
                    <hi rend="italic">Proleg. Aristoph.</hi> p. XXX.) though he also studied under
                    the philosopher Theophrastus, (Diog∙ Laert. <hi rend="italic">Thcophr.)</hi> As
                    early as his twenty-first year he exhibited his first play, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Oργf</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and gained a prize. (Aristoph. 1. c. Euseb. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ol.</hi> 114. 4.) Authors are not agreed as to the number of plays
                    which he composed; some say 109, others 108, (Suid.) and Apollodorus 105.
                    (Gell.) Athenaeus mentions the titles of fifty plays. Menander wrote also
                    letters addressed to king Ptolemaeus Soter, (306-283 <hi rend="smallcaps">b
                    c.),</hi> and several orations in prose. Only eight of his plays were thought
                    worthy by the Athenian judges of receiving the crown of victory; but as
                    Euripides was even still more unsuccessful we must not consider this as a
                    decisive proof of their inferiority. So much indeed did the, poet feel the
                    injustice of this treatment and the unworthiness of ∙some of those who were the
                    successful competitors, that on meeting Philemon he inquired of him whether he
                    did not blush when he heard himself declared victor. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gell.</hi> xvii. 4.) Menander was accused by the ancients of plagiarism, and
                    the grammarian Cratinus composed a work in six books on the thefts of Menander,
                    but this accusation appears to have been dictated by envy. Menander is said to
                    have been a great admirer of the female sex; hence Ovid <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Trist.</hi> xi. 370.) has remarked that there is no comedy of Menander in
                    which love is not introduced, and yet that the manners are sufficiently pure to
                    allow a mother to place these dramas in the hands of her daughter. On this point
                    we may remark that the manners of the Greeks differed much from those of the
                    present day, and .we can have no doubt that the subjects of many of them were
                    such as would exclude them from our drawing-rooms. The titles of three of his
                    plays, Thais, Glyceriùm, and Nannion, shew that they treated of ladies of not
                    the most reputable characters. It is well known that Terence carried his
                    imitation of Menander so far as sometimes merely to translate his plays, and
                    hence Caesar calls him Dimidiate Menander. <hi rend="italic">(Epigr. αp.
                    Donat.</hi><hi rend="italic">Vit.</hi><hi rend="italic">Terent.)</hi> It is much
                    to be regretted that the whole, of his works have perished, with the exception
                    of a few fragments which have been preserved by different grammarians and
                    philosophers. Menander was the founder of the new comedy, in which vices were
                    censured without reference to particular facts, and in which the action of the
                    play was not impeded by the presence and declamation of a chorus. It must have
                    differed little from a modern comedy except in being somewhat less pure in
                    manners. Plutarch has drawn a parallel between Menander and Aristophanes, in
                    which he thus expresses his opinion of the former: “Menander can adapt his style
                    so as to suit any character; he never loses sight of nature, is always equal to
                    himself, and always different, according as the subject requires a change of
                    manner; like to a limpid stream which, flowing between unequal banks, assumes
                    all its forms without losing any of its purity. He is made to be read,
                    represented, learned by heart, to please in every place, and every time.”
                    Quintilian says, “He has delineated the picture of human life most accurately;
                    his invention is fruitful, his eloquence powerful, his characters, passions, and
                    manners, proper and natural.” (x. 1.) It is said that Menander was drowned
                    whilst he was bathing in the Piraeus at Athens; <hi rend="italic">(Schol.
                    Ovid.</hi> 593.) and the Athenians erected a tomb to his honour not far from
                    that of Euripides. (Pausan. i. 6.) The fragments of Menander have been collected
                    in thePo‰ <hi rend="italic">Graeci</hi><hi rend="italic">Minores,</hi>
