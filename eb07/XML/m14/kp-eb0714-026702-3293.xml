                    ingenious writer in the seventeenth century, was bred at Cambridge. He travelled
                    through the most polite parts of Europe, and was secretary to the embassy at
                    Constantinople. His first appearance in public business at home was as assistant
                    to John Milton, Latin secretary to the protector. A little before the
                    Restoration, he was chosen by his native town, Kingston-upon-Hull, to sit in the
                    parliament ], which assembled at Westminster on the 25th of April 1660; and he
                    is recorded as the last member of parliament who received the wages or allowance
                    anciently paid to representatives by their constituents. He seldom spoke in
                    parliament, but he had much influence without doors upon the members of both
                    houses; and Prince. Rupert had always the greatest regard for his advice. He
                    made himself very obnoxious to the government by his actions and writings; but,
                    notwithstanding, Charles II. took great delight in his conversation, and tried
                    all means to win him over to the side of the court. There were many instances of
                    his firmness in resisting the offers of the court; but he was proof against all
                    temptations. The king having one night entertained him, sent the Lord Treasurer
                    Danby next morning to find out his lodgings, which were then up two pair of
                    stairs in one of the little courts in the Strand. He was busy writing when the
                    treasurer abruptly opened the door and entered. Surprised at the sight of so
                    unexpected a visitor, Mr Marvell told his lordship that he believed he had
                    mistaken his way. Lord Danby replied that he had not, now he had found Mr
                    Marvell; telling him he came from his majesty, to know what he could do to serve
                    him. Coming to a -serious explanation, he told the Lord Treasurer that he knew
                    the nature of courts full well; and that whoever was distinguished by a prince’s
                    favour, was certainly expected to vote in his interest. The Lord Danby told him,
                    that his majesty had only a just sense of his merits; in regard to which he
                    merely desired to know if there was any place at court he could be pleased with.
                    These offers, though urged with the greatest earnestness, had no effect upon
                    him. He told the Lord Treasurer that he could not accept of them with honour;
                    for he must either be ungrateful to the king in voting against him, or false to
                    his country in giving in to the measures of the court. The only favour,
                    therefore, he had to request of his majesty was, that he would esteem him as
                    dutiful a subject as any he had, and more in his proper interest by refusing his
                    offers than if he had embraced them. The Lord Danby finding that no arguments
                    could prevail, told him that the king had ordered a thousand pounds for him,
                    which he hoped he would receive until he could think what further to ask of his
                    majesty. But this last offer was rejected with the same stedfastness of mind as
                    the first; though, as soon as the Lord Treasurer was gone, he was forced to send
                    to a friend to borrow a guinea. He died in 1678, not without strong suspicions
                    of having been poisoned, in the fifty-eighth year of his age. In 1688, the town
                    of Kingston-upon-Hull contributed a sum of money to erect a monument to his
                    memory in the church of St Giles-inthe-Fields, where he was interred, and an
                    epitaph composed by an able hand; but the ministers of that church forbade both
                    the inscription and monument to be placed there. His works were published in
                    1726, in two vols. 12mo; but a much more complete collection appeared in 1776,
                    in three vols. 4to. This edition, however, attributes to him some pieces which
                    did not proceed from his pen.</p>
