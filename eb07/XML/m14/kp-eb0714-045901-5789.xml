                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MECHAIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Peter Francis
                    Andrew</hi></label>, a well-known practical astronomer and geographer, was born
                    at Laon, on the 16th April 1744. His father was an architect, and educated him
                    with the intention of making him his successor in his business. He afterwards
                    took charge of two young men at Sens, as their private tutor, and accidentally
                    became acquainted with Lalande, under whose patronage he was subsequently
                    brought forward as an observer, surveyor, and computer. He made two voyages with
                    Μ. de la Bretonniére, and assisted him in surveying some parts of the coast of
                    France. He was afterwards employed in various computations by the Marquis de
                    Chabert, and the Duc D’Ayen. Having obtained a prize from the Academy of
                    Sciences in 1782, for a <hi rend="italic">Memoir on Comets,</hi> he became a
                    member of the Academy the same year. About the year 1785, he undertook the
                    publication of the <hi rend="italic">Connaissance</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Terns,</hi> and continued it till he was employed in geodetical operations at a
                    distance from Paris. He was appointed member of a committee, along with Cassini,
                    de Thury, and Legendre, to meet the English astronomers for the determination of
                    the relative situation of the observatories, which had been proposed by Cassini.
                    It was in these operations that he first brought Borda’s circle into general
                    use. In 1791 he was appointed, in conjunction with Delambre, to execute the
                    intentions of the Constituent Assembly, with regard to the determination of a
                    basis of linear measures. A variety of delays and difficulties occurred in these
                    operations. In Spain he was wounded in the head and side, by an accident which
                    occurred whilst he was inspecting a water-wheel; and the political circumstances
                    of the times produced many embarrassments, which caused him to linger in Italy
                    perhaps a little longer than was actually necessary; but the establishment of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bureau des Longitudes,</hi> and his nomination as a member
                    of it, determined his immediate return to Paris. He was now director of the
                    Observatory, and he entered with great zeal on a series of observations, which
                    were to rival those of Flamsteed, of Bradley, and of Maskelyne; but he seems to
                    have been a little tired of the confinement, and he readily accepted, or rather
                    solicited, the appointment to assist in the measurements required for the still
                    farther extension of the arc of the meridian to the south of Barcelona. But the
                    secret motive for his seeking this humbler employment appears to have been a
                    desire to remove some doubts which he entertained respecting the latitude of
                    Barcelona, as it appeared after his death from his papers, that there had been a
                    discordance of 3' ’ in some observations which he had not made public. In this
                    unfortunate undertaking, he paid a heavy penalty for any want of candour which
                    may have been attributed to the concealment. Shipwreck and disease awaited him;
                    and he died at last, on the 20th of September 1805, of a fever, which fatigue
                    and a bad climate had brought on. From the time of his accident in Spain he had
                    become habitually melancholy and timid, though regardless of personal danger in
                    the pursuit of his professional objects. His whole time was occupied in
                    observing and calculating; he published little; and never ventured to advance
                    any reflections on the subjects which employed him, being probably more in the
                    habit of acting than of speculating. He married, in 1777, Mademoiselle Thérèse
                    Maijon, with whom he had become acquainted at Versailles. This connexion was in
                    every respect happy; he was indebted to it for a competent fortune, and he left
                    a daughter and two sons.</p>
                <p>1. Of his publications the most important are to be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires des</hi><hi rend="italic">Savans</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >étrangers;</hi> that is, besides some <hi rend="italic">Observations of
                    eclipses and occulaticyns,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Memoir on the comets</hi>
                    q/T532«wíZ1661, showing that theyare not the same; and their non-appearance
                    seven or eight years afterwards fully; ustified his conclusions, and the
                    adjudication of the prize. 2. In the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the
                    Academy,</hi> from 1782 to 1784, there are several of his <hi rend="italic"

                    also some letters of Méchain in Zach’s <hi rend="italic">Geographical
