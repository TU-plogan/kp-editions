                    which describes and explains the various phenomena which occur in the region of
                    our atmosphere. It has deeply engaged the attention of men in every state of
                    society, from the roving savage to the refined votary of wealth and pleasure.
                    The moment we cross our doors, we commit ourselves to the influence of the
                    weather. But the hardier classes of the community, the shepherd, the ploughman,
                    and the mariner, whose labour creates or procures the staple articles of life,
                    are always exposed, by their occupation, to the mercy of the elements. They were
                    hence led, by the strongest motives, to examine closely the varying appearance
                    of the sky, and to distinguish certain minute alterations which commonly precede
                    the more important changes. No doubt they would often mistake the indications of
                    those aspects, and would infer conclusions from mere casual circumstances. Those
                    tokens which portend the more violent convulsions of the atmosphere, the pelting
                    storm or the careering tempest, are generally of a decided character; but the
                    symptoms which go before the ordinary fluctuations of the weather can only be
                    dimly conjectured by long experience and sagacious observation. This shadowy
                    knowledge, this dubious and very limited anticipation of the changes which
                    arrive in the medium we breathe, is merely the fruit of personal assiduity and
                    application. Like the conclusions which men of discernment form to themselves on
                    the subject of physiognomy, it is scarcely communicable; it receives therefore
                    no accessions in the progress of ages, but perishes with the individual.</p>
                <p>The vague rules which experience had formed on the subject of atmospheric changes
                    were adopted by the philosophers of antiquity, and incorporated into their
                    cosmological systems. But in attempting to explain the phenomena, they sought
                    merely to satisfy the imagination; and the supposition of certain dements, each
                    endued with peculiar properties, appeared, on a superficial view, to connect
                    harmoniously the general facts.</p>
                <p>In the infancy of science, however, it was very difficult to distinguish between
                    such appearances as are only incidental, and those constant presages which
                    invariably anticipate their effects. The different fluctuations that happen in
                    the lower atmosphere seemed dependent on the influence of the heavenly bodies,
                    which are continually altering their places. Not only the sun and moon appeared
                    to rule the seasons, but the planets, and even the fixed stars, were conceived
                    to retard or accelerate, by their feeble action^ the revolution of the grand
                    cycle of changes. The application of the term <hi rend="italic">aspect</hi> to
                    the positions of those remote bodies, implied a principle of intelligence, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">stellar influence</hi> shed by them might therefore be
                    deemed capable of producing all the variety of effects. Hence the origin of <hi
                    rend="italic">Physical Astrology,</hi> which has, during so many ages,
                    maintained ascendency in the world, and still colours the verses of our poets,
                    and pervades the creed of the vulgar.</p>
                <p>The heat evolved by the luminous particles transmitted from the sun, as they lose
                    themselves among the lower strata of our atmosphere, or under the surface of the
                    land and the sea, varying in its intensity, according to the obliquity of their
                    incidence, and the extent of medium which they traverse, produces the most
                    important effects in the great economy of the globe. But the correct knowledge
                    we have at length acquired concerning the mutual action of bodies, contracts the
                    limits of the supposed celestial influence almost to a point. The light of the
                    moon does not amount to the I00,000th part of that of the sun, and the heat
                    which this very feeble illumination excites or communicates has never been
                    detected by the most delicate instruments, or the best-devised experiments. But
                    all the rays shot from the planets, and from the whole constellations of fixed
                    stars, are quite lost in the contrast with those lunar beams. Their combined
                    impressions, during the lapse of countless ages, on the atmospheric temperature,
                    would hence elude the utmost powers of calculation.</p>
                <p>It is only by their attractive force that the heavenly bodies, except the warming
                    energy of the sun, can ever affect the constitution of this globe. As, by their
                    action unequally exerted over its surface, they raise tides in the ocean, so
                    they must likewise agitate the atmosphere with a corresponding reciprocation.
                    This effect, however, depends much more on the proximity of the disturbing body,
                    than on its magnitude or density. Thus the sun, with twenty-three million times
                    the mass of the moon, yet being about four hundred times more distant, has only
                    about the third part of her influence in causing the tides. But, according to
                    the computations of Laplace, the joint action of the sun and moon is only
                    capable of producing a tropical wind, flowing westward at the rate of about four
                    miles a day; a quantity evidently too small to be ever subjected to observation,
                    and certainly insufficient to occasion any immediate and practical results.</p>
                <p>It may be calculated that Jupiter and Venus, in those parts of their orbits which
                    approach the nearest to the earth, affect the aërial tides by a force 76,000 and
                    82,000 times less than the sun. Those planets could therefore excite a most
                    minute shifting in the atmosphere, limited to a foot in the space of fourteen or
                    fifteen days, or about a single mile in twenty years. As the mass of Mars is
                    unknown, its disturbing force cannot be estimated, though it is less than that
                    of Jupiter. But the combined influence of all the rest of the solar system is,
                    from their great distance, incomparably smaller.</p>
                <p>Nothing can be <hi rend="smallcaps">so</hi> utterly groundless, therefore, as the
                    disposition to refer the ordinary changes of the weather to the influence of the
                    moon. But, compared with this, the fancied efficacy of the stellar aspects,
                    which was for ages <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209156"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9156-0718"/>firmly believed by the learned world, vanishes
                    into the shadow of a vision. Nor has the most elaborate examination of numerous
                    registers of the weather disclosed any precise and constant connection between
                    the phases of the moon or the positions of the stars, and the succession of
                    atmospherical phenomena. The inferences which seem to indicate a different
                    conclusion may be fairly disregarded, as drawn only from a loose and imperfect
                    inspection of facts.</p>
                <p>īt cannot be disputed, however, that all the changes which happen in the mass of
                    our atmosphere, involved, capricious, and irregular as they may appear, are yet
                    the necessary results of principles as fixed, and perhaps as simple, as those
                    which direct the revolutions of the solar system. Could we unravel the intricate
                    maze, we might trace the action of each distinct cause, and hence deduce the
                    ultimate effects arising from their combined operation. With the possession of
                    such data, we might safely predict the state of the weather at any future
                    period, as we now calculate an eelipse of the sun or moon, or foretell a
                    conjunction of the planets. After the protracted chain of combinations has been
                    completed, the same series of events must again be repeated through the
                    boundless lapse of ages. As all the anomalies of the planets are periodical, so
                    likewise the successive varieties follow some cycle of vast extent. In the
                    remotest annals of atmospherical phenomena, we might desery a gleam of futurity,
                    and read the changes which still lie hid in the womb of time.</p>
                <p>But, besides this great eyele, there probably are much shorter interior and
                    subordinate periods, in which the weather nearly, though not absolutely, returns
                    after the same order. Whatever principles concur to modify its succession, the
                    revolutions of the sun and moon are certainly the primary and predominant
                    causes. The character of the weather is accordingly strongly marked by the
                    vicissitudes of day and night, and by the annual repetition of summer and
                    winter. The menstrual action of the moon escapes correct observation; but,
                    accumulated during a sufficient time, it may possibly produce a decided
                    influence. Every nineteen years the motions of the moon come to coincide with
                    those of the sun, and her nodes perform their revolutions in nearly the same
                    time, or about eighteen years. This period, or the half of it, has therefore not
                    improbably some slight connection with the usual series of the changes of the
                    weather.</p>
                <p>“If the sages of antiquity be justly blamed for adopting implicitly the notions
                    and prejudices of the vulgar, those of modern times may be charged with too
                    eager a disposition to reject whatever savours of popular opinion. A collection
                    of the numerous rules and remarks formed in the course of ages among different
                    orders of men, deeply interested by their occupations in watching the changes of
                    the sky, would undoubtedly contain some important truths, which the diligence
                    and sagacity of the philosopher might discriminate, and employ for the basis of
                    beneficial speculations. The most sanguine can hardly uphold the prospect that
                    mankind will ever arrive at such a pitch of knowledge as to be capable of
                    prognosticating the future modifications of the atmosphere, with the same
                    precision with which they can foretell the successive revolutions of the
                    heavenly bodies; yet the motions, however irregular in appearance, which prevail
                    in the element that we breathe, are, equally with those performed in the regions
                    of space, the result of certain fixed laws. The variable aspect of the sky
                    proceeds partly from the direct action of the sunbeams, but principally from the
                    winds which they excite and maintain. The unequal gravitation of· the different
                    portions of our atmosphere to the sun, and to the moon especially, must occasion
                    some small effect in producing or altering the aerial currents; and even the
                    disturbing forces of the planets have a remote share, how minute soever, in the
                    formation of meteors. Nor can we hesitate to conclude, with the late ingenious
                    and elegant Μ. Bailly, whose fate demands the tribute of a tear, that the
                    notions, so widely spread among men, of the aspects and influences of the
                    celestial bodies, are only the corrupted remains of astronomical science,
                    already advanced to high perfection in some distant age of the world. If motions
                    were to rise and cease instantaneously with the operation of their causes, the
                    same succession of seasons would exactly attend on each revolution of the sun;
                    but the currents of air acquire velocity by degrees, and thenceforth continue to
                    flow till their force is spent. The varied face of our terraqueous globe will,
                    therefore, modify the direction, the power, and the duration of the winds,
                    raised by the action of the solar rays. Hence an extreme complication of causes,
                    which will produce an immense series of fluctuating events. That profound
                    geometer Μ. de Lagrange has established by demonstration, that all the changes
                    arising from the disturbing forces in the planetary system are subjected to
                    certain vast cyeles, on the return of which the same motions are perpetually
                    renewed. Similar periods, but of an extent that affrights the imagination,
                    probably regulate the modifications of the atmosphere; for, whenever a
                    coincidence of circumstances prevails, the series of appearances must inevitably
                    recur. The aggregate labours, indeed, of men continually transform the face of
                    our globe, and consequently alter the operations of natural causes; but, if the
                    agency of animals be stimulated and determined solely by the influence of
                    external objcets, it follows that the re-actions of living beings are
                    comprehended in the same necessary system, and that all the events within the
                    immeasurable circuit of the universe are the successive evolution of an extended
                    series, which, at the returns of some vast period, repeats its eternal round
                    during the endless flux of time. Besides the grand cycle, there must evidently
                    be many intermediate smaller periods, at the lapse of which our atmosphere will
                    present nearly, though not exactly, the same fleeting aspects. Whether these
                    bear any decided relation to the lunar revolutions, cannot with certainty be
                    affirmed. ∙ A copious collection of registers formed in the course of ages, will
                    probably, at some future time, lead to the discovery of certain remarkable
                    periods, which will enable men to conjecture, with tolerable precision, the
                    succeeding changes of the weather. It would be most advisable, perhaps, to begin
                    the inquiry with the tropical countries, in which the seasons arc more uniform,
                    and to advance by degrees into the temperate climates. In the mean time, our
                    prognostications may be greatly assisted by observing and studying the
                    concatenation of <hi rend="italic">phenomena.</hi> Certain coincidences of
                    aspects mark the near recurrence of some small portions of the general series,
                    and afford scope for the doctrine of chances.” <hi rend="italic">{Monthly Review
                    for September</hi> 1795, art. i. p. 14.)</p>
                <p>Such views of the eyelical returns of the varied seasons may expand the
                    imagination, but will be considered rather as curious speculations, than as
                    definite conclusions which can ever be reduced to real and actual application.
                    To improve meteorology, we must submit to tread a humbler path; we must study
                    closely, and by the aid of delicate instruments, the constitution and
                    modifications of the atmosphere, and pursue, under various circumstances, and in
                    different parts of the globe, a lengthened train of careful and precise
                    observations. The ordinary registers of the weather are of a very modern date,
                    and, besides being for the . most part unskilfully kept, they seldom record more
                    than the state of the barometer and thermometer, which afford not any complete
                    indication of the disposition of the atmosphère. No wonder than meteorology,
                    though cultivated from the earliest times, has advanced the most slowly to the
                    perfection of science.</p>
                <p>To prepare the way for establishing meteorology on a solid basis, we shall <hi

                    philosophical instruments which assist external observation, and indicate at all
                    times the exact condition and qualities of that mutable fluid.</p>
                <p>The ancients imagined that our atmosphere, the seat of care, mortality, and
                    corruption, reached as far as the moon, beyond which was a boundless expanse of
                    resplendent ether, the abode of celestial beings, exempt by their nature from
                    all anxiety, and absorbed in the enjoyment of eternal bliss. But the discovery
                    of the weight and pressure of the air destroyed at once this magnificent vision.
                    Comparing the length of the mercurial column with the density of the aerial
                    medium, it followed, that if the atmosphere had been an uniform fluid, it could
                    not exceed the elevation of five miles. But the air being very dilateable, the
                    higher portions of the mass which covers our globe, sustaining a diminished
                    pressure, must swell upwards, and occupy a proportionally wider space. This
                    property hence removes the boundary of the atmosphere to a much greater
                    elevation. By means of an excellent pneumatic machine, air can be rarefied about
                    a thousand times; but this degree of rarefaction would not occur below the
                    height of forty-two miles in the atmosphere. Such is nearly the limit deduced
                    from another consideration, first proposed by the famous Kepler. This most
                    original and inventive philosopher conceived, that the depression of the sun
                    below the horizon, when twilight closes around us, might furnish the data for
                    discovering the altitude of the portion of sky which reflects his latest parting
                    rays. Let C (see fig. 2, Plate CCCLV.) be the position of a spectator on the
                    surface of the earth, and A represent the point where the sun sets; the tangent
                    AB will mark the track of his lowest ray, which illuminates the upper part of
                    the atmosphere at B, whence the emission of a secondary ray BC will barely reach
                    the ground at A. But assuming the mean estimate of astronomers, that twilight
                    expires when the solar depression or the arc CA amounts to eighteen degrees. In
                    the right-angled triangle COB, the base OC, or the radius of the globe, being
                    3956, and the acute angle COB nine degrees, or the half of AOC, the hypotenuse
                    OB is easily found, and hence about 49 miles is the excess BD of CB above CD, or
                    the elevation of the boundary of the atmosphere, illumined by the latest beams
                    of the sun. A correction might be required for the deviation of the rays from
                    their rectilineal path, in consequence of the unequal refraction of the
                    different strata of the atmosphere; but in a question of this kind, resting on
                    rather loose or doubtful observations, it seems superfluous to affect any
                    delicacy of calculation.</p>
                <p>The inference drawn from the limits of twilight is not so conclusive as might at
                    first appear. The feeble slanting rays, shed from the higher regions of the
                    atmosphere, may not have been received directly from the sun, but derived, after
                    repeated reflexions, from the more distant parts of the sky. The very ingenious
                    Lambert attempted to distinguish, besides the primary twilight, a secondary, and
                    even a ternary <hi rend="italic">crepusculum.</hi> It is easy to see, that the
                    solar ray SA (fig. 3, Plate CCCLV.), after grazing along the surface, will
                    illuminate the upper atmosphere at B, from which some light will be darted in
                    the direction of the tangent BCD, to tinge another elevated portion of the sky
                    at D, which may cast a few expiring rays to the spectator at E, or shoot onwards
                    to the opposite sky at F, and thence reach, in a state of almost extinction, the
                    ground at G. Whilst the first <hi rend="italic">crepusculum,</hi> therefore,
                    sets in the west, the second will travel like a bow over the heavens, followed
                    at a regular distance by the dusky veil of the third, or the vanishing train of
                    the fourth. But it may be computed, from the vast length of the tracks which the
                    light would have to traverse, that those shades would in succession be ten
                    thousand times darker. The clearest sky, however, on the close of evening, never
                    appears marked by such contrasted boundaries. The vault of heaven seems to
                    darken by insensible transitions, from the western to the eastern horizon. It is
                    most probable, therefore, that the diminution of light, after the close of
                    evening, is owing to the prodigious rarefaction of much higher portions of the
                    atmosphere, which still catch some faint rays of the sun, without being able,
                    from excessive attenuation, to reflect them efficiently to the earth. But since,
                    unless the sky be overcast, there is total darkness in no climate, even at
                    midnight, we may therefore infer, that the body of air extends to such an
                    altitude, as to receive the most dilute glimmer, after the sun has attained his
                    utmost obliquity, and sunk ninety degrees below the horizon. It would thence
                    follow, that the elevation of the atmosphere must be equal at least to 1638
                    miles, or the excess of the hypotenuse of an isosceles right-angled triangle
                    having 3956 miles, or the radius of the earth, for its base.</p>
                <p>This very great extension of a rare expansive atmosphere appears conformable to
                    the general phenomena. But the thin investure of our globe, at least near the
                    equator, may stretch out much farther; and yet its elevation can never exceed a
                    certain absolute limit. The highest portions of the atmosphere, which is carried
                    round in 23 hours and 56 minutes, by the rotation of the earth about its axis,
                    would be projected into space, if their centrifugal force at that distance were
                    not less than their gravitation towards the centre. But the centrifugal force is
                    directly as the distance, while the power of gravity is as its square.
                    Consequently, when the centrifugal force at the distance of 6∙6 radii of the
                    earth is augmented as many times, the corresponding gravitation is diminished by
                    its square or 43∙7 times, their relative proportion being thus changed to 289.
                    Now, the centrifugal force being only the 289th part of gravity at the surface
                    of the equator, it will therefore just balance this power at the distance of 6∙6
                    radii from the centre, or at the elevation of 22,200 miles. On this hypothesis,
                    fig. 7, Plate CCCLV. will represent our globe encompassed by its atmosphere, of
                    which the equatorial diameter extends from A and B.</p>
                <p>Such is the extreme boundary of atmospheric expansion. Though it surpasses all
                    our ordinary conceptions of the space occupied by that dilateable fluid, it yet
                    scarcely exceeds the twentieth part of the distance of the moon, which was held
                    by the ancients to communicate with our atmosphere. If it really spreads out to
                    the limit now assigned, it must, in its remote verge, attain a degree of tenuity
                    which would utterly baffle imagination to conceive. Perhaps the fluid itself may
                    change in those lofty regions, and pass into a sort of ethereal essence, more
                    analogous to diffuse light than to a mass of air.</p>
                <p>The constitution of the atmosphere forms the next object of inquiry. The analysis
                    of that rare medium is one of the finest discoveries of modern chemistry. It
                    appears to consist of two distinct expansible fluids combined' in different
                    proportions, a single portion of oxygen gas being united to three parts by
                    weight, or four parts by bulk, of azote. There is also a very slight admixture
                    of carbonic acid gas, amounting to perhaps the thousandth part of the whole. It
                    may be doubted, however, whether this analysis be complete. The combination of
                    those gases obtained artificially, generates a fluid in which we can hardly
                    recognise the ordinary qualities of atmospheric air. Some fugacious elements
                    must therefore escape during the process of decomposition. Indeed, the air may
                    be considered as an universal solvent. It is the medium of all smells, and must
                    therefore dissolve the different odorous effluvia, and transmit them to the
                    olfactory nerves. The presence of moisture may perhaps assist the solution, but
                    the mass of air is still the great receptacle of those diffusive emanations. We
                    can readily distinguish several earths and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209182"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9182-0720"/>stones by their difference of smell. Nay, the
                    metals themselves, especially when rubbed, emit peculiar odours. What can be
                    more variously contrasted, for instance, than the smells of iron, of tin, and of
                    copper? The air must hence actually dissolve some traces of those metals, highly
                    attenuated indeed, and almost evanescent. If a lump of <hi rend="italic"
                    >as-safoetìda</hi> loses but a grain by exposure for several weeks, a bright
                    surface of copper may, in similar circumstances, suffer the waste of only the
                    thousandth part of a grain. The metal, if not encrusted by oxidation, would
                    consequently experience a certain diminution, however small, in the course of
                    ages.</p>
                <p>I he atmosphere is thus charged with emanations of all the various substances
                    which it sweeps. To detect such dilute corpuscles wholly transcends the powers
                    of chemical analysis. It seems probable, that the air holds some matters in more
                    copious solution than others; and the phenomena of the aerolites lead us to
                    suspect that it attracts iron and nickel with greater force than the rest of the
                    metals. The quantity of those adventitious particles contained in a given mass
                    of air may be exceedingly small, and yet the aggregate weight diffused through
                    the whole atmosphere would form a considerable amount. It appears from numerous
                    endiometrical observations, which agree tolerably well when performed in a
                    similar way, that the constitution of our atmosphere is the same in all places
                    on the surface of the earth, and at every elevation which has been yet explored.
                    Such experiments have been made at very distant points, repeated on the summits
                    of the loftiest mountains, and applied to portions of air brought down by
                    balloons from the altitude of five miles. The result is what we should expect
                    from the perpetual agitation and commixing of the lower strata of the
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>But a variety of circumstances render it extremely probable, that an expanse, far
                    above the region of tl¢ clouds, is filled by some peculiar fluid, very different
                    from the grosser element spread below. The shooting stars which are seen every
                    clear night, the <hi rend="italic">bolades</hi> or fire-balls, and the luminous
                    arches which not unfrequently occur, and which must traverse the sky at the
                    height of several hundred miles, all seem to indicate the existence of a very
                    ignitible medium. Nor is it difficult to conceive how such a collection of
                    highly inflammable fluids could be formed. Not to mention the multiplied
                    processes of art which emit those products, the great laboratory of nature is
                    incessantly at work in generating and pouring forth hydrogen gas, and its
                    various compounds. The volcanic mountains cover a considerable portion of the
                    surface of the globe; and their innumerable spiracles, with scarcely any
                    interruption, continue to discharge immense streams of inflammable aerial
                    fluids, a great part of which escape conflagration. But, as hydrogen gas has
                    little attraction to common air, it rises upwards by its buoyancy, without
                    suffering much loss in the passage through that fluid. The largeness of their
                    volume, and the celerity of their projection, conspire to favour the ascent of
                    those inflammable gases to the loftiest regions of the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>A comparison of the several quantities of astronomical refraction, at different
                    altitudes, points to a similar conclusion. The refraction which the rays of
                    light suffer in slanting across the higher regions of the air, is greater than
                    what calculation assigns to the corresponding density of the medium. But the
                    discrepancy would entirely disappear, if we suppose those strata to consist of
                    hydrogen gas, which is known to possess, in a remarkable degree, the power of
                    refracting.</p>
                <p>It seems very probable, that the higher range of atmosphere has a sort of
                    phosphorescent quality, or shines with a certain feeble light, for some time,
                    after it has been heated or excited by the incident rays of the sun. Such may be
                    the principal cause, and not any reflex illumination, of that lucid glow which,
                    even at midnight, is diffused over the clear canopy of heaven.</p>
                <p>The phenomenon of what is called the <hi rend="italic">zodiacal light</hi> might,
                    perhaps, be traced to the same source. That remarkable appearance, which is more
                    conspicuous in the finer climates, and near the vernal equinox, on the approach
                    of evening, has often been ascribed to the extension of a supposed luminous
                    atmosphere about the sun. But Laplace has shown, that such an atmosphere, far
                    from stretching to our earth, would not even reach the orbit of Mercury. The
                    zodiacal light must therefore have only a terrestrial origin. Supposing the
                    uppermost regions of our atmosphere to consist of diffuse inflammable matter, we
                    might infer from analogy, that, like the calcined sulphate of barytes and other
                    incinerated substances, they are endued with a phosphorescent quality, and
                    capable of scattering a lambent gleam on being excited by the beams of the sun.
                    But this luminary darting perpendicular rays, will evidently affect most
                    powerfully the range of atmosphere which occurs in his diurnal track. The
                    expansion of the gaseous investure of our globe above the equator will hence,
                    from its vast elevation, be descried in places even beyond the tropics, glowing
                    with a gentle flame. The luminous cone which converges from the sun to the
                    distance of perhaps 30 or 40 degrees in the circle of the equator, gradually
                    contracts and grows fainter in proportion as that body sinks farther below the
                    horizon.</p>
                <p>It thus appears, that the opinion entertained by the ancient philosophers
                    concerning the existence of a vast shining aethereal expanse beyond our
                    atmosphere, is, with some modifications, consonant to the principles of sound
                    philosophy. This is not the first occasion in which we have to admire, through
                    the veil of poetical imagery, the sagacity and penetration of those early sages.
                    It would be weakness to expect nice conclusions in the infancy of science; but
                    it is arrogant presumption to regard all the efforts of· unaiffed genius with
                    disdain. Seldom has a discovery been made without some distant ray of
                    anticipation.</p>
                <p>Having ventured to state that the highest region of the atmosphere is probably
                    occupied by some very diffuse phosphorescent gas, we shall hazard a conjecture
                    which will appear bolder, and even paradoxical,—that perhaps air, in its most
                    concentrated state, occupies the bottom of the ocean, and forms a vast bed, over
                    which the incumbent waters roll. Air has actually been condensed above a hundred
                    times, and during this process it betrayed no deviation from the fundamental
                    law, that its elasticity is directly proportional to its density. There seems no
                    reason, therefore, to doubt, that if an adequate compressive force could be
                    exerted, air might be reduced to the thousandth part of its ordinary volume. But
                    this elastic fluid would then be denser than water, and, consequently, instead
                    of rising, would fall through the liquid. Suppose, for instance, a bladder
                    filled with air, and having a small bullet attached to it, were thrown into the
                    sea; in continuing to sink, it would reach a depth where the enormous weight of
                    the column of water would compress it to the same density with the surrounding
                    mass; and if the bullet were now disengaged, the bladder would remain suspended
                    in that stratum, or if carried a little lower, it would precipitate itself to
                    the bottom.</p>
                <p>l’o form some estimate of this singular event, a simple calculation will be
                    required. Air of the ordinary temperature is 840 times lighter than distilled
                    water, and is therefore 865 times lighter than sea-water, assuming the density
                    of this to be 1∙03. But the mean pressure of the atmosphere being equal to that
                    of a column of thirty-four feet of distilled water, is hence equal to the weight
                    of a column of 32f feet of sea-water. Wherefore 32∣ X 864, or 28,296 feet, is
                    the depth of the ocean where the necessary compression would obtain. But a small
                    correction <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209195" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9195-0721"
                    />must be applied, on account of the augmented density of the sea-water itself
                    under the load of such a column. The logarithm of this density is found very
                    nearly by multiplying the height of the column by six, and striking off seven
                    decimal places; whence the <hi rend="italic">modulus</hi> of the compression of
                    water may be reckoned 723,824 feet. Of this large number, the former depth is
                    about the twenty-fifth part; consequently, to procure an equilibrium between the
                    condensed air and the-corresponding stratum of seawater, it is requisite that
                    the air should be contracted one twenty-fifth part more, or reduced to 901 times
                    less than its ordinary volume. But 32½ × 900 = 29,475 feet, from which deduct
                    the fiftieth part for the mean condensation of the column, and there remains
                    28,885 feet, the correct depth.</p>
                <p>This computation is to be considered as only a near approximation, yet
                    sufficiently accurate for the object in view. Nor shall we fatigue our readérs
                    by the investigation of a strict formula, including exponentials. It is enough
                    to mark the conclusion, that any portion of air carried five miles and a half
                    below the surface of the sea will never ascend again. Now, this limit is only
                    half the depth which the theory of tides assigns to the waters of the ocean.
                    There is more difficulty in conceiving by what process air can be conveyed to
                    its abyss. Increase of pressure, however, enables water to hold a larger share
                    of air; and the effect is hence the same as an augmented attraction. The minute
                    globules of air may therefore be gradually drawn downwards from stratum to
                    stratum, till they are at last detached from the body of water by their own
                    superior density. The precipitation and accumulation of concentrated air under
                    the ocean would thus be the results of some unceasing operation. Such a process
                    may perhaps constitute a part of the great economy of nature. It seems probable,
                    that the existence of a subaqueous bed of air is necessary to feed the’ numerous
                    fires which continually rage in the bowels of the earth, and occasionally burst
                    forth on the surface in volcanic spiracles.</p>
                <p>The variable disposition of the atmosphere is the main cause of all the
                    meteorological phenomena. It is of importance, therefore, to examine the theory
                    and application of the different instruments which can be employed to explore
                    the state of that medium. Some of these have been long in common use; but
                    others, of a more delicate and refined construction, are only beginning to be
                    known, and promise, when generally adopted, to expand our views, by opening a
                    store of new and ulterior prospects. The ordinary observations arc confined to
                    the weight and temperature of the air. There are other data still wanted to
                    determine at any time the actual condition of that medium. The dryness or
                    humidity of the atmosphere, its brightness 3r degree of illumination, the
                    different depth of the ceru-can hue of the sky, and the variable disposition to
                    chill he surface of the earth by impressions of cold transmitted rom the higher
                    regions; these objects of inquiry should ιe conjoined with others of a more
                    practical tendency, dc-ιending immediately on the mutable state of the weather.
                    Such are the attempts to measure the daily evaporation ram the ground, to
                    register the quantity of rain which alls, and to mark the direction and indicate
                    the force or docity of wind. A complete apparatus of meteorological hstruments

                    series in the order of enumeration.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Barometer.</hi> —The capital discovery of the weight and
                    pressure of the atmosphere, achieved by Torricelli in 1643, was the first step
                    in the progress of meteorology to the ank of a science. Prior to that memorable
                    period it rested n principles altogether loose and conjectural. But the
                    construction of the barometer, as an accurate instrument of observation, soon
                    disclosed what was passing in the more elevated and distant regions of the
                    atmosphere. The column of mercury, it was perceived, seldom remained long
                    stationary, but rose and fell through a sensible space, according to the
                    different state of the heavens. In fine calm weather it generally stood high,
                    but commonly subsided a short while before rain or wind. The barometer came,
                    therefore, to be regarded as a <hi rend="italic">iveatloer-glass,</hi>
                    announcing the proximate changes of the sky, and owed its general reception to
                    this belief. Its indications, however, were found by farther experience to be
                    liable to much uncertainty. 1 hough the extreme depression of the mercurial
                    column appears invariably to foretell the ravage of a hurricane, yet its partial
                    variations often pass away without being followed either by rain or wind. The
                    barometer evidently can mark only the pressure of the atmosphere, and intimate,
                    by consequence, the state of the weather, in as far as it depends on that
                    cause.</p>
                <p>Philosophers have eagerly sought to explain the fluctuations of the mercurial
                    column. They have tried every principle that might appear to exert any influence
                    in modifying the local weight of the atmosphere; but their very numerous
                    attempts, it must be confessed, hav⅛ hitherto proved singularly unsuccessful. It
                    was requisite to show that such causes would not only give results of the kind
                    expected, but were, besides, fully adequate to the production of the phenomena.
                    In most instances, however, either none of those effects could have followed, or
                    they would occur in a very inferior degree and disproportionate extent.</p>
                <p>All the proposed explications of the changes of the barometer may, perhaps, be
                    referred to three distinct sources: 1. The action of heat on the atmosphere; 2.
                    the influence of moisture on that fluid; and, 3. the impression made by its
                    rapid motion in wind. Now, the heating or cooling of the air above any given
                    place could in no way affect its pressure. The only change occasioned would be
                    in the density of the fluid; and, by the influx of the portion below, or the
                    efflux of a similar portion above, the pressure of the atmospheric column would
                    soon become adjusted to an equilibrium with the surrounding mass. The diurnal
                    variations of the barometer within the tropics, seldom exceeding the twentieth
                    part of an inch, as they follow a different course from the progress of heat,
                    are obviously not derived immediately from this cause. According to the accurate
                    observations of Humboldt in South America, at all seasons the barometer falls
                    from nine o’clock in the morning till four in the afternoon; it then rises till
                    eleven at night, and from this time it again descends till half-past four in the
                    morning, and next mounts till nine o’clock.</p>
                <p>The transition of the air, from a state of dryness to humidity, seemed to furnish
                    the most plausible explication of the changes of the mercurial column. But the
                    indication of the barometer was, in this case, distinctly at variance with the
                    ordinary feelings of men. Those who suffer under a delicate or enfeebled
                    constitution arc accustomed in damp weather to complain of the air as heavier
                    and less elastic. This language is, no doubt, metaphorical only, and descriptive
                    of the disordered state of the nervous system; but it shows the utter fallacy of
                    trusting in philosophical matters to the loose results of vulgar observation and
                    experience. Moisture, so far from loading the air by its weight, communicates,
                    like heat, increased expansion and elasticity. But even supposing a column o.
                    air to become suddenly charged with humidity, before its subsequent dilatation
                    had, by diffusing it, produced an equilibrium, still the additional pressure
                    would have been extremely small, not exceeding, at a moderate computation, the
                    fifteenth part of a mercurial inch. Any transition of that medium from dryness
                    to humidity would be quite <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209208"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9208-0722"/>inadequate, therefore, to the production of the
                    effects actually observed.</p>
                <p>Some philosophers imagine that moisture, in separating from the air, ceases to
                    press that fluid by its gravitation, and would hence explain the fall of the
                    barometer on the formation of clouds and the precipitation of rain. But when the
                    aqueous particles are disunited in their solvent, whether dispersed in minute
                    globules or collected in large drops, they must evidently descend till they
                    acquire the celerity sufficient to maintain a resistance in the medium equal to
                    their weight. The pressure of the whole atmospheric mass upon the surface of the
                    earth must therefore continue exactly the same under all the changes of the
                    constitution of the medium.</p>
                <p>The combined action of winds seems at first to promise the most satisfactory
                    explication of the variations of the barometer. It is evident that opposite
                    currents rushing to the same quarter will occasion an accumulation of the air;
                    and, on the other hand, different streams flowing from any point must reduce the
                    vertical column. But such conclusions are quite vague, without being subjected
                    to the ordeal of calculation. Now it is easy to compute that a concourse of
                    winds, blowing at the rate of fifty miles an hour, and’hence approaching to the
                    violence of a hurricane, would be required to raise the barometer only the tenth
                    part of an inch. The utmost power of a tempest could not, therefore, affect the
                    mercurial column the twentieth part of what is frequently remarked in such
                    circumstances. But trifling as this influence appears, it would be still at
                    variance with actual observation. So far from rising in strong winds, the
                    barometer almost invariably sinks; and instead of continuing depressed in the
                    place where those currents originate, and where a calm must prevail, it
                    generally stands high.</p>
                <p>i To explain the descent of the barometer during wind, a very ingenious idea has
                    been proposed, which, being apparently confirmed by experiment, has obtained
                    general reception. It is conceived, that a current of air, in sweeping over the
                    surface of the earth, must cease to exert any vertical pressure. But this
                    assumption can hardly be reconciled with any strict principle in science, for
                    the particles of air will not for a moment cease to gravitate, nor will any
                    horizontal motion of them produce the slightest derangement in a perpendicular
                    direction. A remarkable experiment, however, was made by the ingenious Mr
                    Hauks-bec about the beginning of the eighteenth century, “showing,” as he says,
                    “the cause of the descent of the mercury in the barometer in a storm.” Having
                    connected the square box cisterns of two barometers by a horizontal brass pipe
                    of three feet in length, he inserted in the side of one of the boxes another
                    pipe opening outwards, and connected the opposite side with a pipe attached to
                    the neck of a large globular receiver, into which three or four charges of
                    atmosphere had been compressed. On turning the stopcock, the imprisoned air
                    rushed with vehemence over the surface of the mercury in the cistern, and
                    effected its escape, while both columns fell simultaneously about two inches,
                    and gradually rose again as the force of the blast diminished. From this
                    experiment Mr Hanksbee formally derives four distinct corollaries: 1. “That we
                    have hence a clear and natural account of the descent and vibrations of the
                    mercury in violent storms and hurricanes ;” 2. “That not only the different
                    forces, but also the different directions, of the winds, are capable of
                    producing a difference of the subsidence of the mercury 3. « That strong winds
                    may affect the animal economy upon this very account, of their altering the
                    pressure of the atmosphere ;” and 4. “That the weight of the atmosphere being
                    diminished in one place, it is also as much diminished at the same time in
                    another place which holds a communication with the former.”</p>
                <p>This experiment has a specious appearance, and might even seem to warrant the
                    conclusion drawn from it. But a closer examination dispels the illusion. Since
                    the air had been condensed four times, it must issue from the receiver with the
                    immense velocity of 2700 feet in a second, or the double of that with which air
                    of the ordinary density would rush into a vacuum. This is a rapidity; however,
                    twenty times greater than the most tremendous hurricane. The very small change
                    of the four hundredth part of an atmosphere would hence have been sufficient to
                    produce the strongest wind ever observed, and therefore its influence in passing
                    over the mercurial surface must have been quite insignificant.</p>
                <p>But the experiment itself was absolutely fallacious. The peculiar result
                    proceeded from a mere casual circumstance, the exit-pipe from the mercurial
                    cistern being wider than the pipe which introduced the current of air. This
                    incidental arrangement is not mentioned in the description of the apparatus, and
                    we have, therefore, caused the original figure to be engraved on a reduced
                    scale, not only to prove the fact which we have just stated, but also to warn
                    experimenters of the necessity of noting scrupulously every accessary
                    circumstance blended in their operations. (See Fig. 2, Plate CCCLIV.) It is easy
                    to perceive that the tube G, which discharges the air from the box F, is much
                    wider than the tube E, which conveyed it from the receiver A. This air,
                    previously condensed, and still restrained in its passage through E, on entering
                    the cavity of the box, immediately expands beyond the limit of equilibrium, and
                    finding an easy escape through G, allows that state of dilatation over the
                    mercury during the time of the horizontal flow. But the air contained in the
                    other cistern K must, from its communication by the slender pipe I, suffer a
                    like expansion, and, consequently, the columns L and H will, in the same time,
                    subside equally.</p>
                <p>Such is unquestionably the true explication of this curious fact. Were any
                    confirmation needed, it could easily be derived from a very simple experiment.
                    Let A (fig. 3, Plate CCCL1V.) be any cylinder of tin, suppose three inches long
                    and two inches in diameter, having an open pipe inserted at B, a quarter of an
                    inch wide, and perhaps two inches long, and another opposite pipe inserted at C,
                    about three eighths or half an inch wide, and one inch long; at right angles to
                    these a recurved glass tube or syphon G II E, of the tenth of an inch bore, is
                    cemented below, descending twelve inches, and rising again six inches to the
                    open swell at E, which contains coloured water terminating at F. Holding the
                    cylinder in a horizontal position, and applying the mouth at B, let a sudden
                    blast be injected into the cavity; the water will rise instantly to G, thus
                    showing the diminished pressure, and, consequently, the rarefaction of the air
                    above it. But if a cap D, with a narrow projection of perhaps only the eighth
                    part of an inch, be adapted to the exit-pipe C, on repeating the experiment, an
                    opposite effect will take place, and the column of water, so far from mounting
                    to G, will now sink to H. It is‘evidently the difficulty of the escape through D
                    that occasions the accumulation of the air within the cylinder, and the
                    consequent depression of the water in the syphon. These different results are
                    perfectly analogous to the local fall or rise of the surface of a river
                    occasioned by the widening or contracting of its channel.</p>
                <p>After the complete failure of so many theories for explaining the variations of
                    the barometer, which it would be tiresome to enumerate, we may be charged with
                    presumption in attempting the solution of a problem that has racked and
                    exhausted so much ingenuity. Yet in all these various efforts a principle seems
                    to have been overlooked, of extensive influence, accordant with the general
                    phenomena, and sufficient, we think, on a close investigation, to produce the
                    measure of effect which is required.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209221" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9221-0723"/>
                <p>It is obvious that a horizontal current of air must, from the globular form of
                    the earth, continually deflect from its rectilineal course. But such a
                    deflection, being precisely of the same nature as a centrifugal force, must
                    hence diminish the weight or pressure of the fluid. The only question is to
                    determine the amount of that disturbing influence. Though it should appear quite
                    inconsiderable in the interval of a short space, it may yet accumulate to a very
                    notable quantity through the wide extent over which the same wind is known to
                    travel. Suppose a current to begin to flow from A (fig. 9, Plate CCCLV.) in the
                    direction of a tangent, it will successively bend from a rectilineal track at
                    the points B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. on the surface of the earth. The particles
                    of the fluid are, therefore, drawn incessantly from their course by the action
                    of gravity. Their vertical pressure is consequently diminished by the force
                    spent in producing this deflection. Wherefore, during the prevalence of the
                    wind, the atmospheric column will press with inferior weight at B than at A, at
                    C than at B, at D than at C; thus gradually decreasing through the whole chain.
                    Suppose the intervals AB, BC, CD, DE, &amp;c. to be each of them a mile, and
                    that the current reaches the points B, C, D, E, &amp;c. in successive minutes, a
                    celerity which frequently happens; the deflection at B, owing to the curvature
                    of the earth, would be eight inches, or two thirds of a foot; but the space
                    through which a body w ould descend in a minute, by the action of gravity, is 60
                    × 60 × 16 = 57,600 feet, or 86,400 times greater than the deviation from the
                    tangent. Wherefore the atmospheric pressure would, on that hypothesis, be
                    diminished by the 86,400th part for each interval of a mile from A to G. In the
                    space of 288 miles this diminution would consequently be the 300th part of the
                    incumbent weight; and over an extent of 2880 miles it would amount to the 30th
                    part. If we assume the very probable estimate, that storms involve the whole
                    region of the clouds, or attain an elevation of near three miles, the diminution
                    of pressure, occasioned by a long series of deflections in the stream, would
                    affect one half of the atmosphere. Whereforé, a wind which has blown over a
                    track of 2880 miles, at the rate of 60 miles an hour, might cause the mercurial
                    column to subside half an inch. If the velocity of the wind were doubled, which
                    is probably the limit of the most tremendous hurricane, the fall of the
                    barometer would be four times greater, and amount to two inches.</p>
                <p>That the same powerful wind can sweep over an immense track of surface is well
                    ascertained. The effects of a hurricane originating in the West Indies, at the
                    distance of 5000 miles, have often been felt on our shores. But a wind arising
                    at A must evidently be followed, at succeeding intervals, by a current from K,
                    L, Μ, &amp;c. the range of influence being thus extended over a larger track.
                    During the flow of the air, the depression of the barometer at G will be
                    maintained, or rather augmented.</p>
                <p>These conclusions are perfectly accordant with the facts observed. It appears,
                    from comparing the most accurate registers, that the pressure of the atmosphere
                    is subject to very nearly the same variations through a vast extent. A barometer
                    may be considered as in unison with another placed at the distance of perhaps
                    200 or 300 miles, and the mercurial columns in both of them rise and fall by an
                    almost simultaneous movement. But, in stormy weather, the separated barometers,
                    however they may approximate in their indications, cannot absolutely correspond.
                    The gradation of atmospheric pressure from G to F, from F to E, &amp;c. may be
                    very slow; and yet the minute differences may accumulate to a very sensible
                    amount in the <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> long range from G to A, or to Μ.
                    Thus, though a barometer may stand only the twentieth part of an inch lower than
                    another separated 200 miles, it would be half an inch below a barometer at the
                    distance of 400 miles.</p>
                <p>The theory now stated seems to furnish the most satisfactory explication of a
                    great variety of phenomena. Thus the minute diurnal alternations to which the
                    barometer is subject within the tropics, are caused by the influence of the land
                    and sea breezes. During the heat of the day those gentle airs blow from the
                    ocean, and, therefore, near the shore, and in the interior of the islands, the
                    mercurial column subsides. But after the vigour of the sun’s beams has declined,
                    they flow in an opposite direction, and consequently the mercury rises again.
                    The fluctuations are only partial, however, because such breezes hold a very
                    short sway, and do not perhaps extend beyond 100 or 200 miles.</p>
                <p>The common remark, that a north-east wind, so far from depressing the mercurial
                    column, generally causes it to rise, might appear at variance with the
                    principles which we have advanced. But that wind which really comes from the
                    north has probably a short course, and may be dependent on a more extensive
                    current which maintains a flow in the higher regions towards the poles. The
                    existence of opposite streams, though incompatible with the supposition of a
                    wide-spreading hurricane, may yet be admitted in local and partial derangements
                    of the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have contemplated the winds as describing only arcs of great circles
                    about the earth; but they may be constrained to bend in smaller circles, and
                    perhaps trace the parallels of latitude. Their flexure from a rectilineal course
                    being in this case augmented, they would in the same extent exert an influence
                    proportionally greater on the barometer. Such, near the arctic regions, may be
                    the effect of a westerly wind of no very distant origin.</p>
                <p>The same principles will explain the phenomena of eddies, whirlwinds, and
                    tornados. Suppose (fig. 4, Plate CCCLV.) a horizontal stream of air, rushing
                    from A to B, meets a contrary current blowing from C to D, and that some
                    obstacle E occurs in their line of separation. The flow will evidently diverge
                    on both sides of E (see figs. 5 and 6, Plate CCCLV.) till it swells by degrees
                    into a vertiginous revolution. Such is the origin of the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">malstroem,</hi> or whirlpool, on the coast of Norway, occasioned
                    by the meeting of opposite tides. The aerial vortices are evidently produced by
                    a similar cause. If the opposite streams have equal force, the circulation will
                    be maintained in the same spot; but if the one current flows with greater
                    rapidity than the other, it will transport the vertiginous motion by the excess
                    of its celerity. A motion of progression and revolution is thus upheld at the
                    same time. Such appearances are frequently witnessed in summer, especially in
                    the hotter climates. A whirlwind arises on a sudden, and runs over the surface
                    of the ground, drawing into its vortex all the light substances which occur in
                    the track. Immense havoc is often thus produced in' the fields of rice and
                    plantations of sugarcane. It is easy to show, that if <hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    denote in feet the radius of the extreme circle described by the whirlwind, and
                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi> the time of circumvolution in seconds, the elasticity,
                    or pressure of the column at the verge will suffer a dimi-</p>
                <p>5r nution corresponding to the fraction —. The amount of this diminution over the
                    whole base would be reduced to three fourths; and consequently <hi rend="italic"
                    >h,</hi> expressing the height of the revolving column of air, would represent
                    the mean effect of centrifugal action. Suppose the whirlwind to have an
                    elevation of 200 feet and a radius of fifty, and to circulate in three seconds,
                    the diminished pressure would be equal to the weight of a column of—' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 50</hi> ' <hi rend="superscript"> 20</hi>. <hi

                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9234-0724"/>1040 feet. This example, assuming a celerity of
                    sixty-five miles an hour, might be reckoned an extreme case, but it would
                    occasion the mercury to sink in the barometer more than an inch, or 1T2.</p>
                <p>The formula for the depression of the barometer caused by a rapid whirl or
                    tornado in the lower atmosphere, may be changed into an expression that shall
                    embrace the velocity instead of the time of revolution. This velocity in miles
                    each hour being denoted by <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> the diminished <hi
                    rend="italic">3vVι</hi> pressure of the vertiginous column will be — . It
                    thus</p>
                <p>50r appears that the effect is directly as the square of the celerity, and
                    inversely as the radius of circumvolution. And since the rapidity of whirl can
                    never exceed certain limits, the action of a tornado must diminish in proportion
                    to the extent of surface which it occupies. Suppose the height of the cylinder
                    of air to be 300 feet, the radius of the sweep 500 feet, and the celerity of its
                    extreme circulation eighty miles an hour: 1hen ——-- = 230 feet, which</p>

                    mercurial column.</p>
                <p>II. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Thermometer.</hi> —The invention of this instrument
                    has not only dispelled the illusions which formerly prevailed on the subject of
                    heat, but has mightily contributed to extend our acquaintance with the actual
                    condition of the atmosphere. A lump of iron brought into the house, from its
                    exposure during a frosty night, feels intensely cold, yet becomes gradually
                    warmer; and if it be put into the fire, it will soon grow extremely hot, till it
                    acquires the faculty of burning. On removing it from the fire, and laying it
                    again out of doors, it will, through all the steps of a contrary progress,
                    relapse imperceptibly into its former state. This obvious fact, and many others
                    of a similar kind, might have been sufficient to show that <hi rend="italic"
                    >hot</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> are nearly relative conditions, which
                    every substance is capable of assuming. The schools upheld very different
                    notions, which, after a long series of descents, have at last found shelter
                    among the vulgar. It was maintained that, of the four elements, air and fire are
                    hot, and water and earth essentially cold; and that the compound bodies, from
                    their constitution, partake of those qualities in different degrees. While the
                    senses were the sole arbiters of heat and cold, substances became classed
                    according to the sensations which they excited. If a body, such as lead, rapidly
                    abstracted heat from the touch, it was reckoned cold. But the same quality was
                    likewise bestowed on other substances of a very different kind, for instance, on
                    vinegar and hemlock, because they affect the stomach with a sort of chilling
                    sensation. Soft wood and feathers might be deemed warm, since they draw off heat
                    feebly from the touch; but pepper was also ranged-in the same class, because it
                    stimulates the organs of taste. Such a confusion of ideas disfigured physical
                    science, and perverted the practice of medicine.</p>
                <p>The construction of the air-thermometer, by the famous Sanctorio of Padua, in
                    1590, was the commencement of a salutary revolution. As it was at first intended
                    for exploring disease, it has ultimately rendered signal service ζo the medical
                    practitioners. About twenty years afterwards, those instruments were
                    manufactured by Drebbel, who carried them from Holland into England. They were
                    very rude, however, and adapted to no constant scale, but regarded merely as <hi
                    rend="italic">rceather-glasses.</hi> The discovery of the barometer opened new
                    views, and showed that the former instruments marked the conjoint effects of
                    beat and pressure. To distinguish the separate influence of heat, it became
                    hence requisite to employ some different fluid from air. Alcohol was preferred,
                    as being very expansible; and, from the year 1655, thermometers consisting of
                    rather wider tubes, terminating in balls or large bulbs filled with that liquid,
                    were manufactured by Italian artists, who imitated an arbitrary standard adopted
                    by the <hi rend="italic">Accadenda</hi><hi rend="italic">del Cimento.-</hi> Such
                    thermometers were clumsy, and susceptible of only a low range. Römer, who made
                    the fine discovery of the progressive motion of light, proposed mercury, as a
                    fluid sufficiently expansible, and capable of bearing an intense degree of heat.
                    The origin of the scale was then fixed at the melting point of ice or snow, and
                    the scale itself divided into degrees corresponding to the ten thousandth part
                    of the capacity of the bulb. Yet this mode of construction seemed tedious, and
                    liable to some inaccuracy. The capital improvement was made in 1724, by
                    Fahrenheit, who took another standard point from the boiling of waterunder the
                    mean pressure of the atmosphere. For many years that ingenious artist
                    manufactured thermometers in Amsterdam on correct principles, very neat and
                    small, adapted especially to medical purposes. The multitudes of young
                    physicians who at that period studied in Holland quickly dispersed them to every
                    part of the globe. The observations thus obtained gave juster ideas of the
                    comparative temperatures of different climates, and in many cases reduced the
                    exaggerations of travellers to moderate bounds. It thence appeared that the heat
                    of the torrid zone was not so excessive, nor the cold of the arctic regions so
                    intense, as had been commonly represented. The tropical plants could, therefore,
                    enjoy in our hot-houses all the warmth of their native climate. The thermometer
                    was first applied to direct the operations of horticulture, and afterwards
                    extended to regulate the process of brewing and other arts more immediately
                    depending on practical chemistry.</p>
                <p>Quicksilver was deemed preferable to alcohol in the filling of the thermometers,
                    not only because of the wide range which it embraces, but on account of the
                    remarkable property which it was afterwards found to possess, of expanding
                    equably with equal accessions of heat. But it failed in the lower þart of the
                    scale. The reported sinking of the mercurial thermometer in Siberia appeared to
                    indicate an intensity of cold beyond all conception. But the discovery made by
                    Professor Braun, in 1759, of the actual congelation of mercury itself, reduced
                    the extent of refrigeration to moderate limits. This fluid rpetal suffers a
                    large contraction in passing into the state of solidity; and, therefore, though
                    it freezes about thirty-nine degrees below the zero of Fahrenheit, it yet
                    shrinks through a space of more than a hundred degrees before it becomes fixed.
                    As alcohol has never been congealed, though brought, in some experiments we
                    could mention, to 150° below zero, thermometers filled with it are now employed
                    to explore, if not to measure, intense cold.</p>
                <p>Metallic thermometers are likewise well adapted for examining the state of the
                    atmosphere. They are commonly constructed on the principle of the compensation
                    balance of a chronometer, a spiral or circular spring being composed of two
                    soldered opposite plates of distinct metals, for instance of brass and steel, or
                    of zinc and platinum, which expand very differently under the action of heat,
                    and therefore continually change their incurvation. Some instruments of this
                    kind, made by Breguet at Paris, are remarkably elegant; and those more lately
                    manufactured by that ingenious artist, with a very slender form, surpass all
                    other thermometers in the exquisite sensibility of their indications.
                    Fig.9,PlateCCCLIV.representsthefirstform, reduced to about the fourth part of
                    its natural size. The main piece of mechanism is a circular spring, fixed at one
                    end, and composed of steel and brass soldered together. The other end carries a
                    clip, that acts on a short train of wheels, which turn an index on the
                    dial-plate, the extent of the scale, including the range of atmospheric
                    temperature<pb break="no" facs="nls:194209247" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9247-0725"/>.
                    The dial with its index are shown by A; and B exhibits generally the interior
                    mechanism. Fig. 4, Plate CCCLIV. delineates the latest improvement. To prevent
                    the cracking or dislocation which a large motlon of the springsometimes
                    occasions at the junction of the two metals, a thin plate of a third metal is
                    interposed. Three plates, consisting of platinum, gold, and silver, are united
                    by the rolling press into a single riband, of the thickness of only the 1200th
                    part of an inch. The instrument is formed with about twenty-seven spires or
                    circumvolutions of this very slender spring, bearing an index which travels in
                    its circle over fifty centesimal degrees, or ninety degrees by Fahrenheit’s
                    scale. The metallic film is, from its extreme tenuity, almost instantly
                    penetrated by the impressions of heat or cold, and the sensibility of this
                    thermometer accordingly surpasses all conception.</p>
                <p>It is of much importance, in keeping meteorological journals, to have
                    thermometers that shall indicate the extreme changes which occur during the
                    absence of the observer, such as the greatest heat of the day, and the lowest
                    cold of the night. For this object the metallic thermometers are easily adapted,
                    since their index may push forward or draw back any moveable mark, and thus
                    indicate the limits of its variation. Large mercurial thermometers, also, if
                    mounted like the wheel barometers, to turn an index, will answer a similar
                    purpose. But smaller instruments, though of a more complex construction, have
                    been generally preferred. A sufficient account of the self-registering
                    thermometer proposed by Lord Charles Cavendish in 1757, and of the more complete
                    instrument described by Mr Six in 1782, may be found in any work which treats of
                    the subject. The latter has now come into pretty general use, though we are
                    sorry to remark, that it seems to have fallen into the hands of very inferior
                    artists, the scale consisting merely of boxwood, rudely and inaccurately
                    subdivided.</p>
                <p>Both these instruments have been employed to ascertain the coldness of the ocean
                    at great depths. It becomes requisite, however, to make some allowance for the
                    contraction which the glass bulbs must suffer under the enormous compression of
                    the superincumbent columns of water. This can easily be computed, from the
                    effect of perhaps ten atmospheres in a condensing engine; and such corrections
                    were actually applied to the observations made in Captain Phipps’ voyage in 1773
                    towards the north pole. It is a matter of equal surprise and regret, that all
                    such niceties were overlooked in the late expeditions of Captain Ross and
                    Captain Parry to the arctic regions.</p>
                <p>The simplest, and by far the best, self-registering thermometers, are those
                    invented and constructed by the late Dr John Rutherford, of Middle Balilish, and
                    first described in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for the
                    year 1794. The one, which marks the <hi rend="italic">minimum,</hi> is filled
                    with alcohol, and the other, which indicates the <hi rend="italic">maximum,</hi>
                    is filled with quicksilver; and they are both attached to the same frame, or,
                    what is still better, affixed to separate frames, placed nearly horizontal, or
                    rather elevated about five degrees, to prevent the separation of the thread of
                    liquid. The tubes have bores from the twenty-fifth to the fifteenth part of an
                    inch wide, and include a minute tapered or conical piece of ivory, or of white
                    or blue enamel, ιbout half an inch long. This mark having in either thermometer
                    its base turned towards the bulb, is drawn to the lowest point by the alcohol,
                    which again freely passes it; &gt;ut if is always pushed forward to the highest
                    limit by the nercury, which afterwards lea∖es it. These marks, how-wer, are now
                    made cylindrical, a little thickened at the mds, and about three eighths of an
                    inch in length. (See igs. 7 and 8, Plate CCCLIV.) Fig. 7 exhibits the alcohol.or
                    <hi rend="italic">ninirnunι</hi> thermometer; and fig. 8, the one which
                    indicates he <hi rend="italic">maximum,</hi> and is filled with quicksilver.</p>
                <p>This instrument was first employed by Dr Rutherford, in some interesting
                    experiments, to ascertain the temperature of germination, and determine the
                    depth to which frost penetrates into the ground in different soils and
                    situations, at the suggestion of his neighbour Dr Coventry, the very able and
                    intelligent professor of agriculture in the University of Edinburgh, both of
                    them proprietors in the small county of Kinross. The few instruments of this
                    kind, for some time circulated, were made by the hands of. the inventor; but
                    artists have since learned to imitate and improve the original construction, and
                    nothing is wanted now but to promote their diffusion. We regret that this very
                    useful register-thermometer seems to be not yet so well known in London as it
                    deserves.</p>
                <p>The minutest changes which take place in the constitution of bodies are, for the
                    most part, attended by corresponding alterations of temperature. To explore
                    those abstruser operations of nature, which often betray the influence of more
                    extensive principles, it was now requisite to improve the delicacy of the
                    thermometer. To this object the writer of the present article had early turned
                    his attention. At first he enlarged the capacity of the bulb, and thus procured
                    degrees of such a size on the stem as to be capable of a very distinct
                    subdivision. These instruments, however, received their .impressions very
                    slowly; and therefore tubes of extremely fine bores being selected, he had small
                    bulbs blown, and filled with quicksilver, not in the ordinary way, but by the
                    aid of a compressing force. With such exquisite thermometers, it was easy to
                    procure much nicer observations, and to detect even the finer modifications of
                    corpuscular action. But, to include the usual range of temperature, it was
                    necessary to draw the stem to an immoderate length. The attempt to remedy this
                    inconvenience led to the construction of the first kind of <hi rend="italic"
                    >differential thermometer.</hi> The main object was evidently attained, if the
                    mercury should always be made to start from some given point. The tube was
                    therefore left open, and a cap adapted to the top, containing a surplus portion
                    of the fluid. When the thermometer was kept inverted, this mercury closed round
                    the orifice, and joined the thread in the stem, as in fig. 17, Plate C&lt;CCLIV.
                    But when the instrument was reversed, the excluded fluid instantly separated,
                    and sunk into the cavity under the top of the tube, as in fig. 16. In this
                    situation, the descent of the mercurial thread in the stem marked the depression
                    of temperature.</p>
                <p>A differential thermometer of this construction was used for three or four years,
                    in a variety of experiments, without ever failing. But an open thermometer must
                    be liable to some uncertainty, and unavoidably subject to a continual
                    deterioration. The loose mercury will undergo a slow oxidation, while the bore
                    of the tube is apt to be soiled and tarnished by the insensible introduction of
                    moisture. Such an instrument, however, is well adapted for many researches.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the year 1795, another form of the differential thermometer
                    was devised, which, from its simplicity, its delicacy, and extensive
                    application, has contributed essentially to the progress of physical and
                    chemical science. This instrument is now so generally known, that a few remarks
                    on its general construction will be here judged sufficient. The differential
                    thermometer is a modification of the air-thermometer, but susceptible of the
                    impressions of heat only, and exempt altogether frorri the influence of the
                    variations of atmospheric pressure. The tube, to which the scale is applied has
                    a bore of equal calibre, from the fiftieth to the fifteenth part of an inch
                    wide, the other branch being commonly wider; the terminating balls are not less
                    than four tenths of an inch in diameter, and seldom exceeding an inch and a
                    half. A glass tube,· terminated by a ball containing air, is joined
                    hermetically, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209260" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9260-0726"
                    />or by the flame of a lamp, to another longer tube, terminated by a similar
                    ball containing air also, but including a small portion of some coloured liquid.
                    The tubes are then bent, generally into a recurved or double stem, like the
                    letter U, and the liquid is adjusted to the proper height by making bubbles of
                    air pass from the one ball to the other, from the little enlargement of the bore
                    left at the junction of the tubes. If both balls have the same temperature, the
                    liquid must evidently remain stationary; but if the ball of the shorter tube be
                    warmed, the air, expanding and exerting more elasticity, will depress the liquid
                    in the stem; or if this ball be cooled, the air, by its contraction, allows the
                    liquid to ascend, from the superior elasticity of the air contained in the
                    opposite ball. The fall or rise of the liquid will, therefore, mark the excess
                    of heat or cold in the adjacent ball, and the space through which it moves will
                    measure the precise difference of temperature.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Alcohol and other volatile fluids were avoided in filling the tube, lest their
                    vapour should affect unequally the elasticity of the air contained in the balls,
                    and thus disturb the accuracy of the indication. Linseed oil tinged with alkanet
                    root was first used; but it was found to he sluggish in its movements, leaving
                    along the inside of the tube a sort of trail, which sometimes collected into
                    globules. But the great objection to this and other fixed oils was, that they
                    did not remain at the same point of the scale, but slowly shifted their place,
                    owing, apparently, to a partial absorption of air in one of the balls, while
                    their orange tint was found to fade away by exposure to the light. Deliquiate
                    potash, coloured with archil, was next employed, and with tolerable success. By
                    degrees, however, it deposited the colouring matter, and became almost limpid.
                    Hydrogen gas, instead of common air, was then adopted for filling the balls.
                    This mode of construction prevented the deposition of the colouring matter; but
                    it was experienced to be troublesome, and attended with other impediments. After
                    numerous discouraging trials, it was at last discovered that strong sulphuric
                    acid tinged with carmine fulfils every condition, remaining permanently
                    stationary in contact with confined air, and never losing in the slightest
                    degree its colour from the action of the strongest light. Since the year 1801,
                    this liquid has been constantly used in the construction of the differential
                    thermometer. When the exhibition of striking effects rather than scrupulous
                    accuracy is sought for, tinged alcohol, indeed, has in a very few cases been
                    preferred, on account of the great facility and amplitude of its motions. But,
                    in every instance, a column of liquid, terminating in the cavity of one of the
                    balls, or in a small cylindrical reservoir under it, was preferred; and not, as
                    proposed by some experimenters, a single drop of the liquid, which forces its
                    way through the bore by successive starts, and is therefore liable to much
                    uncertainty and derangement.</p>
                <p>The differential thermometer is capable of some diversity of form. It may consist
                    either of a single branch, pendant or horizontal, or it may be bent into two
                    perpendicular branches, whether contiguous or placed at a short distance. Since
                    the motion of the column in the tube is occasioned by the difference of the
                    elasticity of the air contained in the two balls, it is not essentia] that those
                    balls should be of equal dimensions; for an equipoise must obtain whenever the
                    augmented elasticity of the air of the hotter ball is balanced by its expansion
                    on the one hand, and the corresponding contraction in the opposite ball, joined
                    to the pressure of the ascending column of the sulphuric acid. In general the
                    balls are blown to a certain degree unequal, either to suit the particular
                    instrument, or to please the eye; but in making observations, it must be kept
                    invariably in the position for which it was designed, whether vertical or
                    horizontal, since the pressure of the balancing column would be effected by an
                    obliquity.</p>
                <p>1he differential thermometer, in its pendant form, and extended to a suitable
                    length, from one foot, perhaps, to three or four feet, may be employed with
                    great advantage in comparing the different temperatures of adjacent strata of
                    air near the surface of the earth during the progress and decline of the day;
                    and to detect the variations in a cloudy or a clear sky, and those occasioned by
                    winds, as modified by the quality of the ground, whether naked or clothed with
                    vegetation. But the main use of this instrument in meteorological researches
                    arises from the various modifications of which it is susceptible. The minute
                    changes of temperature which it marks discover the existence and intensity of
                    other disturbing causes. It is thus found that fresh ploughed ground is more
                    affected by the solar rays <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209273"

                    inclines to dryness or humidity, is the main source of all the variety of
                    meteorological phenomena. The changes which it undergoes with respect to
                    moisture have a marked influence on a very numerous class of substances, and
                    even on the animal frame. But unfortunately those indications are always vague,
                    and often fallacious. To ascertain the portion of humidity which a given
                    quantity of air holds, or is capable of sustaining, is a problem of the first
                    importance; but our advances to the constructing of an instrument fit to measure
                    with accuracy that disposition have been extremely slow.</p>
                <p>Most substances of a loose and spongy texture, or possessed of an absorbent
                    quality, are affected, though in very different degrees, by the presence of
                    humidity. Accordingly, the variations, both in weight and ibulk, which
                    absorbent, bodies undergo, have been employed to indicate the disposition of the
                    air with respect to moisture. For this reason such substances are likewise
                    termed <hi rend="italic">hygroscopic,</hi> since they are always affected by the
                    state of the am-Ì bient medium, though they may not precisely measure its
                    degrees of humidity or dryness. But neither heat nor moisture is passively
                    diffused, or yet shared among different bodies in equal proportions. From some
                    experiments made by Sir John Leslie, it appears that, under a like change of
                    circumstances, a hundred grains of ivory will attract from the atmosphere seven
                    grains of humidity; the same weight of boxwood, fourteen grains; of eider-down,
                    sixteen; of wool, eighteen; and of beech, twenty-eight. Other substances, in
                    their respective measures of absorption, exhibit still wider differences.</p>
                <p>The dry or humid state of the air is therefore discovered from the variable
                    weight of certain bodies exposed to its influence. ' Rock salt has been applied
                    to that purpose; but potash, the muriate of lime, sulphuric acid, and most of
                    the deliquescent substances, whether in a solid or a liquid form, act the most
                    powerfully. Other materials of a firm or adhesive consistence manifest the same
                    properties, though in a lower degree. Plates of slate-clay or of unglazed
                    earthenware, the shavings of box or horn, paper or parchment, wool or down, all
                    act as hygroscopes. But these substances, especially the harder kinds of them,
                    unless they be extremely thin, receive their impressions very slowly, and hence
                    they cannot mark with any precision the fleeting and momentary state of the
                    ambient medium. Nor is the weight which they gain by exposure proportioned to
                    the ’ eal dampness of the air; for the measures of their successive absorption
                    are found to increase in a most rapid progression as they approach to the point
                    of absolute humility.</p>
                <p>But to weigh the substances with the accuracy befitting uch experiments is a very
                    delicate and troublesome ope-ation. Those thin bodies are liable, besides, to
                    become n time covered with dust, which, while it must evidently ugment their
                    weight, cannot be detached from them without injuring their slender texture. The
                    increase of bulk vhich they acquire from the portion of moisture attracted nto
                    their substance, furnishes therefore a more certain and onvenient indication of
                    the state of the atmosphere. The olid vegetable and animal fibres are connected
                    by a fine oft netting, ;n which the power of absorption appears hiefly to
                    reside. Hence the presence of moisture always nlarges the breadth of such
                    substances, without affecting n any sensible degree their length. This effect is
                    visible ι the swelling of a door by external dampness, and in the shrinking of a
                    pannel from the opposite cause. But the substances, such as paper or parchment,
                    which have a diffused or interlaced texture, are extended by the absorption of
                    humidity almost equally in every direction. On the contrai y, twisted cord and
                    gut, being swelled by moisture, suffer a corresponding longitudinal contraction,
                    accompanied likewise, if pot confined, by some uncoiling of their fibres.</p>
                <p>All these properties have severally been employed in the constiuction of
                    hygroscopes. The expansion of the thin cross sections of box or other hard wood,
                    the elongation of the human hair or of a slice of whale-bone, and the untwisting
                    of the wild oat, of cat-gut, of a cord or linen thread, and of a species of
                    grass brought from India, have at different times been used with various
                    success. But the instruments so formed are either extremely dull in their
                    motions, or, if they acquire greater sensibility from the attenuation of their
                    substance, they are likewise rendered the more subject to accidental injury and
                    derangement; and all of them in time appear to lose insensibly their tone and
                    proper action.</p>
                <p>An attempt was made by Sir John Leslie to revive the method of measuring the
                    expansion of absorbent cohesive substances by their enlargement of capacity when
                    disposed into a thin shell; and, by successive steps, he carried the hygroscope
                    thus formed to as high a state of improvement as perhaps such an imperfect
                    instrument will admit. A piece of fine-grained ivory, about an inch and a
                    quarter in length, was turned into an elongated spheroid, as thin as possible,
                    weighing only eight or ten grains, but capable of containing, at its greatest
                    expansion, about 300 grains of mercury; and the upper end, which was adapted to
                    the body by means of a delicate screw, had a slender tube inserted, six or eight
                    inches long, and with a bore of nearly the fifteenth part of an inch in
                    diameter. (See fig. 19, Plate CCCLV.) The instrument being now fitted together,
                    its elliptical shell was dipped into distilled water, or lapped round with a wet
                    bit of linen, and, after a considerable interval of time, filled with mercury to
                    some convenient point near the bottom of the tube, where is fixed the beginning
                    of the scale. The divisions themselves were ascertained by distinguishing the
                    tube into spaces which correspond each of them to the thousandth part of the
                    entire cavity, and equal to the measure of about three tenths of a grain of
                    mercury. The ordinary range of the scale included about seventy of those
                    divisions. To the upper end of the tube was adapted a small ivory cap, which
                    allowed the penetration of air, but prevented the escape of the mercury, and
                    thereby rendered the instrument tolerably portable.</p>
                <p>This hygroscope was largely, though rather slowly, affected by <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> any change in the humidity of the ambient medium. As
                    the air became drier, it attracted a portion of moisture from the shell or bulb
                    of ivory, which, suffering in consequence a contraction, squeezed its contained
                    mercury so much higher in the tube. But if, on the contrary, the air inclined
                    more to dampness, the thin bulb imbibed moisture and swelled proportionally,
                    allowing the quicksilver to subside towards its enlarged cavity. These
                    variations, however, were very far from corresponding with the real measures of
                    atmospheric dryness or humidity. Near the point of extreme dampness, the
                    alterations of the hygroscope were much augmented; but they diminished rapidly
                    as the mercury approached the upper part of the scale. The contraction of the
                    ivory answering to an equal rise in the dryness of the air, was found to he six
                    times greater at the beginning of the scale than at the seventieth <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194209286" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9286-0728"/> hygroscopic
                    division, and seemed in general to be inversely as the number of hygrometric
                    degrees, reckoning from twenty below. Sir John Leslie therefore placed another
                    scale along the opposite side of the tube, the space between the zero and the
                    seventieth division of the hygroscope being distinguished into 100 degrees, and
                    corresponding to the unequal portions from the number twenty to 120 on a
                    logarithmic line. This very singular property will be more easily conceived from
                    the inspection of the figure. The scale might probably be extended farther by
                    continuing the logarithmic divisions. Thus, 320 degrees by the hygrometer would
                    answer to 108 of the hygroscope, or to a contraction of 108 parts in a thousand
                    in the capacity of the bulb. But at the dryness of 300, the contraction of the
                    ivory seemed never to exceed 105.</p>
                <p>Boxwood was likewise formed into a hygroscope of the same shape and dimensions;
                    but this absorbent material swells twice as much with moisture as ivory does,
                    and therefore requires its inserted tube to be proportionally longer or wider.
                    Its contractions are still more unequal than those of ivory; for, near the point
                    of extreme humidity, those alterations in the capacity of the bulb appeared to
                    be more than twenty times greater than, under like changes in the condition of
                    the atmosphere, take place towards the upper part of the scale. The space
                    included between the coftunencement and the hundred and fortieth millesimal
                    division of the scale might hence be marked with a hundred hygrometric degrees,
                    corresponding to the decreasing portions of a logarithmic line from five to a
                    hundred and five.</p>
                <p>In noticing the rapidly declining contractions which ivory and boxwood undergo,
                    Sir John Leslie did not mean, however, to state the quantities with rigorous
                    precision. Much time had been consumed in attempting to trace out the law of
                    those gradations; and such experiments are rendered the more tedious, from the
                    protracted action of the hygroscope, which often continues travelling slowly for
                    the space of a quarter, or even half an hour. This tardiness is indeed the-great
                    defect of all instruments of that nature, and utterly disqualifies them for
                    every sort of delicate observation.</p>
                <p>The very large expansions which the hygroscope shows on its approach to extreme
                    humidity, explains in a satisfactory manner the injury which furniture and
                    pieces of cabinet work sustain from the prevalence of dampness. On the other
                    hand, the slight alteration which the instrument undergoes in a medium of highly
                    dry atmosphere, seems to have led most philosophers to believe that there is an
                    absolute term of dryness, on the distance of which from the point of extreme
                    moisture they have generally founded the graduation of the different hygroscopes
                    proposed by them. This opinion, however, is far from being correct, and might
                    give occasion to most erroneous conclusions. No bounds can be set to the actual
                    dryness of the air, or the quantity of moisture which it is capable of holding,
                    which, by the joint application of heat and rarefaction, may be pushed to an
                    almost indefinite extent.</p>
                <p>The ivory hygroscope, after being for several hours immersed in air remarkably
                    dry, was apt of a sudden to split longitudinally. But if the bulb endured such a
                    range of contraction, it appeared in some instances to take at least <hi
                    rend="italic">another set,</hi> or to accommodate its constitution, by
                    imperceptible changes, to the state of the surrounding medium.</p>
                <p>But though the bulbous hygroscope is, in extreme cases, liable to much
                    uncertainty and some risk, it may yet be used with visible advantage in certain
                    peculiar situations. The very sluggishness of the instrument, when the value of
                    its divisions has been once ascertained, fits it so much the better for
                    indicating the mean results. After being long exposed in situations hardly
                    accessible, it may be conveniently transported for inspection, before it can
                    suffer any sensible change. The hygroscope could be therefore employed with
                    success to discover the degree of humidity which prevails at considerable
                    elevations in the atmosphere. It might be likewise used for ascertaining readily
                    the precise condition of various goods and commodities. Thus, if the bulb were
                    introduced, for the space perhaps of half an hour, into a bag of wool, a sack of
                    corn, or a bale of paper, it would, on being withdrawn from their contact, mark
                    the dryness or humidity of those very absorbent substances.</p>
                <p>Other hygroscopic substances have at different times been proposed, which, though
                    possessed of greater sensibility, are yet liable to the same general objections.
                    Thus, quills, reeds, gold beaters’ skin or pellicle, the skins of frogs, or the
                    bladders of rats, were made to act like the bulbs of thermometers, and to cause,
                    by their contraction or dilatation, as they inclined to dryness or humidity, the
                    included quicksilver to rise or fall in rather a wide tube. These instruments,
                    however, being subject to injury or derangement from the smallest accident, can
                    scarcely be applied to any practical use.</p>
                <p>The hygroscopes which depend on the elongation of the fibres are perhaps on the
                    whole preferable. The slice of whalebone proposed by Μ. Deluc, and the human
                    hair afterwards employed by Μ. de Saussure, are both of them sufficiently
                    sensible to external impressions; but the difficulty is to determine the precise
                    relation subsisting between those impressions and the state of the atmosphere.
                    Humidity is not distributed in equal shares through the air and among the
                    several absorbent substances exposed to its penetration; nor are the degrees of
                    expansion which it communicates either uniform or proportional to its quantity.
                    The graduation of such instruments, being thus in a great measure arbitrary, can
                    furnish no correct data of the hygrometric state of the atmosphere. The
                    assumption of two fixed extreme points as the basis of the scale is evidently
                    erroneous. Air contained within a glass receiver may be rendered as damp as
                    possible, by the copious aspersion of water on the sides; but it can never be
                    absolutely deprived of its moisture, which adheres the more powerfully in
                    proportion as it becomes diminished. Caustic alkalis, concentrated acids, and
                    some of the deliquescent salts, aided by the action of heat, all render the air
                    drier, but without being able to complete the desiccation. By the combined
                    application of other agents, and even by mechanical pressure, the driest air can
                    always be made to deposit some farther portion of moisture.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Saussure directed all the resources of his ingenuity to correct the
                    anomalies of the instrument which he proposed, and at last succeeded, by
                    multiplied precautions, in rendering it as perfect, perhaps, as its nature and
                    composition will admit. The hair∙hygroscope (for it is not entitled to the name
                    of hygrometer) certainly shows mobility; but the degrees which it marks can
                    afford no steady or tolerably correct estimate of the dryness of the
                    atmosphere.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From the few
                    observations which we have made with an instrument of this kind brought from
                    Geneva, we are sorry to say that it falls much below our expectations. Its
                    motions are slow and irregular; and it seems to be little affected by very
                    considerable alterations of the state of the encircling medium.</p></note></p>
                <p>To arrive at an accurate measure of the dryness of the air, it is necessary to
                    pursue a different route. Steam, in whatever way it be formed, whether by the
                    application of heat, or the diminution of atmospheric pressure, has nearly<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194209299" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9299-0729"/> the double of the
                    elasticity of common air, or it would, under the same compressing force, occupy
                    about twice as much space. In uniting with that fluid, and forming vapour, it
                    must hence communicate an expansion exactly proportional to the quantity
                    dissolved, or to the share of moisture required for the complete saturation of
                    the air. This principle suggested to Sir John Leslie the means of constructing
                    an accurate hygrometer, to which his researches had been early directed.
                    Inverting a barrel-tumbler, he ground the mouth perfectly flat, and having
                    drilled a hole through the bottom, he cemented into it a syphon-gage, or slender
                    recurved tube, with a narrow bore, and an intermediate swell or cavity, passing
                    through a perforated cap of lead, and holding a portion of nut oil, tinged with
                    alkanet root. (See fig. 6, Plate CCCLIV., where it is represented half the
                    natural size.) To form the scale, he divided 4∙2 inches into an hundred equal
                    parts, so that each degree corresponded to the ten thousandth part of the air’s
                    elasticity, the whole atmospheric pressure being equal to that of a column of
                    the oil 420 inches in height. Having now spread a few drops of water over a
                    surface of plate glass, and slipped the tumbler upon it, the included air
                    quickly dissolved as much moisture as was sufficient for its saturation, and
                    marked the expansion thence acquired, by forcing the oil to rise proportionally.
                    The quantity of effect varied much, but was often very considerable, amounting,
                    in fine weather, to 110 or 120 degrees. This little apparatus appeared to answer
                    the purpose intended; but it was not portable, and it always required some
                    address. It soon gave way, therefore, to other instruments, which promised to be
                    more easily and readily managed.</p>
                <p>As an hygrometer of this kind exhibits the actual expansion oι∙ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> increase of elasticity which the air acquires from
                    complete humefaction, it seemed calculated for indicating *the variable power of
                    a drier or a moister atmosphere in refracting the rays of light. The barometer
                    and thermometer had long been employed to correct the quantity of refraction;
                    but the application of an accurate hygrometer seemed no less necessary for
                    delicate observations. An instrument of the composition now described was
                    accordingly intrusted, in the course of the year 1794, to the late Dr Maskelyne,
                    and deposited in the Royal Observatory of Greenwich. Other objects, however,
                    interfered, and an investigation, which promised important results, was never
                    prosecuted on a regular and digested plan.</p>
                <p>This instrument might be rendered still more accurate, by combining it with the
                    principle of the differential thermometer. Let two similar tumblers (see fig. 5,
                    Plate CCCLIV. where it is contracted to about the fourth part of its size), A
                    and B, inverted and loaded, have their mouths ground to fit a glass plate, the
                    air contained in each of them acting by its elasticity on the column of a
                    recurved tube C, which connects their cavities. Slide both of these tumblers in
                    a dry state upon their bases, dip ι hair-pencil in oil, and pass it round the
                    outside of the nouth of A, to make it quite tight; then having removed B, and
                    spread a few drops of water over its place, slip it m the plate again. The air
                    included in B, now absorbing noisture, will continue to expand and to press upon
                    the iquid column, till it has become absolutely saturated. Should any change
                    take place in the temperature of the oom during this process, it can have no
                    effect in derang-ng the indication of the instrument, since it must influence
                    precisely in the same degree the elasticity of the air :ontained in both balls,
                    and thus produce an exact coun- .erbalance.</p>
                <p>This compound instrument is adapted to various delicate ,)hysical inquiries. In
                    the union of different substances, ι certain alteration of volume, however
                    minute, almost in- ’ ariably takes place. To ascertain such changes under
                    various circumstances greatly extends our views of the empire of chemical
                    affinity. For instance, a small bit of fresh charcoal introduced under one of
                    the tumblers will mark its absorption of the air, by the consequent rising of
                    the coloured liquid. But the tumbler being wetted over the inside, and a portion
                    of dry, though not recent, charcoal, with a pared surface, placed’within it,
                    after the air has ceased to dilate from humcfaction, if the charcoal be brought
                    in contact with water, the liquor will again rise, and continue for some time to
                    indicate a renewed expansion. As the water is imbibed by the charcoal, minute
                    globules of air will appear to escape. But if the water, by its insinuation, had
                    merely dislodged the air from the pores, there would have been no change of
                    volume, and consequently no alteration in the height of the liquid on the scale.
                    Those aerial globules must have, therefore, expanded as they emerged, or they
                    had existed in a state of condensation united to the charcoal.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if a roll of unsized paper, linen rags, slips of wood, or
                    saw-dust, be successively introduced under a tumbler in which a little water is
                    easily shed, the coloured liquor will sink rapidly in proportion as the moisture
                    is absorbed. In this case, there is an obvious diminution of volume, and an
                    union produced between a liquid and a solid, quite analogous to chemical
                    solution; whereas capillary action, such as the ascent of water through sand, is
                    attended by no change whatever of the space occupied by the compound.</p>
                <p>Another application of this instrument was to place under the tumbler separate
                    capsules containing different substances, liquid or solid, which exert a mutual
                    attraction. The included air in this case served as the vehicle of transfer, and
                    a sort of distillation was supported, of a peculiar kind. The indications of
                    this invisible process were variable, and often striking. But to enlarge on this
                    subject would be foreign to our purpose. We have only taken the opportunity of
                    noting a few of the results of an inquiry which was not pushed to any extent,
                    but which deserves to be resumed, as likely to open new paths, and to unfold the
                    more abstruse relations subsisting among different bodies.</p>
                <p>Philosophers have long entertained very crude notions respecting the union of
                    moisture with air, and the different circumstances which regulate or influence
                    the process of evaporation. Dr Halley supposed that fire, uniting with the
                    particles of water, communicates a vesicular constitution, which enables them to
                    rise and spread through the atmosphere. A similar idea was entertained by
                    Leibnitz, and was extended still farther by Muschenbroeck and Desaguliers.
                    Kratzenstein adopted the vesicular system in 1743, and endeavoured to calculate
                    the attenuation of the fluid which should produce the requisite buoyancy.
                    Hamberger, in 1750, advanced, however, a capital step, by rejecting that
                    hypothesis entirely, and attributing evaporation at once to a real solution of
                    moisture in the air. This simple theory was in the following year explained at
                    large by Le Roi of Montpellier, and fortified by some striking arguments drawn
                    chiefly from analogy. In pursuance of his theory, he proposed to pour ice-cold
                    water into a deep glass, and to ascertain the dryness of the air, by noting the
                    depressed temperature at which the dewing or deposition of vapour began to form
                    on the outside of the glass, or was again about to disappear. Could this method
                    ìiave been easily and nicely reduced to practice, it might certainly have
                    furnished an accurate estimate of the hygrometer and state of the
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Wallerius, in his researches, was drawn aside from the right path, by a fact
                    first noticed by Muschenbroeck, who asserted that evaporation is always more
                    copious from a deep than from a shallow vessel; and this curious and apparently
                    anomalous fact has been confirmed by other subsequent<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194209312" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9312-0730"/> experiments. But he found,
                    from a series of careful observations, that the quantity of water exhaled in the
                    same situation is exactly proportional to the extent of surface exposed. He
                    likewise made some experiments which seemed to furnish an explication of the
                    peculiarity remarked by Muschenbroeck, though their force was not generally
                    perceived at the time. But Richman rather darkened the subject by his strange
                    conclusion, that the measure of evaporation depends on the difference merely
                    between the temperature of the air and of the water, whether in excess or
                    defect.</p>
                <p>It was not difficult to perceive that evaporation is promoted by the application
                    of heat, and the agitation of the aerial medium. No attempts, however, were made
                    to determine the relation of that augmented effect to the actual velocity of the
                    wind. But experiments on the influence which an increase of temperature exerts
                    on the quantity of evaporation have been prosecuted with various success by
                    Lambert, Saussure, and Kirwan. The results thus obtained unfortunately differ
                    very widely; and though the researches of the celebrated naturalist of Geneva
                    were those conducted with the most care and address, yet they seem, from the
                    vagueness of their elements, not entitled to much confidence.</p>
                <p>If the estimate of the causes which regulate the quantity of evaporation was
                    unsatisfactory, still more perplexing appeared the ordinary account of the
                    source of that depression of temperature which always accompanies the process.
                    It was commonly referred to the operation of different concurring circumstances,
                    among which the agitation of thfe air was conceived to perform the principal
                    part. The dryness of that medium, on which we shall find the effect alone to
                    depend, was in a great measure overlooked, or was confounded with other
                    occasional agents. An evident confusion of ideas prevailed. The celerity of
                    evaporation was mistaken for its intensity, and the coldness induced on the
                    exhaling surface was viewed as the accumulated effect of a rapid dissipation of
                    moisture. It was not perceived that in a free atmosphere vaporization proceeds
                    with unabated energy, while the corresponding depression of temperature must
                    advance by a relaxing progression, since otherwise the accession of an
                    accelerated movement might push it to any extent. A little reflection, indeed,
                    should have convinced philosophers, that the reduced temperature caused by
                    vaporization must, in given circumstances, have a certain limit beyond which it
                    cannot pass. But simple as this conclusion may now appear, it had escaped the
                    most sagacious inquirers. Even Saussure, a patient and accurate experimenter,
                    persuaded himself that, when water evaporates slowly, the cold produced is
                    scarcely perceptible. To render this sensible, therefore, he thought it
                    necessary to accelerate evaporation. Inserting the ball of a thermometer in a
                    wet sponge, and attaching a cord to its stem, he whirled it briskly round his
                    head, and thus produced a cold of eighteen degrees by Fahrenheit’s scale, which
                    he considered as much greater than could be obtained by other processes. To
                    prosecute the inquiry, he had a sort of whirling table constructed, of about
                    five feet diameter, by means of which a thermometer, with its bulb incased in
                    wet sponge, could be made to revolve with the velocity of forty feet in a
                    second. This machine he was at the trouble and expense of having carried up to
                    the summit of the Col du Géant, where, during a residence of several days, he
                    performed a series of interesting and valuable experiments. It did not occur to
                    this philosopher, that by such a contrivance he was only creating to himself a
                    vast deal of unnecessary fatigue, and that his wet thermometer, if left simply
                    at rest for the space of two or three minutes, would have indicated exactly the
                    same results. By all his exertions, he merely shortened the very moderate time
                    required for attaining its extreme limit of depression.</p>
                <p>Such were the imperfect notions which still prevailed on the» subject of
                    evaporation so late as the year 1796, the date of the publication of the last
                    volume of <hi rend="italic">↑heVoyages dans les Alj)es.</hi> It is curious to
                    remark, that Dr Black, in his Lectures, never mentions the dryness of the air as
                    any way promoting evaporation, but ascribes the acceleration of the process
                    entirely to the warmth and agitation of that medium. His friend Dr James Hutton,
                    whose acuteness and penetration were conspicuous, had probably studied the
                    phenomenon more closely. “I never had a hygrometer,” lie says; “but I used to
                    amuse myself in walking in the fields, by observing the temperature of the air
                    with the thermometer, and trying its dryness by the evaporation of water. The
                    method I pursued was this: I had a thermometer included within a glass tube,
                    hermetically sealed; this I held in a proper situation until it acquired the
                    temperature of the atmosphere, and then I dipped it into a little water also
                    cooled to the same temperature. I then exposed my thermometer, with its glass
                    case wetted, to a current of air; and I examined how much the evaporation of the
                    atmosphere, by holding the ball of the thermometer, or the end of the tube in
                    which the ball was enclosed, towards the current of air; and I examined how much
                    the evaporation from that glass tube cooled the ball of the thermometer which
                    was included.” He then proceeds to relate some hasty and very inaccurate
                    observations made in this way. The passage now quoted occurs in a quarto volume
                    published in 1792, buried in a repulsive mass of diffuse reasoning and
                    paradoxical speculation, unsupported by any definite experiment. But Dr Hutton
                    had evidently considered it as a conjectural hint, on which he laid little
                    stress; for he speaks immediately afterwards of our possessing accurate
                    hygrometers, which could not be admitted if the assumption he seemed to make had
                    been strictly true.</p>
                <p>Whilst such loose and imperfect notions prevailed respecting evaporation, it was
                    expedient to review the process with attention, and analyse the several changes
                    which accompany it. The depression of temperature which it always occasions had
                    been hastily supposed to be proportional to the rate with which the moisture is
                    dissipated, and to be therefore augmented by every circumstance that can
                    accelerate this effect. But if water contained in a porous vessel expose on all
                    sides its surface to a current of air, it will cool down to a certain point, and
                    there its temperature will remain stationary. The rapidity of the current must
                    no doubt hasten the term of equilibrium, but the degree of cold thus induced
                    will be found still the same. A little reflection may discover how this takes
                    place. It is well known that the conversion of water into steam is, in every
                    case, attended by the absorption of the heat requisite to support a gaseous
                    constitution. Though the humid surface has now ceased to grow colder, the
                    dispersion of invisible vapour, and the corresponding abstraction of heat, still
                    continue without intermission. The same medium, therefore, which transports the
                    vapour, must also furnish the portion of heat required for its incessant
                    formation. In fact, after the water has been once cooled down, each portion of
                    the ambient air which comes to touch the evaporating surface must, from its
                    contact with a substance so greatly denser than itself, be likewise cooled down
                    to the same standard, and must hence communicate to the liquid its surplus heat,
                    or the difference between the prior and the subsequent state of the solvent,
                    which is proportioned to the diminution of temperature it has suffered. Every
                    shell of air that in succession encircles the humid mass, while it absorbs,
                    along with the moisture which it dissolves, the measure of heat to convert this
                    into steam, does at the same instant thus deposite an equal measure of its own
                    heat on the chill exhaling surface. The abstraction of heat by vaporization on
                    the one hand, and its deposition <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209325"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9325-0731"/>on the other, at the surface of contact, are
                    therefore, opposite contemporaneous acts, which soon produce a mutual balance,
                    and thereafter the resulting temperature continues without the smallest
                    alteration. A rapid circulation of the evaporating medium may quicken the
                    operation of those causes; but so long as it possesses the same drying quality,
                    it cannot in any degree derange the resulting temperature. The heat deposited by
                    the air on the humid surface becomes thus an accurate measure of the heat spent
                    in vaporizing the portion of moisture required for the saturation of that
                    solvent at its lowered temperature. The dryness of the air is, therefore, under
                    all circumstances, precisely indicated by the depression of temperature produced
                    on a humid surface which has been exposed freely to its action.</p>
                <p>It may insure perspicuity, however, to recapitulate the great principle on which
                    the formation of the hygrometer depends. When water passes into steam or vapour,
                    it enlarges its capacity, and absorbs a very large share of heat. Any body,
                    therefore, having a wet surface, becomes generally colder, if exposed to the
                    access of air. But this decrease of temperature soon attains a certain limit,
                    where it continues stationary, though the dissipation of moisture still proceeds
                    with undiminished activity. The same medium which transports the vapour must
                    hence furnish also the portion of heat required for its incessant formation. In
                    fact, after the humid surface has been cooled, each portion of the ambient air
                    which comes to touch it must likewise be cooled down to the level of the dense
                    substratum. The addition of heat at the surface of contact is thus a
                    contemporaneous act with its subtraction by the process of vaporization; and it
                    quickly advances to the same degree of intensity, alter which a mutual balance
                    of opposite effects is maintained, and the coolness hence induced continues
                    unaltered. An augmented circulation of the evaporating medium may hasten the
                    process; but while it has the same drying quality, it cannot in the least affect
                    the depression of temperature. As soon as such an equilibrium is attained, the
                    deposition of heat on the humid surface must become just equal to its
                    abstraction. But this deposition is evidently proportional to the diminution of
                    temperature, which is hence a measure of the share of heat abstracted, and
                    therefore of the dryness of the air, or its distance from saturation.</p>
                <p>This analysis of the process of evaporation appears so conclusive as to banish
                    all doubt and objection. But it was desirable to confirm the deductions of
                    theory by an appeal to direct observation. Accordingly, on setting the
                    hygrometer upon a table in the middle of a room, and blowing from some distance
                    against the wet ball with a pair of bellows which had acquired the temperature
                    of the apartment, the instrument still indicated the same measure of dryness.
                    The experiment was repeated more accurately on a larger scale, by exposing the
                    hygrometer out of doors to the action of a strong and arid wind, a small screen
                    being interposed and again removed, at short intervals of time, during which
                    alternations no change whatever could be perceived in the quantity of the
                    depression of temperature.</p>
                <p>Having, therefore, ascertained the great law of evaporation, and proved that the
                    coldness occasioned by it is not in any degree affected by agitation or other
                    extraneous influence, nothing seemed wanting to construct an <hi rend="italic"
                    >hygrometer</hi> on just principles, but to contrive a thermometer that should
                    mark the smallest alterations of temperature. At first Mr Leslie employed a very
                    delicate thermometer with a short range, open at the top, where a small cap of
                    glass or ivory was fixed, containing a small portion of surplus quicksilver.
                    (See fig. 16 and 17, Plate CCCLIV.) When this thermometer was heated by the hand
                    till the thread of quicksilver filled the whole of the stem, and formed a little
                    globule at the top, it was inverted, as in fig. 17, and all the quicksilver
                    united into one mass; but when it was restored, as in fig. 18, to its first
                    position, the quicksilver fell back from the cap, and lodged about the end of
                    the stem, leaving the bore completely filled. A cup (see fig. 1, Plate CCCLIV.)
                    made of thin porous earthenware, nearly of the shape of a lady’s thimble, but
                    somewhat larger, and filled with water, was exposed to the air, while the
                    thermometer lay beside it in a horizontal position. After a few minutes, the
                    thermometer was lifted up and plunged vertically into the cup; and the thread of
                    quicksilver, which had extended through the whole length of the bore, being by
                    this change of position cut off at the top of the tube, immediately contracted,
                    and marked, by the space of its descent, the diminution of temperature in the
                    liquid.</p>
                <p>The very severe winter of 1794-5 afforded Sir John Leslie an opportunity of
                    making experiments on the evaporation of ice; in the course of which he was led
                    to the construction of the differential thermometer, now so generally known. At
                    first he employed it merely as an hygrometer, the one ball being always naked,
                    and the other covered with cambric, wetted as often as occasion required. These
                    balls were about an inch and a half in diameter, and blown to the ends of the
                    same tube, one of them having a projecting point or aperture, which was sealed,
                    after the branches had been bent and a portion of coloured oil introduced. The
                    graduation of the scale was determined by placing the instrument erect bctween
                    two boxes, each containing a body of water, which encompassed one of the balls,
                    and by noticing the rise of the oil on changing the relative temperature of the
                    bath. An hygrometer, thus formed, was sent to the late Sir Joseph Banks, in the
                    summer of 1795; and Mr Gilpin, clerk to the Royal Society, deposited a copy of
                    it in their cabinet. But this model is so rude and clumsy, as hardly to recall
                    the original. In the hands of the inventor, however, the instrument was soon
                    improved, and reduced to a convenient and portable size. He had the satisfaction
                    of showing an hygrometer of this construction, in January 1796, to Dr James
                    Hutton, only a few months before the death of that very ingenious philosopher,
                    who was delighted with seeing the application of a principle which he readily
                    comprehended, and which his sagacity had obscurely anticipated.</p>
                <p>But the sluggishness of the oil, and its tendency to deposite its colouring
                    matter, on exposure to the influence of light, still opposed obstacles to the
                    perfection of this hygrometer. These were entirety removed, however, about the
                    year 1801, by the substitution of concentrated sulphuric acid tinged by carmine.
                    The most powerful and con-tinned action of the solar beams was found to produce
                    no change whatever on that purpurine liquid, when precluded from the access of
                    the external air. Any improvements which have since been effected on this
                    instrument consist chiefly in its mechanical arrangement, in the selection of
                    the tubes, the better proportion of the balls, and the elegance and conciseness
                    of the general shape.</p>
                <p>The hygrometer has two distinct forms; the one <hi rend="italic">portable</hi>
                    and the other <hi rend="italic">stationary.</hi> The former (see fig. 13, Plate
                    CCCLIV.), having its balls in the same perpendicular line, is protected by a
                    wooden or metallic case, and fitted for carrying in the pocket; two or three
                    drops of pure water, from the tip of a quill or a hair pencil, being applied to
                    the surface of the covered ball, and the instrument held exactly in a vertical
                    position whenever it is used. The latter form (see fig. 12) is susceptible of
                    rather greater accuracy, having its balls bent opposite ways at the same height.
                    In some instances, it is preferable to retain merely the simplest form of the
                    differential thermometer, the vertical stems being more distant, and the balls
                    not reflected. In both these constructions, the two balls, since they occupy <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194209338" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9338-0732"/> the same level,
                    cannot be affected in the smallest degree by· the unequal temperatures of the
                    different strata of air in a close heated room. After the covered ball has been
                    wetted, the instrument will continue to perform unimpaired, for the space,
                    perhaps, of two or three hours. The addition of a few drops of water will then
                    restore its action. But the hygrometer may be made to supply itself with
                    moisture. It is only wanted to pass some fibres of floss-silk close over the
                    humid ball, and immerse them at the distance of a few inches in a tall glass
                    decanter, full of water, with a stopper which leaves open a small projecting
                    lip.</p>
                <p>The hygrometer has its opposite balls made to exhibit nearly the same colour and
                    opacity, in order to exclude the admixture of photometrical influence, or
                    prevent any derangement which the unequal action of light might otherwise
                    occasion. The naked ball is blown of red, green, or blue glass, and the papered
                    one is externally covered with thin silk, of rather a fainter shade, as it takes
                    a deeper tint when moistened.</p>
                <p>The theory which we have given of the hygrometer, corroborated by its accurate
                    performance, might appear complete in every part. But the progress of science
                    commonly detects the existence of some collateral causes which come to mingle
                    their influence with the action of the great dominating principles. In our
                    explication of the hygrometer, we stated that the same air which <hi
                    rend="italic">abstracts</hi> moisture, and consequently the portion of heat
                    necessary to convert it into the gaseous form, must likewise <hi rend="italic"
                    >communicate</hi> to the wet ball another portion of heat equal to its
                    depression of temperature, which is hence maintained at a constant point. This
                    analysis, however, involves the supposition, that the air conveys heat from
                    bodies merely by its actual transfer. But having discovered that air transmits a
                    certain share, at least, of the heat by a sort of pulsation, or internal tremor,
                    depending on the quality of the surface from which the impression originates, it
                    was requisite to examine anew the process of evaporation. The effect cannot be
                    produced solely by the quickened 'recession of the contiguous portions of the
                    ambient medium. The conterminous air must communicate heat to the humid surface
                    also by pulsation; and hence the balance of temperature would be liable to
                    incidental variations, if moisture, with its embodied heat, were not likewise
                    abstracted by some corresponding process. And such is the harmonious adaptation
                    of these elements: the discharge of vapour appears to be subject precisely to
                    the same conditions as the emission of heat, and in both cases the proximity of
                    a vitreous or a metallic surface produces effects which are entirely similar.
                    Let two pieces of thin mirror-glass, or what is called Dutch plate, be selected,
                    about four inches and a half square; and having applied a smooth coat of
                    tinfoil, four inches square, to one of these, cover them both with a layer of
                    the thinnest goldbeater’s skin, which will adhere closely on being wetted; and
                    after it has again become dry, cut it on each into an exact square of four
                    inches and a quarter: now place the two glass plates horizontally in the
                    opposite scales of a fine balance, and adjust them to an exact counterpoise:
                    then, with a hair pencil, spread two grains of water over the surface of each
                    pellicle: in a few seconds, the plate which is coated with tinfoil will
                    preponderate, and after the former has lost all its moisture, this will be found
                    to retain still three tenths of a grain. The proximity of the subjacent metal to
                    the humid surface, therefore, impedes the process of evaporation, in the ratio
                    of seventeen to twenty; the very same as, in like circumstances, had been
                    ascertained to be the retardation of the efflux of heat. From this and other
                    experiments, we learn, that some constant portion from a humid surface is always
                    abstracted by the pulsation of the aerial medium. The steam exhaled, in uniting
                    with the air, communicates to this elastic fluid a sudden dilatation, which will
                    continue to propagate itself in successive waves.</p>
                <p>In further illustration of this matter, cover with a thin pellicle of
                    goldbeater’s skin both the balls of the <hi rend="italic">pyroscope,</hi> or
                    that form of the differential thermometer which has one ball naked and the other
                    enamelled with gold or silver, and wet them equally. The coloured liquid will
                    remain for several minutes stationary at the beginning of the scale, and will
                    then mount slowly, perhaps ten or fifteen degrees. Evaporation had, therefore,
                    produced the same cold or depression of temperature upon the surface of the
                    metal as upon that of the glass; from the glass, however, it was more copious
                    than from the metal, having left the former dry, while the latter still exhaled
                    some portion of moisture. But this action soon ceased, and the liquid fell back
                    to its former level. On applying another pellicle, the liquid continued longer
                    stationary, and rose only about five degrees. With repeated pellicles a
                    difference was perceptible in the time of drying the two balls, till the
                    thickness amounted to the 600th part of an inch.</p>
                <p>The method employed for the graduation of the hygrometer is not only very
                    convenient, but susceptible of great accuracy. The instrument, with a temporary
                    scale affixed to it, is introduced into a magazine of dry air, and compared with
                    a standard then put in action. To procure the dryness of the included medium, a
                    flat saucer of thirteen inches in diameter, and holding a body, about half an
                    inch deep, of concentrated sulphuric acid, and set on a ground plate of glass or
                    metal, is covered by a very large inverted receiver, containing more than 1500
                    cubic inches of air, and having at the top an opening of three inches wide, on
                    which rests a smaller plate, with two or three hooks projecting down from it.
                    The scale of the standard instrument was determined by suspending beside it,
                    under the receiver, two delicate thermometers, one of which had its bulb coated
                    with several folds of wet tissue paper. The descent of the coloured liquid of
                    the hygrometer, corresponding to the difference often centesimal degrees of the
                    parallel thermometers, was hence computed, and this length afterwards divided
                    into an hundred equal parts, to form the standard degrees. To graduate any other
                    instrument, it was only requisite to attach a scale of inches, and mark the
                    simultaneous measures when a steady equilibrium had at last obtained. The space
                    of half an hour is generally sufficient to bring this about. A simple
                    proportion, therefore, discovers the length answering to an hundred millesimal
                    degrees, from which the subdivisions of each particular scale are derived.</p>
                <p>The condition of the atmosphere with respect to dryness is extremely variable. In
                    our climate, the hygrometer will, during winter, mark from five to twenty-five
                    degrees; but, in the summer months, it will generally range between fifteen and
                    fifty-five degrees, and may even rise, on some particular days, as high as
                    eighty or ninety degrees. On the continent of Europe, it maintains a much
                    greater elevation; and in Upper India it has frequently stood at 160
                    degrees.</p>
                <p>When the indication of the hygrometer does not exceed fifteen degrees, we are
                    directed by our feelings to call the air damp; from thirty to forty degrees, we
                    begin to reckon it dry; from fifty to sixty degrees, we should account it very
                    dry; and from seventy degrees upwards, we might consider it as intensely dry. A
                    room is not comfortable, or perhaps wholesome, if it has less than thirty
                    degrees of dryness; but the atmosphere of a warm occupied apartment will
                    commonly produce an effect of upwards of fifty degrees.</p>
                <p>But this hygrometer will perform its office even if it should be exposed to
                    frost. The moisture spreads over the surface, and, imbibed into the coat of the
                    papered ball, will first cool a few degrees below the freezing point, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194209351" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9351-0733"/> then congeal
                    quickly into a solid compound mass. The moment in which congelation begins, a
                    portion of heat liberated in that act brings the bail back to the temperature of
                    freezing; and the coloured liquor, in proportion to the coldness of the external
                    air, starts up in the opposite stem, where it remains at the same height till
                    the process of consolidation is completed. After the icy crust has been formed,
                    evaporation again goes regularly forward; and if new portions of water be
                    applied, the ice will, from the union of those repeated fdms, acquire a
                    thickness sufficient to last for several days. The temperature of the frozen
                    coat becomes lowered in proportion to the dryness of the atmosphere. The measure
                    of heat deposited on the chill surface by the contact of the ambient air is then
                    counterbalanced by the two distinct though conjoined measures of heat,
                    abstracted in the successive acts of converting the exterior film of ice into
                    wate∏ and this water into steam; which transformations that minute portion must
                    undergo before it can unite with its gaseous solvent. But the heat required for
                    the melting of ice being about the seventh part of what is consumed in the
                    vaporization of water, it follows that the hygrometer, when the surface of its
                    sentient ball has become frozen, will, in like circumstances, sink more than
                    before, by one degree in seven. This inference is entirely confirmed by
                    observation. Suppose, in frosty weather, the hygrometer, placed on the outside
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the window, to stand at twenty-eight degrees, it may
                    continue for some considerable time at that point, until the congelation of its
                    humidity commences; but after this change has been effected, and the equilibrium
                    again restored, the instrument will now mark thirty-two degrees.</p>
                <p>The theory of this hygrometer will enable us to determine, not only the relative,
                    but even the absolute dryness of the air, or the quantity of moisture which it
                    can absorb, by comparing the capacity of that solvent with the measure of heat
                    required to convert a given portion of water into steam. To discover the
                    capacity of air is, however, ι problem <hi rend="italic">of</hi> great
                    difficulty, and it has not perhaps even yet been ascertained with much
                    precision. It was for-nerly estimated, we are convinced, by far too high. Thus,
                    Dr Crawford made it to be L85 times, or nearly double hat of water. But, from
                    several concurring observations, ve should reckon the capacity of air to be only
                    three tenth &gt;arts of that of water. But 600 centesimal degrees, or &gt;000 on
                    the millesimal scale, being consumed in the vapo-ization of heat, this measure
                    of heat would prove suffi-ient to raise an equal mass of air 20,000 millesimal
                    decrees, or those 6000 degrees augmented in the ratio of ten o three. Now, at
                    the state of equilibrium, the quantity f heat that each portion of the aerial
                    medium deposites ι touching the chill exhaling surface, or what answers to he
                    depression of temperature which it suffers from this ontact, must, as we have
                    seen, he exactly equal to the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> pposite measure of
                    heat abstracted by it in dissolving its arresponding share of moisturç.
                    Wherefore, at the temerature of the wet ball, atmospheric air would take up
                    Moisture amounting to the 20,000th part of its weight for i ich degree marked by
                    the hygrometer. Thus, supposing the hygrometer to mark fifty degrees, the air
                    would ιen require humidity equal to the 320th part of its <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> eight for saturation at its reduced temperature. When ιe papered ball
                    of the hygrometer is frozen, the degrees Íthis instrument must have their value
                    increased by one .venth, so that each of them will now correspond to an
                    Dsorption of moisture equal to the 17,000th part of the [ eight of the air.</p>
                <p>But the value of those degrees becomes augmented in much higher proportion if the
                    hygrometer be immersed ♯ hydrogen gas. This very dilute medium appears to nve
                    about eight times the capacity of common air, and He quantity of heat which
                    under similar circumstances it will deposite on the evaporating surface must
                    likewise, from the same principle of mutual balance, be eight times greater,
                    and, consequently, each hygrometric degree will indicate an absorption of
                    moisture equal in weight to the 750th part of the solvent. The energy <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> hydrogen gas is therefore scarcely less remarkable in
                    dissolving moisture than in containing heat. Confined with a powerful absorbent
                    substance, whilst common air marks eighty degrees of dryness, hydrogen gas will
                    indicate seventy. This gas must, in similar circumstances, therefore, hold in
                    solution seven times as much moisture as the atmospheric medium.</p>
                <p>To discover the precise law by which equal additions of heat augment the dryness
                    of air, or its power to retain moisture, is a problem of great delicacy and
                    importance. Two different modes were employed in that investigation, but which
                    led to the same results. The one was, in a large close room, to bring an
                    hygrometer, conjoined with a thermometer, successively near to a stove intensely
                    heated, and to note the simultaneous indications of both instruments; or to
                    employ two nice thermometers, placed beside each other, and having their bulbs
                    covered respectively with dry and with wet cambric. By taking the mean of
                    numerous observations, and interpolating the intermediate quantities, the law of
                    aqueous solution in air was laboriously traced. But the other method of
                    investigation appeared better adapted for the higher temperatures. A thin hollow
                    ball of tin four inches in diameter, and having a very small neck, was neatly
                    covered with linen, and being filled with water nearly boiling, and a
                    thermometer inserted, it was hung likewise in a spacious close room, and the
                    rate of its cooling carefully marked. The experiment was next repeated by
                    suspending it to the end of a fine beam, and wetting with a hair pencil the
                    surface of the linen, till brought in exact equipoise to some given weight in
                    the opposite scale; ten grains being now taken out, the humid ball was allowed
                    to rest against the point of a tapered glass tube, and the interval of time,
                    with the corresponding diminution of temperature, observed, when it rose again
                    to the position of equilibrium. The same operation was successively renewed;
                    but, as the rapidity of the evaporation declined, five, and afterwards two,
                    grains only were, at each trial, withdrawn from the scale. From such a series of
                    facts, it was easy to estimate the quantities of moisture which the same air
                    will dissolve at different temperatures, and also the corresponding measures of
                    heat expended in the process of solution.</p>
                <p>By connecting the range of observations, it would appear that air has its dryness
                    doubled at each rise of temperature, answering to 15 centesimal degrees. Thus,
                    at the freezing point, air is capable of holding a portion of moisture
                    represented by 100 degrees of the hygrometer; at the temperature of 15
                    centigrade, it could contain 200 such parts; at that of 30, it might dissolve
                    400; and, at 45 on the same scale, 800. Or, if we reckon by Fahrenheit’s
                    divisions, air absolutely humid holds, at the limit of congelation, the hundred
                    and sixtieth part of its weight of moisture; at the temperature of 59 degrees,
                    the eightieth part; at that of 86 degrees, the fortieth part; at that of 113
                    degrees, the twentieth part; and at that of 140 degrees, the tenth part. While
                    the temperature, therefore, advances uniformly in arithmetical progression, the
                    dissolving power which this communicates to the air mounts with the accelerating
                    rapidity of a geometrical series.</p>
                <p>It hence follows, that, whatever be the actual condition of a mass of air, there
                    must always exist some temperature at which it would become perfectly damp, as
                    Μ. Leroi had first advanced. Nor is it difficult, from what has been already
                    stated, to determine this <hi rend="italic">dewing point</hi> in any given case.
                    Ihus, suppose the hygrometer to mark 52, while its wet ball has a temperature of
                    20 centesimal degrees, or 68 by Fahrenheit; the dissolving power of air at this
                    tern-perature<pb break="no" facs="nls:194209364" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9364-0734"/>
                    being 252, its distance from absolute humidity will therefore be 200, which is
                    the measure of solution answering to 15 centesimal degrees, or 59 by Fahrenheit.
                    The same air would consequently, at the depressed temperature of 59 degrees,
                    shrink into a state of absolute saturation; and if cooled lower, it would even
                    deposite a portion of its combined moisture, losing the eightieth part of its
                    weight at the verge of freezing.</p>

                <p>These temperatures, and the corresponding quantities of moisture dissolved, maybe
                    represented by the abscissae and ordinates of the logarithmic curve, as in fig.
                    8, Plate CCCLV., where some of the principal terms are marked.</p>
                <p>The influence of warmth in augmenting the dryness of the air, or its disposition
                    to absorb moisture, affords also the most satisfactory explication of the
                    singular fact already noticed. If two equal surfaces of water be exposed in the
                    same situation, the one in a shallow and the other in a deep vessel of metal or
                    porcelain, the latter is always found, after a certain interval of time, to have
                    suffered, contrary to what we might expect, more waste by evaporation than the
                    former. Amidst all the changes that happen in the condition of the ambient
                    medium, the shallow pan must necessarily receive, more completely than the
                    deeper vessel, the chilling impressions of evaporation, since it exposes a
                    smaller extent of dry surface to be partly heated up again by the contact of the
                    air. The larger mass being, therefore, kept invariably warmer than the other,
                    must in consequence support a more copious exhalation.</p>
                <p>From the principles which have been explained, it likewise results that the
                    hygrometer does not indicate the actual dryness of the air, but only the dryness
                    which it retains after being reduced to the temperature of the humid ball. The
                    real condition of the medium, however, could easily be determined, from the
                    gradations already ascertained in the power of solution. Suppose, for example,
                    that the hygrometer should mark 42 degrees, while the thermometer stands at 16
                    centigrade; the moist surface has therefore the temperature of 11 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 8 centigrade, at which the dissolving energy is less
                    by 37 degrees than at 16 centigrade; and hence the total dryness of the air, at
                    its former temperature, amounted to 79 degrees. The following table will greatly
                    facilitate such reductions. It is computed for as wide a range of dryness and
                    temperature as will probably occur in any climate.</p>

                </table>
                <p>We may compute, that a cubic mass of air 40 inches every way, or a little more
                    than the standard of French measures, and of the ordinary density, weighs 20 000
                    grains.. The table now given exhibits, therefore, in «-rains, the weight of
                    moisture which a metrical cube of air ĭs capable of holding at different
                    temperatures. Thus, at 20 degrees, which corresponds to 68 degrees of Fahrenheit
                    this body of air could retain 252 grains of humidity. But if a larger scale be
                    preferred, the same numbers will express in pounds troy, the quantity of water
                    required to saturate a perfectly dry mass of air constituting <hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi> cube of twenty yards in every dimension. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> j</hi></p>
                <p>It is remarkable how small a portion of the aqueous element is at any time
                    suspended in the atmosphere. Reckoning the mean temperature over the surface of
                    the globe to be nineteen centesimal degrees, the air could only hold 240∙6 parts
                    of humidity for 20,000 times its whole weight; but this weight is nearly the
                    same as that of a column of water of 400 inches in altitude, and hence, if the
                    atmosphere, from a state of absolute dampness, were to pass into that of extreme
                    dryness, and discharge the whole of its watery store, it would form a sheet of
                    4∙812 inches, or somewhat less than five inches in depth. To furnish a
                    sufficient supply of rain, the air must therefore undergo <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194209403" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9403-0737"/>very frequent changes from
                    dryness to humidity in the course of the year.</p>
                <p>But it was requisite to subject theory to the test of accurate experiment. For
                    this purpose a globe or glass balloon was procured, of very large dimensions,
                    containing nearly 4000 cubic inches, terminated by a neck of about three inches
                    wide, having its mouth ground flat. The balloon was supported from the floor by
                    a light circular stand or rim, and a round piece of plate glass perforated
                    through the centre by a hole of about the twentieth part of an inch in diameter,
                    through which passed a slender silver wire suspended from the end of a fine beam
                    placed on the table. This wire was fastened to the top of the scale of a
                    delicate hygrometer, from the lower part of which hung a bit of wet paper nearly
                    three inches in diameter. The whole was balanced by a counterpoise in the
                    opposite scale, so that the instrument occupied the middle of the balloon. As
                    .the moisture gradually evaporated from the wet ball of the hygrometer, and
                    still more from the larger surface of the paper attached below it, a loss of
                    weight became visible, while the ascent of the coloured liquid in its tube
                    indicated the corresponding diminution of the dryness of the included air. The
                    progress of humefaction was observed from fifty to ten degrees of the
                    hygrometer, after each successive grain of water, amounting in all to five, had
                    exhaled and dispersed itself through the medium. Having rectified the
                    hygrometric degrees according to the principle already explained, it was easy to
                    compare them with the weight of the whole mass of air contained within the
                    balloon. The conclusions were perhaps as satisfactory as such a nice and
                    fugacious inquiry will admit; and if they be not absolutely correct, they must,
                    at least, approximate very nearly to the truth.</p>
                <p>The table given above is in strictness applicable to air only of the ordinary
                    density. Since this fluid has its capacity for heat enlarged by rarefaction, the
                    same depression of temperature must intimate a proportional augmentation of
                    dryness. Thus, for air at the elevation of three miles and a half, and
                    consequently twice as rare as at the surface, it would be requisite to add the
                    sixteenth part to the numbers in the first column. For the lower altitudes, the
                    correction will be, to multiply those numbers by triple the height in feet, and
                    cut off six decimal places. Thus, suppose, while the thermometer stood at
                    twenty-eight Centesimal degrees, that the hygrometer marked 110° on the plains
                    of Mexico at the elevation of 8000 feet above the level of the sea; then 3 ×
                    8000 X 255 = 6120000, which, being divided by a million, gives 6 to be added to
                    255, increasing the actual dryness to 261°. In most cases, therefore, this
                    modification may be neglected.</p>
                <p>But, in estimating the distance of the point of satura-ion in rarefied air, a
                    greater correction will be required. The solvent power of that medium is
                    extended about fifty ιygrometric degrees each time it has its rarefaction dou-
                    )led. Hence it may be calculated that our atmosphere vould, at the same
                    temperature, become a degree drier or every 360 feet of ascent. Thus, on the
                    preceding supposition, the air on the plain of Mexicowould have its distance
                    from the point of saturation enlarged 22½ degrees, its whole range being thus
                    283½ degrees.</p>
                <p>If the papered ball of an hygrometer be suffered to be-ome dry, the instrument,
                    even in that state, will mark, hough for a short time only, the different
                    condition of the media into which it is transported. Thus, the air of a oom
                    being supposed to have fifty degrees of dryness, on arrying the quiescent
                    hygrometer into another apartment of seventy degrees, the column of liquor will
                    fall near .venty degrees, from the renewed evaporation of that por-on of
                    moisture which had still adhered to the coats of aper. But if the same
                    instrument were carried into an apartment of only thirty degrees of dryness, the
                    coloured liquor would actually rise near twenty degrees above the beginning of
                    the scale, the paper now attracting the excess of humidity from the air. This
                    vapour, in combining with it, passes into the state of water, and therefore
                    evolves a corresponding share of heat. The equilibrium, however, unless the
                    coats of paper have a considerable thickness, is again restored in a very few
                    minutes.</p>
                <p>Those changes are most readily perceived on immersing the quiescent hygrometer
                    alternately in two receivers containing air drier and damper than that of the
                    room. If a pyroscope, having both its balls covered with goldbeater’s skin, be
                    treated in the same way, it will indicate an effect, though momentary indeed, of
                    a similar kind; for, in air which is drier, the pellicle of the naked ball will
                    throw off its moisture more freely than that of the gilt ball; and in damper air
                    it will, on the contrary, imbibe the surplus humidity with greater eagerness,
                    thus losing some portion of heat in the one process, and gaining a minute
                    accession in the other. The quantity of moisture concerned in producing such
                    fleeting alterations may not exceed the thousandth part of a grain.</p>
                <p>If a large receiver, having a delicate hygrometer suspended within it, be placed
                    on a brass plate and over a metal cup containing some water, the included air
                    will, from the solution of the moisture, become gradually damper, and this
                    progressive change is marked by the instrument. Yet the mass of air will never
                    reach its term of absolute humidity, and before the hygrometer points at five
                    degrees, the inside of the receiver appears covered with dew. While the
                    humefying process, therefore, still goes on, the close attraction of the glass
                    continually robs the contiguous air of a portion of its moisture, so that a kind
                    of perpetual distillation is maintained through the aerial medium, the vapour
                    successively formed being again condensed on the vitreous surface. But if,
                    instead of the receiver, there be substituted a vessel formed of polished metal,
                    the confined air will pass through every possible degree of humidity, and the
                    hygrometer will, after some interval, arrive at the beginning of its scale.</p>
                <p>The contrasted properties of a vitreous and a metallic surface, in attracting and
                    repelling moisture, mav be shown still more easily. In clear calm weather let a
                    drinking-glass and a silver cup be placed empty near the ground on the approach
                    of evening, and, as the dampness begins to prevail, the glass will become
                    insensibly obscured, and next wetted with profuse dew, before the metal has yet
                    betrayed any traces of humidity. The effect is, indeed, augmented by the cold
                    pulses darted from the sky, which act more powerfully on the glass than on the
                    metal.</p>
                <p>The hygrometer is an instrument of the greatest utility, not only in
                    meteorological observations, but in aiding domestic economy, in regulating many
                    processes of art, and in directing the purchase and selection of various
                    articles of produce. It will detect, for instance, the dampness of an apartment,
                    and discover the condition of a magazine, of an hospital, or of a sick ward.
                    Most warehouses require to be kept at a certain point of dryness, which is
                    higher or lower according to the purposes for which they are designed. The
                    printing of linen and cotton is carried on in very dry rooms; but the operations
                    of spinning and weaving succeed best in air which rather inclines to
                    dampness.</p>
                <p>The manufacturer is at present entirely guided by observing the effects produced
                    by stoves, and hence the goods are often shrivelled or otherwise injured before
                    he can discern any alteration in the state of the medium. Wool and corn have
                    their weight augmented sometimes as much as 10 or even 15 per cent, by the
                    presence of moisture. But the condition of these commodities could be nicely and
                    readily examined, by heaping them over a small wired cage, within which an
                    hygrometer is placed.</p>

                    with some attention serve as a substitute of the hygrometer. It does not mark
                    the mere dryness of the air, but it measures the quantity of moisture exhaled
                    from a humid surface in a given time. The atmometer consists of a thin ball of
                    porous earthenware, two or three inches in diameter, with a small neck, to which
                    is firmly cemented a long and rather wide glass tube, bearing divisions, each of
                    them corresponding to an internal annular section, equal to a film of liquid
                    that would cover the outer surface of the ball to the thickness of the
                    thousandth part of an inch. (Fig. 1, Plate CCCLV.) The divisions are marked by
                    portions of quicksilver introduced, ascertained by a simple calculation, and
                    they are numbered downward^ to the extent of 100 to 200; to the top of the tube
                    is fitted a brass cap, having a collar of leather, and which, after the cavity
                    has been filled with distilled water, is screwed tight. The outside of the ball
                    being now wiped dry, the instrument is suspended out of doors, exposed to the
                    free access of the air. In this state of action the humidity transudes through
                    the porous substance just as fast as it evaporates from the external surface,
                    and this waste is measured by the corresponding descent of the water in the
                    stem.</p>
                <p>If the atmometer had its ball perfectly screened from the agitation of wind, its
                    indications would be proportional to the dryness of the air at the lowered
                    temperature of the humid surface; and the quantity of evaporation every hour, as
                    expressed in thousandth parts of an inch, would, when multiplied by twenty, give
                    the hygrometric measure. For example, in this climate, the mean dryness in
                    winter being reckoned 15°, and in summer 40°, the daily exhalation from a
                    sheltered spot must in winter form a thickness of •018, and amount in summer to
                    ∙048 decimal parts of an inch. Suppose a pool for the supply of a navigable
                    canal exposed a surface equal to ten English acres, and that the atmometer
                    sankeighty parts during the lapse of twenty-four hours; the quantity of water
                    exhaled in that time would be</p>
                <p>80</p>
                <p>12000 × 660 × 66 × 10, or 2904 cubic feet, which cor responds to the weight of 81
                    tons.</p>
                <p>The dissipation of moisture is much accelerated by the agency of sweeping winds,
                    the effect being sometimes augmented five or even ten times. In general, this
                    augmentation is proportional, as in the case of cooling, to the swiftness of the
                    wind, the action of still air itself being reckoned equal to that produced by a
                    celerity of eight miles each hour. Hence the velocity of wind is easily
                    computed, from a comparison of the indications of a hygrometer with an
                    atmometer, or of a sheltered with those of an exposed atmometer. Thus, suppose
                    the hygrometer to mark 40 degrees, or the column of water in a sheltered
                    atmometer to subside at the rate of two divisions every hour, while in one
                    exposed to the current the descent is twelve divisions; then as two is to ten,
                    the superadded effect of the wind, so is eight to forty miles, the distance
                    through which it has travelled in that time.</p>
                <p>The atmometer is an instrument evidently of extensive application, and of great
                    utility in practice. To ascertain with accuracy and readiness the quantity of
                    evaporation from any surface in a given time, it is an important acquisition,
                    not only in meteorology, but in agriculture, and the various arts and
                    manufactures. The rate of exhalation from the surface of the ground is scarcely
                    of less consequence than the fall of rain, and a knowledge of it might often
                    direct the farmer advantageously in his operations. On the rapid dispersion of
                    moisture depends the efficacy of dryinghouses, which are too frequently
                    constructed most unskilfully, or on very mistaken principles.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, that though the atmometer should be exposed to the free air, it
                    must be sheltered from rain, which, by wetting the ball, would derange the
                    proper action of the instrument. This could easily be done, by fixing a small
                    canopy over it; or, in the case of drifting showers, to have a sort of shelved
                    open screen, like Venetian blinds, turned by the wind. The only objection to
                    this atmometer is, that it cannot be used during intense frost, since the
                    expansion of the included water, by a sudden congelation, might burst the ball
                    and even the tube. But the instrument could still be made to act in another way:
                    Let it be emptied, and a certain portion of the water, measured in the stem, be
                    spread over the outside of the ball, by successive layers, to form a coat of
                    ice. The time is to be noted when the whole of this crust has disappeared; or if
                    any portion should remain, it may be deducted from the whole, and thus the
                    hourly quantity of evaporation ascertained.</p>

                    contrived to indicate the power of illumination, by the slight elevation of
                    temperature which it occasions, has been shortly noticed in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Climate.</hi> It consists of a differential thermometer, having
                    one of its balls diaphanous, and the other coated with china ink, or rather
                    blown of deep-black enamel. (See fig. 17 and 18, Plate CCCLIV.) The rays which
                    fall on the clear ball pass through it, without suffering obstruction; but those
                    which strike the dark ball are stopt and absorbed at its surface, where,
                    assuming a latent form, they act as heat. This heat will continue to accumulate,
                    till its farther increase comes to be counterbalanced by an opposite dispersion,
                    caused by the rise of temperature which the ball has come to acquire. At the
                    point of equilibrium, therefore, the constant accessions of heat derived from
                    the action of the incident light are exactly equalled by the corresponding
                    portions of it again abstracted in the subsequent process of cooling. But, in
                    still air, the rate of cooling is, within moderate limits, proportioned to the
                    excess of the temperature of the heated surface above that of the surrounding
                    medium. Hence the space through which the coloured liquid sinks in the stem will
                    measure the momentary impressions of light, or its actual intensity. To prevent
                    any extraneous agitation of the air from accelerating the discharge of heat from
                    the black ball, and thereby diminishing the quantity of aggregate effect, the
                    instrument is always sheltered, and more especially out of doors, by a thin
                    glass case. The addition of this translucid case is quite indispensable. It not
                    only precludes all irregular action, but maintains, around the sentient part of
                    the instrument, an atmosphere of perpetual calm. Under the same force of
                    incident light, the temperature of the black ball must still rise to the same
                    height above that of its encircling medium. The case will evidently have some
                    influence to confine the heat actually received, and hence to warm up the
                    internal air. Wherefore, corresponding to this excess, the black ball will
                    acquire a farther elevation of temperature; but the clear ball, being immersed
                    in the same fluid, must experience a similar effect, which will exactly
                    counterbalance the former. The difference of temperature between the opposite
                    balls thus continues unaltered; and neither has the size or the shape of the
                    case, nor the variable state of the exterior atmosphere with respect to restor
                    agitation, any sensible influence to derange or modify the results exhibited by
                    this delicate instrument.</p>
                <p>The photometer has, like the hygrometer, two general forms; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stationary,</hi> represented by fig. 15, and the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194209429" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9429-0739"/><hi rend="italic"
                    >portable,</hi> delineated in fig. 18. But they are both of them easily
                    transported from one place to another. Their glass cases can be screwed off, and
                    the former instrument, being cemented into a small slip of brass, which slides
                    with a spring into the bottom, may be packed separately, if required, while the
                    latter is protected by an external wooden case, in which it is carried in the
                    pocket as safely as a pencil. This case, if screwed below, serves also as a
                    handle to hold the photometer in a vertical position out of doors.</p>
                <p>The photometer, placed in open air, exhibits distinctly the progress of
                    illumination from the morning’s dawn to the full vigour of noon, and thence its
                    gradual decline till evening has spread her mantle; it marks the growth of light
                    from the winter solstice to the height of summer, and its subsequent decay
                    through the dusky shades of autumn; and it enables us to compare, with numerical
                    accuracy, the brightness of different countries, the brilliant sky of Italy, for
                    instance, with the murky atmosphere of Holland.</p>
                <p>In this climate, the direct impression of the sun about midsummer amounts to
                    about 90 degrees; but it regularly declines as his rays become more oblique. The
                    greatest force of the solar beams with us in the depth of winter reaches only to
                    25 degrees. At the altitude of 17 degrees, it is already reduced to one half;
                    and at 3 degrees above the horizon, the whole effect exceeds not one millesimal
                    degree.</p>
                <p>The quantity of indirect light reflected from the sky, though extremely
                    fluctuating in our climate, is often very considerable. It may be estimated at
                    30 or 40 degrees in summer, and 10 or 15 in winter. This secondary light is most
                    powerful when the sky is overspread with thin fleecy clouds; it is feeblest,
                    either when the rays arc obstructed by a mass of congregated vapours, or when
                    the atmosphere is clear and of a deep azure tint. On the lofty <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> summits of the Alps or Andes, the photometer,
                    screened from the sun, and only exposed to the dark hue of the broad expanse,
                    would indicate a very small effect. During the solar eclipse which took place on
                    the 7th of September 1820, the sky being completely overclouded, it showed, both
                    before and after the passage of the moon’s disc, only 12 degrees of light; but
                    when the obscuration was the greatest, it marked not more than a single
                    degree.</p>
                <p>The delicacy of this instrument renders it a valuable auxiliary in various
                    scientific inquiries. It ascertains the diminution which the rays of light
                    suffer in reflection, and during their passage through different transparent
                    substances. By combining it with the transferrer of an air-pump, it likewise
                    detects the comparative powers for conducting heat of the several gases, whether
                    in their ordinary state, or when variously attenuated or condensed. Hence ve
                    learn, that air expanded 256 times conducts heat near-y twice as slow, or in the
                    ratio of 7 to 13; but that hy-írogen gas transfers it with more than redoubled
                    celerity <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, )r in the ratio of 9 to 4. But the
                    photometer will measure dso the conducting powers of different liquids. It is
                    only ranted to remove the case, and plunge the instrument ;rect in a wide
                    metallic vessel, bright on the outside, but slackened within, containing the
                    liquid to be examined, and exposed to the sun’s rays. In this way, it was found
                    hat water, which conveys heat about 30 times faster than fir of the mean
                    temperature of our climate, transfuses it vith still greater rapidity if warmed
                    to a higher pitch. If he photometer, enclosed within its case, be immersed
                    un-ler the surface of water, the impression of the light will &gt;e much
                    stronger than when the balls were encircled by he actual contact of this liquid.
                    Yet will the effect be ess than if the case had been surrounded externally by a
                    ιody of air instead of water, which, by its powerful action n drawing off the
                    accumulated heat, hastens the transmis-ion of it through the internal medium,
                    and reduces the elevation of the temperature of the black ball to nearly one
                    third part.</p>
                <p>From observations made with this instrument, we likewise discover that, in the
                    clearest and most serene sky, one half only of the sun’s light, sloping at an
                    angle of 25°, will reach the ground; and that at an angle of 15°, the proportion
                    is reduced to one third; but with an obliquity of 5°, the length of track being
                    then extended ten times, one twentieth part only of the whole incident light can
                    reach the surface. When the sun has approached within a degree of the horizon,
                    and his rays now traverse a track of air equal in weight to a column of about
                    905 feet of water, no more than the 212th part of them can penetrate to the
                    ground.</p>
                <p>The photometer discovers the relative density of different artificial lights, and
                    even contrasts their force of illumination with that of the solar rays. It may
                    be mentioned as a curious inference, that the light emitted from the sun is
                    12,000 times more powerful than the flame of a waxcandle; or that, if a portion
                    of the luminous solar matter, rather less than an inch in diameter, were
                    transported to our planet, it would throw forth a blaze of light equal to the
                    effect of 12,000 candles.</p>
                <p>To compare the illumination of candles or lamps, and of the flame of coal or oil
                    gas, the best form of the photometer is that of fig. 15, Plate CCCLIV., guarded
                    both in front and behind by a pair of thin spreading plates of mica, set
                    parallel at the mutual interval of about half an inch. It may be sufficient to
                    notice at present, that the flame of coal-gas has more than triple the
                    brilliancy of that of a wax-candle.</p>
                <p>A photometer of the branched form is easily adapted to measure the diminution
                    which light suffers in penetrating through a body of water. The scale may then
                    be shortened, and the balls enlarged. A bottom of lead is turned to receive the
                    instrument, with its case, which are cemented to it. Thus loaded, the photometer
                    is suspended vertically by cross silk threads, to which a cord of some definite
                    length is attached, terminating by a small bladder. The sky being clear, and the
                    sun shining bright, the instrument is, by the help of a long pole, stretched
                    from the side of a boat, held a few minutes suspended about four inches below
                    the surface of the water,.and then drawn up, and the number of degrees marked.
                    When the direct action of the solar rays amounted to 90 photometric degrees,
                    their enfeebled influence on the instrument, while thus encompassed externally
                    by a dense chilling body of water, was commonly found to be reduced to 32
                    degrees. From this point, therefore, the subsequent diminution, occasioned by
                    the descent of the instrument, was computed. The photometer, being let down, was
                    left to float near a quarter of an hour at the depth of perhaps three or six
                    fathoms. On drawing it up, the diminished action of the light, occasioned by <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> the length of oblique passage, was at once
                    perceived.</p>
                <p>From experiments performed in this way last summer, it follows that half of the
                    incident light which might pass through a field of air of the ordinary density
                    and 15½ mile⅛ of extent, would penetrate only to the perpendicular depth of 15
                    feet in the clearest sea-water, which is, therefore, 5400 times less diaphanous
                    than the atmospheric medium. 1he light is hence diminished four times for every
                    five fathoms of vertical descent; and, consequently, the 64th part only could
                    reach to the depth of 15 fathoms. Supposing the bottom, then, to consist of a
                    clear white sand, the portion of light reflected, and sent back to the surface,
                    would be attenuated more than 64 × 64, or 4096 times, and would therefore hardly
                    be perceptible to the most acute eye. But the water of shallow lakes, though not
                    apparently turbid, betrays a still greater opacity, insomuch that the
                    perpendicular light was diminished one half in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194209442" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9442-0740"/>descending only through the
                    space of six feet in Loch Leven, or even two feet in a fine artificial sheet of
                    water at Raith, near Kirkaldy. These results, however, are to be considered as
                    mere approximations, the state of the weather having been very unfavourable for
                    such experiments.</p>
                <p>It would be easy, by a small modification, to adapt the photometer as a
                    diaphanometer, for measuring the comparative transparency of different
                    collections of water. The black and the clear ball might be blown larger than
                    usual, and the instrument covered with two thin parallel cases of glass,
                    separated by an interval of about three eighths of an inch. The transparency of
                    a lake, or of the sea, would be inversely as the length of passage traversed by
                    the light, when it had suffered a proportional diminution of intensity.</p>

                    this work under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Climate.</hi> For about two
                    years few good observations were added, owing to the prevalence of very cloudy
                    and windy weather. The chief object, then, was to render the aethrioscope more
                    portable, in the hope of obtaining, through it, some correct information
                    regarding the state of the atmosphere in other quarters of the globe. The upper
                    ball is now scarcely half an inch in diameter; but to compensate for this
                    diminution, the lower ball has a diameter of about four fifths of an inch. The
                    tube, which exceeds not four inches in length, has its bore contracted, a little
                    above its junction, to the very short cylindrical cavity that holds the coloured
                    liquor. This simple contrivance, augmenting greatly the capillary action,
                    prevents the descent of the column into the ball from any sudden change of
                    temperature, while it only retards the motion of the fluid, without affecting
                    the accuracy of its play. Fig. 10, Plate CCCLV. represents the instrument in
                    this abridged form, and fig. 11 shows the way of packing it, the bottom being
                    merely screwed to the top of the case. The only precaution needed is, not to
                    shake the aethrioscope, or invert it; and as it takes very little room, it may
                    easily be carried by the traveller in his pocket.</p>
                <p>In ordinary cases, the hot or cold pulses propagated through the air only assist
                    the energy of the transfer of the different portions of the fluid in promoting
                    an equilibrium of temperature. But the aethrioscope proves that those pulses are
                    incessantly forwarding such a balance, even while the mere transfer and
                    commixture of the medium would not contribute to the effect. In the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Climate,</hi> it was shown that the rapid interchange which
                    takes place between the higher and lower strata of the atmosphere maintains an
                    equal distribution in the <hi rend="italic">quantity,</hi> and not in the <hi
                    rend="italic">intensity,</hi> of heat. Since air has its capacity for heat
                    increased by rarefaction, it must, with the same igneous infusion, indicate a
                    proportionally depressed •temperature. But this inequality of temperature,
                    resulting from the internal commotion produced by the sun’s rays acting more
                    powerfully near the surface of the earth, is partly corrected by the influence
                    of the cold or hot pulses which are at all times darted, and in every direction,
                    unless obstructed or absorbed by the interposition of the clouds. While the cold
                    pulses from the upper strata of the atmosphere are constantly chilling the
                    lower' strata, the warm pulses again from below are exerted in warming the
                    higher regions. In most cases this mutual influence, indeed, is comparatively
                    feeble; but if the rays of the sun were withdrawn for any considerable time, a
                    great progress would be made by such a mutual interchange of the pulsations
                    towards an equality of temperature through the mass of atmosphere. The lowest
                    strata would become unusually colder, whilst the highest regions would grow
                    warmer, and sparkle with augmented clearness and lustre. Such are some of the
                    effects of the long protracted nights within the arctic circle.</p>
                <p>Much yet remains to be explored in the higher strata of our atmosphere. If the
                    differential thermometer, included within the aethrioscope, had its position
                    reversed, that instrument would become adapted to measure the hot pulses which
                    are no doubt shot incessantly upwards with various obliquity from the warmer
                    beds incumbent over the surface of the earth. It would be most interesting to
                    obtain the reports]of both the erect and the pendant opposite aethrioscope, when
                    carried up in the car of a balloon to the elevation of four miles. In that
                    region of mid-air, we might expect the hot and the cold pulses, as they crossed
                    in opposite directions, to act with nearly equal energy. The measures of those
                    effects, compared with the simultaneous indications of the photometer, could not
                    fail to dispel much obscurity, and to open new views of the disposition of the
                    elements, and of the economy of nature.</p>

                    was contrived by M. de Saussure, to measure the variable intensity of the
                    caerulean hue which the sky assumes in different climates and elevations,
                    according to the progress of the day or the advance of the season. It consists
                    of fifty-three slips of paper of about a quarter of an inch broad, stained with
                    the successive shades of blue, from the palest sapphire to the deepest azure,
                    which are pasted around the circumference of a circle of pasteboard of about
                    four inches in diameter. The colours were obtained from fine Prussian blue,
                    diluting it with white chalk, or darkening it with a mixture of ivory black. He
                    likewise compared those coloured spaces with the pure tints of a solution of
                    copper in ammonia, which resemble most the soft transparent hues of the
                    atmosphere. To represent the effect of clouds, and diffuse aqueous vapours, he
                    dropped into that liquid a portion of very fine divided argillaceous earth,
                    precipitated by ammonia from a solution of alum.</p>
                <p>In observing with the cyanometer, it should be held out of doors, between the eye
                    and the part of the heavens which is to be compared, and, with a little
                    practice, the corresponding tint is easily distinguished.</p>
                <p>In this way, Saussure found, that the deepest blue of the zenith on the summit of
                    Mont Blanc, at his station on the Col du Géant, at Chamouni, and at Geneva,
                    corresponded respectively to the shades denoted 39, 37, 34, and 26½. From
                    morning till noon, the colour of the vertical sky darkened, but became lighter
                    again as the evening advanced; and this transition was wider and more rapid in
                    great elevations. On the Col du Géant, the tint of the horizontal air at sunrise
                    was 5, it deepened to ll½ at noon, but again relapsed to 5 towards night. On the
                    15th of July, which was a very clear day, the atmosphere at the horizon had the
                    11th shade; at the altitude of 10°, the 20th; at that of 20°, the 31st; at that
                    of30°, the 34th; at that of 40°, the 37th; and thence with any sensible
                    variation to the zenith. Baron Humboldt, in his voyage from Corunna to Cumana,
                    found the tints of the sky to vary, by the cyanometer, from 13 to 24, and again
                    to 16, while the colour of the ocean fluctuated between 34 and 44.</p>
                <p>The misfortune is, that we cannot annex any very distinct ideas to these numbers.
                    We are not informed even of the proportions of the ingredients of the series of
                    colours.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209455" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9455-0741"/>
                <p>The manner of composition likewise will modify the colorific effect; and most of
                    the pigments, and especially the Prussian blue, not only want uniformity of
                    tone, but are subject to great alteration. It would be quite impossible to paint
                    with any water colours two cyanometers that should continue to agree, after
                    being exposed for some time to the action of the air and the sun.</p>
                <p>If an accurate method could be devised to discriminate colours, and mark their
                    different tints with a sort of numerical precision, it would prove a valuable
                    acquisition to philosophy and the arts. This was first attempted by the famous
                    painter Leonardo da Vinci. Zahn proposed, in 1702, to accomplish it, by the
                    graduating mixture of primary colours dispersed over the surface of a triangle;
                    but he reckoned five of those colours, including <hi rend="italic">black</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">white,</hi> with <hi rend="italic">red, yellow,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">blue.</hi> The celebrated Professor Mayer of Göttingen, after
                    various trials, simplified the procedure, in a posthumous work, published by
                    Lichtenberg in 1775. Having distinguished each side of an equilateral triangle
                    into 13 equal parts, he subdivided the whole space into 91 small triangles,
                    which he painted with the successive mixtures of <hi rend="italic"
                    >vermilion,</hi><hi rend="italic">ultra-marine,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >bright orpiment.</hi> Lambert assumed three colours, <hi rend="italic">carmine,
                    Prussian blue,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gamboge,</hi> to cover a triangular
                    base, upon which he erected a coloured pyramid, having <hi rend="italic"
                    >white</hi> planted at its apex. But Dr Thomas Young, whose authority in those
                    matters has deservedly great weight, Prefers the simple triangle, and adopts <hi
                    rend="italic">red, green,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">violet,</hi> for the
                    primary colours. Their binary combinations ire <hi rend="italic">yellow,</hi>
                    formed by mixing red with green; <hi rend="italic">crimson,</hi> consisting of
                    red and violet; and <hi rend="italic">blue,</hi> produced by blend-ng green with
                    violet. The difficulty, however, is to regulate the intensity of the compounds;
                    nor can the powders be safely mixed except in a dry state, lest some che-nical
                    action should be introduced which might alter their ints. But the colours thus
                    combined must evidently want he freshness and brilliancy of those which nature
                    paints, &gt;r which the prism reveals.</p>
                <p>Air, like water, is, no doubt, by its constitution, a co-oured fluid. The former
                    is naturally blue, as the latter I s green; but these colours acquire intensity
                    only from he depth of the transparent mass. A small body of lim-ιid water has
                    the appearance of crystal, but, in proportion ,ιs it accumulates, it assumes all
                    the successive shades, till t rivals the tints of the emerald and the beryl.
                    This gra-lation is distinctly seen in the profound lakes of Switzer- ⅛nd, whose
                    lustre is never stained by any vegetable infu-ion. The same series of colours
                    emerges on receding rom our shores and approaching the vast abyss of the
                    Atlantic Ocean. At first, the water on the shelving banks 5 merely translucid;
                    at the depth of ten fathoms it ap-ears greenish; and the tint, by degrees,
                    becomes more ιtense, till it passes into a full green at the depth of fifty
                    ιthoms; but beyond soundings it darkens almost into iizure.</p>
                <p>In like manner, the blue shade of the air becomes more ∣ιtense in proportion to
                    the length of the track of light, his we perceive in viewing distant objects,
                    whose colours re always tinted by the deepening hues of the interja-ι ent range
                    of atmosphere. The remotest hills seem lost p a caerulean vesture. The mixture
                    of aqueous vapours nly diffuses a mist, which tarnishes rather than dilutes ιe
                    fine blue.</p>
                <p>It must be observed, that no substance can disclose its therent colour, but by a
                    sort of internal secretion or disection of the rays of light. The mere reflexion
                    from the jrface of a solid body could never betray its tints; for, hen rendered
                    most perfect by polish, it would only, like mirror, send back unchanged the
                    incident beams. To detect the subjacent colour, it is necessary that the
                    particles of light should at least penetrate under the surface, and, after
                    suffering a sort of chemical separation, should be again emitted. In transparent
                    substances, whether solid or fluid, the penetration is greater, but the mode of
                    evolving the native colours must be still the same. The atmosphere, besides
                    dispersing internally the blue rays, likewise reflects in various proportions
                    the white light unaltered. This fact is established by some experiments of <hi
                    rend="italic">polarization,</hi> which show that such simple reflexions are the
                    most copious from the portion of the sky which is 90 degrees from the sun, and
                    regularly decline on either side to the opposite points, where they cease
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>The white or compound beam of light suffering, in its passage through the air, a
                    continual defalcation of the blue rays, must, as it advances, assume the
                    complementary colour, or the tints of the remaining portions of the spectrum,
                    and therefore merge successively into yellow, orange, red, and crimson. Such,
                    accordingly, are the graduating colours of the solar rays, as they approach to
                    their extreme obliquity. Near sun-setting, the shadow of a pencil along a blank
                    card appears a bright azure on a lilac ground. When a diffuse attenuated vapour
                    reflects the incident light unaltered, the western sky, as the sun declines from
                    his altitude, glows with the successive shades of yellow and orange, which
                    deepen finally into a blush red. These colours again may, under certain
                    circumstances, come to be blended with the natural blue of the atmosphere. Hence
                    the explication of a curious phenomenon, which rarely occurs in this climate,
                    the existence of <hi rend="italic">green clouds.</hi> This happens in the
                    mornings and evenings, when a thin cloud is illuminated at once by the yellow
                    rays of the sun and the bright azure of the upper sky, these contrasted colours
                    producing a <hi rend="italic">green</hi> by their mixture. For the same reason,
                    sometimes a portion of the bright sky appears, in the finer climates, tinted
                    with violet. This was remarked by Humboldt in his voyage to America, and we have
                    had occasion to observe the same at Avignon. It was no doubt occasioned by the
                    reddish rays of the declining sun dyeing the intense blue of the higher
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The easiest and readiest way of ascertaining the tints of different portions of
                    the sky is perhaps to employ a sharp wedge of blue glass, of which the base and
                    the parallel sides are painted black and cased with thin brass, and the slanting
                    sides are ground to true planes, and highly polished. To these angular surfaces
                    two slides might be adapted, having each a broad slit, or intermediate opening,
                    to permit the entrance and transmission of white light. Such rays having a
                    greater length of passage to traverse, according to their distance from the top
                    of the wedge, must emerge with a proportional intensity of blue. The scale would
                    hence be determined by dividing the slides into ten or twenty equal parts, which
                    might probably be sufficient.</p>
                <p>To examine the orange and crimson tints which gild the east in the morning, or
                    suffuse the western sky on the approach of evening, it would be necessary to
                    combine a series of the complementary or accidental colours. A wedge of glass,
                    stained of a gold-red or deep orange, might answer the purpose; or perhaps a
                    nearer approximation would be obtained by joining two reversed wedges, one of an
                    angle of 8°, and crimson coloured, and another having only 3°, but of a yellow
                    body.</p>
                <p>These instruments might be reduced to a very convenient size, not exceeding four
                    inches in length; but they would require to be formed out of the same mass of
                    glass and exactly after the same pattern. With some skill in the execution, they
                    could be made to unite elegance and correctness.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9468-0742"/>to construct an instrument that should readily
                    indicate the force and velocity of the wind. One method was to employ a very
                    small model of a wind-mill, and either to reckon its revolutions, or to estimate
                    its power by the application of a weight to a conical barrel or axis. But a more
                    direct and accurate procedure consisted in measuring the impulse of wind against
                    a vertical plane, as intimated by the contraction of a spiral spring. All these
                    instruments, however, act with such extreme irregularity, as scarcely ever to
                    furnish any definite results. They are, besides, racked by incessant motion, and
                    soon put out of order.</p>
                <p>We may notice, however, a material improvement made in this construction of the
                    machine by Mr Waddel of the Trinity-House, Leith, who, amidst other objects of
                    useful experimental inquiry, has long directed his ingenuity to ascertain the
                    force and velocity of the wind. A circular plate, of four inches diameter, is
                    opposed to the blast; but instead of pushing against a spring, it presses
                    against a fine cylindrical bag, of about an inch long, and the third part of an
                    inch diameter, filled with quicksilver, and joined tight to a vertical tube of
                    glass, a foot or fifteen inches high, but having a bore only the twentieth part
                    of an inch wide. The compression of the bag caused by the impulse of the wind
                    upon the plate squeezes the quicksilver up into the tube, carrying with it a
                    small steel mark, which slightly adheres to the sides of the bore. The height of
                    the mercurial column, diminished in the ratio of the surface of the plate to the
                    section of the bag, must evidently give the measure of the force of the wind.
                    But, in the actual exposure of this anemometer, the quicksilver oscillates
                    excessively, so that the extreme effects only are indicated. The instrument,
                    however, is very sensible, and may continue to act for a long period without
                    being impaired.</p>
                <p>The direct action of the wind in supporting a column of water appears to furnish
                    the best and simplest kind of anemometer. This principle was first employed, in
                    1731, by Pitot, the French engineer, in his recurved tube for estimating the
                    force of the current of a river; and, forty years afterwards, it was applied by
                    Dr Lind to measure the impulse of a stream of air. With some modifications to
                    correct, or at least to diminish, the oscillations of the liquid, this
                    instrument is rendered quite manageable. The tube may consist of two pieces,
                    each about a foot in height, having bores of the fiftieth and the fifth parts of
                    an inch, the narrow piece being swelled out into a cylinder, perhaps an inch
                    wide and two inches long, near the end where it is joined hermetically to the
                    other piece. The top of the narrow tube is bent horizontally, and cemented into
                    the centre of a vertical circle of plate-glass, of about three inches in
                    diameter; or, instead of this plane, a hollow segment of a sphere of the same
                    expansion, but including only 30° or 40°, is substituted. The top of the wide
                    tube is likewise bent horizontal, and drawn to a point at the same height as the
                    minute central orifice of the cavity, and bent in the opposite direction. A
                    portion of nut-oil, tinged by the alkanet root, had been previously introduced
                    into the cylindrical cistern. On turning the small plate or bason to front the
                    wind, a condensation, corresponding to its force, is immediately produced on the
                    opposing surface, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> small portion of air enters the
                    orifice, and continues to press upon the oil, till this rises to form an
                    equiponderant column in the wide tube. As the air can with difficulty penetrate
                    through the very narrow bore, the irregular action of the blast is, in a great
                    measure, corrected, and the oil moves rather tardily.</p>
                <p>A scale is adapted, bearing two sorts of divisions, the one indicating the
                    impulse, and the other the velocity, of the wind. Reckoning the weight of the
                    atmosphere equivalent to a column of oil of 400 inches in altitude, this space
                    is subdivided into 10,000 equal portions, each degree thus corresponding to the
                    twenty-fifth part of an inch. It would hence be easy to show, that the pressure
                    of the wind upon every square foot of surface is expressed in pounds
                    avoirdupois, by dividing by five the number of degrees through which the oil
                    ascends.</p>
                <p>But we may place an adjacent line of subdivisions, that shall mark the velocity
                    of the wind in miles each hour. Since air will rush into a vacuum at the rate of
                    1350 feet in a second, it would, under a predominating pressure of the lOOth
                    part of an atmosphere, or at 100 degrees, flow with a celerity ten times less,
                    or 135 feet in a second, which corresponds to 92 miles in an hour. Wherefore, 25
                    degrees of the scale of impulse would be marked by a velocity of 46 miles, and
                    61 degrees by that of 23 miles, in an hour. The subordinate divisions could
                    hence be easily formed.</p>
                <p>Such are the velocities which theory would assign to the different altitudes of
                    the columns supported by the force of the wind. But the actual resistance of
                    fluids, owing chiefly to their detention at the obstructing surface, generally
                    exceeds the result of calculation. In the case of water and air, the ratio of
                    excess appears from experiment to be nearly that of eight to five. We may
                    therefore modify the velocities after this proportion above stated. The
                    relations of celerity and impulse will stand thus:</p>

                <p>This anemometer, being furnished with a vane to make it always face the wind,
                    might also, by an index, point out the direction. Nor is it absolutely requisite
                    that the instrument should be exposed out of doors. The funnel, with its vane,
                    may have a socket of bell-metal, nicely fitted to the top of a long perforated
                    brass tube, which descends from the roof of the house, and terminates below in
                    the recurved tube and its double scale. The impressions of the wind would thus
                    be conveyed with great regularity and undiminished effect to the surface of the
                    oil. Still, however, it would be impossible to avoid entirely the oscillations
                    of the liquid column. Even the steadiest wind will be found to blow with a
                    reciprocating force, now swelling and again relaxing, and, at certain short
                    intervals, concentrating all its vehemence.</p>

                    >Rain-Gauge.</hi> —A very simple instrument, contrived to indicate the quantity,
                    or rather the depth, of the rain which falls upon any spot. It is likewise named
                    <hi rend="italic">Hyetometer,</hi> and has been sometimes called by the
                    barbarous compound <hi rend="italic">Pluviometer.</hi> It is composed generally
                    of a circular bason of tinned iron, soldered to the top of a vertical cylinder,
                    which is contracted in some given proportion, and closed below. A small float is
                    introduced, bearing a slender rod, distinguished by the corresponding divisions.
                    In the most ordinary construction, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209481"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9481-0743"/>the bason being a foot wide, the attached cylinder
                    has 3∣ inches in diameter, and its section is consequently ten times smaller.
                    The inches on the rod arc hence marked only tenth parts.</p>
                <p>This method of measuring the fall of rain is evidently not susceptible of much
                    accuracy; and it would require the gauge to be very frequently visited, on
                    account of the loss of the water by continual evaporation. The more correct
                    ombrometers have their bason made of brass, and turned to a fine sharp edge; the
                    rain, as it falls, runs through a small orifice into the vertical cylinder,
                    which has only about the fourth part of the diameter, and communicates, by means
                    of a cock, with another perpendicular tube still narrower, and consisting of
                    glass having a scale affixed. The divisions of this scale are determined from
                    the proportion of the joint sections of the cylinder and tube to the horizontal
                    surface of the bason. In making an observation, the cock, being turned, lets the
                    collected water rise to the same level in the glass tube, and thus indicate its
                    quantity, which, by another operation, is now drawn off. In the time of frost or
                    snow, it becomes necessary to warm the instrument gently, and make the water
                    flow.</p>
                <p>We may suspect that the measure of the rain, hail, or snowy flakes received by
                    the ombrometer, is not exactly proportioned to the extent of surface which it
                    presents; for, while torrents pour down from the heavens, an eddy plays about
                    the rim of the bason, deranging the regularity of the discharge. A bason of
                    several feet in diameter would perhaps be preferable, or the platform of a roof
                    could be adopted, if it were sufficiently sloped to allow the rain to collect
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>But the most perplexing circumstance affecting the ombrometer is, that it has
                    been found to indicate very different quantities of rain as falling upon the
                    very same spot, according to the different elevation at which it was placed. In
                    general, less rain is collected in high than*in low situations, even though the
                    difference of altitude should be inconsiderable. Thus it was discovered, that,
                    in the space of a year, while 12∙1 inches only fell on the top of Westminster
                    Abbey, J 8*1 inches were collected on the roof of a house sixteen feet lower,
                    and even 22 ’ 6 inches of rain at the ground. Similar observations have been
                    made at the summit and near the base of hills of no great elevation. In such
                    situations, we can hardly suppose the clouds to stretch down to the surface, or
                    to augment the lower portion of rain. We must hence refer the copious fall near
                    the ground to some other cause. Most of the rain which falls proceeds from
                    drifting showers of short duration. The current moves more slowly along the
                    surface, and allows the drops to descend as fast as they are firmed. But being
                    forced to mount a swelling eminence, and thus compressed into a narrower stream,
                    it hurries he mass of vapour along with it, and does not suffer the ree or full
                    discharge on the summit. On both sides of he hill, an ombrometer placed near the
                    bottom indicates dways a greater fall of rain than on the exposed top.</p>
                <p>The observations furnished by this instrument are hence iable to considerable
                    inaccuracy, unless made in an open Campaign country. Thus, a register kept at
                    Keswick gives )7½ inches, which evidently exceeds greatly the annual fall ∣frain
                    in that district; the quantity at Carlisle, not twenty-ive milesdistant, being
                    only 20 inches. Again, the measures ∣f rain, being 33 and 34⅛ inches in the open
                    country about Manchester and Liverpool, are found to amount to 45 and ∣0 inches
                    at Lancaster and Kendal, which approach the lanks of a mountainous range. In
                    general, twice as much ain falls on the western as on the eastern side of our
                    island; and the average annual quantity may be reckoned at 30 inches, or it
                    would form, if all collected, a sheet of water of that depth. According to this
                    estimate, the whole discharge from the clouds in the course of a year, on every
                    square mile of the surface of Great Britain, would, at a medium, be 1,944,643,
                    or nearly two millions of tons. This gives about three thousand tons of water
                    for each English acre.</p>

                    state of the lower atmosphere. The best instrument of this kind undoubtedly is
                    Bennet’s, consisting of two slips of thick gold leaf suspended from a knob
                    within a small cylinder of glass, which is surmounted by a cap of brass. This
                    may be connected with an insulated rod or wire, extending a few feet beyond the
                    window.</p>
                <p>The electrometer indicates the condition of the air only in its immediate
                    vicinity. But when thunder-storms prevail, the atmosphere becomes affected to a
                    very considerable extent. Yet the indications of the electrometer are often
                    capricious and evanescent. Whenever clouds are suddenly formed, or melt away,
                    whether the air changes to dryness or humidity, the electrical equilibrium is
                    disturbed. The observations made with the electrometer are hence of much less
                    importance than was once expected, and have been gradually falling into
                    neglect.</p>
                <p>XII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Drosometer.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>From <hi rend="italic">fans, dew,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >μετζi&gt;ν, a measure.</hi></p></note> —An instrument so called was proposed by
                    Weidler, a German professor, in 1727, to measure the quantity of dew which
                    gathers on the surface of a body which has been exposed to the open air during
                    the night. It consisted of a bent balance, which marked in grains the
                    preponderance which a piece of glass of certain dimensions, laid horizontally in
                    one of the scales, had acquired from the settling and adhesion of the globules
                    of moisture.</p>
                <p>The main objection to a drosometer of such a construction is, that it would
                    require to be protected from the action of the wind; and being thus screened, it
                    could not receive the whole of the dew which might otherwise have been
                    deposited. The steel beam, too, from continual exposure to the weather, would
                    soon lose its polish, and become unfit for any accurate performance. Besides, it
                    is in general easier to measure than to weigh a portion of liquid.</p>
                <p>A simpler and more convenient drosometer could be formed on the principle of the
                    ombrometer, or rain-gauge. Suppose a glass funnel, of about three inches
                    diameter, whose interior surface is very smooth, and slopes towards the centre
                    at an angle of 15 or 20 degrees, to be joined hermetically to a long tube,
                    sealed at the lower end, and having an equable bore not exceeding the quarter of
                    an inch, with an attached scale divided into portions corresponding to the
                    thousandth parts of an inch on the external aperture. The only difficulty is to
                    make the dew which gathers during the night to run down the sides of the funnel
                    into the tube. To facilitate this descent, a coat of deliqueate salt of tartar
                    may be spread with a hair pencil over the shallow surface, and renewed as often
                    as occasion requires. The dew, instead of settling in minute detached globules,
                    would then be attracted by the alkaline lye, which thus, becoming dilute, would
                    gradually flow into the narrow cavity of the tube. It would be easy at any time
                    to make an allowance for the very small portion of liquid alkali blended with
                    the dew.</p>
                <p>Such is the complete apparatus required for keeping a meteorological register.
                    But those instruments are not all of equal importance. The barometer, the
                    thermometer, and the hygrometer, may be considered as indispensable. Next to
                    them deserve to be ranked the photometer<pb break="no" facs="nls:194209494"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9494-0744"/> and aethrioscope, which disclose the more
                    recondite condition of the atmosphere. The atmometer, the ombrometer, and the
                    anemometer, besides, are of consequence, from the practical results which they
                    furnish.</p>
                <p>The value of any meteorological register, however, depends on the accuracy with
                    which it is kept. The observations should be made in a place rather elevated,
                    and exposed freely on all sides to the aspect of the sky; and they should be
                    repeated either at equal intervals, during day and night, or at least at those
                    hours which represent most nearly the mean state of the atmosphere. These
                    requisites are seldom attained, and very few registers of the weather,
                    accordingly, are entitled to much confidence.</p>
                <p>It cannot be expected that registers of the weather will possess much value, so
                    long as they are kept merely as objects of curiosity. Like astronomical
                    observations, as now conducted, they should no longer be left to the chance of
                    individual pursuit. They would require to be unremittingly prosecuted in all
                    variety of situations, and at the public expense. Proper sets of meteorological
                    instruments should be placed, not only in the regular observatories, but sent to
                    the different forts and light-houses, both at home and at our principal foreign
                    stations. They might also be distributed among the ships employed in discovery,
                    or engaged on distant voyages. The cost of providing those instruments would be
                    comparatively trifling, and the charge incurred by keeping registers on a
                    regular and digested plan might shrink to nothing in the scale of national
                    expenditure.</p>
                <p>The state of the barometer alone is kept with tolerable accuracy, because that
                    instrument, being little influenced by collateral circumstances, marks nearly
                    the same impressions over a wide extent of surface. The thermometer, again, is
                    seldom observed at the proper hours, or in a situation sufficiently detached
                    from the buildings and solid walls.</p>
                <p>It is customary, for the sake of convenience, to note the thermometer in the
                    morning, at the height of the day, and again in the evening. But these three
                    observations must evidently furnish results below the medium temperature of the
                    whole twenty-four hours, since the accumulated warmth is reckoned but once,
                    while the freshness partaking of the night is counted twice. It would be nearer
                    the truth to assume the middle point between the maximum and minimum, though
                    even this cannot be deemed absolutely correct, because the heat neither mounts
                    nor declines in an uniform progression. The hottest time of the day is generally
                    about two o’clock, and the coldest just before sunrise. This hour of extreme
                    descent is consequently very variable; and it would be difficult to fix the
                    times suited for observing, unless they were more multiplied. But even fewer
                    observations may sometimes be made to serve the purpose. In this climate, the
                    daily average may be reckoned from eight o’clock in the morning, and the month
                    of October is found to have nearly the mean temperature of the whole year.</p>
                <p>The observations usually made with the hygroscopes of Deluc or Saussure cannot be
                    regarded as affording any definite indication of the dryness of the atmosphere.
                    It would essentially contribute to the advancement of meteorological science, if
                    the hygrometer which we have described were introduced into general practice.
                    This adoption cannot be very distant.</p>
                <p>Some of the monks, in the religious houses scattered over the Continent, might
                    find an agreeable and useful occupation in recording the state of the
                    atmosphere. Many of these establishments are scattered in lofty and romantic
                    situations; and several of them, destined by their founders for the charitable
                    accommodation of travellers, occupy the summits of the most elevated and
                    inaccessible mountains.</p>
                <p>Accurate registers kept in such towering spots are peculiarly interesting.</p>
                <p>Light-houses would, from their usual position, be well fitted for observing the
                    force and direction of the wind, and the swell and relapse of the tide. The
                    navigators who traverse the ocean in every latitude might, besides keeping
                    meteorological soundings, record the variation of the needle, and examine the
                    intensity of magnetic attraction.</p>
                <p>To promote the science of meteorology, it would be most expedient that the
                    various learned associations planted in different parts of the globe, should
                    institute inquiries into the state and internal motions of the higher strata of
                    our atmosphere. As the ultimate results could not fail to prove advantageous to
                    the public, the several governments might be expected to defray the moderate
                    expense incurred in carrying this plan into effect. Light small balloons might
                    from time to time be launched towards the most elevated regions, to detect by
                    their flight the existence and direction of currents which now escape
                    observation. Barometers, thermometers, hygrometers, and perhaps aethrioscopes,
                    in compact forms, and which should register themselves, might be sent up in the
                    car. Observers, furnished with accurate and complete instruments, could likewise
                    be despatched occasionally to the intermediate heights in large balloons. By
                    classing the various meteorological journals, and combining those ulterior
                    facts, some new lights could not fail to be struck out, which would gradually
                    reveal that simple harmony which no doubt pervades all the apparent complication
                    of the universal frame. Till we obtain such insight, we must content ourselves
                    with the best explications of the phenomena of the atmosphere, which our
                    imperfect and limited knowledge will admit. We shall, therefore, treat in
                    succession of the origin of winds; the generation of clouds and fogs; and their
                    precipitation in the form of rain, snow, or hail. Other collateral objects will
                    be discussed as they present themselves to view.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Wind.</hi> —It is a curious circumstance, that in all
                    languages the ordinary name of <hi rend="italic">air</hi> refers to its
                    mobility, and merely signifies <hi rend="italic">to blow.</hi> This impulse
                    alone of the fluid appears to have awakened our sensations; and had the
                    atmosphere continued perfectly still, we might for ages have remained ignorant
                    of the very existence of the fluid which we breathe.</p>
                <p>The main cause of <hi rend="italic">wind,</hi> or the flow of air, is undoubtedly
                    the variable distribution of heat through the atmosphere, which incessantly
                    affects the local density, and disturbs the equilibrium of the mass. The
                    presence of the sun affects the surface of the terraqueous globe, which again
                    warms and dilates the lower strata of atmosphere. The calorific action of the
                    solar beams is greatly diminished by their obliquity; it rapidly accumulates on
                    the land, but becomes attenuated and diffused in the waters of the ocean.</p>
                <p>The alternation of day and night, and the annual revolution of the seasons, are
                    hence the perpetual sources of winds. If the surface of the globe, however, had
                    been wholly covered by the ocean, and not disparted by land and seas, tthose
                    winds must have been scarcely perceptible. The daily illumination of the sun
                    does not warm the ground to the depth of an inch; but the same quantity of
                    •illumination penetrates, though with a decreasing intensity, many fathoms into
                    water, spreading and dividing its influence. We may reckon the tenth part of the
                    incident light to be intercepted by a superficial stratum of the thickness of
                    one foot; and it will hence follow, that the solar beams communicate every day a
                    hundred times less heat to the surface of a body of water than to an expansion
                    of level ground. The subsequent influence, again, of those contrasted surfaces
                    in warming the incumbent air must be proportionally different, though slightly
                    modified <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209507" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9507-0745"/>)y
                    the portion of light reflected from the water. In a ge-ιeral view, the diurnal
                    variation of temperature in the at-nospheré may be considered as limited to the
                    lowest stra-um, not exceeding 2000 feet in height. Such a body of ir will
                    intercept commonly the fiftieth part of all the light Vhich traverses it. We may
                    hence conclude, that the hange of temperature in the air, caused by the
                    succession f day and night, is, on the whole, about thirty times less bove a
                    spacious lake than over the surrounding land.</p>
                <p>The current which rushes from all sides towards any eated portion of the
                    atmosphere is easily explained and omputed from the diminution of pressure which
                    rarefac-ιon produces at that place. The celerity of the flow is recisely the
                    same as that of the efflux from a small aper-are under the pressure of a column
                    equivalent to that di-ιinution, or to the difference between the weight of the
                    arm air and of an equal volume of the exterior fluid, 'bus, suppose a chimney 20
                    feet high were heated up 50 <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> entesimal degrees, or
                    90 on Fahrenheit’s scale; the air in ιe flue being therefore expanded one fifth
                    part, or four jet, would be driven upwards by the pressure of a co-jmn
                    compensating this difference. The velocity of the íscharge would hence be 8 √ ’
                    4 = 16 feet every second, r at the rate of about eleven miles in the hour. If a
                    fire ⅛ kindled in an open field, it is evident that the rush of sr must proceed
                    from all sides. At the spot itself, there- ’ re, the opposite currents will
                    produce a counterbalance, ïid no dominant wind can prevail. But if the warm air
                    aiould cover a very wide extent of surface, its influence Öay be felt at a great
                    distance, and the several converg- (ig winds may have space to blow without any
                    mutual in-ħrference.</p>
                <p>These views afford a complete explication of the phe-B&gt;mena of sea and land
                    breezes, which are occasionally ιet'with in every latitude, but are constantly
                    observed rar the shores of the continent, and of the larger islands fthin the
                    tropics. In those sultry regions, as the day adduces, a refreshing wind blows
                    from the sea, and is suc-teded by an opposite current from the interior of the
                    tod on the approach of evening, and during a great part βthe night. In open
                    seas, and especially near the equa-tr, the thermometer scarcely varies a degree,
                    and very ⅛dom two degrees, by Fahrenheit’s scale, in the whole turse of a day.
                    But on the land, the change of tempe-Öture between the night and day, in similar
                    situations, 11 rise often higher than 76 centesimal degrees, or 126 ♯
                    Fahrenheit. If we, therefore, conceive a stratum of air íi 00 feet in altitude,
                    heated only to the mean difference, c three centesimal degrees, it would receive
                    an expansion « 24 feet; whence the velocity of the wind produced vyuld be 8 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> v</hi> ʹ 24 = 39 feet every second, or at the rate of 2 miles
                    in the hour. This is a very moderate estimate; fit the celerity of the current
                    must, no doubt, be dimi-r*&gt;hed, from the retardation which it suffers in
                    proportion t∣the length of track over which it has to sweep.</p>
                <p>. During the night the lower atmosphere is colder on 1. d than at sea, owing
                    partly to the descent of the more e rated and colder portions of air which chill
                    the surface c the ground, and partly to those cold pulses which are iMessantly
                    darted from every point of the azure sky. If y√ reckon the reduced temperature
                    of the land only a C!itesimal degree and a half below the standard of the ad-
                    Aij[ent ocean, this would give 12 feet for the contraction ò the vertical column
                    of air, and, consequently, a stream v∙∣uld flow towards the sea with a celerity
                    of 8 12 = 28</p>
                <p>fit per second, or very nearly 20 miles every hour. In gaeral, the land breeze
                    may be considered not so power-? as what blows from the sea.</p>
                <p>The ordinary appearances are clearly and graphically d¢cribed by that very
                    intelligent and enterprising navigator Captain Dampier.</p>
                <p>“These sea-breezes do commonly rise in the morning about nine o’clock, sometimes
                    sooner, sometimes later. They first approach the shore so gently, as if they
                    were afraid to come near it; and ofttimes they make some faint breathings, and,
                    as if not willing to offend, they make a halt, and seem ready to retire. I have
                    waited many a time, both ashore to receive the pleasure, and at sea to take the
                    benefit of it.</p>
                <p>“Itcomesin afine, small,black curl upon thewater,when as all the sea between it
                    and the shore not yet reached by it is as smooth and even as glass in
                    comparison. In half an hour’s time after it has reached the shore it fans pretty
                    briskly, and so increaseth gradually till twelve o’clock; then it is commonly
                    strongest, and lasts so till two or three a very brisk gale. About twelve at
                    noon it also veers off to sea two or three points, or more, in very fair
                    weather. After three o’clock it begins to die away again, and gradually
                    withdraws its force till all is spent, and about five o’clock, sooner or later,
                    according as the weather is, it is lulled asleep, and comes no more till the
                    next morning.</p>
                <p>“These winds are as constantly expected as the day in their proper latitudes, and
                    seldom fail but in the wet season. On all coasts of the main, whether in the
                    East or West Indies, or Guinea, they rise in the morning, and withdraw towards
                    the evening; yet capes and headlands have the greatest benefit of them, where
                    they are highest, rise earlier, and blow later.</p>
                <p>“Land-breezes are as remarkable as any winds that I have yet treated of: they are
                    quite contrary to the seabreezes; for those blow right from the shore, but the
                    seabreeze right in upon the shore; and as the sea-breezes do blow in the day and
                    rest in the night, so, on the contrary, these do blow in the night and rest in
                    the day, and so they do alternately succeed each other. For when the seabreezes
                    have performed their offices of the day, by breathing on their respective
                    coasts, they in the evening do either withdraw from the coast, or he down to
                    rest. Then the land-winds, whose office is to breathe in the night, moved by the
                    same order of divine impulse, do rouse out of their private recesses, and gently
                    fan the air till the next morning; and then their task ends, and they leave the
                    stage.</p>
                <p>“There can be no proper time set when they do begin in the evening, or when they
                    retire in the morning, for they do not keep to an hour; but they commonly spring
                    up between six and twelve in the evening, and last till six, eight, or ten in
                    the morning. They both come and go away again earlier or later, according to the
                    weather, the season of the year, or some accidental cause from the land; for on
                    some coasts they do rise earlier, blow fresher, and remain later, than on other
                    coasts, as I shall show hereafter.</p>
                <p>“These winds blow off to sea, a greater or less distance, according as the coast
                    lies more or less exposed to the sea-winds; for in some places we find them
                    brisk three or four leagues off shore, in other places not so manjr miles, and
                    in some places they scarce peep without the rocks, or, if they do sometimes in
                    very fair weather make a sally out a mile or two, they are not lasting, but
                    suddenly vanish away, though yet there are every night as fresh land-winds
                    ashore at those places as in any other part of the world.</p>
                <p>“Indeed, these winds are an extraordinary blessing to those that use the sea in
                    any part of the world within the tropics; for as the constant trade-winds do
                    blow, there could be no sailing in these seas; but, by the help of the sea and
                    land breezes, ships will sail 200 or 300 leagues, as particularly from Jamaica
                    to the Lagune of Trist, in the Bay of Campeachy, and then back again, all
                    against the trade-wind.</p>

                <p>“The seamen that sail in sloops or other small vessels in the West Indies do know
                    very well when they shall meet a brisk land-wind, by the fogs that hang over the
                    land before night; for it is a certain sign of a good landwind to see a thick
                    fog lie still and quiet, like smoke over the land, not stirring any way; and we
                    look out for such signs when we are plying to windward. For if we see no fog
                    over the land, the land-wind will be but faint and short that night. These signs
                    are to be observed chiefly in fair weather; for in the wet season fogs do hang
                    over the land all the day, and it may be neither land-wind nor sea-breeze
                    stirring. If in the afternoon, also, in fair weather, we see a tornado over the
                    land, it commonly sends us forth a fresh land-wind.</p>
                <p>“These land-winds are very cold, and though the seabreezes are always much
                    stronger, yet these are colder by far. The sea-breezes, indeed, are very
                    comfortable and refreshing; for the hottest time in all the day is about nine,
                    ten, or eleven o’clock in the morning, in the interval between both breezes; for
                    then it is commonly calm, and then people pant for breath, especially if it is
                    late before the sea-breeze comes, but afterwards the breeze allays the heat.
                    However, in the evening again, after the sea-breeze is spent, it is very hot
                    till the land-wind springs up, which is sometimes not till twelve o’clock or
                    after.” <hi rend="italic">( Voyages,</hi> vol. ii.)</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Trade-WTnds,</hi> which, within the tropics, at all
                    times constantly blow from the east, but somewhat vary their force, and decline
                    a little to the north or the south, according to the latitude and the season,
                    are the most remarkable of all the aerial currents, and of signal importance in
                    navigation. These steady breezes favoured the voyage of Columbus, and conducted
                    him to the discovery of the Mexican archipelago. The same powerful stream
                    afterwards drew the Portuguese from their southern course, and carried them to
                    the shores of the Brazils. Since the character and extent of those winds have
                    become perfectly known, the navigator reckons safely on their aid, and shapes
                    his voyage in such a way as to reduce its performance almost to a
                    calculation.</p>
                <p>The cause of the trade-winds, however, is not obvious, or very easily traced.
                    Various attempts have been made to explain the phenomenon, yet seldom on any
                    solid or accurate principles. It would form an interesting discussion to examine
                    the different hypotheses advanced; but we can afford room to notice, very
                    briefly, the more considerable only of those opinions.</p>
                <p>Descartes äïid his followers imputed the trade-winds to the inertia of the
                    atmosphere, which they conceived to prevent this fluid from acquiring the full
                    rotation of the earth, especially near the equator. The air being thus left
                    behind as the globe rolled from the west, would have an apparent motion in the
                    contrary direction, and seem to blow from the cast. But it may be urged, that as
                    passengers almost insensibly gain the celerity of the ship which carries them,
                    so every portion of the incumbent atmosphere, though more loosely adherent to
                    the terraqueous surface, must soon acquire the peculiar motion corresponding to
                    the parallel of latitude. Nor would the inequality of such combined movements in
                    the air at all disturb the order and arrangement of its general mass.</p>
                <p>Dr Hailey gave a different explication of the origin of trade-winds, which seems
                    very plausible, and has long been deemed quite satisfactory. This able
                    philosopher and experienced navigator supposed, that the spot where the sun’s
                    vertical rays exert their utmost heating energy, being in the lapse of a day
                    successively transferred from east to west round the circumference of the globe,
                    must, as a centre of confluence, draw in its train a current of air. The current
                    thus formed would result from the excess of the streaming from the east above
                    that from the west; and it would therefore advance with a tardy pace, following
                    at a distance the powerful energy of the sun. The same easterly wind might
                    incline towards the north or the south, according as the great luminary appears
                    to approach to the northern or the southern tropic.</p>
                <p>But it should be observed, that the torrid zone stretches mostly over the ocean,
                    and includes only a narrow portion of land. The heat excited in succession
                    through that liquid track, by the diurnal passage of the sun, is hence extremely
                    small, and hardly sufficient to produce the aspiration of the gentlest air. Nor
                    could even this feeble current have a decided and constant direction. It would
                    only tend towards the heated part of the surface of the ocean. In the morning,
                    it would breathe from the west; about noon, it would become neutral, and die
                    away; and, in the evening, it would again spring up, and flow from the east.
                    Near midnight this current would sink into a perfect calm. The hypothesis will,
                    therefore, not bear any strict examination. It is neither adequate to the
                    production of such effects, nor accordant with the actual phenomena of the
                    trade-winds. It casts a false glare over the subject, without elucidating its
                    real bearings.</p>
                <p>The first who succeeded in taking a correct view of the question was George
                    Hadley, in a short paper inserted in the Philosophical Transactions for 1735. By
                    combining in some measure the idea of Descartes with the opinion of Halley, he
                    produced a clear and simple account of the cause of trade-winds, which appears
                    entirely consistent, and free from every objection. Though the daily variation
                    of temperature be very inconsiderable within the tropics, yet the annual
                    accumulation of heat renders the equatorial regions much warmer than the higher
                    latitudes, and consequently maintains a perpetual current of air from either
                    side. If those aerial motions were not modified by the figure and rotatioh of
                    the globe, there would always be two opposite winds blowing directly from the
                    north and from the south to the èquator. But the stream which perhaps originates
                    at the northern tropic, in advancing to the equator, must seem gradually to
                    deflect towards the west, in consequence of the increasing velocity with which
                    the successive parallels of latitude are carried eastwards. During the time this
                    current takes to perform its journey, it is apparently transported to the west,
                    through a space equal to the excess of the arc described by the equator above
                    the corresponding are traced by the tropic. The current from the southern tropic
                    is equally bent towards the west. When both of them meet at the equator, their
                    opposite impulsions from the north and the south are extinguished, and they flow
                    directly west in a single united stream, and with accumulated force. The
                    apparent motions of the different streamlets which from both hemispheres
                    conspire to constitute the trade-wind, is represented in fig. 18, Plate
                    CCCLV.</p>
                <p>But it is not enough to connect the general facts; a complete theory should
                    harmonize in all the subordinate details. An easy calculation, accordingly, is
                    conducted to those precise results which are commensurate and exactly congruous
                    with the actual phenomena. The trade-wind may be reckoned to begin about the
                    latitude of 25 degrees. At this parallel, the mean temperature is four
                    centesimal degrees colder than immediately under the equator, which difference
                    of heat may graduate through the atmosphere to the altitude of 10,000 feet.
                    Wherefore, the expansion of the air at the equator, which draws to it a
                    meridional wind, will amount to a column of 100 feet. The velocity of the
                    current hence produced must be 8√100, or 80 feet every second, which corresponds
                    to fifty-four miles in the hour. But each point on the parallel of 24° is
                    carried eastwards by its revolution about the earth’s axis seven miles faster
                    every hour than on the parallel of 25°. Consequently, when the wind arrives at
                    the parallel of 24°, it <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209533"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9533-0747"/>kill seem to have acquired a tendency of seven
                    miles an ∣our to the west. As it reaches the successive parallels <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> ∙f 23°, 22°, 21°, &amp;c. it will gain continual,
                    though decreas-ng, additions to its apparent westerly course, which at ,he
                    equator will have augmented to 104 miles in the hour.</p>
                <p>In this calculation we have made no deduction for the esistance which the streams
                    of air must experience in weepingover the surface of the globe, because no
                    expe-iments have been made to ascertain the effect of such re-ιrdation. It is no
                    doubt less on the ocean than on the and, and must evidently be diminished in
                    proportion to ιe depth of the mass of fluid which is borne along. Still, owever,
                    this obstruction, joined to this impediment of jternal motion, must be very
                    considerable; and we may afely reduce the numbers before stated to one third,
                    hich would give eighteen miles an hour for the celerity f the primary meridional
                    wind, and thirty-five miles for pat of the oriental or trade-wind, resulting
                    from the in·· uence of the figure and rotation of the earth.</p>
                <p>Our northern hemisphere, presenting to the action of ιe solar beams a larger
                    surface of land than the southern, , on the whole, rather warmer. Hence the
                    parallel of eatest heat runs not exactly through the equator, but août three
                    degrees farther north. This circle is there-re strictly the mean path of the
                    aggregate easterly streams air.</p>
                <p>But though the hottest part within the torrid zone, tak-g the average of a whole
                    year, occupies the parallel of l∣ree degrees north latitude, it must, to a
                    certain extent, ..lift its position with the seasons. In the summer months i e
                    sun shines twice vertical upon the tropic of Cancer, , id consequently raises
                    the temperature of the northern {ιlf of the zone. During winter, again, this
                    effect is trans-rred to the southern half of the torrid region. In the togress
                    of summer, therefore, the trade-wind gradually ∣hnds about a point towards the
                    north; but as winter ad- ’ nces, it declines as much to the south.</p>
                <p>t Such is the character of that general wind which en- ∣rcles the globe, flowing
                    with slight deviation constantly ¢m the east, and spreading over a zone of more
                    than 50° 1 breadth. It sweeps the Atlantic Ocean from the coast</p>
                <p>' Africa to Brazil, and the Pacific from Panama to the hilippine Isles and New
                    Holland, and again the Indian ;as partially from Sumatra to Zanguebar.</p>
                <p>; The trade-wind undergoes an essential modification, bwever, where the continent
                    stretches into the torrid fine. The sun acting more powerfully upon the land
                    than φon the surface of the sea, the accumulated warmth is ∣ιch greater, and
                    shifts with the revolution of∙the seasons 4 either side of the equator. The
                    centre of heat ap-ιoaches in summer to the northern, and in winter to the
                    luthern tropic. Instead of the great eastern stream, those fgions have two
                    opposite periodic winds alternating to-fsirds the north and the south, and
                    called the <hi rend="italic">monsoons.</hi> ïhen these winds advance to the
                    equator, they conjoin • apparent easterly velocity; but when they recede from ∣e
                    equator, they carry their excess of velocity from the “est. A diagonal motion
                    results from the combined ten-tacies. In the Arabian and Indian Seas, on the
                    north e of the equator, the monsoon blows north-west during; summer months, from
                    April to October; and in the *bposite direction, or south-east, during the
                    winter. But n the south side of the equator, near Java and Sumatra, he course of
                    the monsoon is north-east in summer and uth-west in winter.</p>
                <p>The primary winds, which blow from the parallels of 25° 1 30° to the equator,
                    must evidently give rise to opposite crrents that flow in the higher atmosphere
                    towards the wies. These streams, after they have travelled beyond the topics,
                    may descend to the surface, transporting the cele-ιty of equatorial rotation.
                    They w ill appear, therefore, to blow from the western quarter, with the excess
                    of their previous velocity above that of the parallel which they reach. Hence a
                    westerly breeze, of considerable force and regularity, prevails in either
                    hemisphere above the latitude of 30°. The same winds cross the Atlantic from
                    Newfoundland to Cornwall, and traverse the Southern Ocean from the Plata to the
                    Cape of Good Hope, and thence to New Holland. Any wind which blows from the
                    quarter inclining to the south of the west comes really from the equatorial
                    region, and is therefore relatively warm. Such is the disposition of our
                    westerly winds, which commonly prevail for nine months in the year.</p>
                <p>On the same principle, a wind which blows directly from the arctic pole, and
                    impregnated with intense cold, must, in consequence of the rotation of the
                    globe, appear to arrive from some point to the north of the east. In passing
                    through the first degree of latitude, it will suffer a deflection of eighteen
                    miles in the hour towards the west; in a short space, therefore, it will seem to
                    flow with impetuous force, and almost directly from the east. Hence our easterly
                    and north-easterly winds have a polar origin, and are always bitterly cold.</p>
                <p>Local winds could be explained if the different circumstances which affect them
                    were distinctly known. The latitude and temperature of the place, its relative
                    position, the figure and contour of the surrounding country, would all enter
                    into the calculation. We shall content ourselves with a concise notice of some
                    peculiar winds. The <hi rend="italic">Bize</hi> is a cold piereing wind which
                    blows from the ridge of the Jura, and the frozen summits of the Pyrenees. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Sirocco</hi> is a hot, moist, and relaxing wind, which visits
                    Naples and the south of Italy from the opposite shores of the Mediterranean. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Harmattan</hi> seems to be a cold and dry wind, of a very
                    parching quality, which is frequent in Africa and some of the eastern countries.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Samiel,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Simoom,</hi> is a
                    burning pestilential blast, extremely arid, which springs up at times in the
                    vast deserts of Arabia, and rushes with tremendous fury, involving whole pillars
                    of sand.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Clouds and Rain.</hi> —Their formation and dissolution
                    produce all the varied train of the meteorological phenomena. The humidity
                    suspended in the atmosphere is derived by exhalation partly from the land, but
                    ultimately from the vast expanse of the ocean. A surface of lake, of pasture,
                    corn fields or forest, supports a continual evaporation, augmented only by the
                    dryness of the air, and the rapidity of its successive contacts. Even ploughed
                    land will supply nearly as much moisture to the exhaling fluid as an equal sheet
                    of water. It is only when the ground has become quite parched that it
                    obstinately retains its latent store.</p>
                <p>If the whole of the waters which fall from the heavens were to return again, the
                    evaporation from the ground might be sufficient alone to maintain the perpetual
                    circulation. But more than one third of all the rains and melted snows are
                    carried by the rivers into the ocean, which must hence restore this continued
                    waste. The commerce of land and sea is thus a necessary part of the economy of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>The air, in exhaling its watery store, is rendered quite damp; but it may
                    afterwards become dry on being transported to a warmer situation. Such is the
                    case of the seabreeze, particularly in summer. It arrives on the shore cold and
                    moist; but as it advances into the interior of the continent it grows milder and
                    drier. The same principle accounts for the disposition of different winds in
                    respect to humidity. At Colombo, in the island of Ceylon, as we gather from some
                    remarks of Dr Davy, the north-east monsoon, with a temperature of only 68 on
                    Fahrenheit’s scale,, has yet a dryness of 75 hygrométrie degrees; but the
                    opposite monsoon, from the south-west, though at 82 by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194209546" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9546-0748"/>thermometer, is so damp as to
                    indicate scarcely 30 degrees. The cold wind, coming from the north, was rendered
                    warmer and drier in its progress; while the hot wind, flowing from the equator,
                    was somewhat chilled and made damper as it approached Ceylon. -</p>
                <p>Since air in mounting upwards has its capacity for heat enlarged, and becomes
                    colder, it will hence likewise grow proportionally damper. But a continual
                    intercourse being maintained between the lower and the higher atmosphere, the
                    middle region must, from its chillness, be soon charged with moisture. If this
                    tendency were to act, therefore, without control, the heavens would have been
                    shrouded with perpetual clouds and darkness, and never could the cheering rays
                    of the sun have visited the surface of the earth. A principle of conservation
                    happily occurs to restrain, and finally to overpower, the effect of cold, in
                    disposing air to part with its moisture. By expansion, this fluid is made
                    capable of holding, at the same temperature, a larger share of humidity. Each
                    portion of air, in rising vertically, grows, from the predominance of cold,
                    constantly damper; but after having reached a certain altitude, it again becomes
                    gradually drier, from the influence of its wide dilatation. Every time the air
                    has its volume doubled, it acquires an additional dryness corresponding to fifty
                    hygrometric degrees. Hence’one degree would be the effect of the rarefaction of
                    only the 72d part. This small variation again answers to a depressed temperature
                    of l½ on the centesimal scale, which, near the surface, will occasion an
                    increase of humidity equal to the actual range of the solvent power of the air
                    divided by 31∙4. Suppose the thermometer to mark 15° centesimal at the
                    ground,</p>
                <p>'* . 200</p>
                <p>the air would, for each ascent of about 390 feet, be ,</p>
                <p>31∙4 or 8 hygrometric degrees damper, which would be reduced to 7° by the
                    influence of dilatation. Had the temperature at the surface been as low as —
                    25°, which answers to a solvent power of 31½°, the opposite agencies of cold and
                    rarefaction would evidently have produced a perfect balance, and the same
                    dryness would have continued to a moderate height.</p>
                <p>It would be easy to show that <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> expressing the density of
                    the air at any altitude, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the corresponding
                    indication of the hygrometer, -⅛- A + άή will denote the increment of humidity
                    occasioned by depressed temperature, while the corresponding decrement resulting
                    from expansion is one degree. Hence at the pole the position of the <hi
                    rend="italic">maximum</hi> humidity in the atmosphere must occur at an elevation
                    of 13,300 feet; where the density is∙6, the temperature would stand at 26∙7°,
                    and the hygrometric range only 29°. Under the equator, that limit would attain a
                    much greater altitude, and yet not rise so far above the curve of perpetual
                    congelation. It is probable, however, that the canopy of clouds descends
                    considerably lower, being warmed by the hot pulses darted from the ground and
                    the inferior strata of the atmosphere. We shall not err much if we estimate the
                    position of extreme humidity at the height of two miles at the pole, and four
                    miles and a half under the equator, or a mile and a half beyond the limit of
                    congelation. This range is represented in fig. 18, Plate CCCLV. running nearly
                    parallel to the curve of perpetual congelation, but bending nearer in
                    approaching the equatorial parts. It marks the mean height of the clouds^ in
                    different latitudes, and intimates the shading into the fine etherial
                    expanse.</p>
                <p>The moisture deposited by a body of air in minute globules, which remain
                    suspended, or subside slowly in the atmosphere, constitutes a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cloud.</hi> When it comes near us, whether it hovers on the tops of the hills,
                    or spreads over the valleys, it receives the name of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fog.</hi> The cold occasioned by the ascent or transfer of air may be
                    sufficient to form thin clouds, but a more powerful and extended energy is
                    required for the production of <hi rend="italic">Fain.</hi> The subject has from
                    the earliest times engaged the attention of philosophers, who have made numerous
                    unavailing attempts to explain it. At length the very ingenious Dr ⅛mes Hutton
                    subjected the problem to a correct analysis, and succeeded in deducing a most
                    satisfactory solution. His fine Theory of Rain, which first appeared in the
                    Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for the year 1787, constitutes an
                    epoch in meteorological science. Its merits, however, have been slowly perceived
                    by the public, because the author, full of his original conception, satisfied
                    himself with merely sketching the general outline. But it was not enough that
                    the operation of the principle advanced should always cause rain; it was farther
                    requisite that the results arising from its application should quite accord with
                    the actual phenomena. We shall, therefore, endeavour to render this theory more
                    definite and more complete.</p>
                <p>Air in cooling becomes ready, we have seen, to part with its moisture. But how is
                    it cooled in the free atmosphere, unless by the contact or commixture of a
                    colder portion of the same fluid? Now, the portion of the air which is chilled
                    must in an equal degree warm the other. If, in consequence of this mutual change
                    of condition, the former be disposed to resign its moisture, the latter is more
                    inclined to retain it; and, consequently, if such opposite effects were
                    balanced, there could, on the whole, be no precipitation of humidity whatever.
                    The separation of moisture, on the mixing of two masses of damp air at different
                    temperatures, would therefore prove, that the dissolving power of air suffers
                    more diminution from losing part of the combined heat, than it acquires
                    augmentation from gaining an equal measure of it; and, consequently, this power
                    must, under equal accessions of heat,, increase more slowly at first than it
                    does afterwards, thus advancing always with accumulated celerity.</p>
                <p>The quantity of moisture which air can hold thus increases in a much faster ratio
                    than its temperature. This great principle in the economy of nature was traced
                    by Dr Hutton from indirect experience. It is the simplest of the accelerating
                    kind, and perfectly agrees with the law of solution which the hygrometer has
                    established. Suppose equal bulks of air in a state of saturation, and at the
                    different temperatures of 15 <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> and 45 centesimal
                    degrees, were intermixed, the compound arising from such union will evidently
                    have the mean temperature of 30°. But since at these temperatures the one
                    portion held 200 parts of humidity, and the other 800, the aggregate must
                    contain 1000 parts, or either half of it 500; at the mean or resulting
                    temperature, however, this portion could only suspend 400 parts of humidity,
                    and, consequently, the difference, or 100 parts, amounting to the two hundredth
                    part of the whole weight of air, must be precipitated from the compound
                    mass.</p>
                <p>As another illustration, let air of 15° be mixed with air at the temperature of
                    35°, in three different proportions, all at the point of saturation; one part
                    being combined with three parts, two with two, and three with one. The
                    temperatures arising from the commixture would be 20°, 25°, and 30°; the
                    corresponding parts of moisture precipitated from the mass being derived from
                    the intermediate proportions of 200 and 504, are, 352, 317∙5 or 34-5; 276, 252
                    or 24; 352, 317∙5 or 34∙5; and 428, 400 or 28. These depositions arc represented
                    in fig. 8, Plate CCCLV. by the several intervals between the logarithmic curve
                    and the oblique line which connects the summits of the ordinates of 15° and
                    35°.</p>
                <p>In these examples we have assumed the portions of differently heated air to be
                    quite charged with moisture before<pb break="no" facs="nls:194209559"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-9559-0749"/> mixing; but it is only required that they should
                    approach to the point ofhumidity. The effect, however, of simple commixture
                    would, in most cases, be very small. To explain the actual phenomena, we must
                    have recourse to the mutual operation of a chill and of a warm current, driving
                    swiftly i <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> opposite directions, and continually
                    mixing and changing their conterminous surfaces. By this rapidity, a larger
                    volume of the fluid is brought into contact in a given time. Suppose, for
                    instance, the one current to have a temperature of 50, and the other that of 70
                    degrees, by Fahrenheit’s scale; the blending surfaces will, therefore, assume
                    the mean temperature of 60°. Consequently, the two streams throw together 200
                    and 334∙2 parts of moisture, making 567T parts for the compound, which, at its
                    actual temperature, can hold only 258∙6 parts; the difference, or 8∙6 parts,
                    forms the measure of precipitation, corresponding to the 2325th of the whole
                    weight of the commixed air. It would thus require a column of air 30 miles in
                    length to furnish, over a given spot, and in the space of an hour, a deposite of
                    moisture equal to the height of. an inch. If the sum of the opposite velocities
                    amounted to 60 miles an hour, and the intermingling influence extended but to a
                    quarter of an inch at the grazing surfaces, there would still, on this
                    supposition, be produced in the same time a fall of rain reaching to half an
                    inch in altitude.</p>
                <p>These quantities come within the limits of probability, and agree sufficiently
                    with experience and observation. But, in the higher temperatures, though the
                    difference of the heat between the opposite strata of air should remain the
                    same, the measure of aqueous precipitation is greatly increased. 1hus, while the
                    mixing of equal masses of air, at the temperatures of 40° and 60°, is only 6 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 6, that from alike mixture at 80° and 100° amounts to
                    19°. This result is entirely conformable to observation, for showers are most
                    copious during hot weather and in the tropical climates.</p>
                <p>The quantity of moisture precipitated from the atmosphere thus depends on a
                    variety of circumstances; on the previous dampness of the commixed portions of
                    the fluid, their difference of heat, the elevation of their mean temperature,
                    and the extent of the combination which takes place. When this deposition is
                    slow, the very minute aqueous globules remain suspended, and form clouds; but if
                    it be rapid and copious, those particles conglomerate, and produce—according to
                    the state of the medium with regard to heat—rain, hail, or snow.</p>
                <p>The profuse precipitation of humidity is caused by a rapid commixture of opposite
                    strata. The action of swift contending currents in the atmosphere brings quickly
                    into mutual contact vast fields of air over a given spot. The separation of
                    moisture is hence proportionally copious. In temperate weather this deposition
                    forms rain; but, in the cold season, the aqueous globules,freezing in the
                    mid-air in to icy spiculae, which collect in their slow descent, become
                    converted into flakes of snow. Hail is formed under different circumstances, and
                    generally in sudden alternations of the fine season, the drops of rain being
                    congealed during their fall, by passing through a lower stratum of dry and cold
                    air.</p>
                <p>The drops of rain vary in their size perhaps from the twenty-fifth to a quarter
                    of an inch in diameter. In parting from the clouds, they precipitate their
                    descent, till the increasing resistance opposed by the air becomes equal to
                    their weight, when they continue to fall with an uniform velocity. This acquired
                    or <hi rend="italic">terminal</hi> velocity is therefore in the sub-duplicate
                    ratio of the diameters of the aqueous globules. A thunder-shower hence pours
                    down much faster than a drizzling rain. In general, if <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    express the diameter of a drop in parts of an inch, the terminal velocity,
                    according to theory, will be denoted by 78y ʹ t∕, or, if the usual correction be
                    made for the discrepancy in fluids, it will be 67√√. Thus a drop of the
                    twenty-fifth part of an inch, in falling through the air, would only gain a
                    celerity of 11½ feet, while one of a quarter of an inch would acquire a celerity
                    of 33½ feet. A flake of snow, being perhaps nine times more expanded than water,
                    would descend thrice as slow. But hailstones are often of considerable
                    dimensions, exceeding sometimes an inch in length. They may hence fall with a
                    velocity of 70 feet each second, or at the rate of about 50 miles in the hour.
                    Striking the ground with such impetuous force, it is easy to conceive the
                    extensive injury which a hail-shower may occasion in the hotter climates. The
                    destructive power of those missiles in stripping and tearing the fruits and
                    foliage increases, besides, in a faster ratio than the momentum, and may be
                    estimated by the square of their velocity multiplied into mass. This fatal
                    energy is hence as the fourth power of the diameter of the hailstone.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Optical Phenomena.</hi> —It remains for us to explain
                    the general optical appearances of the sky. When the rays of the sun strike upon
                    a cloud, they are copiously reflected, but partly absorbed by the minute
                    suspended globules. In working their progress through the mass of vapour, they
                    suffer a great diminution from the multiplied acts of absorption. The quantity
                    of light thus finally detained depends on the density of the cloud, and its
                    thickness. But the portion which penetrates through the nebulous medium is
                    always much less than what traverses an equal body of air. In extreme cases,
                    perhaps, the solar beams will suffer greater defalcation by repeated
                    repercussions within a congregated cloud, than from passing through fifty times
                    the same extent of a clear aerial expanse. Hence such clouds always appear dark
                    and black, by their scanty transmitted light. Whiteness, being produced by the
                    copious emission of intermingled rays, can belong only to very thin clouds. The
                    depth of shade indicates the mass of floating vapour.</p>
                <p>Owing to the excessive minuteness of the aqueous globules, the particles of light
                    are only reflected or absorbed at their external surface, without entering them.
                    But when they collect into large drops, the luminous pencil which strikes at a
                    certain angle converges by refraction to a point of the posterior surface, and,
                    after suffering one or more interior reflections, it emerges dissected into its
                    primitive colours. Hence the glorious vision of the rainbow, which was reduced
                    to mathematical calculation by Descartes, but only received its complete
                    explication from the optical discoveries of Newton. The phenomena occur whenever
                    the sun shines upon the falling drops of rain behind the spectator, the coloured
                    arch being a portion of a circle whose centre is a point in the sky directly
                    opposite to the sun. The primary or interior bow is formed by a single
                    reflection, and lies 45° beyond that centre; but the secondary or superior bow,
                    produced by a double reflection, appears with inverted tints at the distance of
                    56°. A ternary bow may exist, but being so extremely faint from the repeated
                    reflections, it is scarcely ever perceived. It hence follows, that rainbows are
                    only visible when the altitude of the sun is below 45° and 56°. In summer,
                    accordingly, they are not seen in this climate about the middle of the day. For
                    the same reason, they generally appear less than a semicircle; but viewed from
                    the top of a spire, or any lofty pinnacle, they embrace nearly the whole
                    circumference. Lunar rainbows may be frequently observed, only the faintness of
                    their colours makes them far less conspicuous.</p>
                <p>The coloured rings or <hi rend="italic">halos</hi> which are often seen
                    surrounding the moon and sun, are evidently occasioned by very thin vapour
                    diffused through the atmosphere. They are supposed chiefly to encircle the moon;
                    but, in this climate, hardly a day passes with light fleckered clouds, when <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194209572" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9572-0750"/> at least portions
                    of halos may not be perceived near the sun. It is only necessary to remove die
                    glare of light which makes the delicate colours appear white. Thus, if we
                    examine the reflection from a smooth surface of water, we shall perceive that
                    the sun gilds the fleecy clouds with segments of beautifully coloured rings.
                    This effect is still more distinctly seen if the rays from a hazy or mottled sky
                    be received upon a sheet of white paper, held before a small hole in the
                    window-shutter of a dark room. But even when the sun shines from an azure
                    firmament, circles of the richest tints may be produced by experiment. Holding a
                    hot poker below, and a little before, the small hole of the shutter, throw a few
                    drops of water upon it, and the sun will be painted upon the paper like the
                    glowing radiations of the <hi rend="italic">passion-flower.</hi> The appearance
                    is exactly similar to what the traveller, in awakening from a short slumber,
                    perceives, in a winter’s morning, on opening his wearied eyes to a burning
                    candle—concentric rings of violet, green, yellow, and red.</p>
                <p>The explication formerly given of the cause of halos, even that proposed by
                    Newton himself, is inadmissible; since it would confine them, like the rainbows,
                    to certain definite limits, whereas they appear with every possible degree of
                    extension. Our earliest inquiries led us to refer the origin of halos to the <hi
                    rend="italic">deflection</hi> of light, or that property of the rays to bend and
                    divide as they pass near the edge of a body. Thus the light admitted through a
                    very narrow slit in a card, or a bit of tinfoil, spreads into bright coloured
                    fringes. The finer also is the slit, the broader are the fringes. A similar
                    appearance is obtained by looking at the elongated flame of a candle through the
                    delicate fibre’s of a feather, or even through the streaks of grease rubbed by
                    the finger along a piece of glass. But if a very small round hole be substituted
                    for the slit, the fringes will change into coloured rings. Thus, if a piece of
                    tinfoil, punctured with the point of a needle, be held close to the eye, the sun
                    will appear through it surrounded by a halo very near his disc, but spreading
                    more in proportion as the hole is contracted. That ingenious artist Mr Troughton
                    constructed for us a slide of brass, and afterwards another of platina,
                    perforated with a series of the finest, conical holes, which were measured by
                    his delicate micrometer. The purpose was to compare the angle subtended by the
                    coloured ring with the diameter of the perforation, it being inferred that an
                    aqueous globule of the same dimension might, by the exterior deflection of the
                    solar rays, produce a similar halo. But our variable sky is very seldom fit for
                    any refined optical experiment, and many delays happening to intervene, we could
                    arrive at no very precise or certain result. We may state, however, as at least
                    an approximation, that the globules of the diffuse vapour which occasions the
                    appearance of coloured circles about the sun and moon, vary from the 5000th to
                    the 50,000th part of an inch in diameter. When the halo approaches nearest to
                    the luminous body, the largest globules are floating, and therefore the
                    atmosphere is surcharged with humidity. Hence the justness of the vulgar remark,
                    that a dense halo close to the moon portends rain.</p>
                <p>Nearly the same theory has been struck out by Dr Thomas Young, to whose profound
                    ingenuity and most extensive information we are glad to bear honourable
                    testimony. By a skilful application of the principle of deflected light, he has
                    likewise constructed the <hi rend="italic">Eriometer,</hi> a curious instrument
                    for measuring the size of the fibres of wool and other filamentous substances.
                    But we cannot at present enter into the details.</p>
                <p>The same acute philosopher has given perhaps the only true account of the origin
                    of the <hi rend="italic">parhelia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mock suns,</hi>
                    which are frequently seen in the arctic regions during certain dispositions of
                    the atmosphere. This gorgeous appearance of intersecting luminous arches,
                    studded with opposite and transverse images of the sun, he ascribes to the
                    combined reflections of the rays from the natural facets of the snowy <hi
                    rend="italic">spiculae</hi> floating abundantly in the air.</p>
                <p>Another most remarkable optical deception occurs in a peculiar state of the
                    atmosphere on the verge of the horizon in various countries, and especially in
                    the warmer climates, whether on the level plains, or on the margin of rivers or
                    lakes, and near the sea-shore. In such situations the remote objects often
                    appear with extraordinary elevation, and in double or inverted images. This
                    singular phenomenon is obviously caused by the irregular refractions which the
                    rays of light occasionally suffer by passing through the different strata of the
                    lower atmosphere. When the effect is confined to the apparent elevation of an
                    object, our seamen call it <hi rend="italic">looming</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but if inverted images be formed, the French and Italians give to this
                    play of vision the appellations of <hi rend="italic">mirage</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">fata morgana.</hi> The shipping and range of buildings on the
                    shore of Naples have from Messina sometimes appeared floating inverted in the
                    air. In the autumn of 1798 the coast of France was distinctly seen raised above
                    the sea, from the beach of Hastings; the appearance lasted about an hour, and
                    then sunk beneath the horizon. In the following year, Professor Vince watched
                    the phenomena at Ramsgate with a large telescope. On the afternoon of the 1st of
                    Angust he first descried the sails of a ship, but as she came fuller in view, he
                    perceived another inverted image just below the surface of the water. Fig. 16,
                    Plate CCCLV. represents the successive appearances; A is the ship when first
                    observed, C after she had approached, and B the inverted image. Fig. 17 exhibits
                    a variation of the effect; <hi rend="italic">a</hi> marks the ship entering the
                    horizon, C and B the double image of the ship when near, a portion of the sea
                    lying between its opposite traces. To produce the appearances now represented,
                    it was quite requisite that the rays of light, in traversing the lower strata of
                    the air, should describe curves, whose final tangents point in the visual
                    directions of the objects. These curves or trajectories are delineated in fig.
                    13, where E marks the place of the observer, <hi rend="italic">zb</hi> the
                    horizon, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the hull and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the mast
                    of the ship; the lowest image is formed by the curves òsE and “rE; above this
                    the curves 6vE and <hi rend="smallcaps">öwE</hi> give an inverted image, and the
                    curves <hi rend="italic">bηV</hi> and ≡E exhibit the highest erect image.</p>
                <p>In ordinary cases, a ray of light, in crossing different layers of the
                    atmosphere, describes a trajectory, which is nearly the portion of a circle,
                    having six times the diameter of the earth. The rate of inflection is
                    proportional to the tangent of obliquity, and to the difference of the
                    refractive power of the conterminous strata, which may be assumed as the same as
                    their difference of density. This variation in a stratum of air twenty-eight
                    feet thick is only the thousandth part of the whole refraction, and is hence
                    equal to the effect of the quarter of a centesimal degree. But since a much
                    greater difference of heat often occurs within that limit, the incurvation of
                    the trajectory must be proportionally increased. Humidity, by dilating the air,
                    will produce a similar effect, though in a much inferior degree, unless in very
                    high temperatures.</p>
                <p>Dr W. H. Wollaston, whose acuteness in devising philosophical experiments was
                    unrivalled, exhibited on a small i scale the various appearances occasioned by
                    irregular atmospheric attraction. His paper inserted in the Philosophical
                    Transactions for the year 1800 contains a very clear exposition of the
                    phenomena. On looking lengthwise over the side of a red-hot poker at a distant
                    object, besides the ordinary image, another inverted one was seen within the
                    edge of the streaming air, and a larger erect one still nearer the poker, as
                    represented in fig. 14. The deviation was here only half a degree; but along a
                    red-hot bar of iron, the separation of the images was increased to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194209585" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9585-0751"/> a degree and a
                    quarter. On directing the eye over the surface of a green board, which had been
                    heated by exposure to the sun, a double image was distinctly seen. Another
                    board, merely wetted with water, betrayed a similar disposition, though it was
                    very difficult to distinguish the irregular image, its elevation being only 3'.
                    But on moistening the surface of the board with alcohol, the images were easily
                    seen at a separation of 15'. Still more conspicuous was the appearance on
                    spreading a little ether over a plate of glass, for the irregular image showed
                    itself 7½° raised.</p>
                <p>It was easy to imitate and examine the natural phenomena by means of a square
                    parallelopiped composed of plate glass. Having filled the half of this with cold
                    water, let hot water be gently poured over it, and the cover placed upon the
                    top. (See fig. 15, Plate CCCLV.) On standing a few feet behind the
                    parallelepiped, and looking at distant objects through the stratum where the
                    cold and hot water have become blended, the double and inverted images will for
                    a short time be clearly perceived. But a more durable effect is obtained by
                    filling one third of the glass case, as represented in fig. 15, with syrup or a
                    strong solution of white sugar, another third with distilled water, and the rest
                    with pure alcohol. A mutual penetration slowly takes place between the
                    conterminous surfaces of the alcohol A and the water B, and between this and the
                    syrup C; and after the lapse of perhaps two or three days, the blending spaces
                    become sufficiently broad for observation. The appearances then are nearly such
                    as those that have been sketched in the plate.</p>
                <p>Γhis mode of experiment is at once simple and convincing. The theory which Dr
                    Wollaston draws from it is equally ingenious, but not so demonstratively
                    established as its author presumes. It rests chiefly on the supposition, that
                    the stratum occupied by the penetration of two fluids of different densities,
                    graduates in refractive intensity more slowly at its boundaries, and most
                    rapidly in the middle. Or, to borrow the elucidation of geometry, if the
                    successive densities be denoted by ordinates, their sum mits will form a line of
                    double curvature, having consequently a point of contrary flexure. This
                    principle may be sound, though we can perceive no cogent reason why the curve of
                    intermediate refraction should be,convex or concave, or should combine both
                    sorts of incurvation. But admitting this double curvature to be a constituent
                    law, it vyill very satisfactorily explain the phenomena. The refraction will be
                    the same as if the light had traversed an uniform medium bounded by a surface of
                    that reverted curvature, the convex portion diverging, and the concave portion
                    converging, the parallel rays. The different effects are exhibited in fig. 12;
                    the distant object 0 is viewed in its true position by the pencil that arrives
                    at 0; it is seen inverted at I, by the rays which enter at <hi rend="italic"
                    >m;</hi> the rays which fall on <hi rend="italic">r</hi> make it appear again
                    erect at A. This explication is certainly very plausible, and may probably
                    approximate to the truth. But though much has been already achieved, the subject
                    of irregular refraction needs to be revised, and still more closely
                    investigated. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.)</hi></p>
