                    the chief of a group, now a portion of the dominions of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200589" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0589-0059"/>Great Britain. In ancient
                    times it was known by the 'name of Melite, and is by some supposed to be the
                    island upon which St Paul was shipwrecked. It afterwards bore the name of
                    Maltache, which name was changed by the Arabs to that of Malta, which it has
                    ever since borne.</p>
                <p>According to Boisgelin, these islands were, in the fourteenth century before our
                    era, possessed by a colony of Tyrian Phoenicians, and by a few small societies
                    of Ionic Greeks. These, under an aristocratic constitution, maintained their
                    independence till the fourth century before Christ, when they were assailed by
                    the Carthaginians, to whom, after a feeble resistance, they submitted. When the
                    Romans had conquered Sicily, they took possession (216 B. c.) of these islands,
                    and maintained their authority till, upon the dissolution of the western Roman
                    empire, they were expelled by the Goths, in whose power they continued till the
                    formidable forces of Arabia had been concentrated under the banner of Mahommed,
                    when, in 828 A. D. their dominion was established. The successful invasion of
                    Sicily by the Normans led to the occupation or Malta by the troops of Roger the
                    Norman, who added it to his newly-acquired dominions in the year 1090. It
                    continued in this state till Naples and Sicily fell under the power of Charles
                    V., emperor of Germany, who granted the islands, as a fief of his empire, to the
                    knights-hospitallers, who had been driven by the Saracens from Jerusalem, and
                    had taken refuge in the town of Acre. They had gradually become a military body,
                    and ably defended that city against the Saracens in 1290; upon which the king of
                    Cyprus gave to them Lemisson in his dominions, where they remained till the year
                    1310. Having then increased their numbers and military skill, they seized upon
                    the island of Rhodes, and gallantly maintained it against the whole power of the
                    Mahommedans, upon which they assumed the title of Knights of Rhodes. That island
                    was, however, wrested from them by the Turkish emperor Solyman in 1522, upon
                    which they withdrew, first to Candia, and soon afterwards to Malta. They were
                    finally established in that place as independent masters, and were only bound to
                    defend Sicily against the Turks, but voluntarily constituted themselves the
                    unceasing enemies of all infidels.</p>
                <p>On taking possession of the spot thus conferred upon them, the knights found the
                    island with little or no cultivation, and with a scanty population of various
                    races, chiefiy subsisting on fish, the persons employed in taking which were the
                    occupants of the huts. There was indeed a castle in which the grand master of
                    the order established himself with a few of the higher officers, but the
                    remainder were miserably lodged. It was not contemplated by the knights to fix
                    themselves permanently in Malta; but they had resolved on attempting to take a
                    strong port on the continent, and to retain Malta as a place of refuge in case
                    of a repulse. In this view they began to fortify it in some of the most
                    assailable parts; and when satisfied with the security of their works, they
                    despatched a force to take possession of Modon, a town of the Morea, and in the
                    vicinity of their former establishment in the island of Rhodes, to which they
                    felt a strong attachment and an eager desire to return. They accordingly sailed
                    and obtained possession of Modon in the night; but the next day, beginning to
                    commit acts of violence and of plunder, the inhabitants rose against them before
                    the whole of the gallies had arrived, and, though the Maltese fought with
                    desperate valour, they were compelled to retire, but not until they had secured
                    a part of their plunder, and had seized upon 800 females, whom they carried with
                    them to their islands.</p>
                <p>This disastrous adventure having convinced the knights that their existence as a
                    body was restricted to the islands, and that their security depended on the
                    fortifications with which it was defended, they addressed their principal
                    attention and efforts to the construction of works of such strength as would
                    defy all attacks which could be made upon them by the Saracens.</p>
                <p>More than ten years were incessantly occupied with this labour. Though the
                    crusades had terminated, the spirit which had animated them still survived in
                    the bosoms of many chivalrous Catholics in every part of Europe, and secured to
                    the knights the aid of men, arms, ammunition, stores, and money. Most of the
                    Christian monarchs of Europe were in some degree supporters of the order, which
                    at length was divided into eight <hi rend="italic">langues</hi> or nations. Each
                    of these divisions had a chief, with a determinate title. Thus the first was
                    Provence, called the grand commendator of religion; the second, Auvergne, was
                    marshal of the order; the third, France, was grand hospitaller; the fourth,
                    Italy, was chief admiral; the fifth, Aragon, was grand conservator; the sixth,
                    Germany, was grand bailiff; the seventh, Castille, was grand chancellor; and the
                    eighth, England, was grand commander of the cavalry. Each of these dignitaries
                    drew from his respective country large revenues, which were for the most part
                    derived from lands; and as those lands increased in monied value, so the
                    revenues of the chiefs of the several <hi rend="italic">langues</hi> kept pace
                    with that increase, and enabled the knights to maintain the most splendid
                    appearance, and to indulge in the most expensive luxuries.</p>
                <p>The rules by which admission into the order was established, and by which its
                    internal affairs were arranged, had been settled soon after they became fixed in
                    Malta, and were continued with only slight alterations up to the time of their
                    final dissolution. None were admitted into the order but such as could prove a
                    nobility of birth of four generations, both on the paternal and the maternal
                    side, unless they were sons, either legitimate or illegitimate, of kings or of
                    sovereign princes. The knights were formed into two classes. The first were
                    called <hi rend="italic">Grand Crosses,</hi> and such only were eligible as
                    candidates for the dignity of grand master. All were equally bound by vows of
                    celibacy, and by oaths of obedience to their superior, of adherence to the
                    Catholic church, and of unceasing hostility towards the infidels and all
                    pirates. These conditions might be dispensed with, either by the power of the
                    pope or by a chapter of the order; and such dispensations were allowed chiefiy
                    in cases where the nobility of the candidate, or of his anecstors on the
                    maternal side, was deficient or doubtful, and in a very few cases where, on the
                    paternal side, the pedigree was not satisfactorily ascertained.</p>
                <p>The admission into the order was under no restriction as to the age of the
                    candidate, as even infants were eligible; but their admission was only allowed
                    when they had completed their sixteenth year. They then entered upon their
                    noviciate, which lasted until they had completed their eighteenth year. Those
                    under sixteen were called the pages of the grand master, and, as such, were
                    prepared to enter upon their noviciate. The grand master had sixteen of such
                    pages, who served him as a kind of honourable domestics.</p>
                <p>The knights wore, on the left side of their cloaks or their vests, a cross of
                    white waxed cloth, with eight points, that having been their distinguishing
                    badge; but in some cases, and at a later period, the cross was of gold. When
                    they made war upon the Turks, they were dressed in a red cassock, on which,
                    before and behind, was a large white cross without points, as an emblem of their
                    religion. The customary dress of the grand master was a flowing garment of
                    tabby, fastened about the waist by a girdle, from which was suspended a large
                    purse, denoting the charitable nature of the institution of the order. The
                    government of the society was of a mixed description. The grand master was a
                    sort of sovereign. He coined money, pardoned<pb break="no" facs="nls:194200602"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-0602-0060"/> criminals, and nominated to the offices and
                    dignities of the order; but he was assisted by the <hi rend="italic">grand
                    crosses,</hi> who, with him as their president, determined on all the more
                    important concerns of the association.</p>
                <p>The education of the noviciates was sedulously attended to. Besides the strictest
                    attention to the forms of their religion, they were carefully taught whatever
                    related to military tactics, both on sea and on land, and accustomed to those
                    severe exercises in arms which, whilst they tended to render them expert and
                    daring, strengthened their limbs, and hardened their whole frame. The attention
                    which the construction of defensive works, and the training of healthy, strong,
                    and disciplined soldiers, required, did not withdraw the knights from the
                    formation of a naval force. The islands supplied none of the elements of naval
                    warfare; but the increase of the revenues extracted from the Christian powers,
                    who rivalled each other in what they considered as a common cause, and the war
                    with the infidels, supplied both the pecuniary means and the material to equip,
                    in a short time, what in that age may be viewed as a powerful navy.</p>
                <p>The fleet of Malta consisted chiefly of gallies, impelled by oars, and manned
                    with soldiers provided with fire-arms, but chiefly dependent on the operation of
                    boarding the vessels of their enemies; they had, besides, some brigantines, and
                    one vessel called the Great Carrack, mounted with cannon, and whose force was
                    estimated to be equal to that of a whole squadron. The naval power of Malta was
                    first employed in full force in the year 1532. It then joined the confederated
                    Christian fleet under the command of Andrew Doria, the celebrated Genoese
                    warrior. The victories gained by that officer were in a great degree attributed
                    to the valour of the Maltese knights, and induced Doria to plan the capture of
                    Modon; but the bad results of their former attempt on that part of the Morea had
                    so disheartened the Maltese soldiers, that they refused to join in the
                    expedition; though they aided in another against Coron, not far from Modon,
                    which proved successful. In the midst of these events, the Maltese forces were
                    suddenly recalled by the grand master to defend their own possessions, which
                    were threatened with an attack by the celebrated Turkish corsair Barbarossa, who
                    had obtained the superiority at sea, and maintained it with a fleet of more than
                    eighty large galli es. The invasion did not, however, take place at that time;
                    and Barbarossa carried on successful operations upon the coast of Africa, where
                    he captured both Algiers and Tunis, and besieged Tripoli.</p>
                <p>At the earnest entreaty of the new grand master, De Ponte, who had succeeded to
                    that dignity on the death of Villers de l’lsle Adam, who died in 1534, and at
                    the urgent suggestions of Muley Hassan, the deposed king of Tunis, the Emperor
                    of Germany, Charles V., was induced to undertake an expedition into Africa upon
                    a vast scale. The forces of Malta joined the emperor, and though, as regarded
                    him, the expedition was a complete failure, yet the credit of the Maltese
                    warriors was so raised by the part they took in the storming of Goletta, which
                    led to the capture of Tunis, that the emperor, when he abandoned his project,
                    conferred on the knights many valuable and extensive privileges, accompanied
                    with large grants to the society. One that was afterwards found to be of the
                    utmost value, was the right of drawing corn and other provisions from his
                    dominions in Sicily without paying any impost.</p>
                <p>After the death <hi rend="italic">of De</hi> Ponte, his successor in the
                    dignified office of grand master, Didier de Tolon de St Jalle, made an excursion
                    to the coast of Africa, with the view of relieving Tripoli. Much bravery and
                    skill was displayed on that occasion; the siege was for a time raised; the army
                    of Hayradin, which carried it on, was completely defeated, with the loss of all
                    its stores and baggage; and the Maltese returned in triumph, which was increased
                    by the capture of a valuable Turkish galley when on their passage homewards.
                    Solyman, the Turkish emperor, continuing the war with the Christian powers, was
                    so successful in many parts, that Ferdinand, then emperor of Germany, was
                    induced, in 1562, to enter into a treaty of peace, or rather a truce, for eight
                    years; but he dying soon afterwards, hostilities were again resumed between the
                    empire and the Turks, for the commencement of which, each party threw the blame
                    on the other. The Mahommedan forces advanced into Styria in 1564; and, though
                    they were successful in taking Erden and some other towns, they were ultimately,
                    after a severe conflict, totally defeated by Charles, archduke of Austria. In
                    some other parts of the frontier the success of the two parties was continually
                    varying, and nothing decisive took place.</p>
                <p>In this state of doubtful warfare, Solyman had his attention called to the island
                    of Malta, by Kossum, the son of Barbarossa, and by his great officer Dragut.
                    They persuaded him that he could never become master of the land until he had
                    gained command of the sea. This naturally drew the views of Solyman and his
                    council to the island of Malta, and an expedition for its capture was resolved
                    upon. Piala was appointed commander of the fleet, which consisted of one hundred
                    and forty-two gallies, seventeen galliots, twenty-three ships of heavy burden,
                    and several other transports. On board this naval armament were embarked thirty
                    thousand of the best soldiers of the Turkish army, commanded by Mustapha Pacha,
                    an experienced officer more than seventy-five years old. This vast force
                    approached the island, and the land troops were disembarked in the latter end of
                    May 1565, at Porto Majore, on the north-western part of the island. The chief
                    strength of the territory consisted of the castles which defended the capital,
                    known then by the names of Saint Michael, Saint Angelo, and Saint Elmo, the last
                    of which was fixed on as the first object of attack.</p>
                <p>At that time the dignity of grand master was occupied by the celebrated Valette.
                    Having maintained such complete intercourse with Constantinople, that he had
                    full information of the designs of Solyman, and likewise of the means available
                    for their execution, he made such preparations as were within his power. He had
                    but three thousand good soldiers, and, besides, about five thousand of the
                    inhabitants, who had fled for refuge to the capital, upon whom he could place
                    but little reliance. The Turks soon attacked St Elmo with great vigour, and were
                    bravely repulsed in their first two efforts; but, in the third attempt, they
                    were so far successful as to effect a lodgement, by which they were encouraged
                    to attempt a storm. By the invincible courage of the knights and their
                    followers, the assailants were at length repelled, leaving behind them two
                    thousand of their men, with their gallant leader Dragut. Their vast quantity of
                    artillery, and their powerful engines, encouraged the Turks to renewed exertion.
                    The cannonading was incessant, till the walls of St Elmo were battered down
                    quite to the rock on which they stood; many of the garrison had been cut off,
                    and the remainder, though not dispirited, were nearly exhausted. The grand
                    master offered to withdraw them, and replace them by volunteers, who had
                    tendered their services for the purpose; but they all resolutely declined the
                    oiler, with the firm determination to resist as long as any remained alive. They
                    prepared for the death that awaited them, by passing the night in confession,
                    prayer, and taking the sacraments, and then, embracing each other, repaired to
                    their respective posts. The Turks, who knew the weakness of the garrison,
                    advanced as to certain victory; but their opponents, though destitute of hope,
                    were not deprived of courage, and exhibited such proofs of it as amazed their
                    enemies, and dealt death in their ranks to numbers far exceeding their own
                    numerical force. The combat upon the platform, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200615" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0615-0061"/>which had been surrounded
                    with walls, continued four hours, till every knight and every soldier, except
                    two, who escaped by swimming, was left dead amongst the ruins, when the Turkish
                    colours were planted on the ramparts.</p>
                <p>The capture of this castle had been attended with such severe loss, that the
                    Turkish commanders were compelled to desist from further attacks; and it was
                    asked by the commander, Mustapha, “What will it cost us to take the father (the
                    city), when taking only the son has cost us such a number of our best troops?”
                    The possession of St Elmo gave to the Turks admission into the harbour; and
                    though they had lost great numbers of their men, they had inflicted on the
                    defenders the loss of fifteen hundred men, including one hundred and thirty of
                    the bravest knights.</p>
                <p>Whilst Mustapha was waiting for his reinforcements, the grand master made
                    pressing applications to the Christian princes for their assistance. Spain was
                    the most interested in the preservation of Malta, and messengers were despatched
                    to her viceroy in Sicily, requesting succours. But no other was afforded than
                    that of granting to the knights, who were in that island, to repair to Malta
                    with a few gallies, and the inconsiderable number of soldiers they could
                    collect. This small force, however, found the whole of the ports of Malta so
                    closely blockaded by the Mahommedans, that it was impossible to land, and they
                    returned to Messina.</p>
                <p>The Turks, as soon as the reinforcements, amounting to more than 10,000 men,
                    reached them, commenced the siege of the castle of St Michael, and carried it on
                    with all the destructive effect which could be produced by artillery, engines of
                    every kind, mining, sapping, and unwearied intrepidity. The defenders had the
                    advantage of greater coolness, and consequently more true courage; and in
                    proportion as the attacks of the Turks were more fierce, the greater was their
                    loss of men, for they were so effectually repelled at every point, that Mustapha
                    already began to think of abandoning the siege. The grand master had means of
                    receiving some slight reinforcements; and Mustapha had received, by means of
                    deserters, accurate information that the viceroy of Sicily, with a powerful
                    fleet, was ordered to sail for the relief of the island. By the same means he
                    had been informed that the castle of St Michael was but slenderly garrisoned,
                    and that it might probably be carried by one other resolute attack. This
                    determined Mustapha, who had already begun to embark some of his troops, to
                    re-land them, and recommence the siege. He attacked both the castle and the town
                    with a fury akin to madness, and they were defended with a courage that did
                    honour to the Christians. Every person in the forts and the city, from the grand
                    master to the youngest individual of both sexes, ran to the walls, and used such
                    implements as they could best manage; till at last, after seven assaults with
                    all their army and artillery, each one being more desperate than the preceding,
                    they were completely beaten back with prodigious slaughter.</p>
                <p>The attack on what was called the New Town was renewed on the following day in a
                    similar manner, and would perhaps have succeeded, if the grand master himself
                    had not flown to its defence, and there forced the infidels to retire with the
                    loss <hi rend="italic">of</hi> two thousand of their best men. Mustapha then
                    attempted the breaches of the castle of St Michael, but courage prevailed over
                    despair. The assailants found new works run up in the night behind the breaches
                    they had made in the day; and though they repeated their storming with increased
                    fury, they were not only repulsed, but suffered severely by sallies from the
                    garrison.</p>
                <p>By the various attacks and repulses, the physical powers of both assailants and
                    defenders became exhausted, and the efforts of both were for a short time
                    suspended. In the interval Mustapha attempted to treat, but his attempts were
                    all rejected with contempt by the grand master; and he, in consequence of
                    numberless inhuman actions committed by the Turks, issued orders that in future
                    no quarter should be given to them. Mustapha was making preparations for a
                    general and dreadful assault, when he received intelligence that the Spanish
                    fleet, which had been long detained in Sicily by contrary winds, had arrived
                    near the island. He then in haste broke up the siege in confusion, before the
                    Spanish troops, which amounted to ten thousand men, had been landed. When that
                    had been accomplished, the viceroy returned with the vessels to Sicily. Mustapha
                    was misled by false intelligence, which had stated that only three thousand
                    Spaniards had been landed. He therefore landed seven thousand men to intercept
                    them before they could reach the capital. This body of men was attacked and
                    routed with the loss of two thousand of their men, when the remainder were
                    embarked on board the vessels, and the whole force returned to their own ports.
                    In this memorable siege, which lasted four months, the Turks are said to have
                    lost twenty-four thousand of their best men, and twenty-four pieces of ordnance.
                    The loss of the Maltese had been two hundred and forty knights of the order, and
                    five thousand men.</p>
                <p>After this spirited defence, the Turks, the only enemies of the order, were so
                    impressed with the impregnable strength of Malta, that they neither made nor
                    contemplated any further attack on the island.</p>
                <p>The only operations, therefore, which could occupy them were of an inconsiderable
                    kind, such as that of sending out their gallies to protect the coasts of the
                    Mediterranean against the roving cruisers which issued from the ports on the
                    African shore. In this state of inactivity the knights naturally became indolent
                    and voluptuous. The strict rules of their order were scarcely ever enforced, and
                    many of them spent their time in the gay pleasures of the continental cities.
                    Their military duties were slightly performed, and their naval forces were so
                    reduced that it amounted only to four gallies, three galliots, four ships of
                    sixty guns, badly appointed, a frigate of thirty-six guns, and a number of
                    quick-sailing small vessels, known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >scampavivas.</hi> The fortifications of the island were not neglected. One side
                    of it is so completely fortified by nature, that no aid is required from art,
                    the rock being of great height, and quite perpendicular from the sea for
                    several, miles. The ancient defences thus grew up to be a prodigious range of
                    works with excavations, compared with which, the boasted catacombs of Rome and
                    of Naples appear insignificant. The ditches, of vast size, were cut out of the
                    solid rock, and, extending for many miles, excite surprise that a state so small
                    should ever in two centuries have been able to execute them. The government of
                    the grand master was, however, a simple despotism as soon as he was elected,
                    which was done by a committee of twenty-one knights, nominated by the several
                    Catholic powers who had <hi rend="italic">langues.</hi> He had the appointment
                    of all officers, civil and military, and presided in all the councils which
                    governed the island, as well as the knights of the order. His court was splendid
                    and expensive; and he had the patronage of a great number of commanderies and
                    priories in the several states of Catholic Europe. Mr Brydone, who visited Malta
                    a few years before the dissolution of its independence, remarks, “that it was an
                    epitome of all Europe, and an assemblage of the younger brothers, who are
                    commonly the best of its families, whence it is probably one of the best
                    academies for politeness in this part of the globe; besides, where every one is
                    entitled by law as well as by custom to demand satisfaction for the least breach
                    of it, people are under the necessity of being very exact and circumspect, both
                    with regard to their words and actions.” It is difficult to conceive that
                    society can be in a very refined state from which females of good character are
                    excluded, and where, as with the knights of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200628"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-0628-0062"/>Malta, though marriage was prohibited, concubinage
                    was undisguiscdly practised.</p>
                <p>Malta was continued as an independent state, and a member of the great European
                    family, till the year 1799. At that time, Bonaparte, with his vast armament for
                    the invasion of Egypt, appeared before the island, and, after a short parley, it
                    was delivered up to him. This hasty surrender has been commonly attributed to
                    treachery and bribery, not being accounted for upon any other principle; for
                    assuredly the knights could have made some defence, and the French were in too
                    much haste to avoid the fleet of Nelson to have spent the requisite time in
                    capturing it, if any resistance had been made. In consequence of this French
                    occupation, the island was surrounded by a British naval force, and a strict
                    blockade was established. This produced a degree of famine and distress to which
                    the garrison was at length compelled to submit, and, after a year and a half of
                    suffering, it was given up to the English. After the capture of Malta, and the
                    expulsion of the French from Egypt, a peace was concluded between England and
                    France; and one of the conditions of that treaty was the restoration of Malta to
                    its former state of independence. The grand master was to be nominated by the
                    pope, and the knights were to be restored to their former rank and dignity, and
                    the king of Naples was to be the guarantee for the independence and neutrality
                    of the island. France demanded the surrender, and England declined to give it
                    up. The existence of independence in Malta could only arise from the possession
                    of the commanderies and priories in the several Catholic countries, as it had no
                    other revenues. These had been seized upon by the governments of France, Spain,
                    and Bavaria, and thus diverted from their application to the finances of Malta.
                    It also became known to the British government that a grand master had been
                    nominated at the instigation of France, who was a decided creature of Bonaparte.
                    It was thought that Naples was too weak a power to be trusted to as a security
                    against the design which France had avowed of again occupying Egypt, in which
                    case Malta would have been an almost indispensable possession. It is needless
                    here to enter into the negociations which were carried on upon this subject,
                    because they were mixed up with the other objects which were then causes of
                    dispute, all of which led to a renewal of the war in 1803, and to leaving Malta
                    in the hands of the British. It may, however, be observed, that the refusal of
                    the British 'government to restore Malta to the knights, gave a great advantage
                    to that of France in the discussions which preceded the renewal of hostilities.
                    The stipulation in the treaty was so express that it could not, by any
                    construction, be eluded; and accordingly the government of France demanded its
                    unconditional fulfilment. This threw the British ministers upon the defensive.
                    As far as regarded the treaty, the obligation on the part of Great Britain to
                    restore the island to its former state of independence was undeniable. In
                    refusing compliance, therefore, the government of the latter had to justify an
                    apparent breach of compact, and consequently found itself reduced to a situation
                    which is at all times questionable and embarrassing, whatever be the nature of
                    the grounds upon which such a refusal is rested. The demands of France were
                    answered by criminations against the conduct of her ruler in regard to other
                    countries, particularly Switzerland; and, as might have been foreseen, the war
                    recommenced with increased fury upon both sides.</p>
                <p>At the general pacification Malta was formally ceded to us by all the powers of
                    Europe, and has continued under our government to the present time. The group of
                    islands, comprehending Malta, Gozo, and Cumino, whose history has been narrated,
                    occupy an extent, from south-east by east to north-west by west, of eight and a
                    half marine leagues; Cape St Demitri, the north-west endofGozo, being in east
                    longitude 14.10. and in latitude 36.3. north; and Point Benhisa, the south-east
                    end of Malta, being in east longitude 14. 33. 30. and in north latitude 35. 49.
                    30. Malta is irregular in figure, and its surface is composed of small valleys,
                    defiles, and hills. It has been conjectured that the three islands, Malta, Gozo,
                    and Cumino, are the remains of a large tract of land, which once extended
                    towards the south-west, and which resisted the violence that caused the
                    destruction of the country of which they formed a part. To have a just idea of
                    Malta, we must figure to ourselves an inclined plane, extending from south-west
                    to north-east, in such a manner that the calcareous strata of which it is
                    composed rise towards the south and south-east 200 fathoms above the sea, which
                    dashes against the bottom of these declivities; at the same time, on the
                    opposite side, they are of considerable length, and decline insensibly till they
                    become level with the sea. The broadest part of the island, though sufficiently
                    elevated, is that to the east of the city of Valetta; this part is consequently
                    more densely peopled, and better cultivated, although there, as in all other
                    places, the rock is entirely naked, except where the hand of industry has placed
                    a layer of earth to encourage cultivation. The principal defiles and valleys run
                    from south-west to north-east, and all of them seem as if formed out of the rock
                    by the violent currents of water rushing from the heights.</p>
                <p>Malta contains two cities and twenty-two casais or villages, the original capital
                    being Citta Vecchia, the old or notable city, though called by the inhabitants
                    Medina. It is the see of a bishop, and contains, besides the cathedral, which is
                    large and commodious, several other churches and religious houses. The town is
                    so elevated, that from it may be seen the whole island, and sometimes the coasts
                    of Africa and Sicily, both about seventy miles distant.</p>
                <p>The catacombs in this place are very extensive, and of great celebrity. They
                    contain streets in all directions, which are formed with such regularity that
                    they have been called the subterraneous city. Near to Citta Vecchia, on the
                    south, is the grotto of St Paul, which is used as a church. It is an
                    extraordinary cave, divided into three parts by iron gates. The sepulchral
                    grottos of the Ben-jemma Mountains, two miles west from the city, are ranked
                    amongst the curiosities of Malta. In the craggy rocks around Malta are many
                    spacious caves or grottos, into some of which, being on a level with the sea,
                    the waves dash in when in an agitated state, and resound most tremendously. The
                    mouths of others are at different heights, and the access to them difficult and
                    dangerous, according to their situation. One of the most considerable of these,
                    near Benhisa, the south-east point of Malta, extends more than two hundred paces
                    under ground. All these grottos are full of stalactites and stalagmites,
                    produced by the water filtering through the calcareous rocks.</p>
                <p>Malta is generally considered as divided into two unequal parts, the one to the
                    east and the other to the west of Citta Vecchia. All the easels or villages are
                    in the eastern division, which is much larger than the western, the latter
                    containing only detached houses, amongst scenery which is commonly picturesque,
                    but, the air towards the coast being very unwholesome, and there being a
                    scarcity of land capable of cultivation, farmers are not tempted to reside in
                    it. The whole of this part abounds in odoriferous plants, and has in it some
                    very considerable salt-works.</p>
                <p>Gozo stands much higher than Malta, and is entirely surrounded by perpendicular
                    rocks, the highest of which are to the west and south, where they are
                    tremendously steep. The country is not so uneven as that of Malta, consequently
                    it is more easily cultivated; and it appears that the surface was originally
                    nearly horizontal. The pasture-land of Gozo is fine, and great numbers of cattle
                    are fed on it for the use of Malta, with which there is daily<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200641" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0641-0063"/> communication. The grapes of
                    this island are peculiarly fine, and so highly esteemed by the Maltese, that
                    almost the whole of them are bought up for their consumption. Cotton and corn
                    are cultivated with success; the air is particularly healthful, and the country
                    presents many agreeable prospects. It contains six casais or villages. One
                    castle stands upon the summit of the island, and another, Fort Chambray, on the
                    south-east coast. The interior fortress is on a solitary rock, of not more than
                    300 yards in diameter. In the heart of a mountain on the north-west, nearZabug,
                    is a quarry of alabaster. There are some salt-works near Port Miggiaro, on the
                    south-east side. At half a league from thence, towards the west, is a shelf,
                    celebrated for producing the <hi rend="italic">Fungus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Melitensis,</hi> or Maltese mushrooms; and farther on is a coast formed of
                    caverns and vertical rocks, from 150 to 160 feet in height above the water,
                    which rocks are buried in the sea to a very great depth, but are of so white a
                    colour, and the water so translucent, that they can be easily distinguished at a
                    great depth under the waves. Cliffs continue all round the western coast, but
                    they are not so high as those of the south, and are broken in several
                    places.</p>
                <p>Cumino is a small island in the channel which separates Malta from Gozo, and
                    partakes mostly of the character of the latter. The two channels which are
                    formed by this island have a depth of water from twelve to twenty fathoms, and
                    consequently are safe for the largest vessels, keeping the middle of the
                    channel, in which, too, is good anchoring ground of fine sand. The greatest
                    length is two miles, and at the north-west end are three small caves of the
                    depth of from two to three fathoms. There is a tower on a height at the south
                    end, to the westward of which is the islet of Cuminotto, and some rocks.</p>
                <p>The great value of this group of islands, whether in a military or a commercial
                    view, depends on the excellence of the numerous harbours to be found on its
                    shores, in the facility of entrance to them, and in the excellent anchorage on
                    almost every part of the surrounding coast, except in the south-west part. The
                    first to be noticed is the Marsa Musceit, and the Porto Grande, or great port of
                    Valetta, separated by a rocky peninsula or tongue of land, on which stands the
                    city, with its suburb Floriana. At the extremity is Fort St Elmo, which serves
                    to defend the entrance into both ports. On the south side of the great port are
                    two other peninsulas of rock, pointing towards Valetta, and forming inlets which
                    serve as excellent harbours. On the first of these is the castle of St Angelo
                    and the town of Victorioso; on the second, the town of Isola or Sanglea; and
                    southward of both is that of Burmola, surrounded by the fortification called the
                    Cottonera. The inlet on the eastern side of Victorioso is the Porto della
                    Renella; that between Victorioso and Sanglea, Porto della Galera; and that on
                    the west of Sanglea, Porto delľ Isola Sanglea. The promontory which forms the
                    north side of Marsa Musceit, as St Elmo and Valetta form the south side, is
                    named Point Dragut, and exhibits on its extremity Fort Tigné, which defends the
                    harbour. Over the south point of the entrance to the Grand Port is the more
                    extensive Fort Ricasoli.</p>
                <p>The approach to the harbour of Valetta is exceedingly picturesque and
                    interesting; and the fortifications, close to which every ship has to pass, seem
                    sufficient to annihilate the most powerful naval force that could be brought
                    against it. Without the harbour, the water is from sixty to eighty fathoms in
                    depth, but the bottom is good holding ground; and as the wind is commonly
                    variable outside, and the entrance rather too narrow to attempt to work in, the
                    larger ships of war commonly anchor there, and are warped in, for which there
                    are great conveniences. The entrance is not more than 250 fathoms, but is safe
                    and commodious, and large enough to contain, in its several ports, the whole
                    British navy. Water for shipping may be had in any quantity. It is filled with a
                    hose alongside the wharf, from pipes laid down for that purpose. The houses are
                    built with flat roofs, plastered with pozzalana, with pipes conducting to the
                    cisterns, so that all the rain-water is preserved. There are also many public
                    cisterns, and likewise a fountain, the source of which is in the southern part
                    of the island, from which the water is conducted by an aqueduct to fill the
                    cisterns when the winter rains do not furnish a sufficient supply.</p>
                <p>There are other harbours, which our limits do not admit of our describing, and
                    without description their names would be of small use to navigation; they are
                    scarcely used for purposes <hi rend="italic">of</hi> commerce, as nearly the
                    whole trade is carried on in Valetta.</p>
                <p>The Maltese islands are calcareous rocks, containing some petrifactions and
                    concretions. This rock is mostly of a porous nature, and a great proportion of
                    it is covered with earth brought originally from Sicily and other parts. The
                    ground so formed is never suffered to rest, but is cultivated every year. The
                    colour of the soil varies in different districts, and it is seldom more than a
                    foot in depth on the surface of the rock: in summer it is irrigated chiefly by
                    the night dew; but the rock being porous, retains the moisture, and keeps the
                    earth constantly fresh. The earth is always removed once in ten years, in order
                    to clear the rock of a thick crust which forms on it, and prevents the moisture
                    from penetrating sufficiently.</p>
                <p>When the ground is properly prepared, it produces in the first year water-melons
                    and garden-plants; in the next year, an excellent fruit, preserved through the
                    winter, called Malta melons; and after that, barley, the straw of which forms
                    fodder for the cattle. The ground is ploughed in the third year, and then
                    planted with cotton; and in the fourth, it is sowed with corn. The land
                    afterwards bears three different crops successively, but particular care is
                    taken to prepare the ground the year in which the cotton tree is to come into
                    bearing, when it is necessary to reduce the earth to a kind of powder.</p>
                <p>The greatest part of the land is planted with cotton, of which three species are
                    cultivated. One is natural to the country, another was brought from Siam, and
                    the third, which is of a cinnamon colour, known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >atillas,</hi> was brought from the West Indies. Wheat is sown in November,
                    after three ploughings, and is cut in the beginning of June. Barley is sown in
                    the same month, and harvested in May. A grain called <hi rend="italic"
                    >tommon</hi> is grown in the poorer soils, but most of it is mixed with wheat,
                    sometimes with rye, and the crop collectively is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >meschiato.</hi> Every field is enclosed with stone walls five or six feet in
                    height, in order to shelter the plants from the effects of wind, rain, and
                    storms, during the spring and the autumn.</p>
                <p>The islands both of Malta and Gozo produce various fruits of exquisite flavour,
                    with excellent roots and very fine flowers. The roses especially are described
                    as smelling more sweetly than those of any other country. They likewise yield
                    cummin, aniseed, laricella, and lichen; the last grows on the rocks exposed to
                    the north, and is used íòr dyeing the amaranthine colour. The gardens in Malta
                    are numerous, especially towards the east. They are generally ornamented with
                    groves of orange and lemon trees. The greatest attention is paid to them, and
                    they are commonly watered twice a day, the water being constantly kept for their
                    use in cisterns hewn out of the rock, with trenches dug round them to collect
                    the rain.</p>
                <p>Bees are kept in great quantities in some parts, in horizontal hives. The honey
                    is of the most delicious flavour, and always remains in a liquid state. There
                    are many asses of a strong race on the islands. The sheep are very prolific, and
                    in number about 12,500. There are about 6500 horned cattle, and 5570 horses of
                    all kinds.</p>
                <p>The appropriation of the land, and the crops produced from it, in 1832, may be
                    seen by the following statement: </p>

                <p>These islands may be considered as one of the most densely peopled spots upon the
                    globe, certainly the most of any portion of Europe. The whole land, it will be
                    seen, does not exceed nine tenths of an acre to each human being; and reckoning
                    only that part which is cultivated, and all that is susceptible of being so, it
                    is scarcely five eighths of an acre to each.</p>
                <p>The people of Malta, though subjugated from time to time by different nations,
                    retain the peculiarities of an original character, and many countenances
                    indicate an African origin. They are commonly strong, short, plump, with curled
                    hair, flat noses, turned-up lips, and the colour of their skin is the same as
                    that of the inhabitants of the coasts of Barbary. Their language is a kind of
                    Italian, mixed with many Arabic words; but it is intelligible along the northern
                    shore of Africa, to which quarter of the world Malta was often considered as
                    belonging, till an <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> act of parliament caused it to
                    be treated as a part of Europe. These people are generally industrious, active,
                    faithful, economical, and courageous, and their temperance is exemplary; but,
                    with these good qualities, they are said to retain the defects attributed to the
                    Africans, being mercenary, passionate, jealous, and vindictive. They are
                    vehemently attached to the Catholic church, and not a little superstitious and
                    fantastical in practising the several ceremonies which that system of religion
                    inculcates. They drink coffee and chocolate more than wine or spirits, and their
                    food consists chiefly of vegetables and fish; but on festivals they eat much
                    pork, and consequently many pigs are kept. Though much of their former character
                    has been retained, yet, since they have become British subjects, sources of
                    profit have been developed, which have increased amongst them industry and the
                    spirit of enterprise, and they are converted into the best seamen of the
                    Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>Malta is, from its situation, remarkably salubrious; epidemic affections rarely
                    occur, but the same diseases return every year with greater or less violence,
                    according to the nature of the season, and all partake, more or less, of a
                    bilious character. Genuine inflammatory disorders are seldom present, but during
                    the spring bilious intermittent fevers prevail.</p>
                <p>The four seasons are regularly and well defined. The spring is delightful, and
                    accompanied with a sweet and temperate air. In June, the heat is considerable,
                    and it continues to increase during the whole summer. The winds, which are
                    almost imperceptible, mostly blow from the east; the sea is then calm, and no
                    country can appear more delightful. In September, the sky begins to be obscured
                    by clouds; towards evening the atmosphere is charged with electricity, which
                    produces frequent lightning, often attended with violent peals of thunder; and
                    sometimes even violent shocks of earthquakes are felt. From December to March
                    the sky is covered with clouds, and the rains are very abundant. The sea is in a
                    constant state of agitation; the winds are cool, and blow from the north, from
                    the north-west, or the north-east, with great violence. The siroccos, or south
                    winds, never blow more than three days. They are frequently succeeded by a calm,
                    during which the heat is very great, but much less oppressive and suffocating,
                    though the thermometer frequently shows a much higher temperature than on other
                    occasions.</p>
                <p>The commerce of the Maltese islands has greatly fluctuated since it has been in
                    the possession of the British. During the war, and especially after the issuing
                    of the Berlin and Milan decrees, they became the great depot for all the
                    commodities produced within the British dominions in the several quarters of the
                    globe. At that time, ships from the ports of Turkey repaired in great numbers to
                    Valetta, and returned with valuable cargos of coffee, sugar, and other tropical
                    articles, as well as British manufactured goods, These were landed in the ports
                    of the Archipelago, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194200667"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-0667-0065"/>thence conveyed, by contraband trade, to the towns
                    in Austrian, Prussian, and other German states, and at times into France itself.
                    That vast trade has ceased with the return of general tranquillity, and the only
                    commerce now is that of the exchange of the productions of the islands with
                    those of other countries which are required for consumption. The chief article
                    imported is corn, as the islands scarcely produce more than half of what is
                    required for that kind of food. It comes partly from Sicily, and partly from the
                    Russian ports of Odessa and Taganrock in the Black Sea. It is made a principal
                    source of revenue, being charged with a duty varying from 12s. to Is. the
                    quarter, according as the price is lower or higher. In the year 1834« the value

                <p>The civil government of Malta, since it became a de pendency of Britain, has been
                    such as to reconcile the inhabitants generally to the dominion of a foreign
                    power, and to excite no regret for the loss of a precarious, uncertain
                    independence. The religious establishment is supported as before the conquest of
                    the island, and as much indulgence and even complaisance is exercised towards
                    the habits of the people in holidays and processions as they can possibly
                    desire. The system of municipal law has been but little altered; for though
                    there is an English chief judge, the numerous inferior native judges remain in
                    possession of their offices, and decide causes as formerly, only subject to an
                    appeal to the supreme court. The education of all classes is cared for. There is
                    a university, with its due number of professors ,∙ and in the year 1834 a lyceum
                    or grammar school was established in connection with the university. The
                    professors in both receive salaries from the government, as do also the tutors
                    of the numerous local schools for primary instruction. The hospitals, and other
                    institutions of a charitable nature, which cost annually from thirteen to
                    fourteen thousand pounds, are, upon the whole, well conducted, and prove highly
                    beneficial to the objects of distress.</p>
                <p>Though the taxes are light, and the duties on all imported commodities are fixed
                    at a low rate, the revenue more than defrays the expenditure; for, excepting the
                    salary of the governor, which is L.5000 per annum, and those of the secretary
                    and chief justice, who have L.1500 each, the sa-aries of the other offices,
                    which are mostly filled by natives, are fixed at a low rate, commensurate with
                    the cheapness of the means of subsistence. In this respect, Malta presents an
                    exception to most of our colonial establishments.</p>

                <p>Having thus shown the relation between the civil expenditure of Malta and the
                    revenue which it produces, it is now necessary to notice the military
                    expenditure. It is not easy to estimate on how much larger a scale our military
                    force requires to be fixed in consequence of our possession of Malta. The
                    troops, if not there, would probably be maintained in some other port at an
                    equal, if not at a greater expense. We can only give the following, being a
                    statement of the amount paid by Great Britain for the military establishment of
                    Malta for the year ending the 31st March 1834, viz.</p>

                <p>The accounts at Malta have been of late kept in English money, abundance of
                    silver having been introduced, though Spanish dollars and Italian silver coins
                    are still in circulation. There are no gold coins in circulation. The silver
                    currency is estimated to amount to L.150,000, and there arc in the island two
                    banks which issue notes, amounting together to about L.20,000. <hi
