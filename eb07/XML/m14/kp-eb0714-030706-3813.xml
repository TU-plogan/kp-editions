                    one of the greatest pulpit orators of France, and in the pathetic department of
                    sacred eloquence the first, was the son of François Massillon, a notary ofHiéres
                    in Provence. He was born on the 24th of June 1663, and entered, when very young,
                    into the college of the Oratory in that city. Whilst yet a boy, his favourite
                    amusement was to collect around him his companions, and repeat to them the more
                    striking portions of the sermons he had heard, which he declaimed in an
                    agreeable and animated manner. Having been destined by his father for the
                    profession of notary, he was early withdrawn from college; but as he never
                    ceased to return thither at his leisure hours, the superiors, remarking his
                    dispositions, addressed solicitations to his father, in order to obtain his
                    permission to attach the youth to themselves; and, in the year 1681, young
                    Massillon entered into the congregation, where he studied theology under Father
                    Beaujeu, afterwards bishop of Castres. He perused the sermons of Father Lejeune,
                    which pleased him exceedingly; and he also made some essays of his own, which
                    were thought good, but did not satisfy his own taste. In the year 1689, he wrote
                    to Father Abel de Sainte-Marthe, general of the Oratory, that, as his talents
                    and his inclination equally disqualified him for the pulpit, he conceived that
                    some employment in teaching philosophy or theology would suit him better.
                    Nevertheless, having been ordained priest, some panegyrics preached by him, in
                    which instruction was happily blended with eulogium, determined his superior to
                    direct his talents to the ministry of the pulpit. But Massillon dreading, as he
                    said, the demon of pride, sought to escape the seductions of self-love, by
                    devoting himself to retirement. It is one of the traditions of the Oratory,
                    collected by D’Alembert, whose statement in this respect is beyond all
                    suspicion, that he went to bury himself in the monastery of Sept-Fonts, the
                    habit of which he assumed; but the abbot having instructed him to reply to
                    Cardinal de Noailles, who had addressed an order to the head of the
                    establishment, the surprise of the cardinal on receiving from this Thebaid an
                    answer full of elegance and refinement, drew compliments to the abbot. The
                    latter immediately named the young novice to the prelate; and as his eminence
                    did not choose that so fine talents should remain longer concealed, Massillon
                    was restored to the Oratory.</p>
                <p>After having professed the belles-lettres and theology at Pézenas, Montbrison,
                    and Vienne, and made some funeral orations, which were not the first he
                    delivered (since Massillon himself says the contrary in the oration on Μ. de
                    Villars), he was in 1696 called to Paris, where he was already known, to assume
                    the direction of the seminary of Saint-Magloire. It was there that Massillon
                    composed his first ecclesiastical Conferences. Although the tone of these
                    compositions, which is simple enough, be different from that of his sermons, yet
                    they are not deficient in vivacity, especially when he has occasion to describe
                    the consequences of the disorder or ignorance of the clergy. They are also much
                    more analogous to the amiable mood of his eloquence than the severer conferences
                    which he composed at an advanced age. These preparatory exercises developed and
                    fixed his talent. Hence, when Father de Latour asked him what he thought of the
                    preachers of the capital, he replied, <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> I find them
                    possessed of great genius and talent; but if I preach, I will not preach like
                    them.” He admired Bourdaloue too much ever to confound him with the preachers
                    who were then followed. But he did not take him in everything as a model,
                    because he wished to open a new path for himself. The pathetic grounded upon
                    strong feeling and intimate self-knowledge was at that time entirely wanting to
                    the eloquence of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203826"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3826-0308"/>pulpit. The absurd mixture of profane and sacred
                    maxims had already been banished from it; but subtile mysticism and extravagant
                    metaphors had not yet yielded to the high reason and the austere eloquence of
                    Bourdaloue. Massillon observed, that they were too much occupied with exterior
                    manners, or vague and general moralities; and he sought in the heart of man the
                    secret interests of the passions, in order to discover their motives, and combat
                    the illusions of self-love by reason and sentiment, as well as by the attraction
                    of happiness united to religion. Such indeed was the distinctive character of
                    his eloquence.</p>
                <p>At the period of the controversies which took place by order of Louis XIV., he
                    was intrusted with a mission, and in 1698 went to preach during Lent at
                    Montpellier, where he was warmly received, notwithstanding Bourdaloue had not
                    been forgotten. The sermons of Father Lejeune, called the missionary of the
                    Oratory, were, according to him, a mine from which he did not fail to derive
                    profit; and he may, no doubt, have obtained some ideas from these discourses;
                    but he must have been endowed with great facility to compose sermons so rich in
                    developments, in which he perhaps indulged to excess, but which appear to arise
                    the one from the other, and to spring forth, as it were, by a single impulse.
                    Eight or ten days at the most were sufficient for those compositions which are
                    so full of reason and of unction. Being now known, he could no longer fly from
                    his renown, which soon recalled him to the capital. It was in 1699 that he
                    preached during Lent at Paris, in the church of the Oratory. The triumph which
                    he then obtained would have intoxicated a preacher who had less self-knowledge,
                    with, perhaps, greater pretensions to humility. Ona particular occasion, being
                    felicitated by one of his brethren on the admirable manner in which he had
                    preached; “Stop, Father,” said he; “the devil has already told it me more
                    eloquently than you.” Father Bourdaloue having gone to hear him, was so much
                    satisfied with his appearance, that on seeing him descend from the pulpit, he
                    pointed him out to his brethren who were inquiring his opinion, and observed to
                    them in the words of the precursor of the Messiah, “Hunc oportet crescere, me
                    autem minui.” This, on the part of such a judge, was an humble acknowledgment of
                    the excellence of that merit which shone forth, notwithstanding the retiring and
                    modest demeanour of the orator. Massillon appeared in the pulpit, not with his
                    eyes shut like the celebrated Jesuit, but with downcast looks, without gesture,
                    and without parade. Nevertheless, when he warmed with his subject, his look and
                    gesture became so expressive, that at a period when the sacred orators served as
                    models to the declaimers of the stage, Baron, the celebrated actor, having gone
                    to hear him, was so much struck with the correctness of his delivery, that he
                    observed to one of his companions, “My friend, here is an orator; but as to us,
                    we are only actors.” The player, however, could only admire without being
                    affected. But Laharpe has mentioned a circumstance which gives us a deeper
                    insight into the real source of the preacher’s power. It appears that a person
                    belonging to the court, when on his way to see a new opera performed, found his
                    carriage stopped by a double file of vehicles, one set of which were proceeding
                    to the opera, and the other moving to the Quinze-Vingts, where Massillon was to
                    preach. Impatient of the delay thus occasioned, he entered the church from
                    curiosity, and immediately applied to himself the emphatic apostrophe, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tu es ille vir,</hi> of the sermon on the Word of God. The man of
                    the world heard the orator to the end, and, in going away, felt that he was
                    altogether a different person from what he had been when he entered the church
                    of the Quinze-Vingts.</p>
                <p>At Versailles there was a general desire to hear Massillon. Being appointed
                    preacher to the court for the advent of 1699, the father of the Oratory appeared
                    there without pride and without timidity. As Fléchier had done in similar
                    circumstances, he chose for the text of his first sermon, on All-Saints-Day,
                    before a court which was wholly engrossed with the glory of the king, <hi
                    rend="italic">Beati</hi><hi rend="italic">qui</hi><hi rend="italic">lugent,</hi>
                    thessed are they w ho mourn. But, with infinite art, he employed dialogue as
                    well as apostrophe, and dexterously put the eulogium in another mouth than that
                    which had uttered the lesson: “If the world were speaking here in the place of
                    Jesus Christ—Happy, would the world say, happy the prince who has never fought
                    except to conquer. But, Sire, Jesus Christ does not speak like the world.” It
                    was after this first advent that Louis XIV. addressed to him, in presence of the
                    whole court, the well-known words, “Father, I have heard several great orators,
                    and I have been satisfied with them; but as to you, whenever I hear you, I am
                    dissatisfied with myself.” Massillon succeeded at Versailles as he had done at
                    Paris. The court of Louis XIV., composed of sprightly and polished men, required
                    to be moved rather than convinced. Massillon, in delineating the passions with
                    that searching truth which destroys illusion, contented himself with opposing to
                    the seductions of vice the delineations of a morality which be knew well how to
                    render amiable and interesting, even to those whose inclinations he unveiled. In
                    a word, the language of Massillon, though noble, was not the less simple, and
                    adapted to the comprehension of the vulgar; it was always natural and just,
                    without labour and without affectation, and hence it had equal attractions for
                    persons of all classes. We cannot have a better proof of this than the rude but
                    expressive remark of a common woman, who, finding herself pressed by the crowd
                    entering Nôtre-Dame, where Massillon was to preach, exclaimed indignantly, in
                    her peculiar idiom, “Ce diable de Massillon, quand il prêche, remue tout
                    Paris.”</p>
                <p>The first time that he delivered his celebrated sermon on the small number of the
                    Elect, was at Saint-Eustache. In his peroration, the orator, suddenly addressing
                    himself to the assembly, “I suppose, my brethren,” said he, “that this is your
                    last hour, and the end of the world; that Jesus Christ is about to appear in his
                    glory, in the midst of this temple, tojudgeus. Think you that he would find in
                    it even ten righteous men? Appear; where are you? Remnant of Israel, pass to the
                    right. Oh God, where are thine elect? and what remains for thy portion ?”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Je suppose, mes frères, que
                    c’est votre dernière heure, et la fin de l’univers; que Jésus-Christ va paraitre

                    passez à la droite. O Dieu! où sont vos élus? et que reste-t-il pour votre
                    partage ?”</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> J</hi> These few words produced a
                    sudden movement; the whole auditory rose up, at once transported and dismayed.
                    In the chapel of Versailles the same passage excited a similar commotion, which
                    was shared by Louis XIV., and Massillon was observed to cover his face with his
                    hands, and to remain silent for a few moments. This prosopopoeia, which still
                    astonishes in the perusal, has been chosen by Voltaire in the article <hi
                    rend="italic">Eloquence</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie,</hi> as an
                    example presenting “la figure la plus hardie, et l’un des plus beaux traits
                    d’éloquence qu’on puisse lire chez les anciens et les modernes.’' The impression
                    produced by the pathos of the discourses, as well as by the charm of the
                    sentiments, with which the orator appeared penetrated, and which he diffused
                    throughout the whole of his auditory, attracted to him numerous proselytes. Of
                    these, one of the most distinguished was Count Rosemberg, nephew of Cardinal
                    Forbin de Janson, who had been wounded at the battle of Marsaille. Attacked<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194203839" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3839-0309"/> by a painful
                    malady, the consequence of this wound, he had recourse to a spiritual director,
                    and did not call in vain upon Father Massillon. After his recovery he became a
                    model of virtue, and, in retirement, led a most exemplary and edifying life.</p>
                <p>In 1704, when Bossuet and Bourdaloue were both removed by death, Massillon
                    preached a second Lent at court, and with such success that Louis XIV. expressed
                    a desire to hear him every two years. But though henceforth without an equal,
                    jealous mediocrity or rival intrigue kept him at a distance, and Massillon never
                    again appeared in the pulpit of Versailles during the last years*of the reign of
                    Louis XIV. whose funeral oration he was destined to pronounce. In 1709, he
                    likewise pronounced that of the Prince of Conti, in the church of Saint
                    André-des-Arc. This discourse, which was much applauded when delivered, though
                    criticised after it had been printed, was the only one which he gave to the
                    public through the press. Soon afterwards, in his sermon on Ahns, preached at
                    Nôtre-Dame in Paris, the picture which he drew of the scarcity of 1709 moved
                    even to tears all who heard it, and excited a commiseration which, so far from
                    being a sterile and transitory sentiment, displayed itself in acts of
                    beneficence. To show the deep impression produced by this preacher, we may here
                    relate an anecdote which is very well authenticated. The pious Rollin having
                    conducted the boarders of the college of Beauvais to Saint-Leu, where Massillon
                    was to preach on the Holiness of the Christian, these children, in listening to
                    him, forgot the levity natural to their age; they returned to their school in
                    profound silence, and several subjected themselves to privations, the rigour of
                    which their good and kind master found it expedient to moderate. After the death
                    of Fléchier, in 1710, Massillon, now the last remaining orator of that
                    remarkable age, was called to pronounce at Sainte-Chapelle the funeral oration
                    of the dauphin; a grand painting, in which he introduced portraits of Montausier
                    and Bossuet, the preceptors of that prince. In 1715 he rendered a similar homage
                    to the memory of Louis XIV. Taking as his text on this occasion the words of
                    Solomon, <hi rend="italic">Ecce</hi><hi rend="italic">magnus effectus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sum,</hi> “Lo, I have become great,” he commenced by repeating
                    them slowly, seeming as it were to recollect himself; then he fixed his eyes on
                    the assembly in mourning; next he surveyed the funeral enclosure, with all its
                    solemn pomp; and, lastly, turning his eyes to the mausoleum erected in the midst
                    of the temple—after some moments of silence, exclaimed, “<hi rend="italic">Dieu
                    seul est</hi><hi rend="italic">grand,</hi><hi rend="italic">mes frères,”</hi>
                    “My brethren, God alone is great.” This sudden burst, worthy of Bossuet himself,
                    is much more than a fine or happy expression; it is a profound and penetrating
                    stroke of inspired eloquence, which in an instant reduced to nothing all the
                    grandeur and the vanity of human life&lt;</p>
                <p>After more than twenty years spent in preaching, Massillon, promoted by the
                    regent to the bishopric of Clermont, in 1717, was appointed to preach before the
                    king during Lent. This was his last effort, but it is also his masterpiece.
                    Racine was more than fifty when he produced his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Athalie</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Massillon had nearly attained his
                    fiftyfifth year when he composed his <hi rend="italic">Petit-Carême,</hi> which
                    made him be called the Racine of the pulpit. It was in retirement, at a
                    country-house belonging to the Oratory, that he completed, in six weeks, the ten
                    sermons which formed the <hi rend="italic">station</hi> (as it was called) of
                    the court, and which, by reason of the tender age of the monarch, was reduced to
                    a simple dominical, in other words, to the Sunday lectures or sermons. Although
                    he had in view the instruction of the prince and of the great, it was rather as
                    a parent than a master that he sought to convey it. Humanity, tenderness,
                    goodness, are the motives which predominate in the sermons of Massillon; and to
                    these he continually recurs, by painting the opposite qualities in the most
                    striking colours. This might at first appear to circumscribe his eloquence in
                    the moral part, and to betray him into repetitions; but, happily, the variety
                    and richness of his expressions aggrandise the field of his discourses, which
                    expands with every movement he makes, and thus affords him ample space to
                    expatiate in, notwithstanding the fertility, and in some cases the redundancy,
                    of his illustrations. The same motives, and above all that of humanity, prevail
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Petit-Care me</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but refined
                    views and delicate moralities compensate, by elegance and grace of expression,
                    for the bolder ornaments and deep pathos of his ordinary style. An eloquence
                    more gentle and more insinuating, because intended to make an impression upon a
                    young prince, thus forms the characteristic of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Petit-Caremeì</hi> it is in fact a new creation of the preacher, wherein the
                    unction of paternal eloquence, which his mature age authorized him to assume, is
                    happily blended with all those gentle and persuasive attractions calculated to
                    make an impression upon the youthful mind. Marshal Villeroi having asked on the
                    part of the king for the manuscript of the preacher, Louis XV. learned by heart
                    the more beautiful passages of these sermons, which were the first he had heard.
                    Several passages, particularly in the discourse on the Humanity of the Great,
                    call to mind the verses of Racine, which, according to Voltaire, Massillon had
                    by heart; but these imitations are so original that even Voltaire himself has,
                    on more than one occasion, transfused them into his own verses. He had always on
                    his desk the <hi rend="italic">Petit-Carême,</hi> which he regarded as one of
                    the best models of eloquence in prose; and Buffon, in his discourse on style,
                    has pronounced the same judgment. Delineations of manners so lively, so natural,
                    and at the same time so touching, required only to be expressed in order to be
                    felt. ∙ When the voice of Massillon was no longer heard, he was read and
                    appreciated; and though the diffuseness of the style is rendered more sensible
                    in reading than in hearing, yet this has in no degree enfeebled its vivacity,
                    because the diction is at once the effusion of natural sentiment and the pure
                    expression of reason.</p>
                <p>When Massillon was promoted to the bishopric of Clermont on account of his
                    eminent talents, he had not wherewithal to pay his bulls, the expense of which
                    was defrayed by the regent. He was consecrated by Cardinal Fleury, in presence
                    of the king; and in the year 1719 he was received into the French Academy. But
                    he was far from being dazzled by these honours, and soon set out for his
                    diocese, which he only left, in 1721, to pronounce at St Denis the funeral
                    oration of the Duchess of Orleans. Massillon, though he had acquired the
                    episcopal dignity by great labour and success in preaching, did not think that
                    this afforded him any dispensation from ascending the pulpit to instruct the
                    people o’f his diocese; only he confined himself to familiar exhortations,
                    iwhich all could understand, and by which even the most ignorant could profit.
                    With regard to his sermons, which are so full of eloquence, he confessed to
                    Cardinal de la Rochefoucauld, his metropolitan, that the faithlessness of his
                    memory having caused him to discontinue preaching them, they had entirely
                    escaped from his recollection. The cardinal, however, exhorted him to revise
                    them, for the purpose of final correction, and at the same time to compose
                    instructions for the pastors of his diocese. The Bishop of Clermont followed
                    this advice, and preached, or rather read, those episcopal <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conferences,</hi> so full at once of earnestness and severity, in which,
                    notwithstanding his age, and the known qualities of his eloquence, he displays a
                    warmth and force which pastoral authority and zeal could alone have infused. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Discours Synodaux</hi> and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mandements</hi> are, on the other hand, grave instructions, conveyed in
                    language remarkable for simple and natural elegance. In a ritual, at once
                    judicious and useful, he combined all the observances and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194203852" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3852-0310"/>all the practices necessary
                    for the clergy of his diocese in ' the discharge of their ministerial
                    functions.</p>
                <p>The conduct of Massillon, as a pastor and bishop, corresponded to his zeal. He
                    abolished those indecent processions which ages of ignorance had until then
                    perpetuated amongst the people; and put down certain superstitious usages, of
                    which mention is made in the <hi rend="italic">Origines</hi> of Clermont. On the
                    subject of the bull <hi rend="italic">Unigenitus,</hi> respecting the liberties
                    of the Gallican church, he directed that, for the sake of peace, it should be
                    received; but he disapproved of the appeal, as contrary to the opinion of the
                    majority of the bishops. All his actions were characterized by a wise and
                    amiable moderation. At his countryhouse he took pleasure in assembling members
                    of the Oratory and Jesuits, whom he engaged in parties at chess, at the same
                    time enjoining them never to make war upon each other in any more serious
                    contest. His charitable was not less effective than his religious zeal. He
                    succoured the indigent with his pen as well as his credit. His letters on this
                    subject equalled the most touching of his discourses, by the feelings of
                    humanity which they raised, and the generous results which they produced. He is
                    said to have remonstrated against the injustice of the war of 1741; and it is
                    certain that he addressed the minister of the day on the excess of the imposts
                    laid on the province of Auvergne, of which he obtained a considerable
                    diminution. In a word, his whole life was a practical commentary on the divine
                    precepts which he had so eloquently enforced; and he died, as he had lived,
                    breathing sentiments of the most exalted piety, and leaving behind him neither
                    money nor debts. His death, which was occasioned by apoplexy, took place on the
                    18th of September 1742.</p>
                <p>The collection of the works of the Bishop of Clermont, made by his nephew, Father
                    Joseph Massillon, priest of the Oratory and prefect of the College of Riom, is
                    really the first. It contains, 1. Sermons to the number of nearly an hundred, of
                    which the <hi rend="italic">Petit-</hi><hi rend="italic">Carême</hi> discourses,
                    though the last in date, form the first in order; 2. Conférences Synodaux,
                    Mandements, et Discours Synodaux; 3. Paraphrase de Plusieurs Psaumes, thirty-one
                    in number; 4. Pensées sur differents Sujets de Morale et de Piété; 5. Discours
                    inédit sur le Danger de Mauvaises Lectures, followed by various other pieces; 6.
                    Fragment of the Sermon delivered at the Quinze-Vingts, in presence of the
                    Duchess of Orleans, forming part of the <hi rend="italic">Morceaux Choisies

                    Paris, 1812; 7. Rituel du Diocèse de Clermont; 8. Lettres, eight in number. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Eloge de Massillon</hi> by D’Alembert was read to the French
                    Academy in 1774, and printed in the first volume of the History of the Academy
                    in 1779. Besides this <hi rend="italic">Eloge,</hi> the reader may consult the
