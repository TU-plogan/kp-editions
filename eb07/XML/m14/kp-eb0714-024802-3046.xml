                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MARITIME</label>, something relating to or bounded by the
                    sea. Thus a maritime province or country is one bounded by the sea; and a
                    maritime kingdom is one that makes a considerable figure, or is very powerful at
                    sea.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Maritime Law</hi> is that branch of general jurisprudence
                    which has relation to navigation and intercourse at sea. By it are determined
                    all seafaring causes, all questions on contracts of freight, contracts for
                    repairs and furnishings to ships, contracts of bottomry and respondentia,
                    insurance, average and salvage, and all marine injuries and offences. This is
                    not the place to enter on any details respecting the objects of maritime law.
                    For these we must refer to other articles in the course of this work; and will
                    now confine ourselves to some observations on the subject of maritime law in
                    general, and the chief sources of that law.</p>
                <p>Land is capable of distinct appropriation; and we see its various portions
                    inhabited by communities, each living under its own peculiar government. But
                    upon the great common of the ocean all nations assemble, and have intercourse
                    together; and, as the Emperor Antoninus replied to Eudemon, “the law is the lord
                    of the sea” <hi rend="italic">(Dig·</hi> b. xiv. tit. 2, 1. 9). Whilst,
                    therefore, the municipal code of every state rests on principles which are more
                    or less peculiar to itself, maritime law is part of the law of nations, and
                    maritime questions ought to be determined on principles which are acknowledged
                    by every people. It is thus that we find so great an accordance of sentiment
                    among different nations on this branch of law; a mutual adoption of maritime
                    works, and the decisions of Scott and Bynkerschoeck, Roccus, Casaregis, and
                    Pothier, received as authority not in their own countries only, but throughout
                    the civilized world.</p>
                <p>This leads us to notice the principal sources of maritime law; and, first of all,
                    we shall speak of the Codes.</p>
                <p>The most ancient maritime laws in Europe were the <hi rend="italic">Rhodian
                    laws,</hi> which were held as the law of nations amongst the inhabitants of the
                    islands in the Aegean Sea. They were, in part at least, adopted by the Romans;
                    in whose code we also find various other maritime regulations. The navigation of
                    the Mediterranean by the ships of Venice, Genoa, and other states which rose on
                    the fall of the Roman empire, led to the compilation of a digest of rules for
                    regulating the navigation. This digestis called <hi rend="italic">II</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Consolato</hi><hi rend="italic">de Mare,</hi> and appears to have
                    been universally adopted on the continent in the course of the eleventh,
                    twelfth, and thirteenthaenturies. Next in order of time were the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ordinances</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Oleron</hi> and of <hi
                    rend="italic">Wisbeig.</hi> The origin and date of these codes are disputed,
                    but, generally speaking, they may be taken to be of the thirteenth century; and
                    they appear to have been long of authority in the Mediterranean, and also in the
                    Baltic Sea. The <hi rend="italic">Ordinances</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Hanse
                    Towns</hi> come next. They were first published at Lubec in 1597, and in 1614
                    were revised and enlarged in an assembly of deputies from the towns, held in the
                    same place. Next followed <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Guidon de
                    la Mer,</hi> originally framed at Rouen in Normandy. It is compiled from the
                    several ordonnances and codes which were then in observance in Europe; and
                    though its origin and date are not certainly known, yet it has been received as
                    of nearly equal authority with the ancient codes. Later in the order of time,
                    but above all the others in authority and extent, is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ordonnance</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Marine</hi> of Louis XIV. It is <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> digest of all that was fixed in the usages and customs of
                    maritime nations, or laid down in ancient codes; and it also determines, on
                    general principles, several points of maritime law till then unsettled. The last
                    code of maritime law to be here noticed is the <hi rend="italic">Code de
                    Commerce,</hi> which is a digest of the edicts of 1675 and 1681, and of the
                    jurisprudence of the great lawyers Pothier, Valin, and Emerigon.</p>
                <p>Next in authority to the ordonnances and customs of maritime states, are the
                    judgments of maritime and mercantile courts. We have already referred to the
                    most eminent of these; and, amongst them, the highest place is undoubtedly due
                    to the determinations of Sir William Scott in the high court of admiralty of
                    England, which are distinguished for their learning, elegance, and precision,
                    and are everywhere received with the greatest respect.</p>
                <p>The earliest collection of maritime laws in Scotland is that contained in
                    Balfour’s Practicks, entitled “The Sea lawis collectit furth of the actis of
                    parliament, the practiques and lawis of Oleron and the lawis of Wisbeig, and the
                    constitutionis of Francois king of France, 1543-1557. The jurisdiction of the
                    Scottish admiralty, indeed, was long very limited. It was confined to seafaring
                    causes, and in these it had no exclusive jurisdiction; maritime causes as well
                    as others being of old within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts, and
                    particularly within the jurisdiction of the justiciar, formerly "the supreme
                    judge in all suits whatsoever. (See <hi rend="italic">Leg. Burg.</hi> c. 27;
                    Pitcairn’s <hi rend="italic">Crim. Trials,</hi> vol. i. part i. p. 129, and part
                    ii. p. 93; and A. S. 16th January 1554.) In this last year we find that David
                    Kintore was judge of the admiralty. He was in all likelihood the author of the
                    book of maritime law referred to in Balfour’s Practicks, under the name <hi
                    rend="italic">of Lib. Kinlor.</hi> In the end of the same century, Alexander
                    King, advocate, was judge of the same court. He also wrote a book on maritime
                    law, which he entitled “Tractatus legum et consuetudinum navalium quae apud
                    omnes fere gentes in usu habentur.” (MS. Adv. Lib.) Wellwood’s Abridgment of all
                    Sea Lawes, London, 1613, is said by the learned author of the life of Melville
                    (M‘Crie’s <hi rend="italic">Melυ.</hi> vol. ii. p. 319) to have “the merit of
                    being the first regular treatise on maritime jurisprudence which appeared in
                    Britain but in forming this opinion, the works of both Kintore and King have
                    obviously been overlooked. King’s work has this further merit, that immediately
                    after it appeared the court of admiralty in Scotland rose into importance. By
                    the act 1609, c. 15, the court was declared a sovereign judicatory, and letters
                    of horning were allowed on its decrees. The reputation of the court being
                    sustained by a succession of eminent judges, amongst whom were Atcheson of
                    Glencairney, Roberton of Bedlay,and Lyon of Carse, all afterwards lords of
                    session, it began to extend its jurisdiction generally to mercantile, instead of
                    being, as before, confined to seafaring causes; and the above act was ratified
                    by 1681, c. 16, by which also the jurisdiction of the court was further
                    explicated and enlarged. By 6 Geo. IV. c. 120, however,jurisdiction in prize and
                    capture was withdrawn from the court, and vested in the admiralty of England;
                    and by 1 Will. IV. c. 69, the court was altogether abolished, and its remaining
                    jurisdiction transferred to the court of session and sheriff-court; the court of
                    justiciary having previously acquired, as of old, a co-ordinate jurisdiction in
                    crimes.</p>
