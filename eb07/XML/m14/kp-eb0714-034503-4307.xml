                <p><label type="entry">MEATH</label>, a maritime county in the province of Leinster
                    in Ireland, is bounded, on the north, by the counties of Cavan, Monaghan, and
                    Louth; on the cast, by the Irish sea and Dublin county; on the south, by the
                    county of Kildare; and on the west by that of Meath. Its superficial contents
                    amount to 567,127 acres, all of which are capable of cultivation, except 5600
                    acres of barren land, which would not repay the outlay expended on its
                    improvement.</p>
                <p>In the time of Ptolemy it formed part of the territory of the Eblani, whose
                    settlement extended from the Boyne to the Liffey. According to the accounts of
                    native writers, the district known by the name of Meath was of much greater
                    extent than at present. It comprehended the modern counties of Meath, Westmeath,
                    Longford, with parts of Cavan, Kildare, and the King’s County, and constituted
                    one of the five subordinate kingdoms into which the island was divided. At the
                    time of the landing of the English it was the property of the O’Melaghlin
                    family, from whom it was wrested by Henry II., who bestowed it on Hugh de Lacy,
                    to be holden by the service of fifty knights. This nobleman subdivided it into
                    twelve parts called baronies, because the persons to whom he granted those parts
                    were afterwards created barons. In this state it continued till the reign of
                    Henry VIII., when it was divided by act of parliament into the two counties of
                    Meath and Westmeath. The modern division of the county is into twelve baronies,
                    which have been formed into two districts, for the purposes of its civil
                    jurisdiction. The Boyne constitutes the line of demarcation between these
                    divisions. That of Kells, to the north-west of the'river, comprehends the
                    baronies of Slane, Morgallion, Kells, Demifore, Lune, and Navan; that of
                    Dunshaughlin, to the south-west, contains those of Duleek, Skreen, Ratoath,
                    Dunboyne, Deece, and Moyfenrath. The baronies of Deece, Duleek, Kells,
                    Moyfenrath, Navan, and Slane, are each divided into half baronies, distinguished
                    by the terms upper and lower, so that the county may be considered as divided
                    into eighteen great divisions, for the purposes of its internal government.
                    These baronial divisions are again subdivided into 137 parishes, and six
                    portions of parishes, the remaining parts of which extend into some of the
                    adjoining counties.</p>
                <p>According to the ecclesiastical division of Ireland this county constitutes the
                    greater portion of the diocese of the same name. There were formerly many
                    episcopal sees in Meath, all of which, except Kells and Duleek, which, however,
                    subsequently shared the same fate as the others, were consolidated previously to
                    the year 1152, when Cardinal Paparo settled the diocesan divisions of Ireland,
                    by authority from Pope Eugenius III. The seat of the see was then fixed at
                    Clonard. The bishopric of Clonmacnois was united to it by act of parliament in
                    1568. The bishop of Meath has no cathedral church; his residence has for a long
                    period been at Ardbraccan, which in the wars of 1641 was a castle of
                    considerable strength, but is now a modern mansion built with much taste. The
                    constitution of the diocese possesses many singularities. There is neither dean
                    nor chapter. The only dignitaries are the dean of Clonmacnois, and the
                    archdeacon of Meath. The want of a chapter is supplied by a synod, of which
                    every beneficed clergyman within the diocese is a member. This synod has a
                    common seal, which is lodged in the hands of members annually selected for its
                    custody. The bishopric is divided into twelve rural deaneries, and comprehends
                    224 parishes, of which, according to the ecclesiastical computation, 147 are in
                    the county of Meath; fifty-nine in Westmeath; sixteen in the King’s County; one
                    in Cavan; one in Longford; besides one part of a parish in Kildare. The bishop
                    of Meath takes precedence of all the other bishops in Ireland, and is a member
                    of the Privy Council in right of his see.</p>
                <p>From the level aspect of this county, it doesnot present such a variety of
                    picturesque views as many other districts; yet it is not without its
                    characteristic beauties. The banks of the Boyne, especially, present a
                    succession of prospects in which the undulating surface is richly ornamented
                    with the natural beauties of wood and water, studded by numerous buildings, both
                    ancient and modern. Few of the elevations of the ground are of sufficient height
                    to be termed hills, and none deserve the title of mountain, except perhaps
                    Scribogue and Lloyd in Kells barony; and even those, where cultivated, are
                    productive to their summits.</p>
                <p>The river Boyne enters the county at its south-western extremity, and intersects
                    it diagonally in a north-eastern direction, till it discharges itself into the
                    sea below Drogheda where it forms the boundary between the counties of Meath and
                    Louth. It receives the Blackwater at Navan. The Moynalty or Borora is a branch
                    of the Blackwater. The Nannywater discharges itself into the Irish sea. The
                    Ryewater forms part of the boundary between Dublin and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194204320" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4320-0346"/>Meath. The Boyne is navigable
                    for barges as far as Navan, whence a canal has been carried to Trim. The royal
                    canal touches the southern border of the county between Kilcock and Cion curry.
                    A projected canal, to traverse the county from south-east to north-west, has
                    never been executed. The sea-coast is confined to the short space between the
                    mouth of the Boyne and the stream of the Delvid, which is part of the boundary
                    of Dublin county. It presents a shelving strand, without a port of any
                    consequence. There is no sheet of water meriting the name of lake, except that
                    of Lough Sheelin, which bounds the county on the north, and the very
                    inconsiderable Lough of Lakefield in Demifore.</p>
                <p>The soil is extremely variable, being found of every quality, from a deep rich
                    loam to the lightest sandy texture; but that most generally to be met with is a
                    strong deep clay, resting on a substratum of limestone gravel. In some parts,
                    and even on the tops of the hills, as good earth has been found at the depth of
                    four feet as at the surface, so that the land in those favoured spots can never
                    be exhausted, because when the farmer begins to find his fields unproductive, he
                    has only by ploughing somewhat deeper to turn up a quantity of virgin earth,
                    whose productive qualities had hitherto lain dormant.</p>
                <p>The county is wholly included within the great central plain of floetz limestone,
                    which crosses Ireland in a broad band. The mineral productions are few, owing
                    partly to the character of the soil, and partly to that of the surface, which,
                    from its general flatness, prevents the interior from being explored to any
                    depth, without being impeded by subterraneous water. A copper mine was for some
                    time worked in Skreen barony, but the latter of the causes now mentioned put a
                    stop to the operations. Limestone of large scantling, and therefore well suited
                    for building purposes, and also susceptible of a high polish, is raised at
                    Ardbraccan. The Episcopal palace is built of this stone. It is white when fresh
                    from the chisel, but assumes a greyish hue from atmospherical exposure.
                    Argillaceous clay, which has been applied to the manufacture of coarse
                    earthen-ware, is raised in some places. In Slane barony coal-smut has been found
                    in abundance, at the edges of streams, where the soil has been washed away by
                    the action of the water; but coal has not yet been discovered. A chalybeate
                    spring of some repute for the cure of diseases arising from debility, has been
                    discovered at Knock, in Morgallion barony.</p>
                <p>The quantity of bog is very small; but in stating this fact, it must be observed
                    that there is a very extraordinary difference in the statements of the two most
                    accredited writers regarding its extent. Thompson, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >County Survey,</hi> published in 1802, under the auspices of the Dublin
                    Society, fixes the quantity of unreclaimed bog at 42,000 acres, whereas
                    Griffith, in his return to parliament, on the valuation of Ireland, in 1832,
                    makes the whole of the barren mountain land and bog together to amount only to
                    5600 acres.</p>
                <p>The population of a district enjoying so many of the natural advantages suited to
                    the maintenance of human existence, is by no means so great as might have been
                    anticipated from this cause. The average of inhabitants, compared with the
                    superficial extent, is but as one to 3 j, whilst in the adjoining counties of
                    Louth and Armagh it is as 1 to 1⅜. The increase of population appears in the
                    following table, which presents the results of investigations at different
                    periods :—</p>

                    instruction, cannot be stated here, because it had been made up according to
                    dioceses, instead of counties.</p>
                <p>Meath returned no fewer than fourteen representatives to the Irish parliament;

                <p>Of the numbers specified in the latter of these returns, 1280 were Protestants of
                    the Established Church, 8817 were Roman Catholics, and five Dissenters; the
                    religious persuasion of the remaining 205 could not be ascertained. Of the 272
                    schools in which these children were instructed, thirty-one, containing 1275
                    pupils, were supported by grants of public money; thirty-eight, containing 1937
                    pupils, by the voluntary contributions of societies or individuals; and the
                    remainder, amounting to 203 schools, affording education to 7195 children, were
                    supported wholly by the fees of the pupils. The diocesan school for the sees of
                    Meath and Ardagh was fixed by the commissioners of education to be kept at
                    Mullingar or Westmeath. That of Meath diocese had been long kept in Trim. There
                    are charter-schools at Trim and Ardbraccan. A school was endowed at Navanby
                    abequest of Alderman Preston in 1686. A large free school, on the Lancasterian
                    system, has been established at Oldcasto, by a bequest of Mr. Gibson of
                    London.</p>
                <p>The population is chiefly engaged in agriculture. The soil being principally
                    composed of a deep rich earth, the deepest ploughing is considered as the best
                    tillage; and from the great tendency to weeds, the farmer, who keeps his ground
                    in the most cleanly state, and at the same time most friable and pulverized, is
                    considered as having it in the most profitable condition. A complete summer’s
                    fallow at stated intervals is considered by the most judicious farmers as
                    absolutely necessary to keep the land thoroughly clean; every other attempt to
                    eradicate the -weeds, by means of clover, vetches, or any other umbraceous green
                    crop having proved ineffectual. Planting potatoes, even without manure, is
                    considered as a good method of fallowing where cleansing is the only object. In
                    the neighbourhood of villages it is a common practice for farmers to throw open
                    the field which he intends to fallow to the cottagers, who furnish manure and
                    plant their potatoes on it. If the ground be in good heart he charges them at
                    the rate of somewhat more than his <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204333"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-4333-0347"/>own rent, which is termed “paying the standing
                    rent ;” but if poor, he makes no charge. The most intelligent farmers break up
                    their fallows before Christmas as lightly as possible; yet, in order to reverse
                    the surface at the close of the spring work, it is cross-harrowed, the weeds are
                    gathered and burned, and if necessary, it is manured and gravelled. The next
                    ploughing, called the “gorrowing,” is performed by six horses or bullocks
                    turning up the ground in high narrow ridges across the former lines. In this
                    state the land lies during the remainder of the summer, and then receives a
                    ploughing called “stretching,” which runs as the ridges of sown corn are
                    intended to lie. The grain is generally sown broad-cast and harrowed in. With
                    respect to the rotation of crops, or system of croping, no restriction is
                    imposed on the tenant Every one is permitted to raise that kind of grain from
                    which he expects to derive the greatest produce.</p>
                <p>The crops usually cultivated, are wheat, oats, barley, bear, rye, meslin, clover,
                    flax, potatoes, cabbage, rape, turnips, and peas. The red wheat is preferred by
                    most as agreeing best with the soil, and having a thinner rind, bearing the
                    change of season better, and being less apt to lodge than the white. The latter
                    is cultivated on the lighter and more gravelly soils. It comes in earlier, but
                    is more liable to injury from the weather or mildew. Oats are produced in the
                    greatest variety and of the finest samples; they are sown in the proportion of
                    three to one as compared with other crops, and command a certain sale at the
                    grain markets. Barley is also in much repute. It is sown on the richest land,
                    and requires the nicest tillage; but there is always a brisk demand for it, and
                    it is considered as one of the most profitable crops. Bear is a good deal sown,
                    particularly after potatoes; it is also a profitable crop where it succeeds, but
                    it is uncertain. The straw makes excellent fodder for young cattle. Rye, by
                    itself or mixed with wheat, when it is called meslin, is chiefly ground into
                    whole meal for domestic consumption. Flax is mostly sown in small patches for
                    the use of the farmer’s family, and seldom offered in quantities for sale; it
                    grows strong and luxuriant, so as to be seldom fitted for the finer fabrics.
                    When a field is laid down for grass, those parts of it on which flax had been
                    grown produce the most luxuriant herbage, and shew the earliest verdure in the
                    following year; if sheep, which are of all animals the greatest epicures, be let
                    in upon it, they invariably settle on the part so laid down; this appearance of
                    luxuriance and early verdure is visible for at least two years. Rape is grown
                    with the greatest success on bog which has been reclaimed by burning. Red clover
                    is much used as a renovating crop; white clover is seldom sown except on land
                    laid down for pasture.</p>
                <p>The quantity of artificial grass sown is very small, as compared with the
                    extensive tracts producing natural grasses; the depth and richness of the soil
                    throughout almost the whole of the county, and its tendency to moisture without
                    being absolutely wet, making it throw up such a coat of nourishing herbage, as
                    is scarcely to be equalled in Ireland. In other counties there are districts
                    which far exceed the richest lands here; such are the Golden Vale in Tipperary,
                    and the corcass lands in Limerick. But no other districtcan exhibit 560,000
                    acres situated together, of such excellent quality, and so appropriate to every
                    purpose of tillage and pasture as Meath. It is, generally speaking, more
                    friendly to the latter kind of agriculture, and consequently was almost wholly
                    applied to grazing, until the legislative measures adopted by the Irish
                    parliament for the encouragement of tillage, induced many to break up the large
                    tracts which for ages had continued untouched by the ploughshare. The superior
                    excellence of the beef reared here over that of any other district has made the
                    county proverbial for its feeding. All the old pastures are composed of grasses
                    of the best kinds. Graziers seldom think of procuring any particular species,
                    from an opinion that the land, after three years, will revert to its natural
                    herbage, even though grasses of other kinds had been sown upon it when laid
                    down. Dry gravelling soils throw up a rich coat of white clover, though no red
                    has been sown; and grounds of a clayey nature, when drained and manured with
                    limestone gravel, often exhibit a similar tendency. Natural meadows are to be
                    met everywhere; few farms, whatever be their size, are without a sufficiency for
                    the holder’s use. The artificial grasses chiefly cultivated are clover and
                    trefoil. Much attention is paid by the graziers to the treatment of their
                    feeding stock. The first week in May the pastures are generally opened for the
                    summer stock, which are seldom reared here, the land being deemed too valuable
                    to be given up to young cattle. Beasts of this description are brought from
                    Connaught or Munster. When they arrive they are bled and turned into the pasture
                    field where they remain till completely fattened, each field being stocked at
                    once with its full complement. They are then sold partly in the Dublin market
                    for the consumption of the metropolis or for exportation to Liverpool, and
                    partly to buyers from the northern ports, chiefly for the supply of the
                    colonies. The slaughtering season commences in September. Some graziers put a
                    few fat sheep to graze amongst the neat cattle; but the practice is generally
                    condemned, from an opinion that it injures the “proof” of the beasts, by which
                    is meant the quantity of inside fat, the butcher’s test of high feeding, as the
                    sheep feed on the sweetest grass; of course it ultimately hurts the grazier, as
                    the north country butchers avoid those whose beasts do not “die well,” as they
                    express it, and are sure to give a preference to those who are known to have
                    good proof beasts. Bullocks are fed in great abundance. The sheep, like the
                    black cattle, are seldom natives; they are brought in at the October fair of
                    Ballinasloe. Lands newly laid down are generally appropriated to the rearing of
                    lambs for the Dublin market. The marshes of Rossmin and Emla, on the Moynalty
                    river feed great numbers of horses during summer. These marshes admit of easy
                    drainage, but the proprietors deem them more profitable in their present
                    state.</p>
                <p>Almost every farmer, occupying from thirty to one hundred acres, keeps a few
                    cows, the produce of which both in milk and butter that remains after supplying
                    his own family, is sent to market. There are also a number of dairy farms in
                    Dunboyne and Ratoath, in which the landlord supplies the land, houses and stock;
                    the tenant furnishes labour and utensils, and pays for the mowing and hay
                    making; the cows, when they go backward in their milk, are charged by the
                    landlord at his own expense. The cream only is churned; the skimmed milk being
                    mixed with butter milk is sold to the Dublin chandlers who retail it to the
                    poor. The dairy cows are invariably housed from the first week in December till
                    May; during which time they are sent out to graze in the day time and fed at
                    night upon hay. Cheese is very seldom made and only for domestic use.</p>
                <p>The quantity of natural wood throughout the county is but small, but the
                    plantations in demesnes, and about gentlemen’s seats, are numerous and thriving.
                    The trees most usually met with are ash, elm, sycamore, lime, and larch. Scotch
                    and spruce fir are less common. Gross oak is very scarce, the principal growth
                    of it being at Lougherew, in Demifore. There are many osieries, of from two to
                    ten acres each, the produce of which is sold to the basket-makers of Dublin.</p>
                <p>The manufactures are chiefly confined to the making of sacking from tow, of
                    coarse linens in the neighbourhood of Drogheda, where the cotton manufacture is
                    also carried on to some extent, and of linens of a texture somewhat finer in the
                    western baronies. Some coarse frieze is also manufactured for home consumption.
                    There are paper manufactories, distilleries, and breweries, of considerable
                    magnitude. Tanyards are to be met with in several places.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204346" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4346-0348"/>
                <p>The chief outlet for the produce of the county is Drogheda. There are good
                    markets for grain and provisions at Trim and Navan, and extensive flour-mills on
                    the Boyne and Blackwater. But on the whole Meath cannot be considered to be a
                    manufacturing county.</p>
                <p>There are several mansions in this county of great size and splendour, surrounded
                    by highly improved demesnes, and numerous seats of resident gentlemen. The farm
                    houses are generally of very inferior construction, formed of the earth or clay
                    taken off the surface of the spot on which the house is to be built; hence the
                    floor is commonly several inches below the level of the soil, and consequently
                    damp and unwholesome. The habitations of the labourers and cotters are of a
                    description still worse, being built of mud, and with sunken floors, insomuch
                    that it is found necessary to form a hole in the floor as a receptacle for the
                    water that comes in at the door, or oozes through the foundation. This
                    description, however, is not universally applicable. The owners of some estates
                    have provided comfortable residences for their labourers, to be held by them on
                    moderate terms. The furniture, food, and clothing, is of a character similar to
                    that of their habitations. In many parts the lower classes suffer extremely from
                    the want of fuel; bog-land being extremely scarce, and the expense of carriage
                    precluding the purchase of coal, which must be drawn from Dublin or Drogheda.
                    When coal can be had upon moderate terms, another objection .to its use is the
                    want of grates, as it will not burn on the hearth like turf; although this
                    difficulty has been overcome in some places by the ingenious contrivance of
                    placing two bricks edgeways and parallel to each other, at about eight or ten
                    inches asunder, by which means a current of air is produced sufficient to
                    support combustion. Though the English language is universally spoken, the
                    peasantry still prefer the use of Irish in their communications with each other.
                    Books of devotion in the latter language, but printed in the Roman character,
                    are much used. It is a proverbial expression here, as also in some other parts
                    of Ireland, “If you have to plead for your life, plead in Irish.” A fund exists
                    here derived from bequests of Dr. Sterne, bishop of Clogher, and Dr. Chetwood,
                    the income of which is applied to apprentice the children of protestant parents
                    to masters and mistresses of the same persuasion. Another bequest of a gentleman
                    of the name of Charleton, disposes of the interest of L.900, in marriage
                    portions of six guineas to labourers’ sons under thirty who marry labourers’
                    daughters under forty, provided they have resided a year previous to marriage in
                    the same parish, and have had the consent of the parents on both sides.
                    Two-thirds of this singular bequest is appropriated to Meath, and the remainder
                    to Longford.</p>
                <p>Amongst the most ancient remains of antiquity may be mentioned the round or
                    pillar towers at Kells and Donogh-more. The former is ninety-nine feet high, and
                    has four small apertures near the top facing the four cardinal points of the
                    compass. The latter is remarkable for having a representation of the Saviour on
                    the cross, carved on the key-stone over the entrance. At Kells and St.
                    Kiarans’are two fine stone crosses. At New Grange, near Slane, is another
                    relique equally extraordinary, consisting of an artificial cavern Or underground
                    gallery in form of a cross seventy-one feet in its greatest length, twenty feet
                    between the extremities of the arms of the cross, and eleven feet in its
                    greatest height. It is surrounded by a tumulus or hillock raised by art, which
                    is surrounded by a circle of huge unhewn stones set upright. It is supposed to
                    have been either a place of Druidical worship or a burying-place; and two
                    skeletons uncovered with earth were found in it, when first opened. The Hill of
                    Tarah is also worthy of note, as being the place where the kings of Ireland were
                    crowned, and where the states of the island held their triennial assemblies,
                    called the Fez of Tarah. The traces of some of the positions supposed to have
                    been connected with this ancient custom, are said by some antiquaries to be
                    still discoverable on it. Near it is a large rath. Other raths are to be seen at
                    Lismullen, Odder, and Ringlestoun. Columbkill’s house, a stone-roofed crypt or
                    cell at St. Kiarans, is said to be the most ancient building of that material in
                    Ireland.</p>
                <p>The ruins of monastic buildings scattered throughout the country are too numerous
                    to admit even of recapitulation. Trim had seven monastic institutions; Kells,
                    Killeen, Du-lek, and Skryne, three each. Several of these buildings have been
                    converted into parish churches.</p>
                <p>The ruins of ancient castles are not less numerous. Some of them have been
                    altered into modern residences. Of these Slane castle is amongst the finest,
                    both for architectural structure and grandeur of situation on a richly wooded
                    elevation overhanging the Boyne. It was the favourite residence of King George
                    IV. during his visit to Ireland in 1821. Killeen castle, in addition to its
                    claims on the score of antiquity, has been rendered splendidly memorable by its
                    present proprietor, the Earl of Fingal, a Roman Catholic nobleman, who, during
                    the disastrous period of the rebellion of 1798, threw it open as an asylum for
                    the well-affected of every description. The clergymen, both Protestant and
                    Catholic, performed divine service there, each to their respective
                    congregations, under the same roof, as long as the danger existed.</p>
                <p>Trim, the county town, situated on the Boyne, presents an appearance very
                    unsuitable to the metropolis of a county so wealthy and populous. But though now
                    a place of very inferior note, it was once amongst the principal of the
                    Anglo-Irish towns. In the war of 1641, it was besieged by Cromwell. The ruins of
                    its monastic establishments have been already noticed. Its present public
                    buildings are, the Protestant church, two Roman Catholic chapels, the court
                    house, the market house, the county jail, the charter school, and the barracks.
                    A Corinthian pillar was erected here in 1817, in honour of the Duke of
                    Wellington, who was born at Dan-gar castle in this county. The population of
                    Trim in 1831, amounted only to 3282 souls. The following are the names and
                    number of inhabitants of the other towns in this county, the population of which
                    exceeds one thousand souls, viz Navan, 4416; Kells, 4326; Athboy, 1959;
                    Oldcasde, 1531; Duleek, 1217.</p>
