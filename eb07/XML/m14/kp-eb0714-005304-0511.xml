                <p><label type="entry">MALAGA</label>, a city of Spain, in the kingdom of Granada,
                    and province of Andalusia. There are few spots more beautiful, and few regions
                    more fertile, than that in which this place is situated. It is on the sea-coast,
                    on a rich and well-watered plain, sheltered by high mountains from the northerly
                    and easterly winds, and open to the genial influence of the sun and the south
                    and west winds, which have created a climate nearly similar to that of some of
                    the tropical islands.</p>
                <p>Although it is beautiful and fertile, it is far from being healthy. It is subject
                    to epidemic fevers, to which, at various periods, numbers of its inhabitants
                    have fallen victims. In one of these visitations which, in the year 1804,
                    afflicted all the Mediterranean shores, this city was deprived, within three
                    months, of more than 21,000 of its inhabitants.</p>
                <p>As this portion of Spain grows the productions more peculiarly called tropical,
                    they are deserving of some attention. Sugar has been cultivated here from a very
                    distant period; the canes were brought from the eastern regions, as appears by
                    authentic memorials, as early as the ninth century, and were then made into
                    sugar, with very little difference in the process from that which is now
                    practised. It is probable that the canes, originally from Chaldaea or Arabia,
                    and long propagated near Malaga, were at length transplanted to the Canary
                    Islands, and from them ultimately to the warmest regions of America, where they
                    have been extended till they have supplied Europe with one of the most
                    delightful and salubrious substances that is used for human aliment. The state
                    of hostility in which Europe was long involved, as it raised the expense of
                    conveying the sugar and other tropical productions from the place of their
                    growth to the place of consumption, gave great inducement to the cultivation of
                    such articles where the expense of war-freights, insurances, and risks, might be
                    avoided; and during that period there was a constant increase in the plantations
                    of sugar, coffee, cotton, and similar productions in the vicinity of Malaga. The
                    return of peace will naturally affect those agricultural pursuits, and reduce
                    them within those confined limits which they will be enabled to supply without
                    coming into competition with the cultivators at a distance, who, from conducting
                    their operations on a larger scale, are enabled to dispose of their produce on
                    much lower terms, as well as to bear the additional expense of a longer
                    conveyance.</p>
                <p>The prosperity of the district round Malaga depends, however, more upon what may
                    be called its indigenous productions, than upon the cultivation of the rarer
                    articles to which we have adverted. The vine flourishes most luxuriantly, and
                    its fruit dries into different kinds of raisins, according to the different
                    periods of the year in which they ripen, and, when dried, becomes an important
                    source of wealth to the cultivators. The wines which their vineyards yield are
                    of various kinds, and mostly in very high request. That which is usually called
                    mountain wine is most in demand for European markets; but a considerable
                    quantity of a dry wine, like sherry, is made, the great consumption of which is
                    in the American dominions of Spain. Oranges, lemons, figs, almonds, and nuts,
                    are gathered in great quantities, and furnish a considerable portion of the
                    exports of this city. In Malaga there are some manufactures, and in the country
                    whose commodities find a vent through its port there are more, which form
                    articles of export to America. Silk goods of various kinds, linens, sail-cloth,
                    leather, and cordage, are shipped to America, as well as some goods brought for
                    that purpose from Russia, Germany, England, and France. Malaga may be considered
                    as the third port in Spain. Cadiz is by far the first; and Barcelona was the
                    next, but the long occupation of that port and its surrounding country by the
                    French destroyed much of its commerce, and renders it doubtful whether Malaga
                    does not now equal it.</p>
                <p>There is, properly speaking, no harbour; but a pier, extending into the sea
                    nearly 1500 yards, gives security to shipping; and the largest vessels may load
                    or discharge their cargoes close to the wharfs of the pier. The customhouse,
                    near the pier, is a magnificent building, and of an extent far beyond the
                    present wants of the trade of the port.</p>
                <p>Malaga is fortified, but its defences are of little avail, as they are commanded
                    by heights around them, the occupation of which by artillery would insure the
                    surrender of the city. The most beautiful object in this city is the Almeida or
                    public walk, bordered with trees, having splendid houses on both sides, but at a
                    competent distance, and a very superb fountain of white marble, admirably
                    adorned with good sculpture. The cathedral church, though of a mixed kind of
                    architecture, is a very imposing mass of building, with two lofty towers at the
                    western entrance. It is said to be of the same dimensions within as St Paul’s in
                    London; but, like all Catholic churches, the interior is far more exquisitely
                    adorned and more beautifully finished. The roof is supported by lofty pillars
                    with arches, and is divided into compartments, which are well painted, so as to
                    resemble the sky. The high altar and the pulpits are of the most beautiful
                    flesh-coloured marble. The choir is a most curious specimen of carving in wood.
                    There are about fifty stalls, some of cedar, others of mahogany, and all richly
                    carved with figures of various saints; which has induced some Spanish artists to
                    call it the eighth wonder of the world. There are two fine organs in this
                    church, which add much to its internal beauty. The pipes project from the
                    instrument, and toward their termination are widened, and the ends curved, so as
                    to represent a row of trumpets.</p>
                <p>The cathedral, as well as some other churches and convents, are rich in statues
                    and valuable paintings by native artists. The encouragement given to the fine
                    arts has always distinguished the inhabitants of Malaga; and there is, of long
                    standing, a society for the cultivation of science and the study of antiquities.
                    No place affords a better field for the pursuits of the antiquary. The
                    Carthaginians, the Romans, the Goths, and the Moors, have each contributed a
                    portion of the buildings, the remains of which are profusely scattered about,
                    and afford high delight to diligent investigators. The present number of its
                    inhabitants does not exceed 50,000, as it has not recovered the loss of
                    population which it suffered from the epidemic fever of 1804. The longitude of
                    the mole of Malaga, by observations made in 1817, is 4. 24. 15. west from
                    London, and the latitude 36. 43.30. north. Upon this mole a revolving light has
                    been recently constructed, which may be clearly distinguished at the distance of
                    about six leagues.</p>
