                <p><label type="entry">MALTE-BRUN, or rather</label>, as he was called in his native
                    country, Malthe-Conrad Bruun, was born at Thister, in the province of Jutland,
                    in Denmark, on the 12th of August 1775. His father, formerly a captain of
                    dragoons, was counsellor of justice and commissioner of domains.</p>
                <p>The latter watched over the education of his son with great care, and the
                    excellent dispositions manifested by the young Conrad in his studies, determined
                    his father to educate him for the church. At the university of Copenhagen, where
                    he took his degrees, he followed his theological studies in submission to his
                    father’s desire; but literature was his chief delight. Endowed with a great
                    facility of learning languages, and apprehending the niceties of inflexion, and
                    the shades of delicacy by which they are distinguished, he was soon enabled to
                    write French with a facility, an elegance, and vigour, which no other foreigner
                    ever acquired, and which placed him in the first rank of French authors.</p>
                <p>Though timid and reserved in conversation, he was bold and passionate in his
                    writings. He proved this in the first pamphlet which he published, under the
                    title of Wakeren, or the Alarm Bell, the political sentiments of which drew down
                    a legal condemnation upon the author.</p>
                <p>The reputation which he had acquired determined him to abandon the ecclesiastical
                    order for that of the bar. The study of the law developed his independence of
                    opinion and his enthusiasm for liberty. In 1795 and 1796, he edited a periodical
                    which he entitled The Aristocrat’s Catechism, in which the public authorities
                    found ground for commencing a process against him, which obliged him to fly to
                    the island of Hvn, belonging to Sweden. During his retirement, he composed
                    several poetical pieces of great merit. After a short sojourn in the land of his
                    exile, he obtained leave to return to Copenhagen. His first care was to publish
                    his poetical essays. This collection had all the success which he could wish;
                    but as he never ceased to assert his country’s right to that freedom which,
                    under the administration of Bernstorff, she seemed on the point of obtaining,
                    the party in power, interested in opposing reform, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200693" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0693-0067"/>characterised the young poet
                    as a discontented and revolutionary spirit. The hostility of his enemies again
                    menaced him in 1799, on the appearance of a bitter political satire entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Tria</hi><hi rend="italic">juncta</hi><hi rend="italic">in
                    uno.</hi> He therefore hastily sought an asylum in Sweden, where his reputation
                    secured him protection, and his talents won him respect; and when the sentence
                    of the Danish tribunals had condemned him to exile, he resolved to adopt France
                    as his country.</p>
                <p>He had been little more than three years in France when he commenced, along with
                    Mentelle, a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Géographie Mathématique, Physique.,
                    et Politique,</hi> in sixteen volumes. It was the first work of its class which
                    combined force of expression and elegance of style with variety of description
                    and minuteness of detail. Before its appearance, the geographical works of
                    France were mere compilations, destitute alike of judgment and of taste,
                    uninteresting in narrative, and repulsive in detail. The public understood, that
                    although Malte-Brun contributed only a third part to the compilation of the,new
                    geography, its success was mainly to be attributed to his talents; and the
                    proprietors of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Debats,</hi> from the celebrity
                    he had acquired by this publication, earnestly solicited him to become one of
                    its editors. His contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Debats,</hi>
                    on voyages, geography, history, languages, antiquities, physical science,
                    morals, and literature, compose a miscellany at once interesting and
                    voluminous.</p>
                <p>At the period when France was preparing to establish in Poland a barrier to
                    secure Western Europe against the preponderating power of Russia, Malte-Brun
                    conceived the design of bringing this country into notice; a country which had
                    twice fallen a sacrifice to iniquitous power, and which, divided between two of
                    its natural allies, no longer possessed a geographical existence. The interest
                    which the Poles excited secured a favourable reception for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tableau</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Pologne·,</hi> a work which, although it
                    cost the learned geographer only six months’ labour, contains a rapid sketch of
                    the geography, history, manners, and resources of the ancient territory of
                    Poland.</p>
                <p>It was in the course of the year 1808 that Malte-Brun executed the plan which he
                    had conceived, for contributing to diffuse a taste for geography in France, by
                    the publication of a periodical especially devoted to this important branch of
                    human knowledge. He then published, in concert with Μ. Eyries, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">des Voyages, de la</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Géographie, et</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire;</hi> and the success of this attempt led to the publication of other
                    periodical works on geographical science.</p>
                <p>The publication of these annals, and his co-operation in the editorship of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Journal des Debats,</hi> did not prevent Malte-Brun from
                    finding time to erect that monument to geography which he proposed to leave as
                    his most durable title to scientific and literary reputation; we allude to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Precis</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Géographie
                    Universelle.</hi> The first volume of this work appeared in 1810, and the sixth
                    in 1825. He had only prepared the first five or six leaves of the seventh
                    volume, when he ceased for ever from his labours, leaving the last two volumes,
                    containing Western Europe, to be completed by others. An English translation of
                    Malte-Brun’s Geography has been published at Edinburgh, in nine volumes 8vo.</p>
                <p>Great, indeed, must have been the erudition which enabled him to compose the
                    first six volumes of this work. The plan is no doubt too vast for one man to
                    execute, without leaving some parts weak; still these are comparatively few in
                    number, and no part of what he left unfinished has been better done to this
                    day.</p>
                <p>The constant and harassing fatigue attending his laborious employment at length
                    exhausted his strength. For three days he had determined on confining himself to
                    his room; but, absorbed by his passion for science, and the intensity of his
                    desire to be useful, he sketched, two hours before his death, the analysis of a
                    scientific work for the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Debats</hi>; and, on the
                    14 th of December 1826, an attack of apoplexy suddenly carried him off.</p>
