                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    transmigration of the soul of a man after death into the body of some other
                    animal. Pythagoras and his followers held, that after death men’s souls passed
                    into other bodies of different kinds, according to the manner of life which they
                    had led. If they had been <pb break="no" facs="nls:194208987"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-8987-0705"/>vicious, they were imprisoned in the bodies of
                    miserable beasts, there to do penance for several ages, at the expiration of
                    which they returned again to animate human forms. But if they lived virtuously,
                    the body of some happier brute, or even of a human creature, was destined to be
                    their new habitation. What led Pythagoras into this opinion was, the persuasion
                    which he had that the soul was not of a perishable nature, and from which he
                    concluded that it must remove into some other body upon its abandoning its
                    actual habitation. Lucan treats this doctrine as a kind of officious lie,
                    contrived to mitigate the apprehension of death, by persuading men that they had
                    changed their lodging, and only ceased to live in order to begin a new life.
                    Reuchlin denies this doctrine, and maintains that the metempsychosis of
                    Pythagoras implied nothing more than a similitude of manners, desires, and
                    studies, which formerly existed in some person deceased, and were subsequently
                    revived in another. Thus, when it was said that Euphorbus was revived in
                    Pythagoras, no more was meant than that the martial virtue which had shone in
                    Euphorbus at the time of the Trojan war, was now in some measure revived in
                    Pythagoras, by reason of the great respect he bore to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >athletae.</hi> For those people, wondering how a philosopher should be so much
                    taken with men of the sword, he palliated the matter by saying that the soul of
                    Euphorbus, meaning thereby his genius, disposition, and inclinations, were
                    revived in him; and this gave occasion to the report that the soul of Euphorbus,
                    who perished in the Trojan war, had transmigrated into Pythagoras. Ficin us
                    asserts that what Plato said of the migration of a human soul into a brute, is
                    allegorically said, and to be understood, only of those manners, affections, and
                    habits which have degenerated into a beastly nature by vice. Serranus, though he
                    allows some force to this interpretation, yet rather inclines to understand the
                    metempsychosis as meaning a resurrection. Pythagoras is said to have borrowed
                    the notion of a metempsychosis from the Egyptians; but others maintain that he
                    received it from the ancient Brahmins. It is still retained amongst the Banians
                    and other idolaters of India and China, and forms the principal foundation of
                    their religion; indeed, so bigoted are they to this tenet, that they not only
                    forbear eating any thing which has life, but many of them even refuse to defend
                    themselves against wild beasts. They burn no wood, lest some little animalcule
                    should be consumed in it; and are so very charitable, that they will redeem from
                    the hands of strangers any animals which they find ready to be killed.</p>
