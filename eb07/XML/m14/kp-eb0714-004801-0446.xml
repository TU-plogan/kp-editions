                <p><label type="entry">MAJORCA</label>, or, as called by the Spaniards, Mallorca, an
                    island in the Mediterranean Sea, of the group anciently distinguished by the
                    name of the Baleares, on account of the great reputation of the inhabitants as
                    slingers. According to D’Anville, these islands were first settled by a colony
                    of Phoenicians, who transferred them to the Carthaginians, and, after that
                    republic had been conquered, they were subdued by the Romans, under whose
                    dominion they continued till the dissolution of that empire. When the Moors
                    overran Spain, the island came into the possession of that race under one of
                    their chiefs, who assumed the title of king; but afterwards, upon the conquest
                    of Granada by herdinand, it formed a province of the kingdom of Spain.</p>
                <p>Majorca, thelargest island of the group, is situated in north latitude between
                    39° 15'and 39° 57', and in east longitude between 2° 9' and 3° 20'. It is about
                    100 miles from the nearest coast of Spain, and 130 from Algiers on the African
                    shore. Its figure is an irregular rhomboid, and its area. according to Toffino,
                    is 1360 square miles. The island is in general lofty, with high ranges of
                    mountains covering the whole from the middle to the northern coast, and so
                    closely connected as to leave only a number of deep valleys and gullies between
                    them, bordered by precipices. Of these mountains the most westerly and most
                    remarkable is a high peak, called by the natives <hi rend="italic">Puig de
                    Galatzo,</hi> 2000 feet above the level of the sea, which stands in latitude 39°
                    36'. The highest mountains, however, are those on the northern side, called the
                    <hi rend="italic">Silla de Torellas,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Puig
                    Major,</hi> or Great Peak. There are several others, but they are less
                    elevated.</p>
                <p>From the middle of the island to the south coast, the surface is much lower than
                    on the north; but it presents several hills and agreeable prospects. The land is
                    finely variegated by corn fields, vineyards, olive woods, orchards, and meadows.
                    The soil on the hills and mountains is rich and fertile, in the valleys moist
                    and even marshy, and on the shore are tracts of sand and of morasses. There are
                    no very extensive woods, but sufficient, consisting chiefly of dwarf trees, to
                    supply fuel. There are no considerable rivers, but many small brooks, and a
                    great abundance of springs; so that there is no scarcity of good water. A large
                    lake, or rather a marsh, is formed by two small rivers, called Al-bufera, on the
                    north coast, near the Bay of Alcudia. It is separated from the sea by a narrow
                    tongue of land; but in summer the heat nearly exhales the water, when the
                    environs are thereby rendered very unhealthy. The climate is mild, agreeable,
                    and healthy in general. The heat of summer is rarely excessive, being cooled by
                    the sea breezes. The winter is temperate, and not excessive in its variations.
                    The thermometer of Reaumur usually stands from 10° to 14°. Snow and ice are
                    almost unknown.</p>
                <p>The island has no other division than into communes or parishes; but it contains
                    one city, thirty-four towns, and twenty-six villages, besides many hamlets. The
                    inhabitants are 164,500, all rigidly adhering to the Roman Catholic church,
                    under a bishop, with a cathedral or palma, and eighty churches in various parts
                    of the island, and many monasteries and nunneries. By the accounts of 1797, it
                    appears there were no less than 1326 regular clergy, 1002 members of monastic
                    orders, and 529 females in nunneries; but they are said to have diminished since
                    that period.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants resemble the Spaniards of Catalonia, both in their complexion and
                    features. In the towns the Castilian language is generally spoken; but the
                    common people use a tongue which is a medley compounded of Limosin, Greek,
                    Latin, Spanish, and Arabic.</p>
                <p>The chief, indeed almost the exclusive occupation, of the inhabitants is
                    agriculture. According to the statistics of Arguiles, the condition of the
                    population is given, viz. 513 nobles, 3826 labouring proprietors, 2223 tenants
                    cultivators, 14,738 agricultural labourers, 3175 artisans and poor labourers,
                    155 merchants and traders, 413 officers of government, and 2270 domestic and
                    other servants. The value of the whole wealth of the island, by the same
                    minister, is stated to be L.l,664,636, distributed thus: Value of the land and
                    crops, L.1,375,600; of the animals, L.180,844; of the product of those
                    manufactures made of vegetable substances, L.53,884; of those made of animal
                    substances, L.20,965; of those made of mineral substances, L.28,340; and of the
                    products of the arts and of commerce, L.5000.</p>
                <p>The produce of corn is barely sufficient for the food of the inhabitants. The.
                    average growth of wheat is about 100,000 quarters, of barley 356,000, of oats
                    25,000, and of pulse 21,000; but neither rye nor maize is cultivated. In wet
                    seasons, the corn harvest sometimes nearly fails, when the scarcity of grain is
                    severely felt. The produce of culinary vegetables is most abundant, consisting
                    of beans, peas, melons, pumpkins, onions, garlic, and the various<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194200459" xml:id="kp-eb0714-0459-0049"/> kinds of capsicums and
                    tornatos. As much of hemp and flax is grown as is required for the inhabitants.
                    Wine is one of the most abundant products. Both the red and white are of
                    excellent quality; and the quantity yielded beyond the domestic demand is
                    converted, by distillation, into good brandy. The olive trees cover the sides of
                    most of the hills. The olives are smaller than those of the Continent, but they
                    are more abundant in oil, and the whole quantity annually made amounts to more
                    than 650,000 gallons. The mulberry trees feed a sufficient number of worms to
                    yield about 40,000 pounds weight of silk. The other articles obtained from the
                    soil, and part of which are exported, are oranges, lemons, citrons, almonds,
                    dates, figs, pistachio nuts, and capers.</p>
                <p>The sea around the island swarms with fish, the taking of which affords
                    employment to many of the inhabitants, and tends to form some of the best
                    sailors in the Mediterranean. Bay salt is made on the south side of the island,
                    sufficient for domestic purposes, as well as for curing the fish taken on the
                    coasts. The stock of live cattle, according to Grasset St Sauveur, amounts to
                    2000 horses, 9000 asses, 6000 horned cattle, 61,500 sheep, 33,600 goats, and
                    25,000 swine. These last animals are fattened to the weight of from 450 to 500
                    pounds, and form the principal part of the animal food of the natives.</p>
                <p>The seat of the government of the island is the city of Palma, situated in a bay
                    of the same name, formed by Cape Cala Figuera on the west, and by Cape Blanco on
                    the cast. The bay is capacious; and the best anchorage is near to the city, in a
                    depth of water from six to nine fathoms. The bay is protected by three strong
                    castles, and the city is surrounded by walls and ditches. It has a fine
                    cathedral and an episcopal palace, a government-house, and appropriate courts of
                    justice, with several monasteries. Besides the Bay of Palma, which is on the
                    south-west of the island, there are two others on the north-east part of it,
                    viz. Alcudia and Pollenza. In the former is good anchorage for the largest
                    ships, within the length of three or four cables from the town, and in six
                    fathoms water, with very good holding ground. It is somewhat exposed to the
                    north-east winds, which bring in a heavy sea, but it is nevertheless tolerably
                    secure. The Bay of Pollenza admits ships of war of the largest size; but if many
                    of them were to resort to it at the same time, the greater number would be
                    exposed to the wind from east-north-east, and a few only would be sheltered.</p>
                <p>The principal places and their population are, Palma, 29,400; Falaniche, 6800;
                    JManacor, 5963; Soller, 5600; Leuchmajor, 5400; Pollenza, 4500; and Bonalbufar,
                    3740.</p>
