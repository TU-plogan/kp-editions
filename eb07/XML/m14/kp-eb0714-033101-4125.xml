                    France</hi></label>, an island in the Indian Ocean, situated between the
                    meridians of 57. 17. and 57. 46. east longitude, and the parallels of 19. 58.
                    and 20. 32. south latitude, one hundred and twenty miles to the north-east of
                    the Isle of Bourbon, and four hundred and eighty miles from Madagascar. Its
                    shape is nearly oval, measuring from north to south forty-four miles, and from
                    east to west thirty-two miles. Some, however, estimate its dimensions about ten
                    miles less either way; but the above appears to be the most correct estimate of
                    its size.</p>
                <p>The island of Mauritius was discovered by the Portuguese in the year 1507, and
                    that people retained possession of it during nearly the whole of the sixteenth
                    century, without, however, making any permanent settlements upon it. In 1598 it
                    was taken possession of by the Dutch, who changed its name, which had originally
                    been Cerné, to that of Mauritius. The Hollanders, however, were too busy
                    extracting the wealth of their other possessions in the East to pay much
                    attention to this new acquisition, and they finally abandoned it in the year
                    1712. It was subsequently colonized by the French, who took formal possession of
                    it in 1721, changing its name to Isle de France. The first regular settlement
                    took place in 1735 under Μ. de la Bourdonnais, who paid much attention to
                    agriculture and commerce, introducing the cultivation of the sugar-cane,
                    establishing manufactures of cotton and indigo, and erecting various public
                    works. The foundations of its prosperity were thus laid, but half a century had
                    nearly expired before the French government fully appreciated the importance of
                    their colony. It was not until 1784 that measures were adopted which raised the
                    island from what it had hitherto been, an agricultural colonγ, to a considerable
                    commercial <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204138" xml:id="kp-eb0714-4138-0332"
                    />dépôt. Till the breaking forth of those great political commotions which
                    originated in France and convulsed Europe, the Mauritius had been despotically
                    governed; but then the colonists, in imitation of the revolutionists of the
                    mother country, declared for a national assembly. For several years the country
                    remained in a very troubled state; but in 1799 the government became more
                    settled, and from this period the colonists enjoyed tranquillity, and the
                    cultivation of the island rapidly extended. From the Mauritius the French were
                    enabled greatly to annoy the trade of the British in the East, and this led to
                    the attack and conquest of the island in 1810. At the peace of 1814 the
                    acquisition was ratified, and since that period Mauritius has remained attached
                    to the British empire.</p>
                <p>The aspect of this island is highly romantic and picturesque, from whatever point
                    it is approached. It is nearly surrounded by coral reefs, having shallow lagoons
                    between them and the shore, so that landing is difficult, if not dangerous. From
                    the coast the land rises to the middle of the island, and chains of mountains
                    intersect it in various directions from the centre to the shore. There are three
                    principal ranges, the height of which varies from 1800 to 2800 feet above the
                    sea, and they are for the most part covered with timber. The forms of many of
                    these mountains are singular and grotesque. The great chain of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pouce</hi> is so called from its resemblance to a thumb on a human
                    hand. On the same chain is a peak called Pieterbooth, 2500 feet high, which is
                    terminated by an obelisk or spire of naked rock, on the top of which reposes an
                    immense globular mass of stone, larger than the point of the pyramid on which it
                    is balanced. These mountains are composed of ironstone and a species of lava of
                    a gray colour, and both the appearance of the island and the nature of its
                    material unequivocally indicate a volcanic origin. In the interior there are
                    large forests and plains of table-land, several leagues in circumference, and of
                    different elevations. The principal rivers are named the Port Louis, Latanier,
                    Plaines Wilhems, Moka, Rampart, Great and Little Black Rivers, with many other
                    streams of lesser note. There are likewise several lakes; the largest and
                    deepest is that called the Great Basin, situated on the most elevated plain in
                    the island. The caverns in Mauritius are extremely curious, having the
                    appearance of vast vaults excavated by human hands.</p>
                <p>The soil of this island is in many parts exceedingly rich; in some parts it is a
                    black vegetable mould, in others a bed of solid clay or quaking earth, but
                    generally the earth is of a reddish colour mixed with ferruginous matter, which
                    often appears on the surface in small orbicular masses. Considerable tracts of
                    the interior are good and well cultivated, but the finest and most productive
                    soil lies nearest to the coast. The climate is upon the whole very salubrious,
                    though, during certain seasons of the year, heavy winds and rains prevail, and
                    sometimes exceedingly violent commotions of the atmosphere take place. The
                    hurricane months are January, February, and March; but these tempests are not of
                    uniform occurrence. In the animal kingdom there is nothing peculiar to
                    Mauritius; and with regard to the vegetable, it is sufficient to state, that,
                    under the French and English governments, the richest and rarest plants of the
                    East have been naturalized in the island, and thither also most of the plants,
                    trees, and vegetables of Europe have been conveyed. Throughout the island there
                    are many extensive gardens furnished with everything which can conduce to
                    utility or ornament.</p>
                <p>Mauritius is divided into nine quartiers or cantons, the names of which are, Port
                    Louis, Pamplemouses, Rivière du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Riviere
                    Noire. Plaines Wilhems, and Moka. The two principal ports are Port Louis and
                    Grand Port. Port Louis, the capital of the island and the seat of government, is
                    situated at the head of a fine harbour, between two points of level land, each
                    of which is commanded by a fort. It is a very neat town, well laid out, and, as
                    stone buildings have now in a great measure superseded the more primitive
                    erections of wood, it presents a handsome appearance. A spacious quay,
                    custom-house, theatre, public library, and a town residence for the governor,
                    are amongst the number of public buildings. Those erected by the French,
                    particularly the cathedral and theatre, are tasteful and spacious. The main
                    street, which runs nearly east and west, contains many good buildings,
                    well-furnished shops, and merchants’ warehouses. Here a great part of the public
                    business is transacted. East of the quay is a wooden roofed bazaar, extending
                    over a considerable open space, where all kinds of wares are vended during the
                    hours of daylight. There is an old Roman Catholic church, with two low towers;
                    it is plain and unadorned, both externally and internally. Also an English
                    Protestant church, a low, clumsy structure. The college is a massy wooden pile,
                    three stories in height. From the chief thoroughfare many other streets diverge
                    in a southern direction, some of great length, all of ample width, and for the
                    most part macadamized. Several water-courses from the neighbouring mountains are
                    turned through the principal of these. On one side of the town is the Malabar
                    camp, inhabited by Hindus and other oriental foreigners, the French and English
                    in general occupying the central streets. Here also are barracks for a thousand
                    infantry. A chartered bank was established in 1831, with a capital of 500,000
                    piastres. The population of Port Louis amounts to 26,000. Grand Port, and the
                    other ports of the island, are not of such importance as to require particular
                    description.</p>
                <p>The live stock of the island in 1832 consisted of 748 horses and mares, 2618
                    mules and asses, 21,309 bulls and cows, 1938 goats and sheep, besides above 1000
                    pigs. The state of culture was in 1831 as follows, viz. 103,246 acres of wood,
                    89,780 acres of savannah, 6191 acres of grain, 10,917 acres of manioc, 52,253
                    acres of sugar-cane, 519 acres of cloves, and 477 acres of coffee and other
                    products. The cultivation of cotton and indigo has now almost if not entirely
                    ceased. From the above statement it will be seen that sugar is at present the
                    article principally cultivated. In 1824 the quantity exported was only
                    27,719,776 lbs.; the duty was then reduced on its importation into England,
                    since which period the quantity sent cutof the island has yearly augmented. The
                    amount of exports of the island for the year 1833 was, sugar, 74,243,045 lbs.;
                    ebony, 160,912 lbs.; cotton, 1655 lbs.; cloves, 5855lbs.; tortoiseshell, &amp;c.
                    2905 lbs.; coffee, 900 lbs.; indigo, 444 lbs. The principal imports consist of
                    provisions, particularly grain and flour. Earthenware, machinery, furniture,
                    hardware, piece-goods, wine, &amp;c. arc also largely imported. The total
                    estimated valueof imports in 1831 was L.705,583; the estimated value of the
                    exports for the same year being L.606,684.</p>

                    no appeal. With regard to religion, education, and the press, they appear to be
                    in a lower state than in any other of the British colonies. At Port Louis there
                    is a public school or college, attended by 212 scholars, the annual expense of
                    which for salaries to professors, &amp;c. is L.4556; of this, L.1417 is
                    contributed by government, which likewise contributes L.400 for the support of
                    free schools; but besides these there are other schools supported solely by
                    fees, at which from 800 to 900 children are instructed in the ordinary branches
                    of education. In a financial point of view, theMauritius has not as yet proved a
                    very valuable acquisition. During the fifteen years ending with the year 1825,
                    the expenditure exceeded the revenue by no less than L.1,026,208. It appears
                    from the accounts published by the board of trade, that the total revenue of the
                    colony in 1831 amounted to L.232,438, and the expenditure to L.249,824; in the
                    latter, however, are included the pay of troops, and other items not connected
                    with civil charges. A systematic economy is now in progress, and by a vigorous
                    retrenchment the unfavourable balance will no doubt be reduced, if not
                    obliterated. The importance of Mauritius as a portion of the British empire is
                    in a commercial point of view considerable, it being favourably situated for
                    carryingon an extensive trade with Madagascar and Eastern Africa. This is at
                    present prevented by the system of laying heavy taxes on the produce imported
                    from Asia, with the view of encouraging the West Indies. From its geographical
                    position, it is essential to the prosperity of our trade with the East, as was
                    proved by the injuries which our commerce sustained during the last war, whilst
                    the island remained in possession of the French.</p>

                    amounted in 1832 to 90,353, of whom 26,560 were whites or free blacks, and
                    63,793 slaves.</p>

                <p>The island of Rodrigue, the Seychelles Islands, Diego Garcia, and others, belong
                    to Mauritius. Rodrigue is situated about 300 miles to the eastward of Mauritius,
                    in 19° 13'south latitude. It is about twenty-six miles in length by twelve in
                    breadth, and consists of a succession of verdant hills. Although the valleys are
                    almost full of rocks and stones, there still remains a considerable portion of
                    fertile soil, which is cultivated by colonists from Mauritius. The vegetation is
                    luxuriant, the climate salubrious, and the water clear. There is abundance of
                    fish around the island, but some of them are poisonous.</p>
                <p>The Seychelles, or Mahé Islands, are situated between the parallels of four and
                    five degrees south latitude. There is nothing interesting regarding their
                    history. When Mauritius capitulated to Britain, they were taken possession of as
                    a dependency of that colony, which keeps an agent here, who is assisted in his
                    duty by some subordinates, and twenty-five soldiers; and there is a petty civil
                    and criminal court, held for trial of causes and offences. The names of the
                    principal islands, with the number of acres in each, are as under:</p>

                <p>There are a number of others of smaller dimensions, all resting on an extensive
                    bank of sand and coral, which also surrounds them to a great extent. Mahé, the
                    principal island and seat of government, is sixteen miles in length and from
                    three to five in breadth, with a very steep and rugged granite mountain running
                    through the centre. The vegetation on this, as well as on many others of the
                    group, is extremely luxuriant, and amongst their productions are various spices,
                    such as the cinnamon plant, cloves, nutmeg, and pepper. The town of Mahe is
                    situated on the north side of the island, and, though irregularly built,
                    contains some good houses; but the principal persons live in the environs. It is
                    of course more densely peopled than the others, the inhabitants amounting to
                    about 7000. There is, however, a small population scattered over many of the
                    others, and several which are uninhabited, possess abundance of hogs and goats,
                    as also papaws, cocoa nuts, and other edible fruits. But the most remarkable
                    vegetable production is the coco de mer, so called because the nuts were found
                    on the shores of Malabar, and on the coasts of the Maldive Islands, long before
                    the place of their growth was known, when, from their supposed medicinal
                    qualities, each nut sold for L.300 or L.400. It springs from a species of palm
                    sixty or eighty feet high, the growth of which is confined to two of the
                    Seychelles. A gale of wind is unknown in these tranquil seas, but the ocean
                    breezes are constant, thus tempering the rays of a vertical sun. Diego Garcia is
                    situated about four degrees farther east, and is one of those numerous coral
                    islands with which these seas abound. It contains abundance of turtle, and has a
                    few residents from the Mauritius, <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r. r.)</hi></p>
