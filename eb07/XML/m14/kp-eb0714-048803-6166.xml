                <p><label type="entry">MEDIA</label>, now the province of Ghilan in Persia, once the
                    seat of a powerful empire, was bounded, according to Ptolemy, on the north by
                    part of the Caspian Sea; on the south by Persia, Susiana, and Assyria; on the
                    east by Parthia and Hyrcania; and on the west by Armenia Major. It was anciently
                    divided into the provinces of Tropa-tene, Charomithrene, Darites, Marciane,
                    Amariace, and Syro-Media. By a later division, however, all these were reduced
                    to two; the one being called <hi rend="italic">Media Magna,</hi> and the other
                    <hi rend="italic">Media Atropatia,</hi> or simply <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atropatene.</hi> Media Magna was bounded by Persis, Parthia, Hyrcania, the
                    Hyrcanian Sea, and Atropatene, and contained the cities of Ecbatana, Laodicea,
                    Apamea, Raga, Rageia or Ragea, &amp;c. Atropatene lay between the Caspian
                    Mountains and the Caspian Sea. This country originally took its name from Madai,
                    the third son of Japhet; as is plain from Scripture, where the Medes are
                    constantly called <hi rend="italic">Madai.</hi> Amongst profane authors, some
                    derive the name <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Media from one Medus the son <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> Jason and Medea, and others from a city called <hi
                    rend="italic">Media.</hi> Sextus Rufus tells us that in his time it was called
                    <hi rend="italic">Medena,</hi> and from others we learn that it was also called
                    <hi rend="italic">Aria.</hi></p>
                <p>The government of the various tribes into which the country was divided was
                    originally monarchical, and they seem to have had their own kings even in the
                    earliest times. They were first brought under the Assyrian yoke by Pul, said to
                    have been the founder of that monarchy, or by his immediate successor
                    Tiglath-pileser. From the time of Pul, or Tiglath-pileser, who succeeded his
                    father in the year 740 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>, they remained subject to
                    the Assyrians till about the latter end of the reign of Sennacherib, 710 B. c.,
                    when, emancipating themselves from Assyrian bondage, they fell into a state of
                    anarchy. This circumstance, as Herodotus informs us, gave Esar-Haddon, or
                    Assar-Hadon, who succeeded Sennacherib, an opportunity of reducing a great part
                    of Media, if not the whole country, under subjection. This anarchy is supposed
                    to have lasted one year; for Dejoces, called Arphaxad in the book of Judith, was
                    killed by Saoduchius or Nebuchadonosor, in the year 656. From the commencement
                    of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194206179" xml:id="kp-eb0714-6179-0489"/>reign
                    of Dejoces to the destruction of Nineveh, 601 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi>
                    Media may be properly styled a kingdom. From the destruction of Nineveh we may
                    therefore date the rise of the empire of the Medes. Their empire lasted till the
                    taking of Babylon; for we learn from Xenophon, that after the reduction of that
                    city, Cyrus went to the king of the Medes at Ecbatana, and succeeded him in the
                    kingdom. The empire of the Medes had lasted sixty-five years, at the period when
                    the Persian empire took its rise under Cyrus. Passing over the fabulous history
                    of the Medes, we shall begin with the reign of Dejoces, who was chosen by them
                    as their judge, and who, aspiring to the sovereign power, performed that office
                    with the strictest regard to justice. After his resignation of this office,
                    licentiousness prevailed, and it was found necessary to appoint a king; upon
                    which Dejoces was named to the sovereignty, and with universal applause placed
                    upon the throne, 710 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">As</hi>
                    soon as he had been elected king, and vested with the supreme power, he threw
                    off the mask, and became a tyrant. Ecbatana was built and chosen for the royal
                    residence, and a stately palace was erected for the sovereign. Dejoces, having
                    enacted various laws for the government of the kingdom, and having, in a
                    considerable degree, civilized his unpolished subjects, entertained thoughts of
                    extending the limits of his new kingdom, and with this view he invaded Assyria.
                    Nebuchadonosor, however, at that time king of Assyria, met him in the plain of
                    Ragau, and a battle ensued, in which the Medes were utterly defeated, and
                    Dejoces was slain, after a reign, according to Herodotus, of fifty-three years.
                    The Assyrian king availing himself of his success, reduced several cities of
                    Media, and amongst the rest Ecbatana, which he almost utterly destroyed. Dejoces
                    was succeeded by his son Phraortes, 647 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.; and,
                    not satisfied with the kingdom of Media, he invaded Persia, and is said to have
                    brought that nation under subjection to the Medes. Such is the account of
                    Herodotus. Others, however, ascribe the conquest of Persia, not to Phraortes,
                    but to his son and successor Cyaxares. Phraortes, however, subdued several
                    neighbouring nations, and made himself master of almost all Upper Asia, lying
                    between Mount Taurus and the river Halys. Emboldened by his success, he invaded
                    Assyria, subdued a great part of the country, and even laid siege to Nineveh,
                    the metropolis.</p>
                <p>On the death of Phraortes, his son Cyaxares was placed on the throne. He was not
                    less valiant and enterprising than his father, and had better success against
                    the Assyrians. With the remains of that army which had been defeated under his
                    father, he not only drove the conquerors out of Media, but obliged Chyniladan to
                    shut himself up in Nineveh. To this place he immediately laid close siege; but
                    was obliged to abandon the enterprise, on account of an irruption of the
                    Scythians into his own country. Cyaxares engaged these new enemies with great
                    resolution, but was utterly defeated; and the conquerors overran not only all
                    Media, but the greater part of Upper Asia, extending their conquests into Syria,
                    and as far as the confines of Egypt. They continued masters of this vast tract
                    of country for twenty-eight years, tillatlast Media was delivered from their
                    yoke by a general massacre, at the instigation of Cyaxares.</p>
                <p>The Medes were afterwards engaged with the Lydians; and during the engagement
                    there happened a total eclipse of the sun, which is said to have been foretold
                    by Thales the Milesian. Both parties were terrified, and soon afterwards
                    concluded a peace by the mediation of Labynetus, that is, Nebuchadnezzar, king
                    of Babylon, and Syennesis, king of Cilicia. This peace was confirmed by the
                    marriage of Ary-enis, the daughter of Halyattes, and Astyages, the eldest son of
                    Cyaxares; and of this marriage was born in the ensuing year Cyaxares, who, in
                    the book of Daniel (ch. v. 31) is called Darius the Mede. Cyaxares, disengaged
                    from the Lydian war, resumed the siege of Nineveh; and having formed a strict
                    alliance with Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, they joined their forces, and
                    took and destroyed the city (606 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>) With this
                    prosperous event commenced the great successes of Nebuchadnezzar and Cyaxares;
                    and thus was laid the foundation of the two collateral empires, as they may be
                    called, of the Medes and Babylonians, which 'rose upon the ruins of the Assyrian
                    monarchy. After the reduction of Nineveh, the two conquerors led the confederate
                    army against Pharaoh-Necho, king of Egypt, who was defeated near the Euphrates,
                    and compelled to resign what he had formerly taken from the Assyrians. After
                    this victory they reduced all Coelesyria and Phoenicia; then they invaded and
                    laid waste Samaria, Galilee, and Scythopolis; and at last besieged Jerusalem,
                    and took Jehoiakim prisoner. Nebuchadnezzar afterwards pursued his conquests in
                    the west, and Cyaxares subdued the Assyrian provinces of Armenia, Pontus, and
                    Cappadocia. Again uniting their forces, they reduced Persia and Susiana, and
                    accomplished the conquest of the Assyrian empire. The prophet Ezekiel (ch.
                    xxxii. 22, &amp;c.) enumerates the chief nations who were subdued and
                    slaughtered by the two conquerors Cyaxares and Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
                <p>After this victory the Babylonian and Median empires seem to have been united;
                    but upon the death of Nebuchadnezzar, or rather towards the close of his life, a
                    war ensued, which was only extinguished by the dissolution of the Babylonian
                    empire. The Medes, under Astyages the son of Cyaxares I. withstood the power of
                    the Babylonian monarchs, and, under Cyrus and Cyaxares II. utterly destroyed
                    their empire by the taking of Babylon. After the death of Cyaxares, the kingdom
                    fell to Cyrus, by whom the seat of the empire was transferred to Persia.</p>
