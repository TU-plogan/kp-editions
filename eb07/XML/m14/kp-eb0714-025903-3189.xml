                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    an eminent literary <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203202"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3202-0260"/>character, was born at Marseilles in 1676. He
                    attached himself at an early period of life to the order of the Congregation of
                    the Oratory; but the situation was too confined for his genius, and he soon left
                    it. At Paris he married, became advocate, and entered on this new profession
                    with great approbation and success. Disappointed, however, in his expectations
                    of making a speedy fortune, he abandoned the law; and about this time the
                    peevish humour of his wife occasioned a separation. We next find him as governor
                    to the son of the President de Maisons; and when the premature death of the
                    father deprived him of the fruits of his industry, he engaged with the famous
                    John Law in the same capacity. After the fall of this extraordinary projector,
                    he superintended the education of the Marquis de Beaufremont’s children, and
                    reared pupils worthy othis genius and industry. Although he was accused of a
                    tendency to Deism, and there seemed good reason for the accusation, yet he never
                    infused into the minds of his scholars any principle inconsistent with sound
                    morality, or with the Christian religion. When he left Μ. de Beaufremont’s
                    family, he took a boarding house, in which, after a method of his own, he
                    educated a certain number of young men. But unexpected circumstances obliged him
                    to abandon this useful undertaking; and he was even constrained to give some
                    occasional lessons for the bare necessaries of life. Without fortune, without
                    hope, and almost without resource, he was reduced to extreme indigence. In this
                    situation he was found by the authors of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopedic,</hi> and admitted a partner in conducting that great work.
                    Amongst many other excellent pieces of his, may be mentioned the article <hi
                    rend="italic">Grammar,</hi> which breathes the spirit of sound philosophy. His
                    principles are clear and solid. He discovers an intimate knowledge of the
                    subject, great accuracy in expressing the rules, and perfect propriety in their
                    application. Μ. le Comte de Lauraguais was so much affected with the,
                    distresses, and so much convinced of the merit, of Dumarsais, that he procured
                    him a pension of 1000 livres. Dumarsais died at Paris on the 11th of June 1756,
                    in his eightieth year, after having received the sacrament. The compliment which
                    he paid to the priest on this occasion has been considered by some as rather
                    equivocal. But there is no necessity to deprive religion of the triumph, or
                    philosophy of the honour, which conviction and penitence must confer on it. “The
                    faith of a great genius,” says Bayle, who is entitled to credit on this subject,
                    “is not totally extinguished; it is like a spark under the ashes. Reflection and
                    the prospect of danger call forth its exertions. There arc certain situations in
                    which philosophers are as full of anxiety and of remorse as other men.” Whatever
                    were the last sentiments of Dumarsais, it cannot be denied that in the vigour of
                    health he furnished several examples of irréligion; and to these have been added
                    many absurd stories. The superiority of Dumarsais’s talents consisted in
                    exactness and perspicuity. His ignorance of the world, and of the customs of
                    mankind, together with the greatest latitude in expressing whatever he thought,
                    gave him that frank and unguarded simplicity which is often the chief ingredient
                    of genuine humour. Fontenelle used to say of him, “that he was the most lively
                    simpleton, and as a man of wit the most simple, that he ever knew.” He was the
                    Fontaine of philosophers. In consequence of this character, he was a nice judge
                    of what was natural in every production, and a great enemy to all kind of
                    affectation. His principal works are, 1. Exposition de la Doctrine de l’Eg-lise
                    Gallicane par rapport aux prétensions de la Cour de Rome, 12mo. This accurate
                    work was begun at the desire of the President de Maisons, and did not appear
                    till after the death of the author. 2. Exposition d’une Methode raisonnée pour
                    apprendre la Langue Latine, 12mo, 1722, rare. This method appears conformable to
                    the natural development of the powers of the mind, and on that account renders
                    the acquisition of the language less difficult; but, to vulgar and unenlightened
                    understandings, it was liable to two great objections, namely, its novelty, and
                    the censure which it conveyed of the method formerly in use. 3. Traité des
                    Tropes, 1730, 8vo, reprinted in 1771, 12mo∙ This work is intended to explain the
                    different significations of the same word. It is a masterpiece of logical
                    accuracy, perspicuity, and precision. The observations and rules are illustrated
                    by striking examples calculated to show both the use and abuse of rhetorical
                    figures. Yet this excellent book had but very little sale, and is scarcely
                    known. 4. Les Véritables Principes de la Grammaire raisonnée pour apprendre la
                    Langue Latine, 1729, 4to. There was only the preface of this work published, in
                    which he introduced the greater part of his Methode Raisonnée; 5. Abrégé de la
                    Fable du Père Juvenci, arranged after the manner of the original plan, 1731,
                    12mo; 6. Une Réponse manuscrite à la Critique de l’Histoire des Oracles, par le
                    Père Baltus. There are only imperfect fragments of these papers to be found. 7.
                    Logique, ou Réflexions sur les Opérations de l’Esprit. This is a short tract,
                    which nevertheless contains everything necessary to be known in the art of
                    reasoning. It was reprinted at Paris in two parts, together with the articles
                    which he had furnished for the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie,</hi> 1762.</p>
