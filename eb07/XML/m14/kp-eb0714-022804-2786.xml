                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MANDARA</label>, an independent kingdom of Western Africa,
                    situated to the south of Bornou. It is overlooked by the central range of the
                    Mountains of the Moon, which attain their greatest elevation to the southward of
                    this territory. Those parts of the mountains examined by Major Denham consist of
                    enormous blocks of granite, both detached and reclining on each other, and
                    presenting the most rugged faces and sides. The interstices and fissures
                    appeared to be filled with a yellow quartzose earth, in which grow mosses and
                    lichens, as well as trees of considerable size. At the base of these mountains,
                    and also at a considerable elevation on their sides, are incumbent masses of
                    decomposed fragments of primitive rocks, recompounded by a species of natural
                    cement. A number of petrified shells were found confusedly mixed with fragments
                    of granite, quartz, sand, and clay, and in some instances imbedded in the rocks.
                    Mandara consists of a fine valley watered by various springs. Amongst the
                    various specimens of the vegetable kingdom, are numerous fig-trees, and a tree
                    bearing a white and fragrant blossom, resembling the zeringa. This kingdom was
                    formerly comprehended within the territory of the sultan of Karowa, a country
                    bordering upon it to the south-west, but which was wrested from the <hi
                    rend="italic">herdy</hi> or pagan sovereign by the neighbouring Fellatahs. His
                    son, however, recovered it from them, and succeeded in keeping possession of it,
                    chiefly, it is said, in consequence of his having embraced the Mahommedan faith.
                    The principal Mandara towns, eight in number, all stand in the valley. The
                    inhabitants of these, as well as of the villages by which they are surrounded,
                    profess Islamism; but the pagans are far more numerous, and their dwellings are
                    seen every where in clusters on the sides, and even on the tops, of the hills
                    which immediately overlook the capital. They hold the sultan in great dread, and
                    occasionally propitiate his favour by presenting him with leopard-skins, honey,
                    and slaves, as peace-offerings, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194202799"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-2799-0229"/>besides asses and goats, with which their
                    mountains abound. Mora, the capital of Mandara, is situated nearly facing the
                    north, under a semicircular ridge of very picturesque mountains. These natural
                    barriers form a strong rampart on every side but one, which, however, the sultan
                    is able so to defend as to bid defiance to the attacks of the Fellatahs. When
                    Major Denham visited this kingdom, he found the sultan surrounded by about 500
                    horsemen, posted on a rising ground about a mile from Delow, the most northern
                    town in Mandara. These soldiers were finely dressed in Soudan <hi rend="italic"
                    >tobes</hi> of different colours (chiefly dark blue, and striped with yellow and
                    red), <hi rend="italic">bornouses</hi> of coarse scarlet cloth, and large
                    turbans of white or dark-coloured cotton. Their horses were beautiful, being
                    larger and more powerful than any in Bornou, and they were managed with great
                    dexterity. The country to the extreme south is inhabited by the Musgow people, a
                    rude and savage race. During the visit of the traveller above named, he
                    witnessed the arrival of an embassy of between twenty and thirty individuals of
                    this tribe, mounted on horseback, and bringing two hundred of their
                    fellow-creatures, and fifty horses, besides other presents, to the sultan. They
                    were covered only with the skin of a goat or leopard; and round the necks of
                    each were long strings of the teeth of the enemies whom they had slain in
                    battle. Teeth and pieces of bone were also suspended from the clotted locks of
                    their hair, and their bodies were marked with red patches in various places.
                    Dirkullah, a part of this mountain territory, is occupied by Fellatahs, who have
                    their villages strongly fortified, and fight desperately with poisoned arrows,
                    by means of which they on one occasion put to flight the whole force of Bornou
                    and Mandara, though aided by a numerous and well-armed body of Arabs. They are
                    now, however, kept in subjection by the sultan of Mandara. The common people of
                    this country paint their bodies, wrap themselves in the skins of wild beasts,
                    and subsist chiefly upon fruits, honey, and the fish drawn from large lakes.</p>
