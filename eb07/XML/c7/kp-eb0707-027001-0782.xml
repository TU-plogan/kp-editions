                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">CONSTANTINE</label> the Great, the first emperor of the
                    Romans who embraced Christianity. His father, Constantius Chlorus, rendered
                    himself famous by his expeditions into Germany and Britain; and upon the
                    abdication of Diocletian in 305, he shared the Roman empire with Galerius
                    Maximinus, and was at that time at York, where he died in 306, having first
                    caused his son Constantine the Great to be proclaimed emperor by his army and by
                    the Britons. Galerius at first refused to admit Constantine to his father’s
                    share in the imperial throne; but after having lost several battles, he
                    consented in the year 308. Maxentius, who succeeded Galerius, opposed him, but
                    was defeated, and drowned in the Tiber. The senate then declared Constantine
                    chief or first Augustus, and Licinius his second associate in the empire. This
                    occurred in the year 312. These princes published an edict, in their joint
                    names, in favour of the Christians; but soon afterwards Licinius, jealous of the
                    renown of Constantine, conceived an implacable hatred against him, and renewed
                    the persecutions against the Christians. This brought on a rupture between the
                    emperors, and a battle ensued, in which Constantine proved victorious. A short
                    peace followed; but Licinius having shamefully violated the treaty, the war was
                    renewed, when Constantine totally defeated him, and forced him to fly to
                    Nicoedia, where he was taken prisoner and strangled, in the year 323.
                    Constantine having now become sole master of the western and eastern empires,
                    immediately formed the plan of establishing Christianity as the religion of the
                    state; and for this purpose he convoked several ecclesiastical councils; but
                    finding that he was likely to meet with great opposition from the Pagan interest
                    at Rome, he conceived the design of founding a new city, as the capital of his
                    Christian empire. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Constantinople.)</hi> The glory
                    which Constantine had acquired by establishing the Christian religion was
                    tarnished by the part he took in the persecutions which were, towards the close
                    of his reign, carried on by the Arians against their Christian brethren who
                    differed from them; and, seduced by Eusebius of Nicoedia, he banished several
                    eminent prelates, soon after which he died in the sixty-sixth year of his age
                    and thirty-first of his reign.</p>
                <p>As to the character of Constantine, he was chaste, pious, laborious, and
                    indefatigable; a great and successful commander, and deserving his success by
                    his shining valour and superior genius; and a protector of arts, which he
                    encouraged by his beneficence. If we compare him with Augustus, we shall find
                    that he overthrew idolatry by the same precautions and the same address which
                    the other used to destroy liberty. Like Augustus, he laid the foundation of a
                    new empire; but being possessed of less political skill, he failed to give it
                    equal stability. He weakened the body of the state by adding to it, in some
                    measure, a second head in the foundation of Constantinople; and by transporting
                    the centre of motion and strength too near to the eastern extremity, he left
                    without vigour, and almost without life, the western parts, which soon became a
                    prey to the barbarians. The Pagans were too much his enemies to do him justice.
                    Eutropius says, that in the earlier part of his reign he was equal to the most
                    accomplished princes, and that, in the latter, he fell below the meanest. The
                    younger Victor pretends, that in the first ten years he was a hero, in the
                    succeeding twelve a robber, and in the last ten a spendthrift. But it is easy to
                    perceive, with respect to the reproaches imputed to him by Victor, that the one
                    relates to the riches which Constantine took from idolatry, and the other to
                    those with which he loaded the church.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Constantine,</hi> emperor of the East in 912, left the care
                    of the empire to his wife Helena, who oppressed the people with taxes, and sold
                    all the offices hi church and state to the highest bidders; whilst the emperor
                    employed himself in reading, writing, and the fine arts, till lie became as good
                    an architect and painter as he was a bad prince. He wrote several biographical
                    and geographical works, which would have done honour to his name if he had not
                    neglected his duties to compose them. He diedin 959.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Constantine,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dracoses,</hi> the son of
                    Emmanuel Palaeologus, was placed on the throne by Sultan Amurath in 1448. But
                    Mahommed IL, his successor, resolving to dethrone him, laid siege to
                    Constantinople by sea and land, and took it by assault in 1453, after it had
                    held out fifty-eight days. The unfortunate emperor seeing the Turks enter the
                    breaches, threw himself into the midst of the enemy and was cut to pieces; the
                    children of the imperial house were massacred by the soldiers; and the women
                    were reserved to gratify the lust of the conqueror. Thus terminated the dynasty
                    of the Constantines, 1123 years after its establishment at Constantinople.</p>

                    great reputation by his skill in the Greek language, in history, and in
                    medicine. He died in 1603, at the age of a hundred and three years. He wrote a
                    dictionary in Greek and Latin, and other works.</p>

                    plain without woods, but with rich meadows, on which large herds of black cattle
                    are fed. The chief place, of the same name, is on the Orel, where the Barestowja
                    falls into that river. It was formerly walled, but the defences are now in
                    ruins, and the inhabitants do not exceed 1200. Long. 31. 35. E. Lat. 53. 12.
