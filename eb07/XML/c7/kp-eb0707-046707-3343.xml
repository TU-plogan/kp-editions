                    Robert Crichton, who, in conjunction with John Spence, executed the office of
                    lord advocate; his mother was Elizabeth, the only daughter of Sir James Stewart
                    of Beath, by Margaret, the eldest daughter of Lord Lindsay of Byres. It appears
                    highly probable, if not certain, that by the father’s side he derived his
                    lineage from Sir Robert Crichton of Sanquhar, ancestor of the earl of Dumfries;
                    and his maternal grandfather, ancestor of the earl of Moray, was the son of Lord
                    Avandale, who was descended from Murdac duke of Albany, and through him from
                    Robert II. It is indeed to be recollected that the birth of the first Lord
                    Avandale was illegitimate; but it is likewise to be recollected that he obtained
                    letters of legitimation under the great seal.<note anchored="true"

                    158.</p></note> His grand-uncle Lord Methven was the third husband of Margaret
                    Tudor, the relict of James IV. It is therefore sufficiently obvious that he was
                    entitled to speak of his high descent; but his extraordinary endowments of mind
                    conferred upon him much higher distinction than he could derive from any
                    accidental circumstances of birth. The place of his birth is somewhat doubtful.
                    According to one tradition, he was born in the castle of Cluny, situated on a
                    small lake bearing the same name; but as the father did not acquire his estate
                    in Perthshire till two years after the birth of James, his eldest son, this may
                    be considered as entitled to less attention than another tradition, which
                    represents him as having been born at Elliock in Dumfriesshire, the more ancient
                    seat of the family. The estate of Cluny, which belonged to the bishopric of
                    Dunkeld, was conveyed to the king’s advocate by Robert Crichton, the last popish
                    bishop of that wealthy see.</p>
                <p>In the year 1570, when he had only attained the age of ten, he was sent to the
                    university of St Andrews, where he was entered at St Salvator’s College.
                    According to Aldus Manutius, his father placed him under the tuition of
                    Buchanan, Hepburn, Robertson, and Rutherford, who are all mentioned as very
                    eminent persons. John Rutherford, whose name is sufficiently known, was provost
                    of the college to which Crichton belonged. Buchanan, who was principal of St
                    Leonard’s College, resigned his office about the time when he became a student;
                    but, according to the statement of his Italian friend, he was partly educated
                    along with the young king of Scotland; and Buchanan was appointed to the office
                    of preceptor to the king when he quitted St Andrews, in the year 1570. On the
                    20th of March 1573, or, according to our present mode of computation, 1574,
                    Crichton took the degree of A. B. He proceeded A. Μ. in the year 1575, and thus
                    completed the regular course of study at the premature age of fifteen. In the
                    university of St Andrews, the candidates for the higher degree were then
                    distributed into <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753356"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3356-0468"/>circles, according to the comparative proficiency
                    displayed in the course of their previous examinations. Each circle was likewise
                    formed on the same principle. Of the thirty-six masters who took their degrees
                    on this occasion, there were three circles; and the third name in the first
                    circle is that of James Crichton. At the head of the list appears David
                    Monypenny. It is highly probable that Crichton was the youngest of all those
                    graduates; and as his proficiency was only exceeded by two out of thirty-five,
                    it is evident that he had already begun to distinguish himself by his
                    extraordinary aptitude in the acquisition of knowledge.</p>
                <p>As the king was six years younger than Crichton, they could not well participate
                    in the same studies, although they could receive instructions from the same
                    tutors. Crichton must have continued to devote himself with intense ardour to
                    the pursuits of science as well as literature; for to a knowledge of many
                    languages he added a familiar acquaintance with the philosophy and even the
                    theology of the age. The power of genius is shewn in the use of the materials
                    which are placed within its reach; but there is no royal road to learning,
                    which, if acquired to any extent, must be acquired by much labour and
                    perseverance, although their particular degree must vary according to the
                    quickness of apprehension and tenacity of memory belonging to various
                    individuals.</p>
                <p>Crichton may for some time have enjoyed the benefit of such able instruction; for
                    he appears to have been still residing in Scotland towards the close of the year
                    1577. His subsequent movements are represented as being partly influenced by
                    some domestic disagreements. As the father embraced the reformed doctrines,
                    while the son adhered to the ancient superstition, disputesand reproaches could
                    scarcely fail to intervene at a erisis of si ch high and general exciteinent.
                    The young scholar repaired to France, where he is said to have distinguished
                    himself equally by his skill in literature and in arms. Of a marvellous
                    disputation which he held in the university of Paris, there is an account which
                    passes very currently, although it is only stamped with the authority of Sir
                    Thomas Urquhart. According to this account, he affixed a program in the most
                    public places of the city, inviting all men of learning to meet him, after an
                    interval of six weeks, at the College of Navarre, where he should “be ready to
                    answer to what should be propounded to him concerning any science, liberal art,
                    discipline, or faculty, practical or theoretick, not excluding the theological
                    nor jurisprudential habits, though grounded but upon the testimonies of God and
                    man, and that in any of these twelve languages, Hebrew, Syriack, Arabick, Greek,
                    Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, English, Dutch, Flemish, and Selavonian, in

                    us, that about afort-night before the appointed day of meeting, some person,
                    less acquainted with Crichton himself than with his reputation, subjoined the
                    following sarcastic inscription to his program on the gate of the Sorbonne: “If

                    the taverne or bawdy-house, is the readyest way to finde him.” The hint for this
                    part of the story is to all appearance borrowed from a work of mere fancy, in
                    which Boccalini relates that a similar <hi rend="italic">mordace facetia</hi>
                    was practised upon Crichton, not. ⅛ Paris, but in Parnassus: “Ľ chi lo vuol

                    Parnaso, tomi. p. 181.) <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi></p></note> in the mean
                    time, as we are duly instructed, “the admirable Scot (for so from thence forth
                    he was called) minding more his hawking, hunting, tilting, vaulting, riding of
                    well-managed horses, tossing of the pike, handling of the musket, flourishing of
                    colours, dancing, fencing, swimming, jumping, throwing of the bar, playing at
                    the tennis, baloon, or long-catch, and sometimes at the house-games of dice,
                    cards, playing at the chess, billiards, trou-madam, and other such like
                    chamber-sports, singing, playing on the lute, and other musical instruments.”
                    But when the appointed hour arrived, he acquitted himself with stupendous
                    learning and ability, having for the space of nine hours maintained his ground
                    against the most eminent antagonists in all the faculties. The rector of the
                    university concluded the ceremony by presenting him with a diamond ring and a
                    purse full of gold. It would be a mere waste of criticism to enter into a minute
                    examination of the narrative to which we have now referred. The details are
                    sufficiently circumstantial, but they have much of the aspect of a downright
                    romance; and such details from the knight of Cromarty would have required the
                    strong confirmation of collateral evidence. It might perhaps be admitted with
                    some degree of safety that Crichton was engaged in a public disputation at
                    Paris, and that he acquitted himself with consummate ability; but as to his
                    fluency in twelve languages, and his maintaining so long and powerful a contest,
                    not merely with grammarians, rhetoricians, and philosophers, but even with
                    theologians, canonists, and civilians, all these particulars must be received
                    with extreme hesitation; and perhaps it may be considered as much more probable
                    that such a disputation never took place at Paris, but was merely fabricated
                    from another, which took placeat Venice.</p>
                <p>The intellectual endowments of Crichton seem to have been equalled by his
                    personal accomplishments. He is highly celebrated for his martial prowess, and
                    as a complete master in the use of the sword and spear. Some degree of military
                    experience he must have acquired during his two years service in the civil wars
                    of France: but this term of service was apparently sufficient to gratify his
                    youthful inclination for the life of a soldier; and he next directed his steps
                    towards Italy, where be must have arrived in the year 1580. According to Dr
                    Mackenzie, he proceeded to Rome, and there gave another demonstration of his
                    talents for public disputation;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    celebrated in the annals of typography; and this laid the foundation of a
                    literary friendship, which was not without considerable influence in

                    canon law, who was royal professor of Greek in the university of Paris, and the
                    author of various orations published in a detached form. He married a daughter

                    other men of letters, particularly with Sperone Speroni, Lorenzo Massa, and
                    Giovanni Donati. An ode addressed to Massa, and another to Donati, are preserved
                    among his literary reliques. But the friendship of Manutius was distinguished by
                    a more than ordinary degree of zeal: he highly extolled Crichton when living,
                    and deeply bewailed' him when dead. To the notices which he has introduced into
                    his edition of Cicero, we are in a great measure indebted for our knowledge of
                    the young scholar’s proceedings in the territory of Venice. His edition of the

                <p>An oration which Crichton pronounced before the Doge and the nobility of Venice
                    excited the admiration of his audience, by the eloquence of the composition, as
                    well as by the gracefulness of the elocution, insomuch that the young orator was
                    regarded as a person of the most extraordinary endowments. He afterwards engaged
                    in various disputations on subjects of divinity, philosophy, and the
                    mathematical sciences; and such was the reputation which he now acquired, that,
                    during the remainder of his short career, he seems to have been viewed as one of
                    the wonders of Italy. It has been thought a circumstance worthy of being
                    recorded in the life of Mazzoni, celebrated among his countrymen for his powers
                    of literary debate, that he thrice encountered Crichton at Venice, and
                    overwhelmed him by the astonishing copiousness and subtilty of his arguments. If
                    it was reckoned an honour for a man of high reputation to sustain a contest with
                    so youthful an antagonist, we cannot fail to perceive the singular estimation in
                    which that antagonist must have been held.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>These intellectual exertions were succeeded by an infirm state of health, which
                    continued for upwards of four months; and before he had completely recovered, he
                    made an excursion to Padua, the seat of a flourishing university. The professors
                    in all the different faculties were invited to meet him in the house of a person
                    of rank; and there, in the midst of a numerous assembly, he exhibited new and
                    striking proofs of the versatility of his genius. He commenced his performances
                    with the recitation of an extemporaneous poem in celebration of Padua; a subject
                    which was only then proposed to him, and which he treated in a manner that is
                    described as very elegant. With much acuteness and learning, he afterwards
                    discussed various topics of science with the doctors who were there assembled;
                    and it is particularly mentioned that he exposed many of the errors of Aristotle
                    and his commentators. Having thus displayed his knowledge for the space of six
                    hours, the final theme proposed to him was the praise of ignorance; and on this
                    subject he pronounced an oration, which still further excited the admiration of
                    his learned auditors. A similar exhibition was announced to be held in the
                    bishop’s palace, but, for some reason which is not plainly stated, it did not
                    take place. The popular applause which attended such demonstrations of
                    intellectual superiority, had too natural a tendency to excite envy, and to
                    provoke detraction, nor did Crichton escape that lot which has been common to so
                    many others. On his return to Venice, he was induced by the malignity of certain
                    individuals, whom he does not mention by name, to publish a remarkable program,
                    which has been preserved by his friend Manutius. In order to expose the futility
                    of their cavils, he undertook to refute innumerable errors of Aristotle, and of
                    all the Latin philosophers, that is, all the schoolmen, both in their
                    expositions of his doctrines, and in their disquisitions on subjects of
                    theology, together with the errors of certain professors of mathematics, and to
                    answer suwh objections as might be urged against him. He further gave his
                    antagonists the option of selecting their topics of disputation from any other
                    branch of science, whether publicly taught in the schools, or privately
                    investigated by the most profound philosophers; and he undertook to return his
                    answers, as the proponents should themselves determine, either according to the
                    usual figures of logic, according to the secret doctrine of numbers, or
                    mathematical figures, or in any one out of a hundred different species of verse.
                    The challenge may appear sufficiently bold, if not arrogant; but unless it came
                    from a person who was conscious of possessing very extraordinary powers of
                    intellect, and who had repeatedly applied to them a severe and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> unequivocal test, it could scarcely be viewed in any
                    other light than as an indication of insanity. He appealed to a community^ which
                    included many competent judges of such pretensions, and therefore could not hope
                    to impose upon an unlearned multitude. The appointed place of meeting was the
                    church of St John and St Paul; and there, for the space of three days, this
                    young man sustained the arduous trial in a manner which fully justified his
                    confidence in his own intellectual resources. His friend Aldus Manutius was a
                    spectator of his triumphs upon this occasion; and though some allowances must
                    doubtless be made for the warmth of friendship, and for an Italian taste in
                    writing, it is still to be remembered that when he published his account, the
                    event to which it referred was altogether recent, and he necessarily appealed to
                    a cloud of living witnesses, who would have treated his panegyric with derision,
                    if Crichton bad obviously failed in supporting his own lofty pretensions.</p>
                <p>After his departure from Venice, he betook himself to Mantua; and there,
                    according to Urquhart’s romantic narrative, he rendered himself very conspicuous
                    by his valiant encounter with a fierce Italian gentleman, who had recently slain
                    three antagonists. Crichton is said to have challenged this redoubtable
                    champion, and, after many efforts of mutual skill, to have brought the matter to
                    this conclusion: “His right foot did beat the cadence of the blow that pierced
                    the belly of this Italian; whose heart and throat being hit with the two former
                    stroaks, these three franch bouts given in upon the back of other: besides that,

                    were marked by them, they would represent a perfect isosceles triangle, with a
                    perpendicular from the top-angle, cutting the basis in the middle.”<note

                    mathematics, and he seems to have been fully resolved that his knowledge should
                    be turned to some account. This combat he has described in a very circumstantial
                    manner; but, viewing his unsupported authority with no small degree of
                    suspicion, we feel no inclination to repeat his martial details, which however
                    are not a little curious in themselves. But it is a fact confirmed by other
                    evidence that Crichton was invited or attracted to the court of Mantua, and that
                    the duke appointed him tutor to his son Vincenzo Gonzaga. Here, according to the
                    knight of Cromarty, he displayed his dramatic talents as conspicuously as he had
                    formerly displayed his learning and his prowess. In the space of five hours, he
                    is said to have represented fifteen different characters, and to have supported
                    each of them with marvellous effect. But his brilliant career was speedily to
                    close. When he was one evening walking in the streets of Mantua with his lute in
                    his hand, he was unexpectedly assailed by three individuals; and drawing his
                    sword, he pressed upon them with so much skill and resolution, that the;
                    principal aggressor was impelled by his fears to discover himself as young
                    Gonzaga. Crichton fell upon his knees, and entreated forgiveness for an act
                    which evidently inferred no guilt, when the prince instantly pierced him through
                    the body, and terminated the mortal existence of one of the most remarkable
                    persons of the era to which he belonged.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    casu, incertum nor are we in possession of any more specific information. With
                    regard to the date, there is some degree of uncertainty. In the month of
                    November 1583, Manutius bewailed his young friend as already dead, and pointedly
                    referred to the fatal third of July. Imperiali likewise states that he died on
                    the third of July 1583. On the other hand, Serassi, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vita del Aſazzoni,</hi> p. 127, speaks of a poem written by James Crichton on
                    the death of Cardinal Borromeo, which did not take place till the third of
                    November 1584. But for such a fact as this, the authority of Manutius cannot
                    well be called in question; and we must rather conclude that the poem was
                    written by another James Crichton, or by some person who thought proper to adopt
                    his name.</p></note> This act of base ferocity was perpetrated on the third of
                    July 1583, when Crichton had nearly completed the twenty-third year of his
                    age.</p>
                <p>The elegance of his person had procured him the admiration of those who were
                    unable to estimate the powers of his mind. His countenance is described as
                    beautiful; but his right eye was marked, if not somewhat disfigured, by a red
                    spot, or, as Manutius describes it, a red rose by which it was surrounded. His
                    reputation as a scholar did not render him indifferent to the more superficial
                    accomplishments of a gentleman: his address was courteous, and he was a
                    proficient in dancing, as well as in the gymnastic and martial exercises to
                    which youths of his condition were then addicted.</p>
                <p>The unrivalled fame of this young scholar is certainly allied to romance; but, on
                    the other hand, it is very difficult to imagine that it was not originally
                    founded on some qualities which eminently distinguished him from other forward
                    and aspiring youths, who at that period were sufficiently numerous in the more
                    learned countries of Europe. A reputation so splendid, and so uniformly
                    maintained, cannot reasonably be ascribed to a mere concurrence of accidental
                    circumstances. The specimens of his Latin poetry which have been preserved do
                    not indeed contain any thing very remarkable; but they are few in number, and
                    were not published by himself; nor does his reputation depend upon one species
                    of excellence. He is celebrated for the wonderful facility with which he
                    composed verses, for his knowledge of ten or twelve different languages, for his
                    acquaintance with the writings of the fathers, for his uncommon powers of
                    memory, and for his promptitude and acuteness in public disputation. We must not
                    therefore hastily conclude that he “was in Italy considered as one of those
                    literary mountebanks who were numerous in that age or that his reputation
                    chiefly depends on the romantic flights of Sir Thomas Urquhart, who wrote about
                    seventy years after his death. Joseph Scaliger, who flourished at the same
                    period with himself, who professes to have obtained his information in Italy,
                    and who besides was not too prone to admiration, mentions Crichton as a
                    prodigious genius, and indeed enumerates all the most essential qualifications
                    that are commonly ascribed to him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    considerable weight and importance. Crichton is likewise extolled in terms of
                    the highest admiration, in a work published so early as the year 1609 by Dr

                <p>To the early testimonies which we have already produced, many others, somewhat
                    more recent, might easily be added; and we are fully prepared to acquiesce in

                    suppress as surpassing credibility, yet we shall, upon incontestible authority,
                    relate enough to rank him among prodigies.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    copious account of this renowned youth, has legitimately applied the test of
                    criticism to several of the early notices; and many of his strictures,
                    particularly those on Urquhart and Mackenzie, every person of a sober judgment
                    must admit to be too well founded. We have however placed no reliance on such
                    authorities, but have derived all our materials from better sources. “He
                    appears,” says this biographer, “to have had a fine person, to have been adroit
                    in his bodily exercises, to have possessed a peculiar facility in learning
                    languages, to have enjoyed a remarkably quick and retentive memory, and to have
                    excelled in a power of declamation, a fluency of speech, and a readiness of
                    reply. His knowledge, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753395"

                    years; and this, in conjunction with his other qualities, enabled him to shine
                    in public disputation. But whether his knowledge and learning were accurate or
                    profound, may justly be questioned; and it may equally be doubted whether he
                    would have arisen to any extraordinary degree of eminence in the literary world.
                    It will always be reflected upon with regret, that his early and untimely death
                    prevented this matter from being brought to the test of experiment.”<note

                    ascertain the real state of the question. In a youth of twenty-three, whatever
                    superiority of intellect he may possess, we do not expect to find the erudition
                    of Scaliger or Salmasius. Those who extol Crichton as a very extraordinary
                    person, do not necessarily suppose that his attainments exceeded the limits of
                    human genius: but they may reasonably believe that in various departments of
                    science and literature he arrived at a degree of proficiency wonderfully
                    premature; that he evinced great energy of application, with unusual powers of
                    memory; and that of the knowledge which lie so rapidly acquired, he possessed so
                    ready a command, together with so much promptitude and acuteness of mental
