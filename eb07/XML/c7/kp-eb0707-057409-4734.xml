                <p><label type="entry">CYMBAL</label> (κυ <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> α∕3αλov), a
                    musical instrument in use among the ancients. The cymbal was made of brass, like
                    our kettle-drums, and, as some think, in the same form, but smaller, and of
                    different use. Ovid applies to cymbals the epithet of <hi rend="italic"
                    >genialia,</hi> because they were used at weddings and other diversions.
                    Cassiodorus and Isidore denominate this instrument <hi rend="italic"
                    >acetabulum,</hi> the name of a cup or cavity of a bone in which another is
                    articulated; and Xenophon compares it to a horse’s hoof; whence it must have
                    been hollow. But, in reality, the ancient cymbals appear to have been different
                    from our kettledrums, and their use of another kind; for to their exterior
                    cavity was fastened a handle, from which circumstance Pliny compares them to the
                    upper part of the thigh, and Rabanus to phials.</p>
                <p>They were struck against each other in cadence, and made a very acute sound.
                    Their invention was attributed to Cybele, and hence their use in feasts and
                    sacrifices; but setting aside this occasion, they were seldom used except by '
                    dissolute and effeminate people. Μ. Lampe, who has written expressly on the
                    subject, attributes the invention of these instruments to the Curetes, or
                    inhabitants of Mount Ida, in Crete; and it is certain they, as well as the
                    Corybantes or guards of the kings of Crete, and those of Rhodes and Samothracia,
                    were reputed to excel in the music of the cymbal.</p>
                <p>The Jews had their cymbals, or at least instruments which translators render
                    cymbals; but as to their matter and form, critics are by no means agreed. The
                    modern cymbal is a mean instrument, chiefly in use among vagrants, gypsies, and
                    such like persons. In consists of steel wire arranged in a triangular form,
                    whereupon are passed five rings, which are touched and shifted along the
                    triangle with an iron rod held in the left hand, while it is supported in the
                    right by a ring, to give it the freer motion. Durandus states that the monks
                    used the word <hi rend="italic">cymbal</hi> for the cloister-bell used to call
                    them to the refectory.</p>
