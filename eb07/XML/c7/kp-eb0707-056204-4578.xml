                <p><label type="entry">CUTCH</label>, a province of the south-western extremity of
                    Hindustan, situated between the 68th and 72d degrees of east longitude, and the
                    22d and 24th of north latitude. It is a peninsulated tract of land, inclosed
                    towards the west by the eastern branch of the Indus or the Korce; on the south
                    by the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Cutch; <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754591"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4591-0563"/>and on the north and east, towards the interior,
                    by the great Northern Runn, an extensive salt morass or lake, which from May to
                    October is flooded with salt water, and communicates in its greatest extent with
                    the Gulf of Cutch on the west, and the Gulf of Cambay on the east, these two
                    divisions being united during the monsoon.</p>
                <p>The interior of Cutch is studded with hills of considerable elevation, and a
                    range of mountains runs through it from east to west, many of them of the most
                    fantastic shapes, with large insulated masses of rock scattered in all
                    directions. In the intervening valleys the country is not deficient in fertility
                    and verdure, and is sufficiently productive in all cases where the nature of the
                    government permits the cultivator to enjoy the fruits of his labour. But this
                    very seldom happens. Many of the hills are covered with jungle, and with the
                    strongholds and dens of petty chiefs, who sometimes protect, but more frequently
                    issue forth to plunder, the lower country. The general appearance of Cutch is
                    barren and uninteresting; the greater part is a rock destitute of soil, and
                    presenting the wildest aspect; the ground is cold, poor, and sterile; the rains
                    are generally scanty, and often fail altogether; and the whole face of the
                    country bears marks of volcanic action. From the violence of tyranny, and the
                    rapine of a disorderly banditti, by which this district has from time immemorial
                    been infested, as well as from shocks of earthquakes, the villages have a
                    ruinous and dilapidated appearance; and, with the exception of a few fields in
                    their neighbourhood, the country presents a rocky and sandy waste, with in many
                    places scarcely a show of vegetation. Water is scarce and brackish, and is
                    chiefly found at the bottom of low ranges of hills, which abound in some parts;
                    and the inhabitants of the extensive sandy tracts suffer greatly from the want
                    of it. Mrs Elwood, who visited this country in her overland journey to India,
                    observes, that “she could imagine that Cutch had been originally a rocky island
                    of volcanic production, thrown up at some great convulsion of nature, and that
                    in the course of ages soil had been washed down by the Indus, the Bhunni, the
                    Puddar, and other streams, which now lose themselves in the sand.” Owing to the
                    uncertainty of the periodical rains in Cutch, the country is liable to severe
                    famines, which, along with the internal broils by which it has been harassed,
                    have greatly obstructed cultivation, and thinned the inhabitants, many of whom
                    have been induced to emigrate to Bombay and Gujerat; and, in addition to all
                    these evils, an uncommonly violent earthquake, which occurred on the 16th of
                    June 1819, nearly destroyed Bhooj, the capital, and greatly injured the towns of
                    Anjar, Mandavie, and Moondria or Mundra. The soil of Cutch produces grain,
                    cotton, tobacco, ghee, &amp;c.; and iron and coal have been discovered, the
                    latter near the surface of the ground, on the banks of one of the rivers, seven
                    miles north-east of Bhooj, but it is not in general use as fuel.</p>
                <p>The Runn, which communicates with the Gulf of Cutch, and sweeps round the
                    northern side of that province, is a very extensive salt morass, varying in
                    breadth from five to eighty miles across, and during the rains nearly impassable
                    for horsemen. The total area of this immense morass may be estimated at about
                    8000 square miles, without including any portion of the Gulf of Cutch, which is
                    in many parts so shallow as to resemble a marshy fen rather than an arm of the
                    sea. The Runn is said to be formed by the overflow of the river Puddar and the
                    Gulf of Cutch I during the monsoon; but in December it is quite dry, and in most
                    places hard. The wild ass is very common on the borders of this lake, being seen
                    in herds of from sixty to seventy at a time.</p>
                <p>The temperature of Cutch during the hot season is high, the thermometer
                    frequently rising to 100° or 105°; and in the months of April and May, clouds of
                    dust and sand, blown about by hurricanes, which are common in these months,
                    envelope the houses, and the glass windows scarcely afford any protection. The
                    hot wind in May is so scorching that it has been compared to the feeling which
                    would be experienced on standing near a quantity of burning grass. For nine
                    months of the year the climate is comparatively temperate and agreeable; but the
                    approach of October is equally dreaded both by the native and European
                    population as extremely unhealthy, and at the close of the monsoon the
                    oppression of the atmosphere is described as being excessive. The influence of
                    the monsoon is greatly moderated before it reaches this country, and the rains
                    sometimes fail altogether; but although in this case the necessary consequences
                    are want and misery to the great body of the people, yet these dry seasons are
                    far more favourable to the health of Europeans. In 1825, when the monsoon rains
                    were copious, the country was extremely unhealthy; and, on the other hand, the
                    years 1823 and 1824 were equally remarkable for salubrity and for drought. The
                    monsoon generally sets in with great violence from the north-east before it
                    settles in the south-west. The prevailing wind is westerly, and it blows west by
                    south and west by north ten months in the year. The easterly winds, which do not
                    blow more than a month in the year, are always unhealthy and unpleasant, and
                    bring with them, if they continue long, epidemics and locusts. Cutch is
                    considered unhealthy by the natives from other parts of the country; and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Df</hi> Burnes, who was stationed there, and gives an account
                    of its medical topography, mentions that he has known many persons from Bombay,
                    especially servants, who were perfectly useless from continued sickness in
                    Cutch, but who recovered their health the moment they had left it. He also adds,
                    that he never was at any station where recoveries from fever were so tedious and
                    incomplete. The hospital returns do not, however, he adds, show any
                    extraordinary sickness. The cholera, that dreadful scourge of Europe as well as
                    of India, has made no progress in Cutch. The most common diseases among the
                    natives are fever and rheumatism; and fever is also the prevailing disease among
                    Europeans, the first attacks of which are always the most dangerous.<note

                    the Court of Sinde; also a Sketch of the History of Cutch, &amp;c. By J. Burnes,
                    Surgeon to the Presidency at Bhooj. 1831.</p></note> “These,” Dr Burnes
                    mentions, “are generally in the form of bilious remittents, leaving a tendency
                    behind them to intermittent fever, liable to produce a paroxysm on any exciting
                    cause ;” and in elucidation of this, he mentions, that of five officers resident
                    in Cutch, of whom he is himself one, they are all subject to periodical attacks,
                    and scarcely at any time enjoy six months uninterrupted health. These, however,
                    are not severe, and easily yield to the remedy of sulphate of quinine, without
                    any serious injury to the constitution. There are some stations at Cutch
                    particularly noxious, such as Narrona, a village in a marsh twenty-four miles
                    north-east of Bhooj, near the Runn; and Luckput Bunder, remarkable for the
                    badness of its water.</p>
                <p>The principal towns are Bhooj, Anjar, Jharrah, Kunt-cote, and Kuttaria. The
                    principal sea-ports are Mandavie and Mundra. The town best known to Europeans is
                    Bhooj, which is situated inland, and is surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills,
                    some of which approach within <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754604"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4604-0564"/>three or four miles of the city. The hill of
                    Bhoojeah, on which the fort is situated, and under the south-west angle of which
                    is the cantonment of the Cutch brigade, rises to the height of 500 feet in the
                    middle of the plain, and is detached from other high ground. The residency is
                    four miles distant in a westerly direction. There are many mountain streams, but
                    no navigable rivers. They scarcely contain any water except in the rainy season,
                    when they are very full and rapid, and discharge themselves into the Runn, all
                    along the coast of which the wells and springs are more or less impregnated with
                    common salt, and other saline ingredients.</p>
                <p>Various causes have contributed to thin the population of this country. In 1812
                    it was ravaged by a famine and pestilence, which destroyed a great proportion of
                    its inhabitants; according to some accounts nearly one half. This, joined to the
                    tyranny and violence of the government until the year 1819, and more lately to a
                    succession of unfavourable seasons, has forced many of the cultivators to remove
                    to Sinde and other countries. At present the inhabitants may be estimated at
                    350,000, of whom one third are Mahommedans, and the remainder Hindus of various
                    castes, resembling in their habits and manners those of other parts of India.
                    The Jharejah Rajpoots form a particular class, being the aristocracy of the
                    country; and all are more or less connected with the .family of the Rao or
                    prince. There are in Cutch about 250 of these Jharejah chiefs, who all claim
                    their descent from Sacko Goraro, a prince who reigned in Sinde about a thousand
                    years ago. From him also the prince is lineally descended, and he is the liege
                    lord of whom all the chiefs or nobles hold their lands in feu, for services
                    which they or their ancestors had performed, or in virtue of their relationship
                    to the family. They are all termed the brotherhood of the Rao, and supposed to
                    be his hereditary advisers, and their possessions arc divided among their male
                    children; and to prevent the breaking down of their properties, the necessary
                    consequence of this law <hi rend="subscript"> vj</hi> of inheritance, there is
                    no doubt that infanticide is common among them, and that it extends to the male
                    as well as the female descendants. The British have exerted their influence to
                    check this inhuman practice; but it is so interwoven with the state of manners
                    and property, that it is still carried on in the private recesses of the
                    Jharejah’s forts, where it is impossible to watch them. They consider it as
                    unlawful to marry any female of their own tribe, being all descended from a
                    common parent. They accordingly marry into the families of other Rajpoots; and
                    to this unfortunate regulation may be chiefly ascribed the destruction of all
                    the female children. The Jharejabs have a tradition that when they entered Cutch
                    they were Mahommedans, but that they afterwards adopted the customs and religion
                    of the Hindus. It is certain, indeed, that they still retain many Mahommedan
                    customs. They take oaths equally on the Koran or on the Shastras; they employ
                    Mussulman books; they eat from their hands; the Rao, when he appears in public,
                    alternately worships God in a Hindu pagoda and a Mahommedan mosque; and he fits
                    out annually at Mandavie a ship for the conveyance of pilgrims to Mecca, who are
                    maintained during the voyage chiefly by the liberality of the prince. The
                    Mahommedans in Cutch are of the same degenerate caste with those usually found
                    in the western parts of India. The Mecanahs form a particular class, who claim
                    the same descent as the Jharejabs, and boast of their constancy to the
                    Mahommedan creed, while the latter apostatized; but they have now entirely
                    degenerated, being little better than banditti, always ready to commit outrages,
                    and to sally out in disorderly bands to plunder the peaceful country. Such has
                    been the weakness and tyranny of the rulers of Cutch, that they have frequently
                    had recourse to these wretched auxiliaries in order to aid them in their
                    inordinate exactions, while at ' other times they recruited the army from the
                    same race. They were nearly extirpated under the rigorous rule of Futtch
                    Mahommed, but of late years they have returned in considerable numbers to their
                    villages among the hills. In the seasons of scarcity of 1823 and 1824 many of
                    them emigrated to Sindc, where, joining with other adventurers, they formed
                    disorderly bands, who made forays into Cutch, several villages of which they
                    plundered and burned. The natives are in general of a stronger and stouter make,
                    and even handsomer, than those of western India; and the women of the higher
                    classes are also handsome. The Ryots are described as intelligent, and the
                    workmen are justly celebrated for their ingenuity and mechanical skill. The
                    palace at Mandavie, and a tomb of one of their princes at Bhooj, are fair
                    specimens of their architectural skill. In the manufacture of gold and silver
                    ornaments they display a taste and nicety far beyond any Asiatic artists, except
                    those of China; and there is scarcely any piece of mechanism which, with some
                    instruction, may not be imitated by the goldsmiths and carpenters at Bhooj. The
                    natives of this country are in general peaceable and obedient subjects, for
                    robberies and murders are seldom committed except by the Mecanahs. They are
                    universally addicted to the use of opium,and the hookah. The quantity of opium
                    which they take is enormous; and its effects, according to Dr Burnes, are less
                    deleterious to their constitution than might be supposed; though he mentions,
                    that from being continually under its influence, they appear to be of a dull and
                    phlegmatic character.</p>
                <p>The country of Cutch was invaded about the ninth century by a body of Mahommedans
                    of the Summa tribe, who under the guidance of five brothers emigrated from
                    Sinde, and who gradually subdued or expelled the original inhabitants,
                    consisting of three distinct races. The descendants of these five leaders
                    assumed the name of Jharejah, from a chief named Jharrah, who set an example of
                    female infanticide by putting to death his seven daughters in one day. Cutch
                    continued tranquil under their sway for many years, until some family quarrel
                    arose, in which the chief of an elder branch of the tribe was murdered by a
                    rival brother. His son fled to Ahmedabad to seek the assistance of the viceroy,
                    who was married to his sister, and who reinstated him in the sovereignty of
                    Cutch, and Moorvee in Kattiwar, with the title of Rao, or Rawul, in the year
                    1519.</p>
                <p>The succession continued in the same line from the time of this prince until the
                    year 1666, when a younger brother, Pragjee, murdered bis elder brother, and
                    usurped the sovereignty. This line of princes continued till the year 1760
                    without any remarkable event, when, in the reign of Rao Gore, the country was
                    invaded four times by the Sindians, who wasted it with fire and sword. The reign
                    of this prince, as well as that of his son Rao Rahi-den, by whom he was
                    succeeded in 1778, was marked by cruelty and blood. The latter prince was
                    dethroned, and, being in a state of mental derangement, was during his lifetime
                    confined by Futtch Mahommed, a native of Sinde, who continued, with a short
                    interval, in which the party of the legal heirs, Bhyjee Bawa, gained the
                    ascendency, to rule the country until his death in 1813. It was in the reign of
                    Futtch Mahommed that a communication first took place With the British
                    government. During the contests for the sovereignty between this usurper and the
                    legal heir, the leader of the royal party, Hunsraj, the governor of Mandavie,
                    sought the aid of the British. But no closer connection followed at that time
                    than an agreement for the suppression of piracy, or of any inroads of troops to
                    the eastward of the Runn, or Gulf of Cutch; <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754617"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4617-0565"/>and in return the Company’s government agreed to
                    warn the rulers of Sinde against any attempt to invade the neighbouring country
                    of Cutch. But the Gulf of Cutch, notwithstanding this agreement, continued to
                    swarm with pirates, who were openly encouraged or connived at by the son of
                    Hunsraj, who had succeeded his father, as well as by Futtch Mahommed, who also
                    permitted bodies of banditti to cross into Kattiwar, which they laid waste, and
                    even proceeded to lead a force across the Ruŋn into Purkur, with a view of
                    extending his authority in that quarter. Futtch Mahommed left several sons by
                    different wives, who were competitors for the vaeant throne. Hussein Meyan
                    succeeded to a considerable portion of his father’s property and power.
                    Jugjevan, a Brahmin, the late minister of Futtch Mahommed, also received a
                    considerable share of influence; and the hatred of these two factions was
                    embittered by religious animosities, the one being Hindu and the other
                    Mahommedan. The late Rao had declared himself a Mahommedan, and his adherents
                    were preparing to inter his body in a magnificent tomb, when the Jharejabs and
                    other Hindus seized the corpse and consigned it to the flames, according to the
                    forms of their superstition. The two factions declared, the one for Ladoba, the
                    nephew of the late prince Rao Kahiden; the other for Maun Sing, his son by a
                    slave girl, who was elevated to the throne under the name of Rao Bharra, or
                    Bharmuljee.</p>
                <p>The administration of affairs was nominally in the hands of Hussein Meyan and his
                    brother Ibrahim Meyan. Many sanguinary broils now ensued, in the course of which
                    Jugjevan, with several of his family, were murdered, and the executive authority
                    was much weakened by the usurpations of the Arabs and other chiefs. In the mean
                    time lbrahim Meyan was stabbed by an assassin; and after various other scenes of
                    anarchy and blood, the RaoBharmul-jee, by general consent, resumed his lawful
                    power. But liis reign was one continued series of the grossest enormities; his
                    hostility to the British was no longer concealed; and his inroads into their
                    territories were continued with increased activity. There was no longer,
                    therefore, any room for hesitation; and accordingly a force of 10,500 men
                    crossed the Runn in November 1815, and were within five miles of Bhooj, the
                    capital of the country, when a treaty was concluded, by which the Rao Bharmuljee
                    was confirmed in his title to the throne, and agreed to pay for the losses
                    sustained by the chieftains of Kattiwar from predatory ineursions; to re-imburse
                    the expenses of the expedition, which, however, was not insisted on by the
                    British; to make himself responsible for the good conduct of his subjects; to
                    disband the Arab mercenaries; and to fix the Runn and the Gulf of Cutch as the
                    eastern boundaries of his principality, and to cede in perpetuity to the
                    British, Anjar and its dependencies. The Rao, however, was far from fulfilling
                    the terms of this treaty. He gave himself up to intemperance and the grossest
                    indulgences; and being a tool in the hands of an unprincipled faction, he gave
                    orders for the murder of his cousin Ladoba, the nephew of the late Rao; and on
                    every occasion he displayed his hostility to the British. On these grounds, it
                    was determined to depose him, and an army was assembled at Anjar under the
                    command of Sir William Keir, where it was joined by the five principal Jharejah
                    chiefs. The British force soon approached the capital, and having taken the fort
                    of Bhorjeah by assault, the Rao Bharmuljee surrendered his person to the
                    British, and was immediately placed under a guard. He has since been detained as
                    a state prisoner; and his only son, a child of three years of age, was elected
                    sovereign. A regency was appointed, of which the British resident, Captain
                    M‘Murdo, was declared president; and since this period the country, under the
                    superintending influence of the British, has enjoyed comparative
                    tranquillity.</p>
                <p>Curcιι <hi rend="smallcaps">Gunda</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">va,</hi> a district in
                    the province of Beloo- , chistan, situated at the bottom of the mountains lying
                    south-east of Kelat. It is about 150 miles in length, and forty or fifty in
                    breadth. The soil is rich, black, and loamy, and produces every species of
                    grain, as also cotton, indigo, madder, and other commodities. The rains are
                    heavy in June, July, and August; it rains also, but not so heavily, in the
                    spring months. The climate during the summer is unhealthy, owing to the simoom
                    or pestilential wind which blows at that time, by which many people lose their
                    lives. Great quantities of grain are exported from this district to the
                    sea-ports of Curaċhee and Sonmeanyq whence it is shipped to Muscat, on the coast
                    of Mekran. In unfavourable seasons it is also sent to the mountainous
                    country.</p>
