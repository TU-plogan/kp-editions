                <p><label type="entry">COFFEA</label>, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Coffee-Tree.</hi>
                    The flowers, which are produced in clusters at the root of the leaves, are of a
                    pure white, and have a very grateful odour. The fruit, which is the only useful
                    part, resembles a cherry. When it comes to be of a deep red, it is gathered for
                    the mill, in order to be manufactured into those <hi rend="italic"
                    >coffee-beans</hi> now so generally known. The mill is composed of two wooden
                    rollers, furnished with iron plates eighteen inches long and ten or twelve in
                    diameter. These movable rollers are made to approach a third, which is fixed,
                    and which is called the <hi rend="italic">chops.</hi> Above the rollers is a
                    hopper, in which is put the coffee, whence it falls between the rollers and the
                    chops, where it is stripped of its first skin, and divided into two parts, as
                    may be seen by its form after it has undergone this operation, being flat on the
                    one side and round on the other. From this machine it falls into a brass sieve,
                    where the skin drops between the wires, while the fruit slides over them into
                    baskets placed ready to receive it. It is then thrown into a vessel full of
                    water, where it soaks for one night, and is afterwards thoroughly washed. When
                    the whole is finished and well dried, it is put into another machine called the
                    <hi rend="italic">peeling-mill.</hi> This is a wooden grinder, turned vertically
                    upon its trundle by a mule or horse. In passing over the coffee it takes off the
                    parchment, or thin skin, which detaches itself from the berry in proportion as
                    it grows dry. The parchment being removed, it is taken out of this mill to be
                    put into another, which is called the <hi rend="italic">winnowing-mill.</hi>
                    This machine is provided with four pieces of tin fixed upon an axle, which is
                    turned by a slave with considerable force; and the wind produced by the motion
                    of these plates clears the coffee of all the pellicles that are mixed with it.
                    It is afterwards put upon a table, where <pb break="no" facs="nls:194747480"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-7480-0018"/>the broken berries, and any filth that may remain
                    among them, are separated by negroes; after which the coffee is fit for
                    sale.</p>
                <p>The coffee-tree is cultivated in Arabia, Persia, the East Indies, the Isle of
                    Bourbon, and several parts of America and the West Indies. It is also raised in
                    botame gardens in several parts of Europe. It delights particularly in hills and
                    mountains, where its root is almost always dry, and its head frequently watered
                    with gentle showers <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> It prefers a western aspect,
                    and ploughed ground without any appearance of grass. The plants should be placed
                    at eight feet distance from each other, and in holes twelve or fifteen feet
                    deep. If left to themselves, they would, as already observed, rise to the height
                    of sixteen or eighteen feet; but they are generally stinted to five, for the
                    convenience of gathering their fruit with the greater ease. Thus dwarfed, they
                    extend their branches so that they cover the whole spot round about them; and
                    they begin to yield fruit the third year, but are not in full bearing till the
                    fifth. With the same infirmities that most other trees are subject to, they are
                    likewise in danger of being destroyed by a worm, or by the scorching rays of the
                    sun. The hills where the coffee-trees are found have generally a gravelly or
                    chalky bottom. In the latter soil it languishes for some time and then dies; in
                    the former, its roots, which seldom fail to strike between stones, obtain
                    nourishment, and keep the tree alive and fruitful for thirty years. This is
                    nearly the period for plants of the coffee-tree. The proprietor, at the end of
                    this period, not only finds himself without trees, but has his land so reduced
                    that it is not fit for any kind of culture; and unless he be so situated that he
                    can break up a spot of virgin land, to make himself amends for that which is
                    totally exhausted by the coffee-trees, his loss is irreparable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Coffee</hi> also denotes the drink prepared from these
                    berries, which has been familiar in Europe for a hundred years, and among the
                    Turks for a hundred and seventy.</p>
                <p>Its origin is not well known. Some ascribe it to the prior of a monastery, who
                    being informed by a goatherd that his cattle, when they happened to browse on
                    the tree, remained awake and capered all night, became curious to prove its
                    virtue; and accordingly he first tried it on his monks, to prevent their
                    sleeping at matins. Others, following Schehabeddin, refer the invention of
                    coffee to the Persians, from whom it was learned in the fifteenth century by
                    Gemaleddin, mufti of Aden, a city near the mouth of the Red Sea, and who having
                    tried its virtues himself, and found that it dissipated the fumes which
                    oppressed the head, inspired joy, opened the bowels, and prevented sleep,
                    without producing any countervailing inconvenience, first recommended it to his
                    dervises, with whom he used to spend the night in prayer; and their example
                    brought coffee into vogue at Aden; the professors of the law, artisans,
                    travellers, in short, every body at Aden, drinking coffee. It next passed to
                    Mecca, where the devotees first, then the rest of the people, took coffee. From
                    Arabia Felix it passed to Cairo; and in 1511, Kahie Beg prohibited it, from a
                    persuasion that it inebriated, and inclined to things forbidden; but Sultan
                    Causon immediately after removed the prohibition, and coffee advanced from Egypt
                    to Syria and Constantinople. The dervises declaimed against it from the Alcoran,
                    which declares that coal is not of the number of thingscreated by God for food;
                    and the mufti accordingly ordered the coffee-houses to be shut; but his
                    successor declaring coffee not to be <hi rend="italic">coal,</hi> they were
                    again opened. During the war in Candia, the assemblies of newsmongers making too
                    free with state affairs, the grand visier Cuproli suppressed the coffeehouses at
                    Constantinople; but this did not prevent the public from using this beverage;
                    and it has ever since been tolerated, if not legalised. Thevenot the traveller
                    was the first who brought it into France; and a Greek servant, named Pasqua,
                    brought into England by Mr Daniel Edwards, a Turkey merchant, in 1652, first
                    commenced the profession of <hi rend="italic">coffee-man,</hi> and introduced
                    the beverage into this island.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Coffee Trade.</hi> From the great increase in the
                    consumption of coffee in this as well as in other countries, the value of the
                    article, the amount of capital and labour employed in its production, and the
                    quantity of shipping required for its transport, it has become a commodity of
                    great commercial importance. The duties which have been levied upon it have
                    varied considerably at different periods. In 1819 the duty was raised from
                    sevenpence to one shilling per lb.; and the quantity entered for home
                    consumption in 1824 was 7,993,041 lbs., yielding a revenue of L. 407,544. 4s.
                    3d. In 1824, however, the duty was lowered to sixpence per lb., and the quantity
                    entered for home consumption, in 1825, was 10,766,112 lbs. In 1828 it increased
                    to 16,522,422 lbs., and at present may be estimated at 22,000,000 lbs.,
                    producing a revenue of about L. 580,000. In the year ending January 1831, the
                    quantity imported into the united kingdom from all parts was 40,952,163 lbs.,
                    and the quantity exported to all parts 20,087,994 lbs. The following is an
                    estimate of the annual exports of coffee from the principal places where it is
                    produced, and of its annual consumption in those countries into which it is
                    imported from abroad at the present time:</p>
                <p>The diserepancy here between the supply and the demand is in some measure to be
                    accounted for from the circumstance that we are without the means of arriving at
                    very accurate conclusions, either as to the supply or the consumption of coffee.
                    The above, however, is as close an approximation to the truth as can be
                    obtained.</p>
