                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Copyright</hi> denotes the property which an author has in
                    his literary works, or which a bookseller, or any other person, may acquire by
                    purchase; a property consisting, in either case, in the exclusive right to
                    print, publish, and sell a particular work. The subject involves two important
                    inquiries; one the obligation imposed by law to sacrifice a given numbér of
                    copies to our public libraries; the other, a much more extensive, and, in a
                    public sense, more interesting question, the expediency of prolonging the
                    duration of copyright, or the exclusive property of a book. ' 1. Printing became
                    extensive in England about a century after its discovery; and it was in the year
                    1556 that a charter was granted to the Stationers’ Company, an incorporation
                    consisting, not of venders of stationery in the present sense of the word, but
                    of booksellers and printers, who, for their general benefit, determined to keep
                    at their hall a register, in which should be entered the title of every new
                    book, the name of the proprietors, and the successive transfers of the
                    copyright. By-laws were enacted by the company; fines were levied on members
                    acting in contravention of their regulations; and, in course of time, these
                    resolutions of the association were confirmed by a well-known measure of
                    government, we mean the licensing act of 1662, an act prohibiting the
                    publication of any book unless first licensed by the lord chamberlain, and
                    entered in the stationers’ register. ' In 1684 a new charter was issued to the
                    company, partly for the purpose of securing the property of books, but more with
                    the view of interposing the royal interdict on any publication at variance with
                    the arbitrary government of Charles II. In die more auspicious reigri of William
                    (1691) this act was repealed; but whilst the liberty of the press was restored,
                    the door was unluckily thrown open to infractions on literary property by
                    clandestine editions of books. It was in vain for the owner of a copyright to
                    bring an action against the trespasser; he had no other protection than common
                    law; he could recover only to the extent of the “damage proved,” that is, he
                    could not adduce evidence of the tenth, or perhaps twentieth part of the damage
                    suffered, as he could not prove the sale of one copy out of twenty. This led to
                    applications to parliament in 1703 and 1706; but no act was passed until 1709,
                    when, after much discussion, the sanction of the legislature was given to a
                    bill, of which the prominent features were two; first, an obligation to deliver
                    nine copies to as many public libraries; and next, a provision for guarding, by
                    severe penalties, the property of copyright during <hi rend="italic">fourteen
                    years.</hi> The public libraries entitled to the receipt of a copy each
                    were,</p>
                <p>The King’s Library, now transferred to the British Museum.</p>
                <p>The Bodleian at Oxford, and the University Library at Cambridge.</p>
                <p>In London, Sion College, or the Library of the London Clergy.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, the libraries of the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews,
                    and Aberdeen, with that of the Faculty of Advocates.</p>
                <p>To these were added, by a subsequent act, in 1791, two Irish libraries, viz.
                    Trinity College, Dublin, and the Society of the King’s Inns in that city, making
                    in all eleven copies to be delivered.</p>
                <p>The delivery of so many copies of every new book was a heavy sacrifice, and
                    booksellers were indefatigable in their efforts to evade it, giving at one time
                    only a single volume, and at others venturing to omit the ungracious duty
                    altogether. Hence a necessity for new acts of parliament, more particularly
                    those of 1775 and 1791. Still these acts were not sufficiently positive; and it
                    having been decided in 1798 (in the case of Beckford <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Hood), that publishers were not prevented by such irregularities from obtaining
                    damages for pirated editions, they became more and more remiss in their
                    deliveries. At last, in 1811, the university of Cambridge having determined to
                    bring the question to an issue, brought an action for the non-delivery of Fox’s
                    History, and obtained a verdict. The booksellers, finding that this act was now
                    no longer a dead letter, applied to parliament; but a committee of the House of
                    Commons, appointed in March 1813, made a report in favour of their opponents;
                    and in the succeeding spring an act was passed, confirming in the most explicit
                    terms the claims of the public libraries, who were not even required to pay any
                    proportion of the price of such books as they thought proper to require. In this
                    the law of England differs from that of other countries; in several states of
                    the continent of Europe, and in the United States of America, only one copy of a
                    book is required from an author; in France and Austria not more than two.</p>
                <p>2. For many years, we might more properly say for a couple of centuries, the
                    property of a book seems to have been considered as permanent as the property of
                    an estate; shares of literary works being bought and sold without any idea of
                    their expiring. It is not till 1709 that we discover a trace of interference
                    with its permanency, the act of that year defending it against intruders during
                    fourteen years, and <hi rend="italic">no longer.</hi> The limitation, however,
                    had no practical effect; copyright was considered as permanent both by the
                    booksellers and the public; nay by three out of the four judges of the Court of
                    King’s Bench, in the celebrated trial Millar <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Taylor,
                    which took place in 1769, and led to a very memorable display of judicial
                    erudition. The . plaintiff charged the defendants with a trespass in publishing
                    an edition of Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Seasons,</hi> of which the plaintiff
                    was the sole proprietor. Lord Mansfield, with Judges Willes and Aston, gave an
                    opinion in favour of the permanency of the copyright, in which they were
                    confirmed by Judge Blackstone; but one of their brethren, Judge Yates, took a
                    very different course, and adhered resolutely to the literal construction of the
                    act.</p>
                <p>An action for a similar trespass was some time afterwards brought before the
                    Court of Session in Scotland; the London proprietor of a copyright claiming
                    damages for an infraction by a provincial bookseller (case of Hinton <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Donaldson). Here the majority of the bench were adverse to
                    the opinion formerly delivered by Lord Mansfield, and discharged the defendant
                    without a dissentient voice, except that of the well-known Lord Monboddσ. At
                    last, in the session of 1773-4, the question came decisively before parliament,
                    the booksellers having brought in a bill for declaring copyright perpetual. This
                    bill passed the Commons, but was thrown out, after much debate, in the
                    Lords.</p>
                <p>To avoid perplexity, we shall endeavour to comprise the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pros</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cons</hi> in these various discussions in a
                    kind of; regular succession, adopting the plan of appending a re-ı joinder to
                    each argument, as the best method of doing justice to both sides.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Objection.</hi> Ideas cannot be the object of property; they
                    are not visible, tangible, or corporeal. (Judge Yates.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Answer.</hi> Whatever admits of exclusive enjoyment may be
                    property. (Hargrave.) <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751354"

                    arrive, by his own process of thought, at similar conclusions; would you deny to
                    him what you granted to his predecessor?</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is very little apprehension of such a
                    coincidence; the plans and the results of study admit of as infinite variety as
                    the human countenance; the same views or the same conclusions will never come
                    from two persons, or even from the same person at different times, in the same
                    language. At all events, an arbitrator or a court of justice can be at no loss
                    to decide whether a second publication on the same subject comes within the
                    description of plagiarism.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">0.</hi> A literary composition is undoubtedly the property of
                    the writer so long as it remains in manuscript; but by the act of publishing he
                    gives it to the world; he lets the bird fly; his property is gone. (Judge
                    Yates.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He gives the public the free use of the knowledge
                    contained in his book; but this is a very different thing from the profit as
                    publisher. The ten shillings paid for a volume entitles the reader to the use of
                    its contents, but can certainly give him no claim to the hundred pounds which
                    may be expected from a new edition. (Lords Mansfield, Judges Willes, Blackstone,
                    and Aston.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">0.</hi> It is not clear that common law ever sanctioned the
                    exclusive enjoyment of copyright. The only titles appear to have been the royal
                    patent and the license of the Stationers’ Company. (Lord Camden.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It seems to have been always taken for granted by
                    Chancery and other courts, that an exclusive right existed. There is a
                    confirmatory example in the highest quarter; the king is perpetual proprietor of
                    the right of publishing acts of parliament and all public documents. (Lord
                    Mansfield, Judges Willes, Blackstone, and Aston.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">0.</hi> The patentees of mechanical inventions possess but a
                    limited term; none of them ever advanced a claim to perpetuity. (Judge
                    Yates.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Such patentees are much sooner reimbursed than authors;
                    the fruit of their invention is of direct practical application. Besides, the
                    stranger who makes a duplicate if a machine incurs a much greater relative
                    expense than the stranger who reprints an edition of a book: in the one the
                    materials form the chief part of the cost; in the other, they are comparatively
                    insignificant, and copies may be multiplied by thousands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">O.</hi> The statute of the 8th of Queen Anne expressly limits
                    the duration of copyright; it enacts that the protecting penalties shall be in
                    force during fourteen years, and no longer. (Judge Yates.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is, no doubt, the apparent meaning of the statute,
                    but the preamble of the act declares that it is passed for the protection of
                    literature. To make the act an instrument for curtailing a literary privilege
                    would certainly be at variance with its general language. (Lord Mansfield.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">0.</hi> If such property be admitted for a time, is not the
                    term of fourteen years sufficient? What good could the public expect from the
                    writings of men so selfish as to call tor a perpetual monopoly?</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Monopoly is not the proper word; the object may be
                    attained, as will be shown presently, under modifications which insure to the
                    public a complete supply of books at reasonable prices.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">0.</hi> “Glory,” said Lord Camden, “is the reward of science,
                    and those who deserve it scorn all meaner views.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Reputation is, and always will be, the grand stimulus
                    to literary exertion, but it requires long-continued exertion; and if we do not
                    enable a writer to live by his works, we confine the possibility of acquiring
                    reputation to a very small class—to the rich, or to those who derive an income
                    from other means. Such, in fact, has hitherto been the case: standard works have
                    been attempted onD by men who, like Gibbon, possessed patrimony, or who. like
                    Robertson and Hume, arrived at the possession of income from other sources. No
                    one imagines that our military or naval officers follow their profession for the
                    sake of pay; yet no one would propose to abridge it on the ground of reputation
                    being their primary object.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">0.</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> It was not for gain,” said Lord
                    Camden, “that Bacon, Newton, Milton, and Locke, instructed the world.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Each of these distinguished men was obliged to trespass
                    on the time devoted to literature, and to seek an income from public
                    employments. How much better would it have been could they have given an
                    undivided and uninterrupted attention to their favourite pursuits?</p>
                <p>In comparing these various arguments, the balance is evidently on the side of the
                    advocates of exclusive right in every point except one—the interpretation of the
                    statute of Queen Anne. There the words “fourteen years and no longer” are too
                    pointed to admit of the construction put upon them by Lord Mansfield. In the
                    beginning of 1774, when the question came before the House of Lords, the judges
                    attended and delivered their opinions at length, Lord Mansfield advocating the
                    cause of permanency, while Judge Yates, now supported by his brethren Baron Eyre
                    and Baron Perrot, asserted once more the necessity of limitation. Thurlow, at
                    that time attorney-general, addressed the House, as a councillor, against the
                    perpetuity, and found an ardent auxiliary in Lord Camden; but the opposite side
                    was ably supported by Dunning, by Solicitor-General Wedderburne, and by Lord
                    Lyttleton. One party contended that fame was the only true reward of literary
                    exertion; whilst the others maintained, that without an adequate pecuniary
                    provision, the public would be deprived of many useful works. The house,
                    however, appear to have been alarmed at the idea of perpetuity, and finally
                    decided that the exclusive right should last only “fourteen years, with a
                    contingent fourteen, if the author happened to be alive at the end of the first
                    period.”</p>
                <p>The grand error on the part of the booksellers lay in demanding <hi rend="italic"
                    >perpetuity</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">prolongation.</hi> The idea of
                    perpetuity has in it something very serious, and will not be sanctioned by a
                    legislature without the clearest proof of public advantage; it would be
                    premature to ask it even in the present age. They ought to have drawn the
                    attention of parliament to the number of years required to compose a standard
                    work, and to the further length of time necessary to give it effectual currency;
                    appealing to the good sense of the legislature whether fourteen or even
                    twenty-eight years were not wholly inadequate to remunerate these multiplied
                    labours.</p>
                <p>Foiled in the House of Peers, the booksellers determined to do what men always
                    will endeavour to do when unjustly controlled, namely, to evade that which they
                    cannot resist. They resorted to the alternative of giving an ostensible renewal
                    to a work, by adding, at the end of the term of each copyright, notes and other
                    appendages, which remained their property during another period of fourteen
                    years, and afforded them a kind of guarantee in two ways; <hi rend="italic"
                    >first,</hi> because a competitor, whatever he might do with the original text,
                    could not touch the <hi rend="italic">addenda;</hi> and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >next,</hi> because the great body of publishers residing in London acted as a
                    corporation, and combined to give circulation to works thus edited, to the
                    complete exclusion of rival impressions.</p>
                <p>The law continued on this footing for forty years, the; term of copyright
                    receiving no extension till 1814, On that; occasion it was soon apparent that
                    the universities would 1 carry the point of the delivery copies, and the only
                    alternative was, to seek an indemnity in an extension of copyright to
                    twenty-eight years; that is, by rendering the last <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194751367" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1367-0315"/>fourteen <hi rend="italic"
                    >certain</hi> instead of contingent. This was obtained, and here ends the
                    historical part of our sketch.</p>
                <p>We are now to enter on the grand question, of the advantages of a further
                    prolongation of the term of copyright; a question that has never yet been
                    brought fully before the public.</p>
                <p>We shall begin by examining a very material point,— we mean the dispositions and
                    habits of those with whom authors have principally to deal. And here, from long
                    familiarity with men of business, we entreat the particular attention of our
                    literary brethren; for, however anxious to be instrumental in procuring them
                    relief, we must not hesitate to point out their errors or misconceptions. Of the
                    surprising quantity of publications issuing annually from the press, not a tenth
                    part are the production of writers of established character; the rest proceed
                    from candidates whose reputation is yet to make. In what manner are booksellers
                    to form an estimate of the mass of unknown manuscripts thus laid before them?
                    Their own habits are not those of study, but of business, and they must consign
                    the task of examination to friends, who have been called not inaptly “literary
                    tasters.” Need we wonder that the patience of the critic should be put to a
                    severe test by the general mediocrity of these performances, and that his report
                    should, in general, be so little decisive, that booksellers fall into the habit
                    of putting one work on a par with another, and of subjecting them, in the mode
                    of publishing, to the application of a common rule? It has become the practice
                    of some bouses to decline any other terms with an author unknown to the public,
                    than those of defraying the paper and print, in return for the manuscript, and
                    the understanding that the profit of the edition, <hi rend="italic">if</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">there be any,</hi> shall be shared equally between the bookseller
                    and the author.</p>
                <p>Now this plan of publishing, however natural in the present state of the law, is
                    replete with mischief to all parties, bringing forth a mass of books which ought
                    never to see the light, and which, in truth, would never have been published
                    could the publisher have foreseen their failure. It is a remarkable fact,
                    disclosed by a parliamentary discussion, that only “<hi rend="italic"
                    >one</hi><hi rend="italic">publication in eight</hi><hi rend="italic">is</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">found</hi><hi rend="italic">to come to a second edition.”</hi>
                    (See <hi rend="italic">Evidence before the</hi><hi rend="italic">Copyright
                    Committee in</hi> 1814.) The unfortunate limitation of copyright discourages
                    literary men from the continued labour necessary to produce standard works; and
                    the bookseller, tempted to assail the public by the attraction of novelty, goes
                    on publishing books by the dozen, in the hope that some lucky chance may make up
                    for past disappointments.</p>
                <p>All this shows that, in the great majority of cases, the contract between an
                    author and a bookseller is made without previous data, and is nothing more or
                    less than what is commonly called a blind bargain. Dr Paley, on finishing the
                    manuscript of his <hi rend="italic">Moral and Political Philosophy,</hi>
                    tendered the copyright of it to a bookseller for L.300, and was offered in
                    return L.250, exactly in the way that a cautious purchaser bids for unknown
                    merchandise. During this negotiation, a brother of the trade, apprised of the
                    value of Paley’s work, came boldly forward and offered L.1000 for the copyright.
                    The author having consented to give the party first in treaty the previous
                    option, the latter now saw the matter in a new light, and ended by paying four
                    times the amount of his original offer.</p>
                <p>No notion is more general among authors than that booksellers make rapid fortunes
                    at their expense. One writer has published, that Jacob Tonson and his nephew
                    died worth L.200,000 (D’Israeli’s <hi rend="italic">Calamities of Authors,</hi>
                    I vol. i. p. 29); and not one reader in twenty will stop to question the
                    accuracy of the allegation. It is our firm belief that such a sum was never
                    possessed by any bookseller, or partnership of booksellers, that ever existed.
                    Among them, as in all lines of business, there are examples of considerable
                    capitals; but these arc realized only in the case of long-established concerns,
                    and after a progress of acquisition infinitely slower than the angry imagination
                    of a disappointed author allows him to believe· In his eagerness to take for
                    granted that his publishers are getting rich at his expense, he forgets the
                    history of the fathers and grandfathers of the present men, and omits to mark
                    the slow steps by which they paved the way for the eventual rise of their
                    descendants. He fails, likewise, to scrutinize another material point, namely,
                    the <hi rend="italic">quantum</hi> which a close calculator would deduct from
                    the fortunes so liberally assigned by report to booksellers. The latter, like
                    all men in business, are desirous of passing for affluent; but if so few
                    publications are found to be successful, must there not follow a large abatement
                    from the imagined extent of their annual gains?</p>
                <p>It is, on various accounts, a matter of regret that the limited profits of
                    bookselling business should not be better understood by literary men. The
                    discovery of it would remove the film from their eyes, would lessen greatly
                    their habits of complaint, and would lead to cordial co-operation for redress of
                    their common grievances. A small oiler from a bookseller, as in the case of
                    Paley, is indicative, not of a design to overreach, but of an apprehension that
                    to give more would be to injure himself. On the other hand, we are by no means
                    disposed to launch out into a panegyric of the liberality either of particular
                    individuals, or of the body at large. Like other men of calculation, they
                    naturally mete out their advances, not by attachment to the writer, but by the
                    extent of the expected return. A large allowance for a finished book denotes a
                    confidence of extracting a still larger from the public; while the scanty, and
                    apparently niggardly, payment of an unknown author, is a token of the fear and
                    trembling with which a bookseller handles a production of doubtful promise.</p>
                <p>The agreement between a bookseller and a new author proceeds commonly as follows:
                    The latter having prepared a work, of which he has high hopes, but in which he
                    has not had either guidance or advice, sets out by making an offer of his
                    manuscript; and, after some time taken for consideration, he is answered, that
                    his name not being yet known to the public, the publishers cannot take on
                    themselves to make him a payment for his labour, but are willing to give it to
                    the world on their joint account. This leads to a compact, in terms somewhat
                    like the following :—</p>
                <p>It is agreed between Messrs Y and Company, booksellers, and Mr Z, that Messrs Y
                    and Company shall print and publish for their account, jointly with Mr Z, in two
                    volumes octavo, his historical work on , Mr Z</p>
                <p>supplying the manuscript, and Messrs Y and Company taking on themselves the
                    paper, printing, and other publishing charges; the statement of the account to
                    be made up every year at midsummer; and when, after deducting the various
                    publishing expenses, there shall appear a balance of profit, the same to be
                    equally shared between Mr Z and Messrs Y and Company. The books to be accounted
                    for at the regular trade sale price.</p>
                <p>The publication now takes place; and in a twelvemonth after, an account is made
                    up in the following form :—</p>

                <p>Next year the account is considerably shorter, the charges consisting only of
                    advertising and interest of money; but the attraction of novelty having gone
                    off, the sale is also less, and does not probably exceed eighty copies, leaving
                    still an adverse balance of L.100. The bookseller goes on with mercantile
                    punctuality to render him a further account; but the scale is now in a state of
                    progressive decrease, and does not, for the third year, exceed fifty copies,
                    leaving still an unfavourable balance of L.80. The author now loses patience,
                    and entreats the bookseller to relieve him of all responsibility, by taking over
                    the remaining copies, and considering the account as closed. Such is the fate of
                    five-sixths of the books, great and small, that come before the public. Composed
                    without the benefit of experience, they are unprofitable to the publisher,
                    uninstructive to the reader, and discouraging to the author.</p>
                <p>If we arc suspected of stating an extreme case, let another be supposed, in which
                    the author is less of a novice, and in which a bookseller, from confidence
                    equally in him and in the subject, ventures to make an advance of money, and to
                    agree to pay a fixed price for the copyright. An arrangement is made for
                    bringing out the work against a given time, and the writer proceeds with* all
                    the ardour attendant on a new enterprise. Authors, however, were never
                    remarkable for accurate calculation, or rather their undertakings are almost
                    always found to require more time and labour than they had anticipated; the
                    prescribed time expires, and the bookseller agrees to postpone it for another
                    twelvemonth. This also passes away; the publishing season draws near; the work
                    is still unfinished; but the author is impatient of further labour; and the
                    bookseller thinks it high time to get a return for his money. The work goes to
                    press, and comes out without either <hi rend="italic">a</hi> correction or an
                    acknowledgment of its imperfections, unless the author be particularly modest,
                    in which case the public is requested, in a well-turned apology, to make
                    allowance for his multiplied avocations and the urgent nature of the subject.
                    This is the case with almost all the better class of our new publications; the
                    sale, in such cases, is somewhat less unfavourable than the specimen given
                    above; but four or five years are requisite to run oft' an edition; and, on
                    coming a second time before the public, it is necessary for the author to do
                    what should have been done at first, revise and correct the whole. A second
                    edition comes out, but under considerable disadvantages; the attraction of
                    novelty is gone, or greatly impaired; the number of readers is lessened by those
                    who have purchased copies of the first edition; and the book has been estimated,
                    in reviews and elsewhere, by an unfavourable standard. The bookseller is thus
                    curtailed of profit, the author of reputation; yet each has the happy gift of
                    throwing blame off his own shoulders; the publisher attributing the failure to
                    the distraction of the public attention by some unlucky novelty; whilst the
                    other vents his complaints on the incurable frivolity of the age. In truth,
                    neither of the parties is much to blame; their conduct is the natural result of
                    their situation. The haste of authors, and the acquiescence of the booksellers,
                    are mainly owing to the short-lived tenure of the fruits of their labour;
                    the'habits of the one and the calculations of the other having been all along
                    adapted to this state of things.</p>
                <p>Is there, then, no remedy for so mortifying a state of things—no method of
                    relieving the public from such an unprofitable expenditure of time and
                    attention? Some have been desirous to call in the patronage of government, and
                    have argued, that literature can never, like the coarser objects of industry,
                    find adequate re-payment in the fruit of its exertions. It is, indeed, a current
                    subject of complaint among authors, that so few provisions for life should be
                    appropriated to literary men. <hi rend="italic">Sed non tali aux-{ ilio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi> whatever be their distress, we beg to deprecate any
                    interference on the part of government. No engine is so formidable in the hands
                    of an arbitrary ruler as the press. Look at the degraded picture exhibited by
                    the French press in the reign of Bonaparte, and you will find men, who, under
                    the auspices of freedom, would have acted an independent part, tempted,
                    threatened, and gradually compelled to become the advocates of a tyrant, and to
                    participate in the guilt of riveting the chains of their countrymen. It is in
                    vain even for a liberal legislature or a disinterested sovereign to attempt to
                    make up for the deficient reward of literary labour, by granting pensions or by
                    creating places for men of letters. These measures, though apparently
                    beneficial, carry with them all the disadvantages of irregular and unnatural
                    interference. A literary man promoted, as is not unusual in France, to a
                    government employment, is withdrawn from his proper sphere of utility; he
                    becomes lost to general reasoning and liberal views, amidst the endless details
                    of practical routine. The pension granted to Johnson by Lord Bute was generally
                    approved, both as the fair reward of past industry, and as a seasonable relief
                    to pecuniary difficulty; but what was the consequence? It fostered his natural
                    indolence, prevented the composition of further works, and, by enabling him to
                    live in idleness, rendered him perpetually dissatisfied with himself. Had the
                    property of his literary labour been permanent, he would have received fully as
                    much from the booksellers, and might have continued his proper pursuits under
                    circumstances progressively improving, without incurring the humiliation of
                    dependence, or degrading his name by the composition of party pamphlets.</p>
                <p>It is equally vain for zealous friends to attempt making up for the inadequacy in
                    question, by procuring private subscriptions for a work; for though it may be
                    successful in a pecuniary sense, the step is humiliating to the author, is
                    liable to abuse, and is, besides, an interference with the proper business of a
                    bookseller. One of the most splendid of such examples was Pope’s translation of
                    <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> an undertaking where the
                    importance of the task and the talents of the translator called equally for
                    liberal remuneration. Pope was perfectly ready to sacrifice several precious
                    years for the sake of eventual competency, and he found in his friends,
                    particularly in Swift, a most zealous promoter of his views. Proposals were
                    circulated, liberal subscriptions were obtained, and a favourable bargain made
                    with the bookseller; the translation of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> was
                    executed, and will for ever remain a proof of the perseverance to which an
                    author may be prompted by the love of fame, when relieved from pecuniary'
                    pressure, and enabled to give long-continued labour to his task, So far all was
                    well; but the success of this first undertaking induced Pope to resort to the
                    same method for publishing a translation of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi>
                    which proved far inferior, being performed either hastily by himself, or by two
                    coadjutors, whose respective contributions, though not altogether concealed,
                    were unfairly represented to the world. Could such an abuse have taken place had
                    subscription been out of the question, and had the remuneration of Pope been
                    proportioned to the eventual sale of his book? The public would in that case
                    have had a translation of equal merit with its predecessor, and Pope would have
                    been spared the reproach of a literary' imposition.</p>
                <p>The least exceptionable mode of rewarding literary eminence is by church
                    preferment in the southern part of the kingdom, and by admission to professorial
                    chairs in the north. But the extent of both, particularly of the latter, is
                    limited, and does not always place a man in that station where he can be most
                    useful, or in the mode of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751393"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1393-0317"/>employment most congenial to his habits. Both,
                    besides, require more of connection, of interest, and of management, than
                    commonly falls to the lot of a retired student.</p>
                <p>The only effectual plan is, to find the means of relief in the prosecution of
                    literature itself; to relieve it from existing shackles, and to allow every
                    writer to reap his reward in thejsale of his books, exactly as is done in other
                    kinds of employment. This is all that literature wants, and all that it is good
                    for her to have. She will then make no claims to patronage from government, no
                    appeal to the subscriptions of private friends; nor will appointments in the
                    church or in universities be an object of indecent contention; they will be
                    coveted by a smaller number, by those only whose particular habits fit them for
                    such situations. Perpetuity of copyright is as much the right of the author or
                    purchaser of a manuscript, as of the builder or purchaser of a house; and the
                    public will never reap its full harvest of advantage from literary compositions
                    till the law be made to confirm the claim of equity. But as this opinion is as
                    yet far from being general, we shall not press it to its extent, but demand it
                    only for a specific period, leaving the public to enact perpetuity at a future
                    time, when it shall have had undoubted evidence of the beneficial effect of
                    prolongation.</p>
                <p>Let us inquire if we can take a useful lesson from the example of our continental
                    neighbours. In France, copyright has received in the present age several
                    prolongations: limited at first to the author’s life, it was extended in 1793 to
                    ten years, and in 1805 to no less than twenty years after his death. Taking
                    twenty years as the average of life after the publication of a work, we have
                    here in the whole a medium term of forty years, which is considerably longer
                    than ours. But the grand practical example is to be found in Germany. In that
                    country <hi rend="italic">copyright is perpetual</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and though the sales of editions are small, in consequence of the facility of
                    importing clandestine impressions from the territory of neighbour ing princes,
                    such is the benefit of permanency, that Germany sends forth more works of
                    lasting use than any other country in Europe. .Compare their performances in
                    statistics and geography with those of France, England, or Italy, and we shall
                    be surprised at their superior research, and their careful examination of the
                    necessary documents. It is at present proposed to effect a most important
                    improvement in the state of book property in Germany, by rendering the
                    protection general throughout the empire, and by enacting that a clandestine
                    edition published in a different state shall be subject to the same penalties as
                    if published in the country of the writer. The great powers, Austria and
                    Prussia, are understood to favour this measure, and some objections raised by
                    the lesser states are likely to be overcome; and if the decision of the Diet be
                    favourable, Germany will take the lead of all Europe in the number of standard
                    works. <hi rend="subscript"> βf</hi>,</p>
                <p>There is evidently no reason that the term of book property should have a
                    reference to the probable time of an author’s life; it is much more equitable to
                    prolong it to a considerable time after his death, as a provision for a family
                    deprived of its natural protector. Our present term of twenty-eight years
                    appears at first sight no inconsiderable tenure; but the circulation of literary
                    works is often only beginning to become considerable when the property is
                    drawing to a close. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> remained in comparative
                    obscurity for many years; and on coming nearer our own times we find Hume’s
                    early works, and even the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">History,</hi>
                    falling dead-born from the press; whilst Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Wealth of
                    Nations,</hi> the labour of half a lifetime, went through only two editions in
                    the course of eight years. No wonder then that a bookseller should pause before
                    giving a large price for a short-lived possession. But prolong copyright, and
                    you relieve him from&lt; the necessity of laying stress on the sale of this or
                    that season; you point his hopes to eventual and permanent circulation; and you
                    put it in bis power to pledge himself for a considerable sum, because he is
                    justified by the prospect of its return. An author thus supported and encouraged
                    will no longer scruple to give year after year to studying a subject thoroughly,
                    and bringing out his book in a finished state.</p>
                <p>We shall now put these suggestions into a specific form, less under the idea of
                    their forming the basis of a legislative measure, than as a convenient mode of
                    stating the substance of a case.</p>
                <p>“Grant in all books to be hereafter published, an exi tension of copyright for
                    twenty-two years, making in the ’ whole fifty years. Appoint a commission, with
                    power of' reference to a jury, to act in all cases where the owners <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of copyright withhold publication, or confine it to
                    an expensive form. Empower this commission to order the publication of such
                    works in the form they judge most proper, and with the obligation towards the
                    proprietor of the copyright of paying over to him or his representatives the
                    proportion of profit accruing to him by the practice of the trade. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Quarterly Review,</hi> vol. viii. p. 112.)</p>
                <p>“The power of this commission to be operative only for the additional term of
                    twenty-two years, without application to the existing twenty-eight.”</p>
                <p>The act of 1814 would thus'remain in force. Should it, however, appear in the
                    progress of the discussion that the prolongation made it necessary to take steps
                    for the interest of the public, or of the minor booksellers, the power of the
                    commission might be made applicable to a portion of the twenty-eight years.</p>
                <p>The grand objection hitherto has arisen from an idea, that to prolong copyright
                    was to prolong the power of the owner to deal with the public as he chose.
                    Nothing, however, is easier than to separate the two, preserving to the
                    bookseller his property, and giving the public the right of calling for editions
                    of the book, in the manner most suited to general convenience. This seems
                    sufficiently explained in the above provision; and the only matter of surprise
                    is, that it should not have been sooner acted on.</p>
                <p>This clause would put book property on so plain and equitable a footing, as to
                    open a prospect to another and very desirable arrangement, namely, <hi
                    rend="italic">a community of copyright between this country and the United
                    States</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is, a mutual compact that “the
                    publisher of a book in the one should possess the property of it also in the
                    other,” subject always to the interference of a commission or jury in each
                    country, who should take care that it be given to the public in a cheap and
                    convenient form.</p>
                <p>Such is the plan of the proposed alteration. We are] next to consider its
                    probable effects. And, first, as to li-t terary men: they certainly feci sore at
                    the obligation of sacrificing eleven copies of every book to the public
                    libraries. A prolongation of copyright would go far to remove this uneasy
                    sensation; but we would urge it on higher grounds; and here it is fit to state,
                    that our arguments are not at all intended to favour a mercenary spirit. Persons
                    who write merely for money find at present an ample stock of employment in
                    compiling, abridging, and plagiarizing; they are dead to the feeling of
                    reputation, and incapable of that judicious and honourable calculation which
                    shows that the true way to attain either fame or competency, is to be sparing of
                    early publications, to study in silence, and to aim only at ultimate success.
                    Such men do not properly belong to literature; they have been cast into it
                    merely as a refuge. The men to be benefited by the change would be a very
                    different class; they would be those who embrace literature as others em- <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194751406" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1406-0318"/> , brace medicine,
                    law, or the church, with the intention of following it as a profession; who make
                    allowance for passing a number of years in unproductive study, and do not repine
                    at the postponement of their reward, if it be not eventually withheld. The
                    proposed alteration would operate in their favour, not by gratifying an
                    avaricious disposition, which literature never engenders, and which, if
                    it'previously existed, would be modified, perhaps cured, by such pursuits; but
                    by enabling the individual to pursue his task year after year without
                    discouragement, and without feeling that, by gratifying his personal
                    predilection, he is doing an injury to his family. Improve his circumstances,
                    not that he may amass money, but that he may have the means of support during
                    the long labour necessary to reputation. More is not to be desired; the wants of
                    literary men are few; their residence, their plan of life, and their mode of
                    bringing up a family, ought all to be such as to recal the simplicity of former
                    days.</p>
                <p>What a reproach to modern Europe, that, with all the benefit of printing and
                    extended circulation, our literary compositions should not have surpassed those
                    of the ancients! Does not this argue that there must exist somewhere an unhappy
                    counteraction to our advantages? In number of studious men we far surpass the
                    fairest days of Greece and Home; but few of them comparatively become writers;
                    they meet a great deal of difficulty and discouragement in their attempts to
                    address the public; and the result is, that their knowledge expires with
                    themselves. Such will be the case until an effectual change be made; we shall
                    have the mortification of seeing men capable of enlightening the world and
                    accelerating the progress of improvement, doomed to waste their time in
                    teaching, or relinquishing literature for professions productive of money.
                    Others who prefer the gratification of their taste to all considerations of
                    property, must be content to live on a trifling pittance abroad, or in a corner
                    of their own country, remote from libraries and the pleasure of literary
                    intercourse.</p>
                <p>To make literature a profession for l∙fe is almost a new project; for hardly any
                    men have set out with the intention of making it their sole employment. They
                    have consequently proceeded without a settled plan, have arrived at no definite
                    method until advanced in years, and have seldom, if ever, thought of drawing up
                    instructions for the guidance of their successors. Observe in mercantile
                    business, in public offices, and in the law, how labour is methodized and
                    subdivided; in what manner the mechanical and uninstructive part is made to
                    devolve on inferior assistants, and the time of the principal reserved for
                    general views and important decisions. In literature, any thing of the kind that
                    has yet been attempted is in its infancy; yet the same plan is applicable; and
                    were authors so far at their ease as to be enabled to make an undisturbed
                    apportionment of their time, they would soon learn to make great improvements in
                    their mode of study.</p>
                <p>Some booksellers apprehend, that if authors were assured of a prolonged term,
                    they, the booksellers, would not so soon have the option of buying copyrights;
                    at all events, they would pay dearer for them. This reasoning is plausible, but,
                    like the general conclusions of most practical men, will be found to be drawn
                    from a narrow eir-cumference. Whatever be the duration of copyright, the
                    property of it, in nineteen cases out of twenty, must be vested in the
                    bookseller. How can authors have the means of running the risks, or waiting year
                    after year for the tardy returns of sale? Must they not continue to exchange
                    these formidable contingencies for a specific allowance in ready money? To write
                    books is one thing; to sell and to hold the property of them is another. The one
                    is the province of the retired and sedentary student; the other of the man of
                    activity and capital. Again, as to augmen-( tation of price, booksellers would,
                    indeed, in the event of a prolongation, find it necessary to increase the
                    remuneration of good writers; but this increase would be repaid them threefold
                    in the augmented value of their editions, which ∙would, in that case, probably
                    embrace the circulation of the United States. Give encouragement to our own
                    writers, and the compositions offered to our booksellers will soon be such as to
                    justify an extent of impression equal to those of France, where two or three
                    thousand copies are struek off for one thousand in England. Observe the effect
                    of such a change in facilitating the recovery of the drawback on paper; a
                    drawback at present of little benefit to our exporting booksellers, because the
                    books shipped to America are frequently in such petty lots as not to defray the
                    expense of the debenture. These considerations are of high importance at a time
                    when we suffer from the printing, on the Continent, of rival editions of our
                    standard books, for the American market.</p>
                <p>Cheapness is not to be sought by inferiority of type and paper; but it would be
                    the result of those progressive improvements, which would soon take place were
                    things left to their natural operation. An increase in the size of an edition
                    implies a reduction of price to the public. Now the cheapening of books is
                    productive of great advantage. It would enable us both to supply the foreign
                    market and to increase greatly our circulation at home, by inducing individuals
                    to buy books which they would otherwise borrow, and to have always at hand those
                    to which they would otherwise have only occasional access.</p>
                <p>What is the ordinary course of the business of a great publishing house? A large
                    proportion of the books they send forth pass unnoticed, and hardly defray the
                    expense of paper and print. What loads of unsaleable volumes encumber their
                    warehouse! What a heavy expense do they incur for unproductive advertising! The
                    success of the house depends on the very few works of standard merit, perhaps
                    one in twenty, whιeh obtain extensive sale, and forma counterpoise to their
                    ill-starred brethren. Now, the effect of a prolongation of copyright would be to
                    increase very considerably this select number, and to afford on a large, that
                    benefit which is now enjoyed on a small scale. Booksellers have merely to look
                    around them to see that those publications succeed best where the encouragement
                    of the writer is most liberal. The expense of paper, print, and advertising, is
                    as great on a bad as on a good manuscript, and it would in time become a rule
                    with our leading booksellers to publish -none but first-rate books. If they
                    adhered to that, they might safely dispense with repeated and expensive calls on
                    the public attention; the name of their house would do more than any thing
                    else.</p>
                <p>Another, and by no means inconsiderable advantage, of a valuable manuscript, is
                    the power of obtaining an allowance from a French or a German bookseller for the
                    use of the English sheets for the purpose of translating; a point hitherto
                    little attempted, in consequence of the trifling nature of most of our
                    publications.</p>
                <p>Booksellers complain, and probably with truth, of the vanity and unreasonableness
                    of authors; but literature has many attractions, and whenever you satisfy men
                    that they will not doom themselves to a life of poverty by following it, you may
                    be assured that you will soon have to transact with a very superior class of
                    writers.</p>
                <p>It is usual with booksellers, when treating with an author of reputation, to make
                    their bargain with reference to successive editions; that is, they pay a certain
                    sum for the first, a further sum when a second is called for, and a final
                    payment on the appearance of a third generally completes the purchase of the
                    copyright. This plan is highly desirable, and would be regularly acted upon,
                    could <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751419" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1419-0319"/>the
                    bookseller have full confidence in authors. It reduces the risk of the former,
                    while to the author it affords the gratification of prospect, and gives him the
                    strongest motives to render his book worthy of permanent favour.</p>
                <p>Such is the state of the case as regards the elder brethren of the trade, the
                    principal publishers. But we must address a few words likewise to a numerous,
                    and, in general, a respectable class, the printers and lesser booksellers. These
                    persons may apprehend that a prolongation of copyright would prove a continued
                    suspension of their power of coming forward with cheap editions; but we refer
                    them to the clause in the above sketch of the proposed act, which might be so
                    framed as to allow any bookseller who chose to make the speculation, to print an
                    edition of a work on his obtaining the assent of the proprietor of the
                    copyright, or, failing that assent, on his getting the sanction of the
                    commission or jury authorized to settle disputed points.</p>
                <p>We are next to call on the lesser booksellers and printers to take a
                    comprehensive view of their situation, and to mark that progressive extension of
                    the bookselling business, which shows that there is no ground for keeping up
                    ancient jealousies, or for considering the interest of one branch as different
                    from that of others. Look back to the history of the trade, and observe how it
                    has gradually, and without the aid of interference, divided itself into a
                    variety of distinct branch es. Booksellers combined at first the sale of
                    stationery with that of books; and hence the Stationers’ Company. In process.of
                    time they relinquished, in great towns at least, that unnecessary appendage,
                    and, after a further lapse of years, divided the wholesale book business from
                    the retail. Progressive extension led next to a distinction between the sale of
                    new and old books; and we have at present in one house (the house so well known
                    as the publishers of Hume and Robertson) the example of an establishment
                    avoiding all business, even wholesale, except what relates to books printed for
                    their own account. These subdivisions tend exceedingly to facilitate business;
                    they cause it to be done both better and to greater extent. Experience shows
                    that the repartition of employment is the true road to success, and that men
                    cannot more effectually clog their progress than by attempting to conjoin
                    dissimilar undertakings. The further course of things, particularly under an
                    extension of the term of copyright, would lead to establishments on a still more
                    simple plan; some booksellers would confine themselves to the mere purchase of
                    copyrights, and leave not only the printing, but the sale, to the trade at
                    large. Is that prospect calculated to alarm either the printers or minor
                    booksellers? Does it not tend to show that things, when left to their natural
                    course, fall invariably into their true channel, and render superfluous both the
                    care of the legislature and the by-laws of corporations? Nothing can be clearer
                    to a man of business than that the dearer an edition the fewer the purchasers;
                    and that the true plan is to meet the demand of all classes with as little delay
                    as possible. This we see repeatedly exemplified in the case of new books,where
                    an octavo edition is brought forward before the sale of the quarto is completed;
                    but as all booksellers might i not be equally accommodating, the plain
                    alternative is to invest <hi rend="italic">a commission with explicit power to
                    interfere.</hi> That would form a full and conclusive answer to those argu-i
                    ments which Judge Yates on the bench, Lord Kames in I the Court of Session, and
                    Lord Camden in the House of I Peers, só strongly urged against giving what they
                    termed the</p>
                <p>“continued monopoly of a book.” These distinguished persons were not aware that
                    the property of a book might be preserved to an author or purchaser, whilst the
                    mode of selling it was subjected to regulation. They could not see by intuition
                    what it has taken no small share of time and reflection to discover.</p>
                <p>The existing restriction of the term of copyright tends to induce an author to
                    make his work less perfect in the first instance, with the view of affording him
                    an easy method of renewing the exclusive property. Gibbon did not scruple to
                    write to his publisher, that a thorough révisai of bis history would form “a
                    valuable renewal of the copyright at the end of the term.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Correspondence from Lausanne, annexed to his
                    <hi rend="italic">Memoirs.</hi></p></note> Several publishers follow this plan
                    avowedly and habitually.</p>
                <p>We by no means assert, however, that the proposed change would stop the
                    appearance of trifling works, since every man must be allowed to dispose of his
                    time and property as he chooses; but it would surprisingly increase the number
                    of good books, prompting many, who are at present entirely discouraged, to
                    become authors, and inducing others who labour, but labour with haste, to give a
                    finish and attraction to their performances.</p>
                <p>It is long since Dr Johnson pronounced us “a nation of readers,” though we are
                    still extremely deficient in <hi rend="italic">standard rvorks,</hi> and on
                    subjects too where we ought to have been long since amply supplied. Have we a
                    good <hi rend="italic">general</hi> history of Ireland or Scotland, or even of
                    England? No wonder that we should still be deprived of such works when we
                    calculate the time, labour, and expense required in their composition. Since
                    public records have become so voluminous, and the transactions of nations so
                    complicated, whoever undertakes to do justice to such topics will find himself
                    subjected to a variety of expenses. He must set apart two, perhaps three, years
                    for what apparently requires one; he must have his residence in the vicinity of
                    great libraries; he must carry on an extensive correspondence; he must employ
                    clerks in making copies of official documents and family papers. The same
                    observations are applicable to scientific labours. At present no bookseller can
                    afford to indemnify a writer for the years he would be disposed to bestow on a
                    favourite but insulated branch; he must have a work on a subject of general
                    interest; that is, one which will take in a number of topics, without going to
                    the bottom of any. But prolong the term, and afford a prospect that a
                    well-written book, even in a limited department, will make its way, and the
                    bookseller will find himself justified in offering to the author a sum which
                    will enable the latter to indulge in his predilection for the branch in
                    question. This point is of great consequence, for almost every author has a
                    favourite subject, which he would cultivate with great zeal, did not necessity
                    oblige him to turn aside to popular topics for the sake of a livelihood. We have
                    known works that might have been completed in two or three years, postponed from
                    time to time so as to occupy seven, eight, or nine, in consequence of those
                    unwelcome avocations.</p>
                <p>The more a man of taste and judgment studies the true nature of composition, the
                    more he becomes attached to simplicity; he loses the relish for flowery diction;
                    he learns to chasten his early predilection for ambitious passages; for point
                    and antithesis-he substitutes the plain language of the Grecian and Roman
                    models. Such a style is calculated to be permanent, but may not for some time be
                    popular, perverted.as the public taste is by a habitual tone of exaggeration and
                    inflation. The reward of such writers is thus to be found only in length of
                    time. Grant but that, and you will accomplish a total change in the character of
                    new books, rendering the writers indifferent <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751432"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1432-0320"/>to whatever may be called tricks of composition,
                    and directing their attention to the plain, the solid, the perma- ’ nent. What a
                    prospect is here opened both of improving our national style and of diffusing
                    useful information!</p>
                <p>We have treated this subject with reference to four distinct parties; authors,
                    publishing booksellers, the lesser booksellers with the printers, and finally
                    the public: yet we challenge any opponent to produce a single point in which the
                    advantage of the one is not found to coincide with and promote the advantage of
                    the others.</p>
                <p>How then has it happened that a case calling so strongly for amendment has not
                    hitherto been fully brought before the public? The reasons arc the
                    following:</p>
                <p>Publishing booksellers have been, and still are, unconscious of the extent of
                    improvement which it would produce in literary composition.</p>
                <p>The lesser booksellers and printers were not aware of the practicability of
                    combining prolongation of copyright with freedom in publishing editions.</p>
                <p>The former opponents of the measure proposed, such as Lord Camden, were equally
                    unaware of the possibility of the provision in question.</p>
                <p>And as to literary men, their error has been partly in want of co-operation,
                    partly in asking too much, by urging a claim to perpetuity.</p>
                <p>But is there now any prospect of the adoption of such a measure? The progress of
                    improvement is slow; our legislatures have not leisure to study such matters to
                    the bottom, and our practical men are in general wedded to ancient usage. At the
                    same time, there arc strong reasons to hope, that the question, if taken up by a
                    spirited and persevering member of parliament, will eventually be carried. The
                    universities afford an encouraging example. They have long possessed copyright
                    without abusing it. Booksellers are accustomed, particularly since the peace, to
                    take a much wider view of their business; they aim at exportation, reduce their
                    prices, and seek an equivalent in a larger circulation. As to authors, their
                    object is completely the śame with that of the public, namely, extended
                    circulation. We have the example of successive prolongations of copyright in
                    this country and in France; and a most encouraging proof of the effects of
                    perpetuity in Germany. Finally, it may be safely urged, that, until some such
                    measure is adopted, the English public will receive few standard books.</p>
                <p>The number of new literary works which come out in Great Britain annually is
                    computed at 1500. This is exclusive of reprints, pamphlets, and periodical
                    publications. Taking the average editions of each at 750 copies, we have a total
                    of more than a million of new volumes published annually in Great Britain. In
                    France, the number of newly published volumes is greater, because the editions
                    are larger; but, of all countries, Germany is in this respect the most
                    remarkable, the new works published there annually exceeding five thousand, or
                    three to one compared to those of England or France. <hi rend="smallcaps">(d.
