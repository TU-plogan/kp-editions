                    article, we propose to direct the attention of our readers, were considered as
                    related to <hi rend="italic">Insects</hi> by the authors of the most popular
                    systems of zoology of recent times. In common life they are confounded with
                    animals of a very different character, under the general denomination of <hi
                    rend="italic">Shell-fish,</hi> and are familiarly known by particular names, as
                    crabs, lobsters, shrimps, and prawns.</p>
                <p>The ancients, in their contemplation of shell-fish, denominated such as were
                    furnished with true shells, Oσ⅛ ’ gακo- <hi rend="italic">⅛1μu, or</hi>
                    testacea, whilst such as were covered with a softer crust were termed
                    μαλακoστgαzα, or Crustacea. The former group comprehends those molluscous
                    animals which are usually described in our systems of conchology (see the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusea</hi> of this work), whilst the latter will
                    form the subject of the following remarks.</p>
                <p>The crustacca belong to that extensive division of <hi rend="italic"
                    >An-nulose</hi> animals which have been denominated <hi rend="italic"

                    and which also includes spiders, insects, and millepeds. They differ, however,
                    in many respects from the three last groups, especially in the greater
                    perfection of their circulating system, and by the adaptation of their
                    respiratory organs to water or damp air. The true character of the differences
                    will be rendered more obvious while we unfold the physiology of the Crustacea,
                    preparatory to a few remarks on their systematical arrangement.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAPTER</hi> I.</p>
                <p>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE CRUSTACEA.</p>
                <p>Crustaceous animals exhibit various modifications of head, body, and tail. The
                    head bears the antennae, the eyes, and the mouth, while the body and tail
                    support the organs of locomotion and respiration. The body, above, is usually
                    protected by a thorax or <hi rend="italic">shield,</hi> marked with grooves or
                    eminences corresponding to the position internally of the more important organs.
                    These parts have been denominated <hi rend="italic">regions,</hi> with annexed
                    terms indicative of the organs which they cov,cr. Thus the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stomachal region</hi> is situate in the middle of the shield, and immediately
                    behind the eyes, and is followed towards the centre of the shield by the <hi
                    rend="italic">genital region,</hi> to which succeeds the I <hi rend="italic"
                    >eατdial region.</hi> Between the cardial region and the junction of the shield
                    with the tail is the <hi rend="italic">posterior hepatic re-</hi> I <hi
                    rend="italic">gion,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">anterior hepatic region</hi>
                    being situate on each side of the stomachal one. The branchial regions extend on
                    each side from the genital and cardial regions to the margins of the shield.
                    These distinctions, which were suggested by the craniological speculations of
                    Gall, arc of some value in the discrimination of nearly allied species, and have
                    been successfully employed by the industrious Desmarest in illustrating the
                    character of such as occur in a fossil state, and which in general have their
                    members mutilated or bruised.</p>
                <p>SECT. I. EXTERNAL COVERING.</p>
                <p>The covering of crustaceous animals may be considered i as composed of a cuticle,
                    a crust or scale containing much earthy matter, and a thin membrane representing
                    the true skin of the vertebral animals. The cuticle in some cases is extremely
                    thin, while in others it is developed into prominent hairs and other similar
                    appendages. The crust contains, besides the animal matter which forms its basis,
                    and which in the lobster constitutes about a fourth of the whole, the carbonates
                    and phosphates of lime, the former occurring to the amount of sixty per cent,
                    the latter to fourteen per cent, in the animal referred to. The flexible
                    laminated matter of the crust remaining and retaining its form after the earthy
                    salts have been dissolved by acidulated water, has been shown by M. Odier to
                    consist chiefly of <hi rend="smallcaps">Chitine,</hi> a substance which
                    constitutes the basis of the elytra of insects, and which differs from gelatine
                    and coagulated albumen in its insolubility in boiling water or caustic
                    potash.</p>
                <p>The crusts of crabs and lobsters, though they exhibit various tints of colours
                    when the animals are alive, or not acted upon by heat, yet after death they are
                    suddenly changed to a red colour when subjected to the action of boiling water.
                    This change appears to take place in consequence of the decomposition of a
                    substance, which leaves in a free state a red coloured oil, which, though
                    insoluble in cold or boiling water, is soluble in cold alcohol and sulphuric
                    ether. Besides these singular ingredients in the crust, Μ. Chevreul has detected
                    the presence of iodine.</p>
                <p>The moulting of the Crustacea, or the casting of their skins, takes place at
                    seasons of the year differing somewhat according to the species. During this
                    period of their weakness, when their crusts are yet-soft, and incapable of
                    yielding the requisite protection which in a mature state they afford, these
                    animals become the prey of their numerous foes. The evil is in part guarded
                    against by their retirement to places of shelter and concealment. In their
                    moulting state we have taken half a dozen of the Lithodes maia from the stomach
                    of a codfish, a place to which they would not have been conveyed had their
                    crusts acquired their mature hardness.</p>
                <p>SECT. II.—ORGANS OF MOTION.</p>
                <p>The* residence to which the Crustacea are in a great measure restricted, confines
                    their motions to swimming, walking, and leaping. For the purpose of executing
                    the first of these motions, the feet are constructed with flattened joints,
                    which present a considerable surface of resistance to the surrounding medium;
                    and their expanse is greatly enlarged by the fringe of stiff hairs by which they
                    are in general surrounded, as in <hi rend="italic">Portunus puber,</hi> figured
                    in Plate CLXXX. The gravity of their bodies being considerably greater than the
                    surrounding medium, their suspension and motion in the water can only be
                    effected by the active use of their limbs, while their progress is usually
                    irregular. In walking, the Crustacea, in general, advance sidewise, owing to the
                    motions of the limbs being perpendicular to the mesial plane, instead of
                    parallel to its direction, as in many other animals. Their progress, even
                    laterally, is irregular and constrained. Indeed they appear better adapted to
                    move over an uneven surface, by a process resembling climbing, than by ordinary
                    walking. They mount with ease along the leaves of the sea-weeds, and the stems
                    of the zoophytes, in search of their prey.</p>
                <p>When pursued by their foes, or even in the execution of their ordinary purposes,
                    many species are capable of leaping with considerable facility. This kind of
                    motion they effect by suddenly unbending their tail or abdomen. In swimming they
                    not unfrequently combine in their progress the leap with the employment of the
                    feet as oars. In some <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753746"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3746-0498"/>species thekind of progressive motion is confined
                    to walking or climbing, in others the motion is exclusively natatory.</p>
                <p>The limbs of the Crustacea consist of the five following parts: The <hi
                    rend="italic">hip</hi> is the medium of articulation between the limb and the
                    body, and is divided into two parts; the <hi rend="italic">coxa</hi> next the
                    body, and the <hi rend="italic">trochanter</hi> articulating with the thigh.
                    These, two joints are usually short, and nearly equal in size.' The <hi
                    rend="italic">thigh or femur</hi> is usually the longest and the thickest of all
                    the joints in the limb. The <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tibia,</hi> though shorter than the thigh, frequently exceeds in dimensions,
                    especially in length, the hip-joints. The tarsus is in general as large as the
                    leg,- and supports the last joint or claw. When the claw or unguis is placed on
                    the extremity, or as a continuation of the tarsus, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >simple</hi> leg is formed; but when placed laterally, So as to move and act in
                    opposition to the extremity of the tarsus, it performs the function of a thumb,
                    and the limb is said to have pincers, or to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >didactyle.</hi></p>
                <p>The facility with which the Crustacea can throw off their limbs when they are
                    injured or detained, has often attracted the notice of the curious. The suture
                    at which the parting takes place sustains but little loss by bleeding, and is
                    soon able to exercise its reproductive functions. The new-formed limb, however,
                    is smaller in all its dimensions, though consisting of the same number of parts,
                    than the one thrown off; and it is not till after several moultings that the new
                    limb acquires its mature size. The repairing power can more easily renew a whole
                    limb than an individual joint, and is incapable of repairing a bruised or
                    mutilated one. When the annual moulting of the Crustacea is taken into
                    consideration, this renewing process of the limbs will excite less surprise,
                    though it still displays a striking feature in the economy of these animals,
                    that in order to save their bodies from capture by their foes, they can cast off
                    so readily the claws or legs which have been seized.</p>
                <p>SECT. III.—ORGANS OF SENSATION.</p>
                <p>The nervous system in the Crustacea may be considered as exhibiting three
                    different modifications. The first of these forms is displayed in the
                    Podophthalma, or those with moveable pedunculated eyes, in which the brain is
                    formed above into four lobes, the two middle giving rise to the optic nerves.
                    Below, four nerves take their rise, and proceed to the antennae, detaching in
                    their course some filaments to the neighbouring parts. The posterior portions of
                    the brain give rise to the two cords, which, in their course, supply the
                    mandibles with filaments, and, after encircling the alimentary canal, unite in
                    forming a medullary oval ring-like mass in the middle of the thorax, many times
                    larger than the anterior ganglion or brain. From the circumference of this ring
                    nerves proceed to the jaws and feet, and, retrally, a single nerve is sent to
                    the tail. This arrangement prevails in the common crab. In the crây fish, the
                    cords which proceed from the brain are shorter, and, after forming the collar,
                    unite in an oblong ganglion, and supply the jaws with nerves. Leaving this
                    ganglion, the two cords remain near each other, uniting at intervals to form
                    five ganglia for the supply of the corresponding pairs of feet, and afterwards
                    proceed into the tail, where they form six ganglia: the last of these masses
                    gives rise to four nerves, which are distributed as· radii to the sealyfins that
                    terminate the tail.'·- In the first condition of the nervous syst’ĩTn the
                    ganglia are reduced t¢ two in number,·by the union of all the ganglia behind the
                    collar into a single medullary ring, a form well suited to the compact orbicular
                    form of the body. In ’ the last conditicn the lengthened form of the body draws
                    out, as it Were, the nervous cords, to form several ganglia, though these cords
                    preserve a tendency to approximate throughout their whole extension.</p>
                <p>The second form of the nervous system in the Crustacea is exhibited in the
                    Edriophthalma, or such as have sessile eyes. Among these animals the two cords
                    of the nervous system, as in Talitrus, in proceeding from the brain, do not
                    coalesce at any point, but form their ganglia separately, symmetrically, and in
                    pairs. Though this modification of the nervous cords be so different from that
                    which prevails in the former group, in the tendency of these cords to keep
                    separate, there appears in Idotea and other genera a tendency in each cord to
                    become, accumulated or condensed towards the middle of its ordinary course, as
                    in the common crab.</p>
                <p>In the third form of the nervous system, occurring in the Entomostraca, the
                    development is imperfect. In some the brain is in the form of a nearly
                    transparent globule, the medullary cord double, with an enlargement at each of
                    the numerous articulations of the body. In others the substomachal ganglion,
                    though distinct, gives rise to filaments which, though representing the two
                    cords, scarcely swell into ganglia in their course.</p>
                <p>The eyes of the Crustacea are either compound or simple. The compound eyes are
                    sessile in one group, and little elevated above the common integuments. In
                    another they occupy the extremity of a moveable peduncle, differing greatly in
                    length according to the genera. In general the eyes are two in number, in some
                    cases four, and in a few instances they seem to unite in one spot. The compound
                    and simple eyes occur in different animals, though in other cases in the same
                    individual both kinds of eyes exist.</p>
                <p>The organs of hearing among the Crustacea generallymay be considered as in a
                    great measure obliterated. Among the decapodous podophthalma, however, distinct
                    traces of this sense may be observed in a perforated cavity, situate at the base
                    of each of the exterior tentacula, filled with a watery fluid, and supplied with
                    auditory nerves. The sense of smell is inferred more from the habits of the
                    species than from their structure, and a similar remark is applicable to the
                    function of taste. The organs of touch, however, are very fully developed. The
                    number of tentacula they possess, together with numerous other external organs,
                    readily give information of the presence of objects, and likewise of their
                    shape. The eye and the touch are indeed the two senses which occur in this class
                    in the fullest development. The taste and smell perhaps come next in order.</p>
                <p>SECT. IV. ORGANS OF DIGESTION.</p>
                <p>The organs exhibited by the Crustacea, which assist in the capture of their prey,
                    are of various kinds. The organs of motion are extremely well adapted for
                    preserving within the reach of the mouth the object which is to serve as food,
                    and the organs of the mouth exhibit a remarkable degree of complexity. In the
                    decapodous Crustacea an upper lip or labrum may be observed, covering a pair of
                    mandibles with their palpi. Underneath these may be found the first pair of
                    maxillae, similar in many respects to those belonging to, insects. The second
                    pair of maxillae, which follow, appear to occupy the place of the under lip or
                    labium of insects, within which is a tongue, but imperfectly developed, and
                    usually biful. These organs of the mouth are covered by three pair, of auxiliary

                    considerable countenance from the circumstance that the number of legs .increase
                    in . certain gqnera, in proportion as the auxiliary maxillae diminish in number,
                    these undergoing modifications fitting them for their new functions.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753759" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3759-0499"/>
                <p>The ordinary food of the Crustacea appears to be either minute zoophytes and
                    molluscous animals, or dead animal matter. In some species a preference appears
                    tube given to vegetable food; and one crab, the Birgus latro, is celebrated for
                    climbing trees for the purpose of stealing or rather eating cocoa nuts. To
                    entice their prey, or conceal their own approach, a few Crustacea, as the Inachi
                    and Mar cropodiae, cut portions of fuci and corallines, which they cement to
                    their bodies, and in this grotesque style of dress effectually hide their true
                    forms. It is not improbable that in this garb they cpn transport themselves more
                    readily from one place to another, at being practised chiefly by those species
                    which are'bad swimmers. .The dead substances on which so many of the Crustacea
                    feed are probably discovered by the help of their organs of smell; and so
                    quickly do they detect substances suited to their taste, that the lobster creels
                    and crab pots, when suitably baited, seldom fail to allure their victims.</p>
                <p>The masticating organs are succeeded by a short gullet opening into a stomach’
                    more or less complicated, with cartilaginous bands, in‘many genera furnished
                    with osseous teeth, to complete the reduction of the solid food which the mouth
                    had been unable to bruise. On each side of the stomach a round flat calcareous
                    stone is found previous to the moulting, which serves as a store of earthy
                    matter for the renewal of the shell. These stones, vulgarly known by the name of
                    crabs’ eyes, were long highly esteemed for their medicinal virtues as
                    absorbents. The intestine, in the decapodous Crustacea, has a valvular
                    enlargement with an attached caecum. In the other groups the intestine is
                    simple, proceeding directly to its terminal opening under the tail.</p>
                <p>SECT. V.—ORGAN’S OE ASSIMILATION.</p>
                <p>The nutritive fluids derived from the contents of the stomach and intestines, are
                    conveyed, in the decapodous Crustacea, to a pulmonic ventricle, situated
                    dorsally and retrally in reference to the stomach. From this vessel one or two
                    principal arteries have their origin, and transmit the blood by as many
                    subdivisions as there are branchiae. After the process of aeration has been
                    effected, the blood is returned to a heart, placed ventrally or below the
                    intestine, forming in this manner a nearly complete double circulation.</p>
                <p>Among the Entomostraca the heart appears to be single, and to approach in its
                    character the dorsal vessel of insects.</p>
                <p>The organs of respiration are of three kinds. Among the decapoda they are plumose
                    pyramids, situate at the base of the feet, covered by the shell,: and watered by
                    a current which enters by an aperture from behind the feet, and escapes by an
                    opening near the mouth. Two pair belong to the auxiliary maxillae, and five pair
                    to the true feet, in the true crabs; while among the lobsters the branchiae
                    belong to the four anterior feet, and the first auxiliary jaws have four in each
                    group, making twenty-two branchiae in all, on each side, instead of fourteen as
                    in the former group.</p>
                <p>In another group of Crustacea the branchiae are not concealed, as in those
                    already noticed, but are external, appearing under various forms, attached to or
                    occupying the place of natatory feet. In a third the branchiae are reduced to
                    vascular scales, differing greatly in the degree of exposure or protection.</p>
                <p>The liver occupies a prominent place, being very fully developed. In the decapoda
                    it is placed ventrally to the stomach, large in its size, indeterminate in its
                    form, and of a yellow colour.</p>
                <p>Among the peculiar secretions of the Crustacea, the singular property of emitting
                    light, which some species pos sess, merits some notice. On the passage from
                    Madeira to Rio de Janeiro/ the sea was observed by Sir Joseph Banks to be
                    unusually luminous, flashing in many parts like lightning. He directed some of
                    the water to be hauled up, in which he discovered-tŵo kinds of animals that
                    occasioned the phenomenon; the∙one a crus¢acéous insect, which he. called Cancer

                    however considerably less, and the legs are “furnished with numerous setae. The
                    light of this animal, which is Very brilliant, appears to issue from every part
                    of the body. The light is otherwisb distributed in another crustaceous animal,
                    observed by Captain Tuckey in the Gulf of Guinea. The luminous property resided
                    in the brain, which, when the animal was at rest, resembled a most brilliant
                    amethyst, about the size of a large pin head; and, from this there darted, when
                    the animal moved, (flashes of&lt;a brilliant silvery light. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>.·!... ... .∙ </p>
                <p>With the exception of some entomostraeous genera, the sexes are distinct
                    among·the Crustacea in different individuals. The males abound in some of the
                    genera, in others the females occur in apparent excéss. In the dcca-podous group
                    the seminal organs are situate between the stomach and heart, towards the centre
                    oftthe body, and send forth two vasa deferentia to the two external organs,
                    which maybe observed behind the fifth pair of feet. The ovaria also occupy a
                    central position, and each sends out a tortuous oviduct, opening in the
                    corresponding third sternal plates at the base of the third pair of feet. With
                    the edriophthalma, in general, the sexual organs are placed under the tail.
                    Among the Entomostraca these organs vary greatly in the different groups, and in
                    some genera the sexes appear to be united; and among the Daphniae a single
                    intercourse with the male suffices to render prolific seven or eight
                    generations.</p>
                <p>The evolution of the egg takes place in several of the Entomostraca within the
                    body of the mother, but in general the hatching is external. In the latter case
                    the eggs, often amounting to a great number, are attached by a glutinous cement
                    to certain filaments under the tail, or to certain plates with which the
                    branchiae are also connected. In other cases, as Cyclops quadriconis, the uteri
                    are external sacs. <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi></p>
                <p>When newly hatched, the young of some of the .Entomostraca nearly resemble the
                    parent, while in others the difference is so great as to have given rise to
                    spurious genera. ł In the more perfect groups, as among the edriophthalma, the
                    young are deficient in the number of segments of their body and corresponding
                    number of feet, which they acquire by degrees. Among the decapoda it was long
                    considered that they issued forth from' .the egg in a perfect state. The
                    interesting “Zoological Researches” of Mr Thompson have, however, unfolded more
                    correct views, and demonstrated the existence of a’metamorphosis so great, that
                    in the first stages of their growth they have been constituted into particular
                    genera, of which zoea is the type. In this condition the young are essentially
                    natatory, with cleft members, which change into simple feet, solely, adapted for
                    crawling. Mr Thompson has traced this change in many decapodous genera. In the
                    genus Mysis the change from the young to the adult state is effected by a
                    gradual and successive development of parts. According to the observations of
                    Rathke, the young crawfish, when it bursts the egg, has the external organs
                    formed, but in a soft state, and advances to maturity by gradual
                    development.</p>
                <p>With the observations of Mr Thompson in, view, contrasted<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194753772" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3772-0500"/> with those of Rathke, it
                    seems desirable that the early life of the crustacea were studied with care, and
                    the facts established subjected to the process of a cautious generalization.</p>
                <p>The duration of the crustacea has not been investigated with care. Among the
                    Entomostraca the individuals seem to perish with the close of the season in
                    which they bad their birth, leaving behind them eggs, to be hatched in the
                    following spring, as preservatives of the race. In the higher groups, especially
                    the decapoda, life is maintained during a succession of years. When moulting,
                    they arc an easy prey to their foes; and when their shell has acquired its
                    hardness, the seeds and eggs of a variety of parasitical plants and animals
                    adhere to it, locomotion is retarded, and starvation follows.</p>
                <p>In the distribution of the crustacea, the greater number of species live in the
                    sea, a few in fresh-water lakes and rivers, and fewer still on the land. These
                    last, however, visit the sea periodically to deposit their spawn, and at all
                    times can preserve their gills in a moist state, to enable them to effect the
                    process of aeration of the blood. Some lodge in holes excavated in the mud,
                    while others seek protection in a deserted univalve shell, requiring such a
                    covering to their tender and soft posterior extremity.</p>
                <p>The species which have become extinct are few in number, and chiefly confined to
                    the newer series of rocks, if we except the anomalous group of Trilobites,
                    afterwards to be taken notice of. In the rocks of the saliferous epoch few
                    traces of crustaceous organisms occur. During the cretaceous epoch, however, or
                    at the period when the various deposits of oolites, has, and chalk were in the
                    course of formation, several crustaceous animals appear to have flourished, the
                    remains of which now occur imbedded in these rocks. The species chiefly belong
                    to the Macrourous tribe, approaching generally the shrimps in character. In the
                    strata of the penult epoch, or those which are interposed between the chalk and
                    the sedimentary masses of a comparatively modern date, the remains of crabs and
                    lobsters occur pretty generally distributed. In the rock well known under the
                    denomination London Clay, they have been found imbedded in considerable numbers.
                    The cause of the extinction of these crustaceous species, at these different
                    periods, must be sought for in those physical alterations which took place on
                    the globe, by which the very materials brought into the seas and lakes by
                    rivers, to form stratified matter, at these distinct eras, presented altered
                    characters. Such changes rendered the seas unfit to support one race of beings,
                    while it became a suitable abode for those which were destined to succeed.</p>
                <p>The crustacea are extensively employed for dietetical purposes. They are eagerly
                    sought after on many parts of our rocky coast, and traps for their capture are
                    in very general use. This kind of fishery, as being of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >littoral</hi> kind, is chiefly prosecuted by the more aged of our maritime
                    population, who have become unfit for employment where greater vigour is
                    required. These fishers make themselves familiar with the haunts as well as the
                    general economy of their game, and the kind of garbage which constitutes the
                    most enticing bait. As food, the crustacea are used either plainly boiled, or
                    dressed with various condiments, sometimes also marinated with vinegar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAPTER</hi> II.</p>
                <p>I. SYSTEMATICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE CRUSTACEA.</p>
                <p>The species known to Linnaeus were few in number, and were distributed into the
                    four genera, Cancer, Oniscus, Monoculiis, and Phalangium. In the genus Cancer
                    the celebrated Swede introduced a number of sections or sub-∣ divisions which
                    succeeding authors have raised to the rank of orders or genera. Fabricius
                    enlarged the number of genera of crustaceous animals, assigning to them, at the
                    same time, more precise distinguishing characters. In this field of improvement
                    he was followed by Latreille, Lamark, Dumeril, and Leach. The last-mentioned
                    naturalist, by great zeal and labour, has not only added many new species to the
                    class, but has succeeded in unfolding many new characters, and giving to the
                    generic marks a degree of precision which they did not previously possess.</p>
                <p>The various groups into which different naturalistshave divided the crustacea
                    resemble one another more in their composition than in the terms by which they
                    have been designated. If we assume the aerating organs as the basis of
                    arrangement, we shall find, correlative with these, certain distinguishing
                    features in the circulation and in the nervous system, as well as in the
                    digestive and locomotive organs. Such considerations appear to have induced
                    Lamark to distribute the crustacea into two orders, which he has termed
                    Homobranchia and Heteřobranchia, the former having a solid shield concealing the
                    branchiae, which are placed on the sides at the base of the feet and
                    auxiliaryjaws, while the aerating organs of the latter never occur in the same
                    position, but are variously placed in the different subordinate groups. The
                    organization of the first order is extensively developed, and furnishes
                    well-marked features of discrimination, separating it from the second division,
                    which includes animals of more simple structure.</p>
                <p>ORDER I. HOMOBRAXCHIA.</p>
                <p>The crustaceous animals of this order have the body covered by a continuous
                    shell, which contains the viscera, and a tail which serves the threefold purpose
                    of giving passage to the extremity of the intestinal canal, of acting as an
                    organ of progressive motion, and of retaining the eggs by means of its fringed
                    appendages. The thorax and abdomen, as well as the head, may be considered as
                    united. The eyes are two in number, and compound, lodged in cavities in the
                    anteal margin of the shield, and are supported on moveable peduncles, which vary
                    greatly in their length in the different groups. The peculiar footstalks of the
                    eye have given rise to the term <hi rend="italic">Podophthalma,</hi> by which in
                    some systems they are denominated. The an-tennae arc four in number, the
                    intermediate pair being divided into filaments. The mouth occurs in this group
                    in its most complicated form, with three pair of auxiliary jaws furnished with
                    palpi. The legs are ten in number, the first pair usually of a large size and
                    formed into pincers, the rest terminating in simple claws. In some cases,
                    however, the second and third pairs are also formed into pincers; and in some of
                    the genera the posterior pair have compressed joints as oars for swimming. The
                    regularity in the number of feet in this group has suggested the term <hi
                    rend="italic">Ωecapoda,</hi> by which they are denominated by Latreille. In the
                    structure of the tail the animals of this division exhibit very remarkable
                    differences. In one tribe the tail consists of but few joints, the last one
                    being simple, the whole shorter than the body, and usually folded up under the
                    shield in a cavity for its reception. This shortness of the tail has suggested
                    the title Brachyura. In the other tribe, the tail is usually exposed, about the
                    length of the body, and furnished with plates at the extremity. .The second form
                    of the tail has given rise to the term Macroura, by which they are known.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Tribe Erachyura.</hi><hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> √In this
                    division of crustaceous animals the body is usually of an orbicular or compact,

                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3785-0501"/>joined with the imperfect development of the tail,
                    restricts the progress of the species to crawling rather than swimming. The
                    animals here referred to arc well known under the familiar name <hi
                    rend="italic">crabs.</hi> The sexes are readily distinguished by the form of the
                    tail, which in the male is narrow and short, while in the female it is
                    proportionally of much greater dimensions.</p>
                <p>Among those animals of this tribe which exhibit the more ordinary forms, there is
                    one family characterized in a particular manner by the structure of the feet
                    being adapted to swimming. In general with such the body is broad, rather short,
                    rounded anteriorly, and the margin spinous. With the exception of the pincers,
                    which are fitted for grasping, all the remaining feet in some genera are formed
                    for swimming, while in others the flattened form of the joint is restricted to
                    the hinder pair. The facility with which these animals can transport themselves
                    permits a wider range of motion than the other species, which are chiefly
                    confined to the shore. In a foreign group, including the genera Podophthalma and
                    Lupa, the peduncles of the eyes are remarkably produced, and received into a
                    groove on each side. In the other genera the eyes have short stalks lodged in
                    oval cavities. The genus Portunus contains many species which are common on our
                    shores, but seldom applied to any useful purpose.</p>
                <p>A second family of crustaceous brachyuri, denominated <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Arcuata,</hi> have the joints and claws of the feet rounded and conical. The
                    anterior margin of the shield is semicircular and full, while the posterior is
                    contracted and truncated. Like the preceding family, the tail of the males in
                    general has only five joints. They chiefly inhabit our rocky shores, and are
                    eagerly sought after. It is in this group that the cancer pagurus, or common
                    crab, occupies its place in the system generically characterized by the large
                    basilar joints of the exterior antennae, and economically employed as an
                    esteemed article of food.</p>
                <p>The family <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrilatera,</hi> as the name implies, have a
                    more or less quadrangular form, in some species approaching to heart-shaped,
                    with the front inclined, forming a sort of hood, and truncated. The tail in both
                    sexes consists of seven distinct fragments. Though in these points of
                    resemblance the genera of this family stand related to one another, yet in their
                    habits or physical distribution they exhibit the most striking differences.
                    Among those which inhabit the sea, the <hi rend="italic">Gonoplax</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">angulata,</hi> a species not uncommon on the southern and western
                    coasts, lives in excavations formed in the hardened mud, open at both
                    extremities; the <hi rend="italic">Pinnotheres,</hi> a genus containing several
                    species, take up their abode in living bivalve shells, such as mussels, pennae,
                    and oysters. By some of the ancients these crabs were considered as acting
                    assentinels; by others, as co-operating for interested purposes.</p>
                <p>Thus fed by mutual· aid, the friendly pair</p>
                <p>Divide their gains, and all the plunder share.</p>
                <p>A few of the species of this group, belonging to the genus Thelphusa, are
                    restricted to fresh water, from which however they can withdraw themselves for a
                    while to the air. The Thelphusa fluviatiles, figured at Plate CLXXX., found in
                    Italy, the Levant, and Egypt, is esteemed as food, and occupies a prominent
                    figure on ancient Greek medals. When the attention of the economists of this
                    country shall have been suitably fixed on the importance of peopling our present
                    watery wastes, including lakes and rivers, with animals of ornament and use, it
                    appears probable that this ; species of crab will speedily be naturalized, its
                    habits furI nishing every facility for its transportation.</p>
                <p>A third group in this family are capable of inhabiting the land, burrowing in
                    holes, and feeding on all sorts of garbage. They are chiefly confined to the
                    equatorial regions. As an example, see the Gecarcinus ruricoa, figured on Plate
                    CLXXX.</p>
                <p>A fourth family, denominated <hi rend="italic">Orbiculata,</hi> exhibit around-ed
                    shell, usually solid and smooth, the peduncles of the eyes short, the pincers of
                    unequal length, according to the sex, the region, of the mouth contracted at its
                    upper extremity, with the third joint of the outer auxiliary feet in the form of
                    a lengthened triangle. The Corystès cassive-lanus, figured Plåte CLXXX. belongs
                    to tins group,—a species which is very common in the sandy bays of the country,
                    and frequently cast ashore after storms.</p>
                <p>The group which has been denominated <hi rend="italic">Trigona</hi> is
                    more^distinctly marked than some of the preceding families. The body is full and
                    rounded behind, and produced and pointed before, and in many species armed with
                    strong spines. The legs are usually long and slender, and hence the name of sea
                    spiders, by which they are familiarly known. The region of the mouth is nearly
                    square. To some of the species, as <hi rend="italic">Maid squinado,</hi> a
                    susceptibility to the charms of music and extraordinary siigacity have been
                    attributed. Another species, <hi rend="italic">Hyas araneus,</hi> is detested by
                    the oyster fishers, as injurious to the young spawn.</p>
                <p>The two remaining groups of braċhyuri, which may be denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heteropoda,</hi> from the condition of their legs being peculiar, are capable
                    of division into two families. The first, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cryptopoda,</hi> have the sliièld semicircular or triangular. The feet, with
                    the exception of the pincers, are capable, when at rest, of withdrawing into à
                    marginal cavity of the shield. In the genus <hi rend="italic">Calappa,</hi> the
                    pincers are elevated into a crest above, and folded in the anterior margin so as
                    to close in the front of the shield. The species are natives of equatorial
                    seas.</p>
                <p>The other group, termed <hi rend="italic">Notopoda,</hi> is distinguished by the
                    last pair of feet having their origin above the general margin of the shield.
                    This gives to these organs a dorsal rather than a ventral aspect The species are
                    few in number, and in general strangers to the northern seas, though one species
                    of the genus Dromia has been recently added to the British fauna.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Tribe Macroura.</hi></p>
                <p>The crustaceous animals belonging to this division, familiarly known as lobsters
                    or shrimps, have the body more produced than in the preceding. The tail is as
                    long, or longer, than the body, exposed or simply recurved at the extremity. It
                    is composed of seven segments, with appendages at the extremity, forming a fin.
                    In their motions they are more agile than those of the preceding group, and as
                    their organs are of a natatory character, the species arc restricted in a great
                    measure to the waters.</p>
                <p>In the first division of this tribe, including the species of more perfect
                    organization, the first pair of feet at least are in the form of pincers, the
                    remainder not biful or natatory. The lateral appendages of the tail are so
                    placed as to form a fan-shaped fin.</p>
                <p>In the first subdivision of these crustacea, denominated by Latreille <hi
                    rend="italic">Carides,</hi> the exterior antennae are placed more ventrally than
                    in the intermediate pair, and have their peduncles covered by a large scale or
                    plate. The snout projects, and is frequently spinous, while the body is usually
                    much incurved. There are five pairs of caudal feet. Some of the species are
                    eagerly sought after as food, as the common shrimp, Cranģon vulgaris, along with
                    another species, Palaemon serratus or prawn.</p>
                <p>The second subdivision, including those species having the antennae placed on the
                    same line, readily admit of distribution into three families. The first,
                    including the genus <hi rend="italic">Scyllarus,</hi> has the pincers imperfect,
                    and the external antennae destitute of a stalk, with the basilar joints dilated,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753798" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3798-0502"/> forming a
                    horizontal crest on each side. It may be considered as an equatorial group. <hi
                    rend="subscript smallcaps"> j</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">,. j</hi></p>
                <p>The second family exhibits equally imperfect pincers, but the external antennae
                    are, largely developed. The <hi rend="italic">Pa-linuxus vulgaris,</hi> or
                    thorny lobster, sometimes also termed cray-fish, is a well-known example in the
                    markets of London and Paris., • ∙ <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> ∙ )f-)H r. ∙
                    <hi rend="italic">A '</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi></p>
                <p>The third family, of which the common lobster may be regarded as the type, has
                    the first pair of legs in the form of pincers, and in some of the other genera
                    the second, and even the third pairs, are didactyle. The group contains a few
                    fresh-water species, among which the <hi rend="italic">Astacus Jluviatilis</hi>
                    or craw-fish may be mentioned, as inhabiting many of the rivers of England, in
                    the clayey banks of which the individuals form their holes.</p>
                <p>The second division of, Macrouri exhibits certain anomalous characters, which
                    separate them from the more perfect and regular group to which we have made
                    reference. The first subdivision comprehends the hermits or soldier crabs. These
                    are distinguished by the, tail not being in the form of a fin, and the
                    diminished size of the posterior legs. In one group all the upper parts are
                    crus-taceous and protected; but in another, a portion of the thorax and, the
                    tail being membranaceous, they are exposed to greater danger. This is guarded
                    against in a remarkable manner. Many of the species inhabit deserted univalve
                    shells, introducing their short tail into the spiral cavity of the shell, their
                    thorax filling the last whorl. The pincers, which are in some measure protected
                    by the pillar of. the shell, are the least in size. These Crustacea move easily
                    from place to place in their assumed abode, and shift into a shell of larger
                    dimensions as their own bodies increase in size. The <hi rend="italic">Paŋurus
                    Bernhardus</hi> is common on all our shores, and is figured at Plate CLXXX. <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ι</hi></p>
                <p>Another species, the <hi rend="italic">Pagurus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Diogenes,</hi> common in Jamaica, for example, may be viewed as a terrestrial
                    species.</p>
                <p>The secondsubdivision, denominated Fissipedes, are destitute of pincers, while
                    the feet have an appendage externally, issuing near the base, giving them a
                    natatory character. Instead of the eggs being carried by the false feet under
                    the tail, they adhere to the base of the thoracic feet; a circumstance which has
                    given rise to the denomination opossum shrimps.</p>
                <p>ORDER II.—HETEROBRANCHIA.</p>
                <p>The crustaceous animals of this order exhibit characters more varied and
                    anomalous than those of the preceding order. The branchiae are external when
                    they consist of .imbricated plumes, or in the form of aerating pouches, but
                    never placed, as in the preceding order, under the shield, but either on the
                    under side of the belly or tail, and unconnected with the auxiliary jaws. They
                    are of small size when compared with those already noticed.</p>
                <p>The. animals of this order may be divided into two tribes, in the first of which
                    should be placed those which have their mandibles bearing palpi, and into the
                    second those having mandibles destitute of such appendages.</p>
                <p>Among the crustaceous animals of the first tribe with mandibles furnished with
                    palpi, the <hi rend="italic">Stomapoda</hi> seem entitled to hold the first
                    rank. In the pedunculated form of their eyes they resemble the animais of the
                    order homobranchia. The branchiae are exposed, and attached to the five pair of
                    appendages under the tail, which act as natatory organs. The covering is usually
                    soft, and even transparent. In general the species of this family inhabit the
                    tropical seas. The Squilla mantis, however, is a native of the Mediterranean;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Alima</hi><hi rend="italic">hyalina,</hi> from the
                    west coast of Africa, is figured in Plate CLXXX.</p>
                <p>With the second family of palpigerous crustacea, denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphipoda,</hi> the group commences which has been termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edriophthalma,</hi> having sessile eyes, all those groups previously refer red
                    Jo, having their eyes seated on a peduncle., The Amphipoda have the body usually
                    com-pressed and incurved. ,The first pair of feet, corresponding to the second
                    pair of auxiliary jaws in the decapodous Crustacea, are attached to the
                    first,segment of the body. The, branchiae appear to be constituted by, the hairs
                    on the divided natatory appendages under the tail. Some of the species occur in
                    rivers, arid streams, others attach themselves to tha <hi rend="subscript"
                    >;</hi> sea shore. They swim on their side, and many species leap wi th,
                    faci∣ity by the sudden unbending of their body. They prey upon dead animal
                    matter, and constitute a favourite article of food for the birds which frequent
                    the shore.</p>
                <p>In the Crustacea which follow, the mandibles are destitute of palpi. The family
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">Lcεmodipoda</hi> are distinguished by the absence
                    of the tail, the last pair of legs being inserted near the extremity, of the
                    body. The anterior pair of feet-are attached to the head; these, together with
                    the following pair, which are the largest, end in pincers. The tentacula are
                    four in number. At the base of∣the third and fourth pairs of feet, in some cases
                    also of the second pair, are vesicular appendages. The third and fourth pairs of
                    feet are in s,ome species greatly reduced in their organization. The species pf
                    some of the genera dwell among fuci .and zoophytes, while some Cyami attach
                    themselves to the bodies of .cetaceous animals, and are on that account known to
                    sailors under the denomination of <hi rend="italic">whale lice.</hi> The Cyamus
                    ceti is figured on Plate CLXXXI.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Isopočla</hi> differ from the preceding group, in the
                    anterior feet not being attached to the head, but, like the following pairs,
                    connected with a distinct segment of the body. Leaf-like appendages, or
                    vesicles, occur under the tail, usually inclosed or coγered by lateral plates.
                    The habits of this group exhibit, very remarkable differences. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Epicarides,</hi> having neither eyes nor antennae, are parasitical
                    on the prawn.</p>
                <p>Among the <hi rend="italic">Chjmothoada,</hi> theLimnqria terebrans, though of
                    small size, is well known as peculiarly destructive to beams of timber employed
                    in the construction of sea harbours.</p>
                <p>The peculiar character of this anima! was first ascertained by that eminent
                    engineer Mr Stevenson, during his observations connected with the construction
                    of the Bell Rock light-house. It excavates its cylindrical hole for its
                    dwelling, and propagates so rapidly that in a few years submerged timber is
                    rendered useless. So destructive indeed is this small animal, that Norway logs
                    laid down at the Bell Rock to support temporary railways in 1807, were found,
                    when lifted in 1811, to have been reduced by its ravages from ten inches square
                    to seven inches, or at the rate of about an inch in the year. Mr Stevenson, in
                    order to observe more particularly the ravages of this destructive animal, fixed
                    down on the Bell Rock in 1814 specimens of teak wood, oak, black birch, Memel
                    and Norway fir timber. The only specimen which remained unperforate till 1820
                    was the teakwood; the rest were almost entirely destroyed in the course of two
                    or three years. Sheathing with copper the beams thus employed in marine
                    architecture, seems to be the only preventive of the injuries of this small but
                    successful destroyer.</p>
                <p>The Idoteadae have habits, as marine species, differing little from the
                    Amphipoda. One species, figured at Plate CLXXXI., has been denominated, from its
                    locality, <hi rend="italic">Asia-</hi><hi rend="italic">cilla</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Baffini,</hi> a native of Baffin’s Bay. The genus to which it

                    to which the name Leacia lacertosa was assigned. The other species, Astacilla
                    Baffini, was collected by , Captain Parry among the marine productions of the
                    Arctic Seas,'and figured and described by Captain Sabine, in the appendix to the
                    First Voyage, as <hi rend="italic">Idòtea Baffim.</hi> Overlooking the
                    observations of our arctic voyagers; M. Latreille, in the fourth volume of'the
                    <hi rend="italic">Regne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal</hi> of Cuvier, revived the
                    arctic species under the new title <hi rend="italic">Arcturus
                    tubcreulatus.</hi></p>
                <p>In those denominated Assellota, the Asellus aquaticus occupies a distinguished
                    place. It is a fresh-water species.</p>
                <p>The Oniscides terminate the group. They are terrestrial, requiring, however,
                    dan⅛p air, th enable the branchiae to exercise their functions. They are
                    denominated in England wood-lice, in Scotland slaters.</p>
                <p>The last crustaceoüs group of the <hi rend="italic">Heterobranchia</hi> which we
                    have to notice have been denŏminatcd <hi rend="italic">Entomostra'ca</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Brancliiopoda.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> l</hi> They have corneous integuments, with a shield
                    in one piece, or divided like a bivalve shell. Hénce the origin of the first of
                    the epithets by which they have been characterized. The branchiae are in'the
                    form of hairs or feathers, forming a part of the feet. In general these
                    Crustacea are of small size, and may be denominated microscopical. The fry of
                    some of the'decapodous crustacea have in this group appeared as’ distinct
                    genera; while the fry of species belonging to the group have been raised to the
                    rank of genera.</p>
                <p>The first great division' of the Entomostraca includes the animals of which the
                    genus Monoculus of Linnaeus consists. They are distinguished by their simple
                    natatory feet <hi rend="subscript">?</hi> the eyes united, the antènnae
                    generally four in number, the mouth composed of alabrutn, two mandibles, a
                    tongue, and one or two pair of jaws. Tħe head is incorporated with the
                    thorax.</p>
                <p>In one family, the <hi rend="italic">Lophyropa</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    i</hi> the feet do not exceed ten, with joints more or less cylindrical. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyclops quadriconis,</hi> to be found in almost every fresh-water
                    pool, is an interesting example of the group.' When kept in a phial, it
                    multiplies with amazing rapidity, and forms a pleasing object for the
                    microscope. The females may be readily distinguished by the bags on each side of
                    the tail, as represented in Plate CLXXXI., containing the eggs. In another
                    family, in which the body is inclosed in a bivalve shield, the individuals of
                    many species are to be found in ditches in vast numbers, and form very pleasing
                    objects of observation. Among these the peculiar markings of the Cypris ornata,
                    figured at Plate CLXXXI., seldom fail to arrest the attention.</p>
                <p>In the second family, denominated by Latreille <hi rend="italic">Phyl-lορα,</hi>
                    the number of feet exceed twenty, and their joints, especially of the posterior
                    ones, are flattened in the form of ciliated leaves. The,eyes are two in number,
                    and in some instances pedunculated. The <hi rend="italic">Artemia salina</hi>
                    occupies a prominent place in this group. It is commonly known by the name of
                    Lymington shrimp, or brine worm. The Rev. Mr Rackett has furnished’the following
                    interesting notice of this curious animal ;—</p>
                <p>“Myriads of these animalcula are to be found in the salterns at Lymington, in the
                    open tanks or reservoirs, where the, brine is deposited previous to the boiling.
                    <hi rend="subscript"> ÷</hi> It attains the desired strength by <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> evaporation, from exposure to the sun and air, in
                    about, a fortnight. A pint contains about a quarter of a pound of salt; and this
                    concentrated solution instantly destroys most other, marine animals, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ι</hi></p>
                <p>“These tanks are called clearers, as the liquor becomes clear in them; an effect
                    which the workmen attribute’in some degree to the rapid and continual motion of
                    the' brine-worm, or to the particles which cloud the liquor serving for its
                    food; but this is mere conjecture. So strongly persuaded, however, are the
                    workmen of this fact, that they are accustomed to transport a few of the worms
                    from another saltern, if they do not appear at their own. They increase
                    astonishingly in the course of a few days, —∙∙ ····'</p>
                <p>“It is observable that the brine-worm is never found in the sunpans, where the
                    brine is made by the admission of sea-water during the summer, and which are
                    emptied every fortnight; but only in the pits and reservoirs, where it is
                    deposited after it is taken out of the pans, and where some of the liquor
                    constantly remains. When it becomes much diluted with rain-water, from October
                    till May (during which time the manufacture is at a stand), a few only of the
                    worms are visible; but at the approach of summer young ones appear in great
                    numbers.”</p>
                <p>Another species, the <hi rend="italic">Branchipus stagnalis,</hi> figured in
                    Plate CLXXXI., gřeatly magnified, is found in ditches of Soft standing Water, in
                    which they sŵim constantly on their backs, keeping themselves suspended by the
                    vibrations of their ňdmerous fins,’ and moving fdrwards ’ by giving a sudden
                    spring with their tails. They delight much in the sunshine, during which tlíey
                    appear near the surface of the water. On the least disturbance they start in the
                    manner⅛f small fish, and endeavour to secréte themselves by diving in the soft
                    mud.</p>
                <p>A'third species of the group, the Lepidura prolongata, greatly resembles the
                    preceding, in being found in stagnant marshes, usually in great'numbers, making
                    their appearance in certain years in those places to which for a time they had
                    been strangers.</p>
                <p>The second great division of the Entomostraca, denominated by Latreille <hi
                    rend="italic">Paecilopoda,</hi> differ from the preceding in the ambulatory or
                    prehensile character of the anterior feet, and the branchial or natatory forms
                    of the posterior ones. They are likewise destitute of mandibles, and even jaws,
                    the mouth being suited for soft food. They live, in general, as parasites on the
                    bodies of fishes, feeding on their substance. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caligus</hi><hi rend="italic">curtus</hi> feeds on the gills of the salmon; the
                    Anthosoma Smithii, figured in Plate CLXXXI., adheres to the shark.</p>
                <p>Besides these more ordinary groups of crustaceous animals, to which a general
                    reference has been made, there are yet two others to which we shall merely
                    allude. The <hi rend="italic">Trilobites</hi> occur only in a fossil state. They
                    make a near approach to the <hi rend="italic">onisci.</hi> But even in the best
                    preserved specimens the existence of feet has not been satisfactorily
                    determined. By the labours of Bronġniart, Desmarest, and others, the permanency
                    and difference of certain forms have been ascertained, so as to justify the
                    establishment of several genera in the group, and enable geologists to employ
                    more definite language.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cirrhipides,</hi> including the shells which constituted
                    the Linnean genus Lepas, make a near approach to the Crustacea in many respects,
                    especially to the Entomostraca. But in an article of this kind it would be
                    unprofitable to give the detailed view which would be requisite for the purpose
                    of establishing the relationship, by the exhibition of the analogies which
                    exist.</p>
                <p>The Crustacea are in general very easily preserved for the cabinet. Their members
                    readily relax after being dried, and admit of being <hi rend="italic">set</hi>
                    according to any particular attitude. The species which inhabit the sea require
                    to be steeped for several hours in fresh water before they are dried. If this
                    precaution,be omitted, the, salt water which adheres to the several parts,
                    especially the ligaments, keeps them damp, and occasions mouldiness and
                    decomposition.</p>
