                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Crystallization</hi> is the symmetrical arrangement of the
                    particles of a body when it passes from the liquid to the solid form. This
                    arrangement is determined by the mutual action of the small solids of which the
                    body is composed; and these solids are separated from the liquid by their force
                    of cohesion. Crystallization is one of the most remarkable effects of cohesion.
                    The qualities of a solid in which the force of cohesion is more easily overcome
                    in one direction than another, its brittleness, elasticity, and ductility,
                    depend on this arrangement of its particles.</p>
                <p>Solid bodies are either found in irregular masses, or exhibit certain determinate
                    forms by the process of crystallization. Those substances which are capable of
                    assuming regular figures uniformly affect the same form; subject, however, to
                    certain deviations, from the operation of particular circumstances. Those bodies
                    only can assume the form of crystals which are susceptible of being reduced to
                    the fluid state. This is the usual method of crystallizing saline substances.
                    The substance to be crystallized is dissolved in a sufficient quantity of water
                    to retain it in solution. This is slowly evaporated; and as the bulk of the
                    fluid is diminished, the particles are brought nearer to each other, when they
                    combine together by the force of cohesion, and form crystals. Some saline
                    bodies, which dissolve but in small proportion in cold water, are found to be
                    very soluble in hot water. But when this water cools, it is no longer capable of
                    holding them in solution. The particles then gradually approach each other, and
                    arrange themselves in certain determinate forms; or, in other words, they
                    crystallize. Many of the saline bodies which crystallize in this manner combine
                    with a considerable portion of water. This is called the <hi rend="italic">water
                    of crystallization.</hi> Other saline substances are equally soluble in hot and
                    cold water. These substances do not crystallize by cooling the fluid; they
                    assume regular forms only by diminishing its quantity. This is effected by means
                    of eva? poration from the application of heat. In salts which are crystallized
                    in these circumstances, the proportion of water which enters into combination is
                    small.</p>
                <p>There are some classes of bodies which assume regular forms, but are not soluble
                    in any liquid. Such, for instance, are metallic substances, glass, and some
                    other bodies. Substances of this nature are crystallized by being previously
                    subjected to fusion; and thus having combined with caloric, they are reduced to
                    the liquid state, and the particles being separated from each other, are left at
                    liberty to arrange themselves in regular forms, or to crystallize, as the body
                    cools.</p>

                <p>But what is the cause which operates in determining the regular arrangement of
                    the particles of bodies in these circumstances? or what is the cause of the same
                    bodies in the same circumstances assuming regular figures? The ancient
                    philosophers supposed that the elements of bodies consisted of certain regular
                    geometrical figures; but it does not appear that they applied this theory to
                    explain crystallization. The schoolmen ascribed the regular figure of crystals
                    to their substantial forms; and others supposed that it depended merely on the
                    aggregation of the particles, but without explaining to what this aggregation
                    was owing, or the reason of the regular figures thus produced. According to Sir
                    Isaac Newton and Boscovich, the particles of bodies held in solution in a fluid
                    are arranged at regular distances and in regular order; and when the force of
                    cohesion between the particles and the fluid is diminished, it is increased
                    between the particles themselves. Thus they separate from the fluid, and combine
                    together in groups which are composed of the particles nearest to each other. If
                    we suppose that the particles composing the same body have the same figure, the
                    aggregation of any determinate number of such particles will produce •similar
                    figures. Bergman is of opinion that the particles of saline substances possess a
                    double tendency: by the one they arrange themselves in the form of spiculae; and
                    by the other these spiculae arrange themselves at certain angles of inclination,
                    and according to the difference of these angles, different forms of crystals are
                    produced. These effects are ascribed by the ingenious author to the mutual
                    attraction which exists between the particles, which, according to the peculiar
                    figures of the atoms, at one time arranges them in the form of spiculae, and
                    then combines the spiculae thus formed under different angles of inclination.
                    But this arrangement of the particles, or tendency to arrangement, assigned by
                    Bergman as a cause, is only explaining the phenomenon by itself; whilst the
                    cause of the tendency is yet unexplained. Nor will Newton’s hypothesis be found
                    more satisfactory; for if the particles of a body, after being equally diffused
                    in a fluid, are brought together by a general attraction, it will follow that
                    every saline body should crystallize in the same manner.</p>
                <p>According to the ingenious theory proposed by Haüy, the integrant particles
                    always combine in the same body in the same way; the same faces and the same
                    edges are always attracted towards each other. But these faces and edges are
                    different in different crystals; and hence originates that variety of forms
                    which different bodies assuming regular figures by crystallization exhibit. But
                    why are the same edges and the same faces attracted in the same way? T1is still
                    wants explanation. If it be ascribed, as some have supposed, to a certain degree
                    of polarity existing among the particles, it might enable us to account for the
                    regular figures of bodies produced by the process of crystallization. For by the
                    effects of this agent we might suppose that different parts of the particles of
                    bodies are endowed with different forces, one an attractive, and another a
                    repulsive force; and by the action of these two forces, the same arrangement of
                    the particles will uniformly take place; for when one part of a particle is
                    attracted, the other will be invariably repelled, and thus the same faces and
                    edges will always be disposed in the same way. But it ought to be observed that
                    the existence of this power, however satisfactorily it may account for the
                    phenomena, has by no means been proved; and even if its existence were
                    completely established, the difficulty still remains how this polarity is to be
                    explained.</p>
                <p>Without entering further into these speculations, we propose, in the two
                    following sections, to present our readers with a comprehensive view.'of the
                    formation and structure of crystallized bodies. In the first section we shall
                    treat of the phenomena of crystallization, the means of conducting this process
                    to obtain the most perfect crystals, and the modifications of which each of the
                    forms is susceptible. In the second we shall give a short view of the theory of
                    the structure of crystals.</p>

                <p>The most complete set of observations which has yet appeared on this branch of
                    practical chemistry has been made by M. Leblanc; and to his ingenious
                    memoir<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal de Physique,</hi> tome 1v. p. 300.</p></note> we must acknowledge
                    ourselves indebted for much of what we now lay before our readers on this
                    interesting subject. The art, he observes, of managing or conducting the
                    crystallization of salts, is in a great measure new; for it has hitherto
                    attracted but little attention. To insure^ success in obtaining perfect
                    crystals, the process must be conducted in flat-bottomed vessels; and vessels of
                    glass or porcelain are found preferable to those of any other materials for this
                    purpose. ’ The salt employed should be in a state of purity; and to favour the
                    increase and regular form of the crystals, they should be placed at a distance
                    from each other in the vessels containing the solution. To these necessary
                    precautions, it may be added, that the vessels in which the evaporation goes on
                    should be at perfect rest; and that it is requisite to observe the density, or
                    specific gravity at which the solution begins to yield crystals.</p>
                <p>The particles of any saline body cannot come into contact and form crystals, as
                    long as the force of affinity between these particles and the fluid in which
                    they are held in solution is greater than the mutual affinity of the particles
                    among themselves. A salt, for instance, which begins to crystallize at a certain
                    specific gravity of its solution in water, will afford no crystals when that
                    specific gravity is diminished; for then the particles of the salt are removed
                    to a greater distance from each other; and while, by this distance, the force of
                    their mutual attraction is diminished, the attraction between these particles
                    and the water in which they are dissolved is increased by the increase of the
                    quantity of the solvent. But, on the other hand, if a solution which begins to
                    crystallize at a certain specific gravity is more concentrated, the crystals
                    which are thus obtained are greatly multiplied, but they are heaped together in
                    confused masses, exhibiting no regular forms. Thus, a solution which has been
                    scarcely reduced to that degree of concentration at which it begins to
                    crystallize, being poured while hot into the proper vessel for carrying on the
                    process,' or left at rest in the same vessel in which the solution is made, to
                    cool slowly, will yield a small number of crystals, which will have no other
                    defects than such as are occasioned by their contact with the vessel. Even
                    perfect crystals will sometimes be found among the smaller ones. When the
                    concentration of the solution has not been carried too far, or not further than
                    what is effected by slow cooling, not only have the embryo crystals less bulk,
                    but the particles having come into contact slowly and without confusion, they
                    possess a greater degree of transparency. After a certain period, which varies
                    according to the species of salt which is subjected to the operation, small
                    crystals may be distinctly observed. - These are to be carefully detached from
                    each other, and placed in a different position. Being placed by <hi

                    on a different side, the defects occasioned by their contact with the vessel are
                    very soon repaired. From the crystals treated in this way the finest and most
                    perfect are to be obtained. This operation of changing the position of the
                    crystal from one side to theother ought to be repeated at least once every day,
                    if <hi rend="subscript"> λ</hi> we wish to obtain the completest crystals. ) ^
                    t</p>
                <p>At the end of a certain period the small crystals are to be removed, that the
                    fluid may be more concentrated, either by a new evaporation,'or by dissolving a
                    new portion of the same salt. After the new solution has cooled, and the
                    crystals which have formed in it are separated, if it has been too much
                    concentrated, or too great a portion of salt has been added, the crystals of the
                    first solution are then to be introduced and treated in the same way as
                    formerly.</p>
                <p>When the crystals have acquired a sufficient volume to be handled, and to enable
                    us to choose such as we wish should increase to the largest size, either as
                    simple or complete crystals, or as exhibiting varieties from position or
                    particular circumstances, the individual crystals are then to be separated, and
                    solutions are to be prepared for them; and brought to such a degree of
                    concentration as to afford crystals in a mass; which latter being removed, the·
                    single crystals are introduced into these solutions, which are now in a proper
                    state to favour their increase. , The crystals may either be previously disposed
                    in the vessel, and then the solution may be poured on,· or having first
                    introduced the latter, they may be afterwards distributed on the bottom of the
                    vessel. And thus by continuing the same process, by· taking care to change
                    frequently the position of the crystal from one side to the other, and by
                    keeping up the solution to a proper degree of strength, we may obtain crystals
                    of any bulk we choose. ' . <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi></p>
                <p>When the quantity of particles, which in a certain state of concentration
                    continue to be mutually attracted, has diminished in consequence of their
                    accumulation on the crystals which are formed, at a certain stage of this
                    diminution the crystals cease to enlarge or increase in bulk; on the contrary,
                    if they are left in the fluid, it happens that they begin to dissolve. It is
                    usually on ,the corners and angles that this decrease takes place; and in some
                    salts it seems to go on piecemeal, so as to present distinct layers of the
                    particles; for in this case lines parallel to the sides may be observed, and
                    these are disposed like steps of stairs. Should the accident which is here
                    alluded to be allowed to go on too far, it may often require a long time to
                    repair it; but it is in general easy to avoid this inconvenience, by watching
                    the progress of the operation and the increase of the crystals. If their corners
                    or angles are observed to become less sharp, they must be removed till the fluid
                    is further concentrated, or they must be introduced into a new solution of the
                    same salt of the proper degree of strength. To prepare the new solution for the
                    increase of the-crystals, a quantity of the same salt is to be dissolved in a
                    given portion of water, so that it shall be fully saturated. It is then allowed
                    to cool and crystallize. The crystals being separated, the remaining solution is
                    to be employed in such quantity as may be judged necessary to replace that in
                    which the diminution of the crystals had commenced.</p>
                <p>Sometimes it happens, from want of necessary precaution, that the new solution in
                    which the process is to be conducted, either being too much saturated, or being
                    disturbed by pouring from one vessel to another, exhibits many other points of
                    attraction besides the crystals whose increase is proposed. In this case a great
                    number of small crystals make their appearance, and cover the surface of the
                    former with a kind of incrustation. The small crystals, provided they are taken
                    in time, may be removed without injury to the others; if not they will be
                    unavoidably spoiled.</p>
                <p>When the crystals have reached such a size as that they may be placed one by one
                    without being in contact with each other, we,must.-still continue frequently to,
                    change their position. This may be done with a spatula,∣ a glass rod, or indeed
                    any instrument which will commu-ļ nicate nothing to the fluid. In this way the
                    sides of the&lt; crystal which are alternately in contact with the bottom of the
                    vessel will increase in equal proportion, and it will always remain
                    complete.</p>
                <p>It is chiefly in salts which furnish elongated prisms that the influence of
                    position may be most distinctly seen. If, for instance, a crystal, before it
                    .has acquired much volume, be found to rest,on one of its bases as well as on
                    one of its sides, it will be observed to be compressed in the direction from
                    base to base; and it will appear to be only a regular segment of the crystal,
                    which, having been placed.on one of its sides, has obtained a great bulk. If we
                    take a six-sided prism whose summits are obliquely truncated, and if-.it be
                    placed on one of its sides, it will enlarge in a greater or less degree, but
                    always in such a manner that the distance from one base to the other shall never
                    be less than the distance between the sides. But if the position be on one of
                    its bases, then its principal increase will be in the direction of the sides,
                    and it will appear to be compressed between the bases. At first sight a crystal
                    treated in this way will seem different from the former. For the corners form
                    the summits of apparent pyramids which are separated by four-sided prisms. This
                    circumstance affords a sufficient explanation of one of the causes which produce
                    varieties in the appearance of a crystal with regard to its relative extent; it
                    shows that there is no foundation for the opinion of a supposed balance between
                    the particles of the salt and that of the solvent; and it shows also, that if
                    the force of attraction be the efficient cause of the saline particles coming
                    into contact, the force of gravitation acts at the same time, and modifies in a
                    greater or less degree the,effects of the first.</p>
                <p>According to these observations, and the different states in which crystallized
                    substances are found, it has been supposed that we might conclude that the force
                    of adhesion between the particles of the salt and those of the solvent varies
                    according to circumstances, which depend on the degree of tendency to
                    combination between the bodies, and the relative weight or bulk of the parts of
                    which these bodies are composed. If a crystal in the incipient stage of its
                    increase be placed upon one of its bases, it enlarges in the direction of its
                    sides; but if it be reversed and placed upon one of its sides, it enlarges in
                    the dimensions of an elongated prism.</p>
                <p>An insulated crystal, placed on one of its sides on a smooth surface, and left
                    undisturbed to enlarge in size, presents on this part a kind of hollow, which
                    corresponds exactly with the side which it replaces. Here the saline particles
                    which cannot reach this surface are distributed on the neighbouring parts with
                    which they come in contact; with this additional circumstance, that the edges of
                    the surface on which the crystal rests increase in proportion, but without
                    allowing the liquid to have access to this surface.</p>
                <p>The hollows which are formed at the surface of liquids differ sometimes from each
                    other even in the same salt. If we suppose that a particle forms the incipient
                    point of the hollow, the latter will assume a configuration corresponding to the
                    side of the particle presented to the surface of the liquid; but the part which
                    it touches increases also; and if by any circumstance a change of position shall
                    happen, the hollow, thus necessarily formed according to the arrangement of the
                    part which corresponds exactly to the surface of the liquid, will change its
                    form, because the new position of the side presented differs from the first.</p>

                <p>When a neutral salt, in a state of purity, and after being crystallized, ceases
                    to produce any effect on vegetable blues, it is not supposed that any of its
                    constituent principles is in excess. But if in this state it is found to combine
                    with other bodies, in such a manner as to produce solid and well-defined
                    crystals, we must admit that there exists an affinity between the salt and the
                    body with which it has combined.</p>
                <p>1 This subject, Leblanc observes of the supra-composition, or compound
                    combination as it might perhaps be called, of which several salts are
                    susceptible, has not hitherto occupied the attention of chemical philosophers.
                    Some, indeed, have been pointed out by Bergman and others; but it has been
                    remarked that these affinities are probably much more extensive than has
                    commonly been supposed, not only with regard to neutral salts with each other,
                    but also to neutral salts with other bodies. Of this kind of combination is not
                    to be reckoned that of one of the constituent parts of a salt being in excess,
                    which frequently takes place in some salts, and is found to be more or less
                    permanent. This circumstance seems to prove that certain salts have two
                    different points in the combination of their constituent parts. Let us see what
                    has been observed in this respect of the sulphate of alumina, which will perhaps
                    explain the reason why this salt is almost always found in nature in the
                    acidulous state. It is known that the more that alum approaches to the state of
                    saturation by an additional portion of base, the less solid the new combination
                    becomes; and in all cases, after a certain time, which is longer or shorter
                    according to circumstances, the portion which was added separates. It will
                    perhaps appear in the sequel, that this tendency to combination which is
                    constantly in action, producing an immense multitude of different individuals,
                    resides not only among the properties of the simple principles, but also in
                    those which belong to all the compounds.</p>
                <p>Many of the sulphates are always found in the acidulous state; and all of them
                    seem to be susceptible of combination with a new quantity of the same base, till
                    they reach the point of saturation. For example, the sulphate of copper, in the
                    state in which it is usually found, crystallizes in eight-sided oblique prisms,
                    terminated by sides according to the obliquity of the prism. But if another
                    portion of base be added, the crystals assume the form of pyramids of several
                    faces, separated by four-sided prisms. The acidulous sulphate of zinc gives
                    crystals of six-sided prisms, which are often very regular; but an addition of
                    base produces a great change, for then the crystals are in the rhomboidal form,
                    and very little different from the cube. Alum, in its ordinary state of
                    combination, crystallizes in the form of a regular octahedron; but in the
                    intermediate proportions between this state and that of saturation it assumes
                    the form of a cube.</p>
                <p>Haüy, as will be afterwards noticed, has demonstrated that the form of the
                    primitive molecules is the same in all crystals of the same salt; and he has
                    shown by calculation that the variations arise from the laws of decrement in the
                    layers which surround the nucleus; but that the order according to which the
                    secondary forms are produced may be interrupted whether this form be complete or
                    not; and the crystal may then, according to circumstances, return to its
                    primitive form, or to some of those which are derived from it. But from the
                    experiments of Leblanc, he thinks that these changes always depend on new
                    conditions in the state of the fluid, as a different proportion of the
                    principles of which the salt is composed.</p>
                <p>If a crystal of octahedral alum be placed in a solution which forms cubic
                    crystals of the same salt, the former will assume the cubic form, by giving up a
                    series of molecules from the summits of the solid angles, so that the layers
                    will continue to decrease on the triangular faces till the crystal has completed
                    its new form. In this process, the change may be stopped at any period, and
                    crystals of every modification of form may be obtained. From this it follows
                    that the centre of each of the faces of the octahedron corresponds to a solid
                    angle of the cube in which it is inscribed. But if a cubical crystal be
                    introduced into the solution which yields the octahedron, its return to this
                    latter form proceeds in the same order by the subtraction of a series of
                    molecules from the solid angles of the cube. It often happens, however, at the
                    same time, that the subtraction of the molecules extends to the corners of the
                    crystal; so that the layers of superposition decrease all at once according to
                    the order of the formation of the octahedron, and the dodecahedron with
                    rhomboidal surfaces. This circumstance seems to suggest the possibility of
                    obtaining crystals of alum of this latter form; but it seems to depend on a
                    particular proportion, which is not easily determined.</p>
                <p>Thus we learn from experiment that salts which exhibit different forms of
                    crystals can be made to assume each of these at pleasure. This-phenomenon, which
                    has not been much attended to, seems to merit particular investigation. The
                    transition from one form to another may be explained according to the laws of
                    diminution, by the successive and regular subtraction of series of molecules; so
                    that the form being actually obtained, the restoration of the preceding form is
                    easily explicable on the principle of restitution alone. It may be observed,
                    that during this kind of metamorphosis, both operations, namely, that by which
                    the crystal receives on the one hand a new form, and that by which, on the other
                    hand, it increases on all its sides, constantly take place.</p>
                <p>The particles of a salt which are in 'solution in a fluid are attracted by it,
                    particle by particle, without any separation or decomposition; but it is
                    necessary that there should be a balance of the attracting forces between the
                    salt and the solvent. This is demonstrated by the following experiment: A vessel
                    two feet in height and two inches in diameter was filled with a solution of a
                    proper degree of concentration for the growth of crystals, which were suspended
                    at different heights from the bottom of the vessel to the surface of the fluid;
                    and it was observed that the increase of the crystal was in proportion to its
                    depth in the vessel, that which was nearest the bottom increasing most rapidly.
                    When the liquid was deprived of saline particles by their accumulation on the
                    crystals, by rest, and sometimes even by the influence of the atmosphere, the
                    crystals decreased by similar gradations to those of their increase; so that it
                    at last reached that state when the crystals near the surface of the liquid were
                    dissolved, whilst those towards the bottom continued to increase; and sometimes
                    it happened that the crystals at the bottom of the vessel continued to increase
                    on the surface which was in contact with it, whilst the opposite upper surface
                    was in a state of dissolution.</p>
                <p>All the experiments which were made on salts of different degrees of specific
                    gravity accord with this observation; and the difference in the degrees of
                    saturation of the waters of the ocean, which depends on the difference of depth,
                    seems to be in favour of this opinion. It is confirmed by the analysis of
                    sea-water by Bergman and others, which was taken up in different places and at
                    different depths. It receives still further confirmation from a practice of the
                    inhabitants of Salines, in Bearn, in estimating the degree of strength of a salt
                    spring. An egg is thrown into the waters of the spring, and the whole water
                    which covers the surface of the egg is thrown away, as it is not of a sufficient
                    degree of concentration.</p>
                <p>It is well known that a cold temperature is most convenient<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194753889" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3889-0509"/> for the crystallization of
                    salts. But it is not at the period when the salt begins to crystallize that it
                    is most convenient to carry on the process; for then it sometimes happens, from
                    too great concentration of the fluid, that the crystallization is too rapid and
                    confused.</p>
                <p>Hitherto saline substances, which are susceptible of regular crystallization,
                    have been divided into two classes, ‘according to the peculiarities in the
                    formation of their crystals. The one class comprehends those crystals which are
                    formed by cooling the fluid in which the solution is made; the other class
                    includes those which are produced only during the evaporation of the solution.
                    This distinction is no doubt well founded; but there are some exceptions to it
                    which are necessary to be attended to in conducting the process of
                    crystallization. If a saline solution which is too much saturated be cooled, it
                    furnishes a mass of crystals which are confused and irregular, and which present
                    no determinate form except on those sides which are in contact with the liquid.
                    If in this state the remaining liquid is poured off, it will yield another set
                    of crystals, but in very small number; and there are some salts which continue
                    to form crystals after being several times successively treated in this way, the
                    number of the crystals still diminishing from the first degree of concentration.
                    It will be found too that this will take place whether the process be carried on
                    in the open air or in close vessels. It follows from this that the increase or
                    the formation of crystals in this case depends solely on the mutual attraction
                    of the particles, or on the attraction between the particles and the crystal; an
                    attraction or affinity which is not destroyed by the cooling of the fluid, but
                    is probably regulated by the distance of the particles, and the degree of force
                    or affinity which exists between the particles and the solvent. In some saline
                    solutions the increase of the crystals goes on in this manner for a long time.
                    It is only in the interval between the cooling of the liquid to the temperature
                    of the atmosphere, and that period when its degree of concentration is so
                    diminished that the increase of the crystals ceases, that the latter proceeds
                    with the degree of perfection of which it is susceptible.</p>
                <p>It is not a property peculiar to dry substances to absorb moisture from the
                    atmosphere. Liquids saturated with certain salts seem also to possess this
                    property; for in some saline solutions the liquids assume a solvent power which
                    never fails to attack the crystals, and not only to prevent their increase, but
                    to diminish the bulk which they had acquired. This accident can only be obviated
                    by regulating the state of the atmosphere in which the evaporating vessels are
                    placed, and preserving it free from any excess of moisture. From causes which
                    produce a contrary effect, the evaporation becomes too rapid: this circumstance
                    also requires to be attended to and properly regulated to insure the full
                    success of the operation.</p>
                <p>From the preceding observations it will appear that solutions of salts which are
                    susceptible of crystallization have certain degrees of concentration which are
                    necessary for the formation of crystals, and that they must be reduced nearly to
                    that degree in which they begin to yield crystals before it can be expected that
                    they will afford proper results. It is therefore necessary to attend
                    particularly to the degree of concentration which each salt requires for the I
                    regular formation of its crystals, and to obtain them with that degree of
                    transparency of which they are susceptible. We have seen that in the formation
                    of crystals they may be removed from one vessel to another, and from one
                    solution to another; and that, in proportion to the slowness of the process,
                    they become more beautiful and more perfect. These operations, it may be added,
                    require much patience and attention; but at the same time the observer is fully
                    compensated for his trouble by perceiving the progress of the crystallization,
                    and by the interest which is excited in all its stages.</p>
                <p>It is essential to know that neither the crystals formed* during the artificial
                    evaporation, nor those which are produced during the cooling of the solution,
                    are proper to be made choice of for being increased and brought forward to the
                    most perfect crystals. When a solution has become cold, that is to say, when it
                    has acquired the temperature of the atmosphere, and is deprived of the excess of
                    saline particles which it held in combination during its increase of
                    temperature, it is still in a condition to yield crystals, and, as long as the
                    distances between the particles are not too great, to allow of mutual
                    attraction. A solution saturated to excess affords on cooling a confused mass of
                    crystals; but after the fluid has been poured off, it will still produce more
                    crystals, though in smaller number. The degree of concentration of the solution
                    before it yielded the last product may be considered as the term of saturation
                    most proper to be employed for the species of salt which is thus treated. But by
                    the repetition of these operations, and the observation of their progress,
                    itwill not be difficult to discover the proper proportions between the salt and
                    the solvent.</p>
                <p>It seems to be a mistake to suppose with some that the crystals which are placed
                    in favourable circumstances for becoming larger and more perfect are injured by
                    coming in contact with each other during their increase. It is un-· doubtedly
                    better that they should be kept separate; but it does not appear that they are
                    hurt by touching each other, if the number in the vessel be not too great, and
                    they are not heaped or pressed together. In that crystallization which results
                    from the cooling of a solution too much saturated, the crystals are always
                    confused and interlaced with each other; the molecules which are arranged in
                    this kind of disorder also experience a kind of irregular distribution; and it
                    may be observed that in this case the summits only of the crystals which are
                    elevated from the kind of cake which is formed on the surfaces of the vessel
                    containing the solution, present regular and determinate forms. The mass in
                    which these crystals are implanted is a confused heap.</p>
                <p>No cavities have been observed on the faces of crystals excepting those which are
                    formed on the surface of fluids. Those which are produced on that side of a
                    crystal which rests on the bottom of the vessel are more common in other salts.
                    This phenomenon seems to merit more attention than has yet been bestowed upon
                    it, as it explains easily the introduction of extraneous bodies which are
                    sometimes detected in the interior of crystals. For when a cavity of this kind
                    has acquired a certain depth, it is capable of receiving part of any foreign
                    substance, and of being filled up by the change of position of the same crystal,
                    retaining at the same time the extraneous matter. By a little art and dexterity
                    these fortuitous circumstances may be favoured, so that phenomena exhibited by
                    such occurrences may be traced and observed at the pleasure of the operator.
                    Experiments have been made with the view of ascertaining whether an extraneous
                    substance could be substituted as the nucleus of a crystal; but from the result
                    of these experiments it does not appear that the particles of any salt have a
                    tendency to combine with any foreign matter, and to form regular crystals. The
                    portions of the salt which were attached to the extraneous substance were always
                    separate and independent crystals.</p>
                <p>There are some saline substances which retain in their solution an excess of
                    particles even after cooling, and which being strongly agitated, instantly
                    deposit so great a number of small crystals as to render the solution turbid.
                    The introduction of crystals of the same salt, it is <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194753902" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3902-0510"/>well known, as in the case of
                    a solution of Glauber’s salt, promotes this sudden crystallization or separation
                    of the excess of the salt. If in this state .of the solution crystals are
                    immersed with the view of having them large and regular, they are certain of
                    being spoiled by the accumulation of a great number of small crystals on their
                    surface, unless, when this happens, the precaution of immediately washing them
                    with pure water is observed.</p>
                <p>It may be remarked also, that when the solution is diminished below a certain
                    degree of saturation, the crystals not only cease to increase, but are also
                    again ih sorpe measure dissolved—the corners and angles reduced and rounded. And
                    if the crystals in this state be introduced into a solution of sufficient
                    strength to promote their increase, supernumerary faces and truncatures, as they
                    are denominated in technical language, are formed on the rounded corners and
                    angles. But these faces always disappear as the increase of the crystals
                    proceeds, and are replaced by corners and angles, which become at last sharp
                    arid distinct. ‘ .</p>
                <p>By attention to preserve the solutions of salt in perfect purity, we shall be
                    more certain of obtaining the most beautiful and transparent crystals. Some
                    fluids, after a certain time, are observed to deposit substances which are
                    foreign to the salt held in solution, and were dissolved along with it. These
                    substances sometimes appear in the form of earthy matters, which precipitate to
                    the bottom of the vessel; in other cases they are diffused in the form of
                    flakes, and sometimes they rise and swim on the Surface. In all these cases the
                    crystals whose formation and increase are going forward must be removed, and the
                    liquor must be filtrated before they are replaced.</p>
                <p>A saline substance which is capable of crystallization possesses, in the state of
                    minute division in which it is in solution, Or in the epndition of the molecules
                    which compose it, a determinate property which is uniform and constant, and in
                    which resides essentially the power of uniting in a certain symmetrical manner,
                    and thus constructing regular solids. The results also are uniform and constant
                    when the process is carefully conducted; but it is necessary to distinguish
                    .with accuracy the circumstances which accompany the operation, and may occasion
                    a deviation from this uniformity. The sulphate of iron, for instance, usually
                    crystallizes in the form of rhomboids; but sometimes it has been found to assume
                    that of an irregular octahedron. And although it may be true that an elongated
                    octahedron riiay be classed with prismatic crystals, it does not on that account
                    belong less to the octahedral form; but it seems probable that these different
                    varieties, in the forms of crystals, depend on some changes which take place in
                    the solutions themselves. The iron in the present case is constantly recéivitìg
                    new portions of oxygen from the atmosphere, and in this new combination it is
                    precipitated in the fluid; this, therefore, occasions a change in the
                    constituents of the salt.</p>
                <p>Several sulphates are found to combine readily with each other: those of iron and
                    copper are of this description, and the result of the compound crystal is always
                    a rhomboid. It seems to be doubtful whether this should be considered as a case
                    of simple interposition of one salt with the other.</p>
                <p>When a liquid which holds saline bodies in solution is evaporated to a certain
                    degree, a crust forms on the surface, acquires a certain thickness, and when
                    this is removed it is renewed. The point at which the liquid exhibits this
                    appearance is known in chemistry by the appellation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >evaporation to a pellicle.</hi> When it has reached this point, the solution is
                    in a state of complete saturation; and the smallest additional quantity of fluid
                    cannot be withdrawn without a corresponding quantity of salt assuming the solid
                    form. On this principle Robinet has attempted to account for the formation of
                    <hi rend="italic">dendrites,</hi> or the arborescent appearance and
                    efflorescence of some salts. Almost all the different appearances of fucus or
                    sea-weed, he observes, are covered in drying with an efflorescence of white
                    matter. In sortie species this white matter was observed to possess a saccharine
                    quality. A number of large roots of the <hi rend="italic">fucus palmatus</hi>
                    was hung up in the shade, and ten days had elapsed without the appearance of any
                    thing on the surface. After that period it became white, and it was soon covered
                    with a light downy substance, the filaments of which gradually increased to a
                    considerable length. When this downy matter was brushed off with a feather, it
                    was renewed till' the plants were completely dry. This substance, it appearéd on
                    examination, was of a saccharine nature, mixed with a small portion of Common
                    salt and a great quantity of mucilaginous matter. By solution and
                    crystallization, the sugar was separated from the other substances.’ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> " <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> ∙∙w∣</p>
                <p>In comparing the circumstances of this efflorescence with those of the formation
                    of the pellicle, in the progress of evaporation, the former seems to be a
                    modification of the latter. In a vessel which contains a liquid saturated with a
                    salt; the surface subjected to evaporation has no sooner assumed.a solid form,
                    than the surface immediately inferior is exposed to the action of the same
                    causés, and produces the same effect; and this effect continues till the crust
                    has become so thick or so compact, as to prevent the contact of air, and then
                    the evaporation ceases. But, on the contrary, in the fucus, the air acting only
                    on the surface of the plant, the liquid which it contains cannot undergo the
                    process of evaporation without coming to the surface. The attraction of the
                    matter of the plant tends to promote this motion; for as the liquid is equally
                    diffused throughout its whole mass, it rises constantly to the surface, in
                    proportion as this surface is dried by the surrounding air; and it would appear
                    that this is the process in the dessication of all thick and massy bodies. Now,
                    the saline matter which, in the present case, is in the state of efflorescence,
                    having the same power of attraction on the liquid, the rudiments of each
                    filament constitute, at the instant of their formation, part of the whole mass
                    or body of the plant. They participate, therefore, of the same degree of
                    moisture as that of the plant, and it is on their surface that the evaporation
                    and crystallization of saline matter chiefly take place.</p>
                <p>The mechanism of the dendritical or arborescent form of saline bodies seems to be
                    in this way capable of explanation. The whole saline mass, which extends to the
                    edges of the vessel, and even redescends externally, is constantly in the humid
                    state as long as any liquid remains in the vessel. It may be supposed that the
                    matter of the sides of the vessel determines, by its attraction, the external
                    circle of the surface of the liquid to rise above the surface; a phenomenon
                    .which is sufficiently obvious, especially in narrow vessels. This portion of
                    liquid, which is more completely subjected to evaporation, gives origin to a
                    circle of saline matter, which appears thus raised above the surface of the
                    liquid, and which being the first rudiments of the dendrites, contributes
                    afterwards to its increase in the way which has been already explained. Thus the
                    vegetation of salts bears a striking resemblance to the process
                    of-efflorescence, or the formation of the downy matter on the surface of the
                    fucus.</p>
                <p>There is yet another kind of crystallization which seems to depend on the same
                    cause.. This is the saline efflorescence which occurs in different places' on
                    the surface of the globe, and is frequently in such quantity as to become an
                    important object of manufacture. Without extending our observations to the
                    efflorescence of soda on the surface <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753915"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3915-0511"/>of the soil in Egypt, or that of nitre in Asiatic
                    countries, we may refer to the production of muriate of soda, or common salt, in
                    different parts of Europe, and in those places which are covered with the waters
                    of the ocean during high tides. The waters of the sea, with which the sandy
                    shores are twice periodically moistened in the course of a month, are far
                    distant from the point of saturation which determines crystallization. They
                    rarely contain more than three parts of salt in a hundred; and the sand, at the
                    degree of moisture in which it is left by the sea, is not impregnated with a
                    sufficient quantity of saline matter to be worthy the labour of manufacturing;
                    but during the interval between the tides these circumstances are greatly
                    changed. The dry air of summer, by evaporating the moisture on the surface,
                    allows the matter of the sand to attract towards the surface a similar portion
                    of water, which was in the lower part of the soil, and which always tends to
                    diffuse itself equally through the whole mass. This liquid, carrying with it the
                    salt, which it holds in solution, increases the quantity of saline matter which
                    exists on the surface; and the process continues without interruption as long as
                    there is no fall of rain. It reaches at last a certain point, at which the water
                    subjected to evaporation is saturated with the salt; and this process cannot
                    proceed further without the deposition of crystals of the salt, which discover
                    themselves by their shining appearance. After some days the sand on the surface
                    is collected, and about six times the quantity of saline matter is found in the
                    same proportion of sand that it contained when it was first moistened by the sea
                    water.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Common salt is
                    manufactured in this way on the sandy shores of the Solway Frith, in Annandale
                    in Scotland. These flat shores: are covered with the waters of the ocean during
                    spring tides; and in the interval of these tides the evaporation by the heat of
                    the sun and the action of the air is so considerable, as to leave the sand
                    impregnated with a quantity of salt sufficient to defray the expense and trouble
                    of manufacturing it by filtration and boiling, ,, <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> *
                    .</p></note></p>
                <p>Another phenomenon which takes place during the ρro-ncess of artificial
                    evaporation should not pass unnoticed. » This is the formation of a saline
                    crustat the bottom of the vessels in which the process is conducted. This seems
                    to be the immediate effect of ebullition; for when the temperature of the liquid
                    is kept under the boiling point, no such effect is produced. This crust is
                    composed of all the saline substances which are held in solution in the liquid;
                    and even these substances are found combined in the same proportion in which
                    they actually exist in the solution. Whatever be the attraction of these
                    substances for water, or whether they even possess a deliquescent property, they
                    are not the less disposed to enter into combination during the formation of the
                    solid crust on the bottom of vessels in which the process of evaporation is
                    conducted with a temperature equal to the boiling point. A slight degree of
                    attention will satisfy us that the formation of this crust depends on the
                    particular circumstances of the evaporation in the case of ebullition. It must
                    be obvious, that in this case the stratum of liquid which is in immediate
                    contact with the vessel receives the caloric which penetrates its sides, is
                    charged with it beyond its capacity, changes its state, and assumes the gaseous
                    form, and by this change having entirely lost its solvent power, whatever saline
                    matter is held in solution must assume the solid state in contact with the sides
                    of the vessel, and consequently adhere to it Thus it happens, according to a
                    very judicious observation, that in different saline solutions, the results of
                    which have been compared, these scales or crusts are more abundant in proportion
                    as the degree of saturation is diminished.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>OF THE THEORY OF THE STRUCTURE OF CRYSTALS.</p>
                <p>In the former section we have given a view of the phenomena of crystallization.
                    The regular forms which bodies assume by means of this process, have occupied no
                    small share of the attention of naturalists and chemical philosophers. The
                    researches and investigations of Bergman, Rome de l’lsle, and Haiiy, have been
                    particularly directed this way. Bergman, in his twelfth Dissertation,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Physical
                    and Chemical Essays.</hi></p></note> treats of the variety of the forms of
                    crystals, of the various figures derived from the spathaceous form, of the
                    structure of the most minute parts, and of the different modes in which crystals
                    are generated. Rome de l’lsle has arranged crystals into six species, derived
                    from the varieties of form: 1. Tetrahedron; 2. Cube; 3. Octahedron; 4.
                    Parallelopiped; 5. Rhomboidal octahedron; 6. Dodecahedron. But the ingenious
                    researches of Haüy on this subject have been followed by the completest and most
                    successful investigation of the theory of the structure of crystals which has
                    yet appeared. Of this theory, an account of which the reader will find in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">de Chimie,</hi> tome xvii. and
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Traité de Minéralogie,</hi> tome i. we now propose to
                    give a comprehensive view.</p>
                <p>This theory, the author observes, cannot be fully understood without the aid of
                    analytical calculations; for, besides the convenience of analysis, including in
                    the same formula a great number of different problems, it is by means of it
                    alone that the theory can assume the character of absolute certainty in arriving
                    at the same results which are obtained by observation. But notwithstanding these
                    considerations, it seemed to be better for those who have not a competent
                    knowledge of the science of calculation to prefer the method of simple
                    reasoning, but accompanied with geometrical figures, which are so useful in
                    giving a distinct conception of the arrangement of the small solids which
                    combine together to form a crystal. This arrangement is denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">structure,</hi> in opposition to the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >organization,</hi> which expresses the more complicated mechanism of vegetables
                    and animals. This method may perhaps be less direct, and less precise and
                    expeditious, and it may require attention to those details which are passed over

                    this advantage, that the mind by its means perceives better the connection of
                    the different; parts under consideration, and can more readily comprehend the
                    facts with which it is furnished.</p>

                <p>The same mineral substance, it is known, is susceptible of several different
                    forms, well defined, some of which do not appear, at first sight, to have any
                    common point of resemblance to indicate their relation. If, for instance, we
                    compare the regular hexahedral prism of calcareous spar with the rhomboid of the
                    same mineral,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The name

                    angle is about 1011°, we should be led to believe that each of these two forms
                    is quite distinct from the other. But this point of relation, which escapes
                    notice when we consider only the external form, becomes sensible when we attend
                    to the intimate mechanism of the structure. Here the author gives an historical
                    view of the progress of his researches, and traces the steps which led him to
                    the discovery of what became as it were the key of his whole theory.</p>
                <p>He had in his hand a hexahedral prism of calcareous spar, similar to that
                    mentioned above, and which had been detached from a group of the same crystals.
                    The fracture presented a very smopth surface, situated obliquely, like the
                    trapezium <hi rend="italic">psut</hi> (fig. 1), and which had an angle of 135°,
                    both with the remainder <hi rend="italic">abesph</hi> of the base, and with the
                    remainder <hi rend="italic">tuer of</hi> the plane <hi rend="italic">iner.</hi>
                    Observing that the cuneiform segment <hi rend="italic">psutin,</hi> which this
                    fracture separated from the crystal, had for its vertex one of the edges of the
                    base, namely the edge <hi rend="italic">in,</hi> he attempted to separate a
                    second segment in that part to which the contiguous edge <hi rend="italic"
                    >cm</hi> belonged. For this purpose he employed the blade of a knife, directed
                    with the same degree of obliquity as the trapezium <hi rend="italic">psut,</hi>
                    and aided by the stroke of a hammer. This attempt failed; but having tried the
                    same operation towards the next edge <hi rend="italic">bc,</hi> a new trapezium
                    similar to the first came into view. The fourth edge <hi rend="italic">αb</hi>
                    resisted the instrument, but the following, <hi rend="italic">ah,</hi> readily
                    yielded to mechanical division, and presented a third trapezium, having as fine
                    a polish as the other two. The sixth edge <hi rend="italic">ih,</hi> it is
                    scarcely necessary to observe, could not be divided, any more than the fourth
                    and the second. <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi></p>
                <p>Proceeding then to the inferior base <hi rend="italic">defghr,</hi> it was soon
                    found that the edges of this base, which admitted of divisions similar to the
                    preceding, were not the edges <hi rend="italic">er, dr, gh,</hi> which
                    corresponded to those which could be divided towards the upper part, but the
                    intermediate edges <hi rend="italic">de, vy, gf.</hi> The trapezium <hi
                    rend="italic">lĳyv</hi> shows the section made below the edge <hi rend="italic"
                    >hr.</hi> This section is obviously parallel to that of the trapezium <hi
                    rend="italic">psut</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the four other sections are
                    in like manner parallel, two and two. Now, these different sections being in the
                    direction of the natural joints of the laminae, it was easy to obtain others
                    parallel to each of them, but it was found impossible to divide the crystal in
                    any other direction. Following this mechanical division according to the
                    parallelism stated above, new sections were obtained, always nearer to the axis
                    of the prism; and when the sections were carried so far as to make the remainder
                    of the two bases disappear, the prism was transformed into a solid OX (fig. 2),
                    terminated by twelve pentagons, parallel two to two, of which those of the
                    extremities, namely, SAOIR, GIODE, BAODC, on the one side, and KNPQF, MNPXU,
                    ZQPXY, on the other, were the results of the mechanical division, and had their
                    common vertices O, P, situated in the centres of the bases of the prism, fig. 1.
                    The six lateral pentagons RSUXY, ZYRIG, &amp;c. (fig. 2), were the remainders of
                    the planes of the same prism.</p>
                <p>In proportion as the sections were multiplied always parallel to the preceding,
                    the lateral pentagons diminished in height; and at a certain term the points R,
                    G being confounded with the points Y, Z, the points S, R with the points U, Y,
                    &amp;c. there remained no more of these pentagons, but the triangles YIZ, UXY,
                    &amp;c. (fig. 3.) Beyond that term the sections coming to pass over the surface
                    of these triangles diminished gradually in extent, till at last the same
                    triangles were lost, and then the solid obtained from the hexahedral prism
                    appeared to be a <hi rend="superscript"> (</hi> rhomboid <hi rend="italic"
                    >ae</hi> (fig. 4) exactly similar to that which is commonly denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">Iceland spar.</hi></p>
                <p>So unexpected a result led the ingenious author to the examination of other
                    calcareous crystals in a similar manner, all of which yielded to mechanical
                    division in such a way that when the external surfaces had disappeared, the
                    nucleus which remained was always a rhomboid, of the same form as the first. All
                    that was necessary was to discover the direction of the sections which conducted
                    to the central rhomboid.</p>
                <p>To extract, for instance, this rhomboid from the spar which is usually
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">lenticular,</hi> and which is itself a much more
                    obtuse rhomboid, having its large plane angle equal to 114° 18' 56", it was
                    necessary to begin with the two vertices, and to make the sections pass through
                    the small diagonals of the faces. But if it is wished, on the contrary, to get
                    at the nucleus of the rhomboidal spar with acute vertices, the direction of the
                    sections of the planes must be parallel to the edges contiguous to the summits,
                    and in such a manner that each of them shall be equally inclined to the faces
                    which it cuts.</p>
                <p>These results are the more worthy of attention, as it would seem at first, that
                    in the process of crystallization, after the rhomboid has been once adopted with
                    regard to a determined species of mineral, it ought always to reproduce it with
                    the same angles. But the paradox which arises from this diversity of appearance
                    is explained by the double usö of the rhomboidal form, which serves here to
                    disguise itself, and conceals fixed and constant characters under a variable
                    external appearance.</p>
                <p>If we take a crystal of a different nature, such as a cube of <hi rend="italic"
                    >fluor spar,</hi> the nucleus will have a different form. This will be, in the
                    present case, an octahedron, which we Shall obtain by taking off the eight solid
                    angles of the cube. Heavy spar will produce for a nucleus a right prism with
                    rhomboidal bases; feldspar, an oblique-angled parallelopiped, but not
                    rhomboidal; apatite or beryl, a right sixsided prism; the adamantine spar a
                    rhomboid, a little acute; blende, a dodecahedron, with rhomboidal planes; iron
                    of the island of Elba, a cube, &amp;c.: and each of these forms will be constant
                    in relation to the whole species, so that its angles will undergo no variation
                    which is appreciable; and if we attempt to divide the crystal in any other
                    direction, we shall not be able to find any joint; we shall only obtain
                    indeterminate fragments; it will rather be broken than divided.</p>
                <p>These solids inscribed each in all the crystals of the same species, ought to be
                    regarded as the true primitive forms on which all the other forms depend. All
                    minerals, it is true, are not susceptible of mechanical division, but the number
                    is greater than it appeared at first sight; and with regard to those crystals in
                    which the attempts to discover the natural joints have failed, it has been
                    remarked that their surface striated in a certain direction, or the relation of
                    their different forms, among those which belong to the same substance,
                    frequently presented indications of their structure, and by reasoning from their
                    analogy with other divisible crystals, we may determine this structure, at least
                    with a good deal of probability.</p>
                <p>All deviations from the primitive form are called by Haüy <hi rend="italic"
                    >secondary forms.</hi> But the number of these forms has certain limits, which
                    can be determined by theory, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753941"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3941-0513"/>according to the laws which regulate the structure
                    of crystals.</p>
                <p>The solid of the primitive form, which is obtained by means of the operation
                    described above, may be further subdivided in a direction parallel to its
                    different faces. All the surrounding matter is equally divisible by sections
                    parallel to the faces of the primitive form. Hence it follows, that the parts
                    detached by the aid of all these sections are similar, and only differ in their
                    volume, which continually decreases in proportion to the extent of the division.
                    Those, however, must be excepted, which are near to the faces of the secondary
                    solid; for these faces not being parallel to those of the primitive form, the
                    fragments which have one of their facets taken in the same faces, cannot exactly
                    resemble those which are detached towards the middle of the crystal. For
                    instance, the fragments of the hexahedral prism (fig. 1), whose external facets
                    make part of the bases, or of the planes, have not, in this respect, the same
                    figure with those which are situated nearer to the centre, all of whose facets
                    are parallel to the sections <hi rend="italic">psut, lqyv</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but the difficulty which presents itself at first sight, in consequence
                    of that diversity, is removed by the help of the theory, and the whole are
                    reduced to a unity of form.</p>
                <p>But the division of the crystal into small similar solids has a certain limit,
                    beyond which we should arrive at particles so small that they are no longer
                    divisible, without destroying the nature of the substance, or decomposing it. At
                    this term the investigation stops, and to the small solids, which we might
                    insulate if our organs and instruments were sufficiently delicate, Haiiy has
                    given the name of <hi rend="italic">integrant</hi> or <hi rend="italic">integral
                    molecules.</hi> He thinks it probable that these molecules are those which were
                    suspended in the fluid in which the crystallization took place. In general it
                    may be observed that, with the aid of these molecules, the theory reduces to
                    simple laws the different forms of crystals, and arrives at results which
                    exactly represent those of nature.</p>
                <p>When the nucleus is a parallelopiped, that is, a solid having six parallel faces,
                    two to two, like the cube, the rhomboid, &amp;c. and this solid admits of no
                    other divisions than those which are made in the direction of its faces, it is
                    obvious that the molecules which result from the subdivision, whether of the
                    nucleus or of the surrounding matter, are similar to this nucleus. In other
                    cases, the form of the molecules is different from that of the nucleus. There
                    are, besides, other crystals which afford, by means of mechanical division,
                    particles of different figures combined together through the whole extent of
                    these crystals. The ingenious author of the theory has thrown out some
                    conjectures on the manner of resolving the difficulty which these kinds of mixed
                    structures present; and at any rate, he observes that it does not in any degree
                    affect the stability of the theory.</p>
                <p>II. LAWS OF DECREMENT.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Decrements at the Edges.</hi></p>
                <p>The primitive form, and that of the integrant molecules, being determined, after
                    the dissection of the crystals, we must investigate the laws according to which
                    these molecules were combined, to produce around the. primitive form those kinds
                    of coverings which terminated so regularly, and from which resulted polyhedra so
                    different from each other, although originally of the same substance. Now, such
                    is the mechanism of the structure subject to these laws, that all the parts of
                    the secondary crystal superadded to the nucleus are formed of laminae, which
                    decrease regularly by subtractions of one or more ranges of integral molecules,
                    so that theory determines the number of these rows, and by a necessary
                    consequence the exact form of the secondary crystal. '</p>
                <p>To have a distinct idea of these laws, let us take a very simple and elementary
                    example. Conceive EP (fig. 5) to represent a dodecahedron whose faces are equal
                    and similar rhombuses, and that this dodecahedron is a secondary form, having a
                    cube for its nucleus or primitive form. By the inspection of fig. 6, the
                    position of this cube in the crystal may be easily conceived. The small
                    diagonals DC, ĊG, GF, FD of the four faces of the dodecahedron, being united
                    round the same solid angle, form a square CDFG. Now there are six solid angles,
                    composed of the four planes, namely, the angles L, Ö, E, N, R, P (fig. 5), and
                    consequently, if sections are made to pass through the small diagonals of the
                    faces which compose the solid angles, six squares will be successively
                    uncovered. These squares will be the faces of the primitive cube, of which three
                    are represented at fig. 6, namely, CDFG, ABCD, BCGH.</p>
                <p>This cube would evidently be an assemblage of cubic integral molecules, and it
                    would be necessary that each of the pyramids, such as LDCGF (fig. 6), which rest
                    on the faces, should be itself composed of cubes equal to each other, and to
                    those which form the nucleus. To have a more distinct conception of this
                    arrangement, let us compose an artificial dodecahedron of a certain number of
                    small cubes, the arrangement of which will be an imitation of the process of
                    nature in disposing the molecules in the formation of the dodecahedron.</p>
                <p>Let ABGF (fig. 7) be a cube composed of 729 small cubes equal to each other, in
                    which case each face of the whole cube will include eighty-one squares, that is,
                    nine on each side, which will be the external faces of as many partial cubes
                    representing the molecules. This cube will be the nucleus of the dodecahedron
                    which is to be constructed. On one of the faces, as ABCD, of the cube, apply a
                    square lamina, composed of cubes equal to those which form the nucleus, but
                    having towards each a row of cubes less than if it were on a level with the
                    contiguous faces BCGH, DCGF, &amp;c. This lamina will be composed of forty-nine
                    cubes, that is, seven on each side, so that if the inferior base be <hi
                    rend="italic">onfg</hi> (fig. 8), this base will fall exactly on the square
                    marked with the same letters in fig. 7. Above this first lamina let a second be
                    applied, composed of tw enty-five cubes, five on each side, so that if <hi
                    rend="italic">lmpu</hi> (fig. 9) represent its inferior base, this base will
                    correspond exactly with the square marked with the same letters in fig. 7. If in
                    like manner a third lamina be applied to the second, which is composed only of
                    nine cubes, that is, three on each side, so that <hi rend="italic">vxyz</hi>
                    (fig. 10), being the inferior base, shall correspond with the square marked with
                    the same letters in fig. 7; and if on the middle square <hi rend="italic">τ</hi>
                    of the preceding lamina the small cube <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> (fig. 11) be
                    placed, this will represent the last lamina.</p>
                <p>When this operation is completed, it will appear that there is formed on the face
                    ABCD (fig. 7) a four-sided pyramid, of which this face is the base, and the cube
                    <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> (fig. 11) is the summit. And if the same operation be
                    continued on the other five sides of the cube, we shall have six four-sided
                    pyramids resting on the six faces of the nucleus, which is enveloped with them
                    on all sides. But as the different rows of laminae composing these pyramids
                    project beyond each other for a certain way, as appears on fig. 12, where the
                    parts raised above the planes BCD, BCG represent the two pyramids which rest on
                    the faces ABCD, BCGH (fig. 7), the faces of the pyramids will not form continued
                    planes; for they will be alternately re-entering and salient, in some measure
                    imitating a stair with four sides.</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose that the nucleus is composed of a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194753954" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3954-0514"/>number of almost
                    imperceptible cubes incomparably greater, and that the laminae applied on the
                    different faces, which maybe called the laminae of superposition, continue to
                    increase towards their four edges by subtractions of one range of cubes equal to
                    those of the nucleus, the number of these laminae will be incomparably greater
                    than in the preceding hypothesis; and at the same time the cavitiesor <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> furrows which they form, as they alternately become
                    salient or re-entering; will be almost imperceptible; and indeed it might be
                    supposed that the cubes of which the crystal is composed are so small as to
                    become quite imperceptible to our senses, and the faces of the pyramids to be
                    perfectly smooth.</p>
                <p>Now DCBE (fig. 12) being the pyramid which rests on the face ABCD (fig. 7), and
                    CBOG (fig. 12) the pyramid applied to the face BCGH (fig. 7), if we consider
                    that every thing is uniform from E to 0 (fig. 12) in the manner in which the
                    laminae of superposition mutually project beyond each other, we may readily
                    conceive that the face CEB of the first pyramid ought to be exactly in the same
                    plane as the face COB of the contiguous pyramid, so that the union of these two
                    faces should form a rhombus ECOB. But we have, for the six pyramids, twenty-four
                    triangles similar to CEB, which consequently will be reduced to twelve
                    rhombuses, from which results a dodecahedron similar to what is represented in
                    fig. 5 and 6.</p>
                <p>The cube, before it arrives at the form of the dodecahedron, passes through a
                    multitude of intermediate modifications, of which one is shown at fig. 13. The
                    squares <hi rend="italic">paeo, hlqu, mitts,</hi> &amp;c. correspond to the
                    squares ABCD, DCGF, CBHG, &amp;c. (fig. 6), and form the superior basis of as
                    many pyramids, incomplete from the deficiency of the laminae with which they
                    ought to terminate. The rhombuses EDLC, ECOB (fig. 5), by a necessary
                    consequence, are reduced to simple hexagons <hi rend="italic">ae</hi> C <hi
                    rend="italic">lh</hi> D, <hi rend="italic">eo</hi> B <hi rend="italic">nm</hi> C
                    (fig. 13), and the surface of the secondary crystal is composed of twelve of
                    these hexagons and six squares. This is the case with the boracic spar (the
                    borate of magnesia and lime), with the exception of some facets which surmount
                    the solid angles, and which depend on a different law of decrement.</p>
                <p>If the diminution of the laminae of superposition proceeded in a more rapid
                    ratio; for example, if each lamina had had on its circumference two, three, or
                    four rows of cubes less than the inferior lamina, the pyramids produced on the
                    nucleus by this diminution being more depressed, and their contiguous faces
                    being no longer on a level, the surface of the secondary solid would have been
                    composed of twenty-four isosceles triangles, all inclined to each other. <hi
                    rend="italic">Decrement on the edges</hi> is that which takes place parallel to

                <p>Let us conceive again a cubic nucleus, whose different edges are lines of
                    departure to the same number of decrements which take place at the same time in
                    two different ways; that is, by the subtraction of two rows parallel to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> (</hi> the edges AB, CD (fig. 7), and of one row parallel to
                    the edges AB, BC. Let it be supposed also that each lamina being only equal in
                    thickness to a small cube of the side AB and CD, is, on the contrary, equal to
                    double the thickness of the side AD and BC. Fig. 14 represents this disposition
                    with regard to the decrements which proceed from the lines DC, BC (fig. 7). It
                    is plain, that on account of the more rapid decrease in proceeding from DC or
                    AB, than from BC or AD, the faces produced in the first case will be more
                    inclined to the plane ABCD, while the faces produced in the second will remain
                    as it were behind, so that the pyramid will no longer be terminated by a single
                    cube E, as in fig. 12, which, on account of its minuteness, seems to be only a
                    point, but by the row of cubes MNST (fig. 14), which, supposing these cubes to
                    be infinitely small, will present the appearance of a simple ridge. By a
                    necessary consequence, the pyramid will have for its faces two trapeziums, such
                    as DMNC, resulting from the first decrement, and two isosceles triangles, such
                    as CNB, which will be the effect of the second decrement.<note anchored="true"

                    arrangement and number of the cubes represented in the same
                    figure.</p></note></p>
                <p>Let us suppose further, that with regard to the laminae of superposition, which
                    arise on the face BCGH (fig. 7), the decrements follow the same laws, but in
                    cross directions; in such a way that the more rapid of the two may take place in
                    proceeding from BC, or from GH, towards the vertex of the pyramid, and the
                    slower decrement in proceeding from CG, or BH, towards the same vertex. The
                    pyramid which results from these decrements will be placed in a direction
                    opposite to that which rests on ABCD, and will have the position represented at
                    fig. 17, where the edge KL, which terminates the pyramid, instead of being
                    parallel to CD, like the edge MN (fig. 14 and 15), is, on the contrary, parallel
                    to BC. We shall then conceive what is to be done, that the pyramid which will
                    rest on DC, GF (fig. 7) may be turned as it is represented in fig. 16, and may
                    have its terminating edge PR parallel to CG (fig. 7). The pyramids which will
                    rest on three other faces of the cube will stand like that which arises on the
                    opposite face.</p>
                <p>But as the decrements which produce the triangle CNB (fig. 15) make a continuity
                    with those from which results the trapezium CBKL (fig. 17), these two figures
                    will be in the same plane, and will form a pentagon CNBKL (fig. 18). For the
                    same reason the triangle DPC (fig. 16) will be on a level with the trapezium
                    DMNC (fig. 15); and, by applying the same reasoning to the other pyramids, it
                    will be conceived that the six pyramids having for their whole faces twelve
                    trapeziums and twelve triangles, the surface of the secondary solid will be
                    composed of twelve pentagons, which will correspond to the twelve rhombuses of
                    fig. 5, but with this difference, that they will have other inclinations. This
                    solid is represented at fig. 19, and with its cubic nucleus at fig. 20, where it
                    may be seen how to proceed in the extraction of this nucleus. If, for example, a
                    section be made passing through the points D, C, G, F, the pyramid which rests
                    on the face DCGF of the nucleus will be detached, and by this section the latter
                    will be uncovered.</p>
                <p>Among the crystals belonging to the sulphuret of iron, or the arseniate of
                    cobalt, there is found a dodecahedron, having the faces equal and similar
                    pentagons, and having for its nucleus a cube in the position above
                    described.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753967" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3967-0515"/>
                <p>But there are an infinite number of possible dodecahedra, which may have for
                    faces equal and similar pentagons, and differ from each other by the respective
                    inclinations of their faces. Of all these dodecahedra, the one whose structure
                    would be subjected to these laws gives 126° 56' 8" as the angle formed þy the
                    inclination of any two of its faces DPRFS, CPRGL (fig. 19) at the edge of
                    junction PR, as might be shown by calculation. Some mineralogists, overlooking
                    the use of geometry in the consideration of crystals, have confounded the
                    dodecahedron of pyrites with the same regular geometrical figure in which all
                    the sides and angles of each pentagon are equal; but there is a striking
                    difference between these two dodecahedra. The regular dodecahedron gives only
                    116° 33' 54" as the inclination of its respective pentagons, making a difference
                    of nearly 11^ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> between it and the other. And
                    indeed the regular dodecahedron cannot be produced by any law of decrement
                    whatsoever, however compound it may be supposed, in regard to a cubic nucleus,
                    and, as may be demonstrated generally, for a nucleus of any form. There are then
                    two kinds of dodecahedra, one whose faces are rhombuses, and another whose faces
                    are pentagons, produced upon a cubical nucleus, in consequence of two simple and
                    regular laws of decrement, in a direction parallel to the edges of the nucleus.
                    By varying these laws in different other ways, a multitude of new polyhedra
                    having the same nucleus may be constructed.</p>

                    originating from the cube (fig. 7); and by supposing that the laminae, instead
                    of decreasing at the same time on all the edges, decrease only to those
                    contiguous, three by three, to the angle C and its opposite. The faces formed in

                    the law of continuity, so as to intersect each other, will compose the surface

                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Decrement on the Angles.</hi></p>
                <p>This position of the rhomboidal nucleus inclosed in the regular hexahedral prism
                    of the calcareous spar being discovered, did not directly lead to the
                    determination of the laws of those decrements of secondary crystals. More simple
                    intermediate steps were necessary. To conceive the method of investigating these
                    new decrements, it may be remarked that the same substances which exhibit the
                    dodecahedron with pentagonal planes originating from the cubes (fig. 19 and 20),
                    and which might assume the form of the dodecahedron whose planes are rombuses
                    (fig. 5 and 6), are found also under that of the regular octahedron. But if the
                    laminae of superposition decrease only on the edges of the two opposite faces of
                    this cube, as on those of the superior base ABCD (fig. 6), and of the inferior
                    base, we shall in general have two pyramids applied on these bases. And if we
                    suppose the effect of the law of decrements continued in the space situated
                    between the bases of the cube, we shall arrive at an octahedron, whose angles
                    will vary as there is a greater or smaller number of rows subtracted. But no
                    law, however complicated, can give equilateral triangles as the faces of this
                    octahedron.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, by dividing a regular octahedron originating from a cube, the
                    cubic nucleus will appear to be so situated in this octahedron that each of its
                    six solid angles corresponds to the centre of one of the faces of the
                    octahedron; but this could not be the case by supposing a decrement on the
                    edges. The law of decrement accomplishes its ends, in such cases, by a different
                    progress from that which conducts to the forms already described.</p>
                <p>Let ABCD (fig. 27) be the superior or inferior surface of a lamina composed of
                    small cubes, whose bases are represented by the squares which subdivide the
                    whole square. The series of cubes to which the squares <hi rend="italic">a, b,
                    c, d, e,f, g, h, i,</hi> belong, are on the diagonal drawn from A to C; and they
                    form one string (fig. 28), which will not differ from the string of the cubes
                    <hi rend="italic">a, n, g, τ</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">, s</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> j</hi><hi rend="italic">, t', u', zl, χl</hi> (fig. 27), lying in
                    the direction of the edge AD, excepting that in the former the cubes touch only
                    by one of their edges, and in the latter by one of their faces. There are also,
                    throughout the whole extent of the lamina, strings of cubes parallel to the
                    diagonal. The series of letters <hi rend="italic">q, v, k, u, x, y, z,</hi>
                    shows one, and the letters <hi rend="italic">n, t, l, m, p, o, r, s,</hi> show
                    another string.</p>
                <p>The laminae of superposition, it may be conceived, project beyond each other one
                    or more rows of cubes in a direction parallel to the diagonal. In like manner
                    may be constructed around the cubic nucleus, solids of different figures, by
                    placing successively above the different faces of this nucleus laminae which may
                    arise in the form of pyramids, and which will experience this kind of decrement.
                    The faces of these solids will be roughened by an infinite number of salient
                    angles formed by the exterior <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753980"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3980-0516"/>points of the composing cubes. This follows from
                    the angular figure which is continually presented by the edges of the laminae of
                    superposition. But these points being on a level, the cubes may be supposed to
                    be so small that the faces of the solid will appear smooth and continued
                    planes.</p>
                <p>Around the cube ABGF (fig. 29), as a nucleus, let a secondary solid be
                    constructed, in which the lamina of superposition shall decrease on all sides by
                    a single row of cubes, in a direction parallel to the diagonals; and let ABCD
                    (fig. 30), the superior base of the nucleus, be subdivided in eighty-one small
                    squares, representing the exterior faces of an equal number of molecules. Fig.
                    31 represents the superior surface of the first lamina, which ought to be placed
                    above ABCD (fig. 30) in such a manner that the point <hi rend="italic">a'</hi>
                    may correspond to the point α, the point <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> to the point
                    <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the point <hi rend="italic">d</hi> to the point c, and
                    the point d’ to the point <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> By this disposition the
                    squares Aα, Bó, Cc, D√ (fig. 30) remain uncovered, which will fulfil the above
                    law of decrement; and the borders QV, ON, IL, GF (fig. 31) project by one row
                    beyond the borders AB, AD, CD, BC (fig. 29), which is necessary, that the
                    nucleus may be enveloped towards these edges. For if the edges of the lamina
                    represented (fig. 31), as well as the following, coincided with the lines ŠT,
                    EZ, YX, MU, on which supposition they would be on a level with AD, AB, CD, BC
                    (fig. 30), they would form re-entering angles towards the analogous parts of the
                    crystal. Thus in the laminae applied on ABCD (fig. 29), all the edges answering
                    to CD would be on a level with CDFG, of which they would form a prolongation;
                    and in the laminae applied on DCFG all the edges analogous to the same ridge CD
                    would be on a level with ABCD, from which necessarily results a re-entering
                    angle opposite to the salient angle formed by the two faces ABCD and CDFG. But
                    by the laws which determine the formation of simple crystals, re-entering angles
                    appear to be excluded. The solid will then increase in those parts to which the
                    decrement does not extend. But this decrement alone being sufficient to
                    determine the form of the secondary crystal, all the other variations which
                    intervene only in a subsidiary manner may be set aside, excepting in the
                    construction of artificial crystals, and in exhibiting the details relating to
                    the structure.</p>
                <p>The superior face of the second lamina will be like A'G'L’K' (fig. 32), and this
                    lamina must be placed above the preceding, in such a manner that the points <hi
                    rend="italic">a", b", d', d",</hi> may correspond with the points α', <hi
                    rend="italic">b', d, d!</hi> (fig. 31), which will leave uncovered the squares
                    having their exterior angles situated in Q, S, E, Ο, V, T, M, G, &amp;c., and
                    continuing to produce the decrement by one row. The solid increases towards the
                    analogous edges at AB, BC, CD, AD (fig. 30), since between A' and L', for
                    instance (fig. 32), there are thirteen squares, but between QV and LI (fig. 31)
                    there are only eleven.</p>
                <p>The large faces of the laminae of superposition which were hitherto octagons
                    QVGFILNO (fig. 31) having arrived at the figure of the square A'G'L’K' (fig.
                    32), will, after passing that term, decrease on all sides at the same time, and
                    the following lamina will have for its superior face the square B'M‘I'S' (fig.
                    33), less in every direction by one row than the square A'G'L’K' (fig. 32). Let
                    this square be disposed above the preceding, so that the points <hi
                    rend="italic">d,f', g', h!</hi> (fig. 33) may correspond with the points <hi
                    rend="italic">c, f,</hi><hi rend="italic">g,</hi><hi rend="italic">h</hi> (fig.
                    32). Fig. 34, 35, 36, and 37 represent the four laminae which ought to rise
                    successively above the preceding, the same letters being made to correspond. The
                    last lamina is reduced to one cube <hi rend="italic">zĩ</hi> (fig. 39), which
                    should correspond with the same letter (fig. 37).</p>
                <p>Thus it follows, that the laminae of superposition applied on the base ABCD (fig.
                    29 and 30) produce, by the total of their decreasing edges, four faces, which in
                    proceeding <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> from the points A, B, C, D, incline
                    one to another in the form of a pyramidal summit. These edges, it may be
                    remarked, have lengths which begin by increasing as in fig. 30 and 32, and which
                    then proceed decreasing. Thus the faces produced by the same edges increase at
                    first, and afterwards decrease in breadth, so that they become quadrilaterals.
                    One of these is represented at fig. 39, in which the inferior angle C is
                    confounded with the angle C (fig. 29) of the nucleus; and the diagonal LQ
                    represents the edge L'G' of the lamina A'G'L’K' (fig. 32), which is the most
                    extended in the direction of that edge. And die number of laminae of
                    superposition producing the triangle LCQ (fig. 39) being less than that of the
                    laminae producing the triangle LZQ, since there is here only one lamina
                    preceding the lamina A'G'L’K' (fig. 32), while there are six which follow it as
                    far as the cube <hi rend="italic">z</hi> (fig. 38) inclusively, the triangle LZQ
                    (fig. 39) composed of the sum of die edges of these latter laminae, will have a
                    much greater height than the inferior triangle LCQ, as it is expressed in the
                    figure.</p>
                <p>The surface of the secondary solid, then, will be formed of twenty-four
                    quadrilaterals, disposed three and three around each solid angle of the nucleus.
                    But decreasing by one row, the three quadrilaterals belonging to each solid
                    angle, such as C (fig. 29) will be in the same plane, forming an equilateral
                    triangle ZIN (fig. 40). The twenty-four quadrilaterals, then, will produce eight
                    equilateral triangles. One of these is represented at fig. 41, showing the
                    arrangement of the cubes that concur to form it; and the secondary solid will be
                    a regular octahedron. This octahedron is represented at fig. 42, inclosing the
                    cubic nucleus, so that each of its solid angles corresponds to the centre of one
                    of the triangles IZN, IPN, PIS, SIZ, &amp;c. of the octahedron. To extract this
                    nucleus, it would be necessary to divide the octahedron in its eight solid
                    angles, by sections parallel to the opposite edges. This is the structure of
                    octahedral sulphuret of lead or galena.</p>
                <p>Such then is an example of decrements on the angles which take place in a
                    direction parallel to the diagonals. By this denomination may be expressed
                    precisely the result of each decrement, by denoting the angle which serves it as
                    a point of departure.</p>

                    exterior faces of so many molecules. Suppose further that the laminae of
                    superposition, applied on this face, decrease by one row towards the lateral
                    angles <hi rend="italic">abd, afd,</hi> in such a manner that on the first the
                    two rhombuses <hi rend="italic">bhhl,fmin</hi> are uncovered; that on the second

                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3993-0517"/>. By this law of decrement two faces will be
                    produced, which, proceeding from the angles <hi rend="italic">bf,</hi> will rise
                    in the form of a roof above the rhombus <hi rend="italic">abdf,</hi> and will

                    undergo like decrements on the primitive form, the faces produced will be twelve
                    in number. But, by the law of decrement by one row, the two faces which have the

                    are parallel to the horizontal diagonals of the same faces. The cube here
                    answers the purpose of a rhomboid, which should have its summits in <hi

                    passes through the middle of the two opposite faces. When the cube begins to

                <p>The crystals of rhomboidal iron are found among those of the iron ore of the

                    its boundary, and for the rhomboid not to be modified by facets parallel to the
                    faces of the nucleus. If the decrement which produces the rhomboid took place at
                    the same time on the eight solid angles of the cube, there would result a
                    polyhedron of twenty-four facets, of which nature are the crystals found at the
                    Calton-hill, Edinburgh, which have been considered as zeolites.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Intermediate Decrements.</hi></p>
                <p>In some crystals the decrements on the angle⅛ do not take place in lines parallel
                    to the diagonals, but parallel to lines situated between the diagonals and the
                    edges. This happens when the subtractions are made by double, triple, &amp;c.
                    rows of molecules. In figure 55, which is an instance of these subtractions, the
                    molecules composing the row represented by the figure are so arranged as if, of
                    two, only one was formed. To reduce this case under that of the common
                    decrements on the angles, we have only to conceive the crystal composed of
                    parallclopipeds, having their bases equal to the small rectangles <hi

                <p>This variety of iron ore is found at Framont, in Les Vosges. It commonly appears
                    under the form of two opposite pyramids, and some groups reflect from the
                    surface the prismatic colours. These crystals, classed by De l’lsle among the
                    modifications of the dodecahedron with isosceles triangular planes, have for
                    nucleus a cube performing the functions of the rhomboid. The two regular
                    hexagons by which they are terminated arise from a decrement by a single row of
                    cubic molecules on the angles <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> n (fig. 46) of the
                    nucleus.</p>
                <p>To comprehend the effect of this law, combined with the preceding, and which
                    produces the lateral trapeziums, let it be supposed that <hi rend="italic"
                    >cbpr</hi> (fig. 49) represents the same square as fig. 46, subdivided into
                    small squares, which are the external faces of so many molecules. Taking these
                    molecules by pairs, so that they form rectangular parallelopipeds, having for
                    bases the oblong squares <hi rend="italic">bngh, hgmG,</hi> &amp;c. and imagine
                    that the subtractions are made by two rows of these double molecules, the edges
                    of the laminae of superposition will be successively ranged in lines, as PG, TL,
                    Ry?, Sy?, <hi rend="italic">hz,yz,</hi> &amp;c. and the sum of all these edges
                    will produce two faces, which departing from the angles <hi rend="italic">b,
                    r,</hi> will converge, the one towards the other, and will unite themselves on a
                    common ridge, situated above the diagonal <hi rend="italic">cp,</hi> but
                    inclined to that diagonal. The complete result of this decrement, then, is
                    twelve faces; and it is shown by calculation, that the six superior faces being
                    prolonged to the point where they meet the six lower faces, will form with them
                    the surface of a dodecahedron, composed of two right pyramids united at their
                    bases. By the effect of the first law, these pyramids are here incomplete, which
                    gives the hexagon <hi rend="italic">abcdru</hi> (fig. 48) and its opposite.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Mixed Decrements.</hi></p>
                <p>The decrements in other crystals, either on the edges or on the angles, vary
                    according to laws, the proportion of which can only be expressed by the fraction
                    ∙; or It may happen, for instance, that each lamina exceeds the following by two
                    rows parallel to the edges, and that it may, at the same time, have an altitude
                    triple that of a simple molecule. A vertical geometrical section of one of the
                    kinds of pyramids resulting from this decrement is represented at fig. 54. The
                    effects of this decrement may be readily conceived by considering that AB is a
                    horizontal line taken on the upper base of the nucleus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >bazr</hi> the section of the first lamina of superposition, <hi rend="italic"
                    >gfen</hi> that of the second. These are called <hi rend="italic">mixed
                    decrements,</hi> which exhibit this new kind of exception from the simplest
                    laws. They, as well as the intermediary ones, rarely exist anywhere else, and
                    they have been particularly discovered in certain metallic substances. The
                    application of the ordinary laws, Haüy observes, to a variety of these
                    substances, presented such errors in the value of the angles as led him to
                    believe that they were inconsistent with theory. But extending his theory, he
                    arrived at results so correct as removed<pb break="no" facs="nls:194754006"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4006-0518"/> every doubt of the existence of the laws on which
                    •these results depended.</p>
                <p>All the changes to which crystals are subjected depend on the laws of structure
                    which have been explained, and others of a similar kind. The decrements
                    sometimes take place at the same time on all the edges, as in the dodecahedron
                    having rhombuses for its planes, or on all the angles, as in the octahedron
                    originating from a cube. Sometimes they take place only on certain edges of
                    certain angles. There is sometimes a uniformity between them, so that it is one
                    single law by one, two, three rows, &amp;c. which acts on the different edges or
                    the different angles. Sometimes the law varies from one edge to the other, or
                    from one angle to the other. This happens particularly when the form of the
                    nucleus is not symmetrical, as, for instance, when it is a parallelopiped, whose
                    faces differ by their respective inclinations, or the measure of their angles.
                    In some cases there is a concurrence of the decrements on the edges with those
                    on the angles to produce the same form, and sometimes the same edge or the same
                    angle is subjected to several laws of decrement succeeding each other. The
                    secondary crystal in some cases has faces parallel to those of the primitive
                    form, and which combine with the faces produced by the decrements to modify the
                    figure of the crystal. Simple secondary forms are those which arise from a
                    single law of decrement, the effect of which entirely conceals the nucleus.
                    Compound secondary forms arise from several simultaneous laws of decrement, or
                    from one single law not having attained to its extent; so that there remain
                    faces parallel to those of the nucleus, which concur with the faces produced by
                    the decrement to diversify the form of the crystal. If, amidst this diversity of
                    laws, sometimes insulated, sometimes united by more or less complicated
                    combinations, the number of the rows subtracted were itself extremely variable;
                    if, for instance, these decrements were by twelve, twenty, or thirty rows, or
                    more, which is possible, the number of forms which might exist in each kind of
                    mineral would be immense. But the power by which the subtractions are effected
                    seems to be very limited in its action. Its extent rarely exceeds one or two
                    rows of molecules. Beyond four rows only one variety of calcareous spar has been
                    discovered. The structure of this variety depends on a decrement by six rows;
                    but this seems to be a rare occurrence in nature. Yet although the laws of
                    crystallization are limited to two of the simplest, that is, those which produce
                    subtractions by one or two rows, calcareous spar is susceptible of 2044
                    different forms, a number exceeding more than fifty times that of the forms at
                    present known; and, admitting into the combination decrements by three and four
                    rows, calculation will give 8,388,604 possible forms of the same substance, and
                    by the operation of either mixed or intermediate decrements this number will be
                    greatly augmented.</p>
                <p>The striae observed on the surface of many crystals is another proof in favour of
                    the theory; for they always have directions parallel to the projecting edges of
                    the laminae of superposition, which mutually go beyond each other, if the
                    regularity of the process has not been disturbed. It must not however be
                    supposed that the inequalities arising from the decrements must be always
                    sensible if the form of the crystals be complete; for the molecules being
                    extremely minute, the surface will appear finely polished, and no striae will be
                    perceptible. In some secondary crystals, therefore, they are not to be seen,
                    while they are quite distinct in others of the same nature and form. In the
                    latter case, the action of the causes producing crystallization has not enjoyed
                    all the necessary conditions; the operation has been interrupted; and the law of
                    continuity not having been observed, there have remained on the surface of the
                    crystal perceptible vacancies. These deviations have this advantage, that <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> they point out the direction according to which the
                    striae are arranged in lines, and thus contribute to discover the real mechanism
                    of the structure.</p>
                <p>The small vacuities which the edges of the laminae of superposition leave on the
                    surface of even the most perfect secondary crystals, by their re-entering and
                    salient angles, show that the fragments obtained by division, the external
                    facets of which form part of the faces of the secondary crystal, are not like
                    those drawn from the interior part; for this apparent diversity arises from
                    these facets being composed of a multitude of small planes, really inclined to
                    each other, but which being very minute, present the appearance of one plane.
                    And if the division could reach its utmost bounds, these fragments would be
                    resolved into molecules similar to each other, and to those situated towards the
                    centre. It happens, too, that molecules of different figures arrange themselves
                    in such a manner as to produce similar polyhedra in different kinds of minerals.
                    Thus the dodecahedron with rhombuses for its planes, which is obtained by
                    combining cubic molecules, exists in granite, with a structure composed of small
                    tetrahcdra, having isosceles triangular faces. It exists also in sparry fluor,
                    where there is also an assemblage of te∙ trahedra, but regular, that is to say,
                    the faces of which are equilateral triangles.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to give examples of compound secondary forms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prismatic Calcareous Spar</hi> (fig. 1).</p>
                <p>The bases of this prism are produced in consequence of a decrement, by a single
                    row on the angles of the summits <hi rend="italic">baf, gaf bag, dex, dec,
                    cex</hi> (fig 4), of the primitive form. The six planes result from a decrement
                    by two rows on the angles <hi rend="italic">bdf,fxg, bcg, dfx, dbc, cgx,</hi>
                    opposite to the preceding. Let <hi rend="italic">abdf</hi> (fig. 50) be the same
                    face of the nucleus as fig. 4. The decreasing edges situated towards the angle
                    of the summit <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will successively correspond with the
                    lines <hi rend="italic">hi, hl,</hi> &amp;c. and those which look towards the
                    inferior angle <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> will have the positions pointed out by
                    <hi rend="italic">run, op</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but as the first
                    decrement takes place by one row, it is proved that the face which results from
                    it is perpendicular to the axis; and calculation shows, in like manner, that the
                    second decrement taking place by two rows produces planes parallel to the axis,
                    and thus the secondary solid is a regular hexahedral prism.</p>
                <p>To develope further the structure of this prism, it may be remarked, that in the
                    production of any one, <hi rend="italic">αbrnih</hi> (fig. 1), of the two bases,
                    the effect of one only of the three decrements which take place around the solid
                    angle <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (fig. 4) may be considered, for example, of that
                    which takes place on the angle <hi rend="italic">baf,</hi> supposing that the
                    laminae applied on the two other faces <hi rend="italic">fagx, bage,</hi> do not
                    decrease, but to assist the result of the principal decrement which takes place
                    in regard to the angle <hi rend="italic">baf.</hi> Here these auxiliary
                    decrements are quite similar to that whose effect they are supposed to
                    prolong.</p>
                <p>The case will be totally different, by applying the same observation to the
                    decrements which are affected by two rows on the inferior angles <hi
                    rend="italic">dbf, dfx,fxg,</hi> &amp;c. and which produce the six planes of the
                    prism. If, for example, we consider the effect of the decrement on the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">dfx,</hi> it is necessary also that the laminae applied on the
                    faces <hi rend="italic">afdb, afxg</hi> (fig. 4), should experience towards
                    their lateral angles <hi rend="italic">afd, afx,</hi> adjacent to the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">dfx,</hi> variations which second the effect of the generating
                    decrement. Here, however, these variations are intermediary decrements by rows

                <p>The numerous analogies connecting this variety with different crystalline forms,
                    whether considering certain angles formed by planes, or certain triangles
                    obtained by drawing the diagonals of the trapezoids, led the author of this
                    theory to give it the name of <hi rend="italic">analogical spar.</hi> It is
                    derived from three other varieties, viz. very obtuse spar, by the trapezoids <hi

                <p>This variety is the result of a combination of the law which produces the
                    octahedron originating from a cube (fig. 42), with that which takes place for
                    the dodecahedron with pentagonal planes (fig. 19 and 20). The first law produces
                    the eight equilateral triangles which correspond with the solid angles of the
                    nucleus; and the second produces twelve isosceles triangles, situated two and
                    two above the six faces of the same nucleus. If a dodecahedron similar to that
                    of fig. 20 were converted geometrically into this icosahedron, it would be
                    sufficient to make the planes of eight sections pass through it in the following
                    manner; viz. one through the angles P, N, L (fig. 19), another through the
                    angles P, M, S, a third through the angles L, R, U, &amp;c. By comparing the
                    figures 19 and 55, the relation between the polyhedra will be seen by the
                    correspondence of the letters; but this is merely an artificial operation; for
                    it may be observed, that the nucleus of the icosahedra which would be obtained,
                    would be much smaller than that of the dodecahedron, since the solid angles of
                    the latter nucleus would be confounded with the angles D, C, G, &amp;c. (fig.
                    20), of the dodecahedron; but the other nucleus would have its solid angles
                    situated in the middle of the equilateral triangles MPS, NPL, URL (fig. 55).</p>
                <p>The icosahedron of the sulphuret of iron, which is not very common, has been
                    confounded with the regular geometrical icosahedron, which has all its angles
                    equilateral. Theory shows that the existence of the latter icosahedron is
                    equally impossible in mineralogy as the geometrical dodecahedron. Among the five
                    regular polyhedra of geometry, viz. the cube, the tetrahedron, the octahedron,
                    the dodecahedron, and the icosahedron, the three former can only exist among
                    minerals according to the laws of crystallization.</p>

                <p>Haüy had not observed the petunze crystallized under its primitive form. This
                    form, such as it is given by the mechanical division of secondary crystals, is
                    that of an oblique prism of four planes (fig. 58), two of which, such as GOAD,
                    RBHN, are perpendicular to the bases ADNH, OGRB; the other two, viz. BOAH, RGDN,
                    make with the former, angles of 120° at the ridge OA, RN, and angles of 60°
                    towards the opposite ridges BH, GD. These planes are inclined to the bases at
                    that place of the ridges GO, BR, 111° 29' 43", and at the opposite ridges 68°
                    30′ 17". This form is at the same time that of the molecule. By theory, the two
                    parallelograms GOAD, OGRB, as well as their parallels, are equal in extent; and
                    the parallelogram BOAH, or its opposite, RGDN, is double each of the preceding.
                    This may serve to explain the roughness of the sections made in the direction
                    BOAH, when compared with those in the directions of the small parallelograms,
                    the latter being always smooth and brilliant. If, however, the diagonal OR be
                    drawn, it will be found perpendicular to OA and RN; or it will be situated
                    horizontally, by supposing that the ridges OA, BH have a vertical position.</p>
                <p>This mineral exhibits the most complicated variety <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194754032" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4032-0520"/>which the author has observed
                    among this kind of crystals. To comprehend its structure, suppose that <hi
                    rend="italic">bpyr</hi> (fig. 57) represents a section of the nucleus AR (fig.
                    58), made by a plane perpendicular to the parallelograms GOAD, BO AH, and
                    subdivided into a multitude of small parallelograms, which are the analogous
                    sections of so many molecules. Here the side <hi rend="italic">yr</hi> (fig.
                    57), which is the same section of the cutting plane as GOAD, is greater than it
                    ought to be in regard to the side <hi rend="italic">cr</hi> (fig. 57), which is
                    the same section as ΒΟΛΗ (fig. 58). But these dimensions are suited to those of
                    the secondary crystal, and here occasion no difficulty, because it may be
                    supposed that the primitive form has been extended more in one direction than in
                    another; for this form is to be considered only as a convenient datum for the
                    explanation of the structure, and the crystal consists merely in an assemblage
                    of similar molecules; so that it is the dimensions of these molecules which
                    remain invariable.</p>
                <p>By comparing fig. 56 and 57 it will be found, 1. That the plane <hi rend="italic"
                    >fabnklih</hi> (fig. 56), and its opposite, which correspond to <hi
                    rend="italic">mn, dg</hi> (fig. 57), are parallel to two planes of the nucleus,
                    viz. GOAD, BRNH (fig. 58), and therefore do not result from any law of
                    decrement; 2. that the plane PowN, and its opposite (fig. 56), which correspond
                    to <hi rend="italic">ao, eg</hi> (fig. 57), are also parallel to two of the
                    planes of the nucleus, viz. BOAH, RGDN (fig. 58); 3. that the plane <hi
                    rend="italic">onkm,</hi> and its opposite (fig. 56), which correspond to <hi
                    rend="italic">on, eg</hi> (fig. 57), result from a decrement by two rows
                    parallel to the ridges AO, NR (fig. 58); 4. that the plane <hi rend="italic"
                    >cfgh,</hi> and its opposite (fig. 56), result from a decrement by four rows
                    parallel to the ridges GD, BH (fig. 58), which decrement takes place on the
                    other side of these ridges. From this it may be seen that decrements different
                    in their measure give rise to planes similarly situated, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">onhm</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cfyh</hi> (fig. 56), which is a
                    consequence of the particular figure of the molecules. With regard to the faces
                    of the summit, the heptagon <hi rend="italic">ρGtcdez</hi> (fig. 56) is situated
                    parallel to the base BRGO (fig. 58). The enneagon <hi rend="italic"
                    >V&gt;srY</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">onbez</hi> (fig. 56) is produced in
                    consequence of a decrement by one row on the angle OBR (fig. 58), or parallel to
                    the diagonal OR; which decrement does not attain to its full extent, and leaves
                    subsisting the neighbouring heptagon parallel to the base BRGO. It may be
                    conceived, from what has been said on the position of the diagonal OR, why the
                    line <hi rend="italic">ez</hi> (fig. 56), which separates the two large faces of
                    the summit, is situated horizontally, by supposing that the planes have a
                    vertical position.</p>
                <p>The trapeziums <hi rend="italic">dafc, ApGC,</hi> are the result of a decrement
                    by one row on the ridges GO, BR (fig. 58). The facet <hi rend="italic">deba</hi>
                    (fig. 56) arises from a decrement by two rows parallel to the ridge BO (fig.
                    58). With regard to the other facet ABzp, which has the same position as the
                    preceding, in relation to the opposite part of the crystal, it results from an
                    intermediary law, by a row of double molecules on the angle OBR (fig. 58). The
                    rhombuses <hi rend="italic">belli, hlsu</hi> (fig. 59) represent the horizontal
                    sections of two of these double molecules taken in the same row, and whose
                    relation to the rest of the arrangement will become sensible by comparing these
                    rhombuses with those marked with the same letters in fig. 57. This variety of
                    crystals is subject to a change of dimensions; the faces <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρGtcdez, fabnklih,</hi> and their opposites, which are at right angles to each
                    other, are elongated in the direction of their breadth, exhibiting the
                    appearance of a quadrilateral, rectangular prism, the summits of which would be
                    formed by the faces situated towards the ridges PN, 17. Crystals of this
                    variety, which are opaque, and of a whitish, yellowish, and sometimes reddish
                    colour, are found in granites; some are in groups, and some, but more rarely,
                    are met with in single crystals.</p>
                <p>III. NUMBER OF PRIMITIVE FORMS.</p>
                <p>In the examples which have been given, the author of the theory has chosen the
                    parallelopiped for a nucleus, on account of the simplicity of its form. He has
                    hitherto found that all the primitive forms may be reduced to six. 1. The
                    parallelopiped in general, which comprehends the cube, the rhomboid, and all the
                    solids terminated by six faces parallel two and two; 2. the regular tetrahedron;
                    3. the octahedron with triangular faces; 4. the hexagonal prism; 5. the
                    dodecahedron with rhomboidal planes; 6. the dodecahedron with isosceles
                    triangular faces.</p>
                <p>Among these forms there are some found as nucleus, which have the measure of
                    their angles the same in different kinds of minerals. It is to be considered
                    that these nuclei are composed, in the first instance, of elementary molecules,
                    and that it is possible that the same form of nucleus may be produced in one
                    species by elements of a certain nature, and in another species by different
                    elements combined in a different manner, as we see integrant molecules, some
                    cubic and some tetrahedral, produce similar secondary forms by the operation of
                    different laws of decrement. But it may be observed that all the forms which
                    have hitherto occurred as nuclei on the different species, are such as have a
                    particular character of perfection and regularity, as the cube, the regular
                    octahedron, and the dodecahedron with equal and similar rhombuses for its
                    faces.</p>
                <p>IV. FORMS OF THE INTEGRAL MOLECULES.</p>
                <p>The primitive form is that which is obtained by sections made on all the similar
                    parts of the secondary crystals; and these sections, continued parallel to
                    themselves, conduct to a determination of the form of the integral molecules, of
                    which the whole crystal is the assemblage. There is no crystal from which a
                    nucleus in the form of a parallelopiped may not be extracted, by making the
                    limitation to six selections, parallel two and two. In a great number of
                    substances, this parallelopiped is the last term of the mechanical division, and
                    consequently the real nucleus; but in some minerals this parallelopiped is
                    divisible, as well as the rest of the crystal, by further sections made in the
                    different directions of the faces, from which results a new solid, which will be
                    the nucleus, if all the parts of the secondary crystal superadded to this
                    nucleus are similarly situated. When the mechanical division conducts to a
                    parallelopiped, divisible only by sections parallel to its six faces, the
                    molecules are parallelopipeds similar to the nucleus; but in all other cases
                    their form differs from that of the nucleus. This may be illustrated by an
                    example.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">achsno</hi> (fig. 60) be a cube, having two of its solid
                    angles <hi rend="italic">a, s</hi> situated on the same vertical line; this line
                    will be the axis of the cube, and the points <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> will be its summits. Let it be supposed that this cube is
                    divisible by sections, each of which, such as <hi rend="italic">ahn,</hi> passes
                    through one of the summits <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and by two oblique
                    diagonals <hi rend="italic">ah, an,</hi> contiguous to the summit. By this
                    section the solid angle z will be detached; and as there are six solid angles,
                    situated laterally, viz. <hi rend="italic">i, h, c, r, o, n,</hi> the six
                    sections will produce an acute rhomboid, the summits of which will be confounded
                    with those of the cube. At fig. 61 this rhomboid is represented as existing in
                    the cube in such a manner that its six lateral solid angles <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,d,fp,g,e,</hi> correspond with the middle of the faces <hi rend="italic"
                    >achi, crsh, kins,</hi> &amp;c. of the cube; but each of the angles at the
                    summits <hi rend="italic">bag, dsf, psf,</hi> &amp;c. of the acute rhomboid, are
                    = 60°, from which it follows that the lateral angles <hi rend="italic">abf,
                    agf,</hi> &amp;c. are = 120°. Besides, it is proved by theory that the cube is
                    the result of a decrement which takes place by a single <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194754045" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4045-0521"/>row of small rhomboids,
                    similar to the acute rhomboid on the six oblique ridges <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">ag, αe, sd, sf, sp.</hi> This decrement produces two
                    faces, one on each side of each of these ridges, making in the whole twelve
                    faces; but as the two faces having the same line of ridge for their departure
                    are on the same plane, by the nature of the decrement the twelve faces will be
                    reduced to six, which are squares, so that the secondary solid is a cube.</p>
                <p>Suppose that the cube (fig. 60) admits, in regard to its summits <hi
                    rend="italic">a, s,</hi> two new divisions similar to the preceding six, one of
                    which passes through the points <hi rend="italic">c, i, o,</hi> and the other
                    through the points <hi rend="italic">h, n, r.</hi> The first will also pass
                    through the points <hi rend="italic">b, g, e,</hi> and the second through the
                    points <hi rend="italic">d,f,p</hi> (fig. 61 and 62) of the rhomboid; from which
                    it follows that these two divisions will each detach a regular tetrahedron <hi
                    rend="italic">bage,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dsfp</hi> (fig. 62); so that the
                    rhomboid will be found converted into a regular octahedron <hi rend="italic"
                    >er</hi> (fig. 63), which will be the real nucleus of the cube; for it is
                    produced by divisions similarly made in relation to the eight solid angles of
                    the cube. If we suppose the same cube to be divisible throughout its whole
                    extent by analogous sections, it is clear that each of the small rhomboids, of
                    which it is the assemblage, will be found in like manner subdivided into an
                    octahedron, and two regular tetrahedrons, applied on the two opposite faces of
                    the octahedron. By taking the octahedron for a nucleus, a cube may be
                    constructed round it, by regular subtractions of small complete rhomboids. If,
                    for example, we suppose decrements, by a single row of these rhomboids, having
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> for the point of their departure, and made in a
                    direction parallel to the inferior edges <hi rend="italic">gf, eg, de, of,</hi>
                    of the four triangles which unite to form the solid angle <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> there will result four faces, which will be found on a level, and, like
                    the octahedron with six solid angles, similar decrements around the other five
                    angles will produce twenty faces, which taken four and four will be equally on a
                    level, making in the whole six distinct faces, situated as those of the cube
                    (fig. 60). The result will be exactly the same as in the case of the rhomboid,
                    considered as nucleus.</p>
                <p>In whatever way we proceed to subdivide, either the cube, the rhombus, or the
                    octahedron, we shall always have solids of two forms, that is to say,
                    octahedrons and tetrahedrons, without being able to reduce the result of the
                    division to unity. But the molecules of a crystal being similar, Haüy thinks it
                    probable that the structure was as it were interspersed with a multitude of
                    small vacuities, occupied either with the water of crystallization, or some
                    other substance; so that, if it were possible to carry the division to its
                    limits, one of those two kinds of solids -would disappear, and the whole crystal
                    would be found composed only of molecules of the other form. This view is the
                    more admissible, as each octahedron being enveloped with eight tetrahedrons, and
                    each tetrahedron being in like manner enveloped with four octahedrons, whichever
                    of these forms may be supposed to be suppressed, the remaining solids will join
                    exactly by their edges; so that in this respect there will be continuity and
                    uniformity throughout the whole extent of the mass. It may be readily conceived
                    how each octahedron is enveloped with tetrahedrons. By attending to the division
                    of the cube only by the six sections which give the rhomboid, we may depart at
                    pleasure from any two, <hi rend="italic">a, s</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">o, h</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">c,n; i,r,</hi>
                    of the eight solid angles, provided that these two angles be opposite to each
                    other. But by departing from the angles <hi rend="italic">a, s,</hi> the
                    rhomboid will be in the position shown at fig. 62. If, on the contrary, we
                    depart from the solid angles <hi rend="italic">o, h,</hi> these angles will
                    become the summits of a new rhomboid (fig. 64), composed of the same octahedron
                    as that of fig. 63, with two new tetrahedrons applied on the faces <hi
                    rend="italic">bdf, egp</hi> (fig. 64), which were unoccupied on the rhomboid of
                    fig. 60. Fig. 65 represents the case in which the two tetrahedrons repose on the
                    faces <hi rend="italic">dbe, fgp</hi> of the octahedron; and fig. 66 represents
                    the case in which they would rest on the faces <hi rend="italic">bfg, dep.</hi>
                    Hence, whatever may be the two solid angles of the cube assumed for the points
                    of departure, we shall always have the same octahedron, with two tetrahedrons
                    contiguous by their summits to these two solid angles; and there being eight of
                    these solid angles, the central octahedron will be circumscribed )vith eight
                    tetrahedrons, which will rest upon its faces. By continuing the division always
                    parallel to the first sections, the same effect will always take place. Each
                    face of the octahedron, however small it may be supposed to be, adheres to a
                    face of the tetrahedron, and reciprocally; and each tetrahedron is enveloped
                    with four octahedrons.</p>
                <p>The structure which is here explained is that of fluate of lime, or fluor spar.
                    By dividing a cube of this substance, we may at pleasure extract rhomboids which
                    have the angles formed by their planes equal to I20°, or regular octahedrons, or
                    tetrahedrons equally regular. In some other substances, as rock crystal,
                    carbonate of lead, &amp;c. which being mechanically divided beyond the term at
                    which we should have a rhomboid or a parallelopiped, parts of various different
                    forms are obtained, and arranged together even in a more complicated manner than
                    in fluor spar. In consequence of these mixed structures, there is some
                    uncertainty respecting the real figure of the integral molecules which belong to
                    these substances. It is observed, however, that the tetrahedron is always one of
                    those solids which concur in the formation of small rhomboids or parallelopipeds
                    that would be extracted from the crystal by a first division. But, on the other
                    hand, there are substances which, being divided in every possible direction,
                    resolve themselves only into tetrahedrons. Garnet, blendes, and tourmaline,
                    belong to this number.</p>
                <p>Several minerals are divisible into right triangular prisms. Such is the apatite,
                    the primitive form of which is a regular right hexahedral prism, divisible
                    parallel to its bases and its planes, from which necessarily result right prisms
                    with three planes. Fig. 67 represents one of the bases of the hexahedral prism,
                    divided into small equilateral triangles, which are the bases of so many
                    molecules, and which being taken two and two, form quadrilateral prisms, with
                    rhombuses for their bases.</p>
                <p>By adopting then the tetrahedron, in the doubtful cases already mentioned, all
                    the forms of integral molecules may in general be reduced to three, which are
                    remarkable for their simplicity, viz. the parallelopiped, the simplest of all
                    the solids, having parallel faces two and two; the triangular prism, the
                    simplest of all prisms; and the tetrahedron, which is the simplest of pyramids.
                    This simplicity may furnish a reason for the preference given to the tetrahedron
                    in fluor spar, and the other substances which have been mentioned as examples.
                    But the ingenious author of the theory cautiously declines to speak decisively
                    on the subject, as the want of direct and precise observations, he observes,
                    leaves to theory only conjectures and probabilities.</p>
                <p>But the essential object is, that the different forms to which these mixed
                    structures lead are arranged in such a manner that their assemblage is
                    equivalent to a sum of small parałlelopipeds, as has been seen to be the case in
                    regard to fluor spar; and that the laminae of superposition applied on the
                    nucleus decrease by subtractions of one or more rows of these parallelopipeds.
                    The basis of the theory exists, therefore, independently of the choice which
                    might be made of any of the forms obtained by the mechanical division.</p>
                <p>With the help of this result, the decrements to which <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194754058" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4058-0522"/>crystals are subject,
                    whatever be their primitive forms, are found reducible to those which take place
                    in substances where this form, as well as that of the molecules, are indivisible
                    parallelopipeds; and the theory has this advantage of being able to generalise
                    its object, by connecting with one faet that multitude of facts whielι, on
                    account of their diversity, seem to be little susceptible of being brought to
                    one common point. But what has been said will be still more illustrated by
                    examples of the manner in which we may reduce to the theory of the
                    parallelopiped, that of the forms which are different from that solid.</p>

                <p>Notwithstanding the vitreous appearance in general exhibited on the fractures of
                    garnets of the primitive form, laminae may be perceived on them, situated
                    parallel to the rhombuses which compose their surface. Let us suppose the
                    dodecahedron divided in the direction of its laminae, and, for the greater
                    simplicity, let us suppose the sections to pass through the centre. One of these
                    sections, viz. that which will be parallel to the two rhombuses DLFN, BHOR, will
                    coneur with a hexagon, which would pass through the points E, C, G, P, I, A, by
                    making the tour of the crystal. A second section parallel to the two rhombuses
                    GLPF, BEAR, will eincide with another hexagon shown by the points D, C, H, O, I,
                    N. And if the division be continued parallel to the other eight rhombuses, taken
                    two and two, it will be found that the planes of the sections will be confounded
                    with four new hexagons analogous to the preceding. But by resuming all these
                    hexagons, it will appear that their sides correspond, some of them with the
                    small diagonals of the rhombuses of the dodecahedron, viz. those which would be
                    drawn from C to G, from A to I, from C to B, &amp;c. and others would correspond
                    with the different ridges EC, GP, PI, EΛ, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>1. The planes then of the sections passing through the sides and through the
                    small diagonals of the twelve rhombuses, will subdivide the whole surface into
                    twenty-four isoseeles triangles, which will be the halves of these rhombuses. 2.
                    Sinee the planes of the sections pass also through the centre of the cryal, they
                    will detach twenty-four pyramids with three faces; the bases of which, if we
                    choose, will be the external triangles that make part of the surface of the
                    dodecahedron, and of which the summits will be united in the centre.</p>
                <p>Besides, if we take, for example, the six tetrahedrons, which have for external
                    faces the halves of the three rhombuses CEDL, CLGH, CEBH, these six tetrahedrons
                    will form a rhomboid, represented by fig. 77, and in which the three inferior
                    rhombuses DLGS, GHBS, DEBS, result from three divisions, which pass, one through
                    the hexagon DLGORA (fig. 68), the second through the hexagon GHBANF, and the
                    third through the hexagon BEDFPO. Fig. 69 also represents the two tetrahedrons,
                    the bases of which make part of the rhombus CLGH. One of these is marked with
                    the letters L, C, G, S, and the other with the letters H, C, G, S. And by
                    applying what has been said to the other nine rhombuses, which are united, three
                    and three, around the points F, A, H (fig. 69), we shall have three new
                    rhomboids; from which it follows, that the twenty-four tetrahedrons, considered
                    six and six, form four rhomboids; so that the dodecahedron may be conceived as
                    being itself immediately composed of these four rhomboids, and in the last
                    analysis of twenty-four tetrahedrons.</p>
                <p>It may be observed, that the dodecahedron having eight solid angles, each formed
                    with three planes, they might have been considered as the assemblage of the four
                    rhomboids, which would have for exterior summits the four angles G, B, D, A;
                    from which it follows, that any one of the faces, such as CLGO, is common to two
                    rhomboids, one of which would have its summit in C, and the other in G, and
                    which would themselves have a common part in the interior of the cryal.</p>
                <p>We may remark further, that a line GS (fig. 69) drawn from any one G (fig. 68) of
                    the solid angles composed of three planes, as far as the centre of the
                    dodecahedron, is at the same time the axis of the rhomboid, which would have its
                    summit in .C (fig. 66 and 68). The composing rhomboids then have this property,
                    that their axis is equal to the sides of the rhombus. From which, with a little
                    attention, we may conclude, that in each tetrahedron, such as CLGS (fig. 69),
                    all the faces are equal and similar isosceles triangles.</p>
                <p>If the division of the dodecahedron be continued by sections passing between
                    those which we have supposed ^to be directed towards the centre, and which
                    should be parallel to them, we should obtain tetrahedrons always smaller, and
                    arranged in such a manner that, taking them in groups of six, they would form
                    rhomboids of a bulk proportioned to their own.</p>
                <p>The tetrahedrons, which would be the term of the division, were it possible to
                    reach it, ought to be considered as the real molecules of the garnet. But it
                    will be seen, that in the passage to the secondary forms, the laminae of
                    superposition which envelope the nueleus really decrease by rows of small
                    rhomboids, each of which is the assemblage of these tetrahedrons.</p>
                <p>The sulphuret of zinc, or blende, has the same structure as the garnet. Haüy
                    informs us that he has divided fragments of this substance by very clean
                    sections, in such a manner as to obtain successively the dodecahedron, the
                    rhomboid, and the tetrahedron.</p>

                    the angle L is the same as that of the acute angle of the nucleus of calcareous
                    spar.</p>
                <p>This variety is the result of a series of laminae, decreasing at the four edges,
                    on all the faces of the primitive dodecahedron. For the more simplicity, let us
                    first consider the effect of this decrement in regard to the rhombus CLGH (fig.
                    68). We have just seen that this rhombus was supposed to belong in common to two
                    rhomboids, which should have for summits, one the point C, and the other the
                    point G. Let us suppose that the laminae applied on this rhombus deerease
                    towards their four edges by subtractions of a single row of small rhomboids, in
                    such a manner that, in regard to the two edges CL, CH, circumstances are the
                    same as if the rhombus belonged to the rhomboid which has its summit in C; and
                    that in regard to the other two edges GL, GH, the effect is the same as if the
                    rhombus belonged to the rhomboid which has its summit in G. This disposition is
                    admissible here in consequence<pb break="no" facs="nls:194754071"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4071-0523"/> of the particular structure of the dodecahedron,
                    which permits us to obtain small rhomboids, some of which have their faces
                    parallel to the faces of that with its summit in C, and the rest to that having
                    its summit in G.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Theory,
                    the author observes, has conducted him to another result, which is, that the sum
                    of the nucleus and laminae of superposition, taken together in proportion as the
                    latter are applied one upon the other, is always equal to a sum of rhomboids;
                    though at first view it does not appear that this should be the case, according
                    to the figure of these laminae, which represent rising pyramids.</p></note></p>
                <p>The results of the four decrements being thus quite similar to each other, the
                    laminae of superposition, applied on the rhombus CLGH, and on each of the other
                    rhombuses of the dodecahedron, will form as many right quadrangular pyramids,
                    which will have for bases these same rhombuses. Fig. 71 represents the pyramids
                    which rest on the three rhombuses CLDE, CEBH, CGHB (fig. 68), and which have for
                    summits the points <hi rend="italic">m, e, s</hi> (fig. 68); but on account of
                    the decrement by a simple row, the adjacent triangular faces, such as EmC, EsC
                    of the two pyramids that belong to the rhombuses CLDE, CEBH, are on a level, and
                    form a quadrilateral ErøCs. But we had twelve pyramids, and consequently
                    forty-eight triangles. These divided by two give twenty-four quadrilaterals,
                    which will compose the surface of the secondary crystal. But because the
                    rhomboidal bases of the two pyramids extend more, in proceeding from L to E, or
                    from H to E, than in proceeding from D to C, or from B to C, the sides mE, Es of
                    the quadrilateral will be longer than the sides Cm, Cs. And besides, <hi
                    rend="italic">mE</hi> will be equal to Es, and <hi rend="italic">Cm</hi> equal
                    to Cs. Thus the quadrilaterals will be trapezoids which have their sides equal
                    two and two. There is no crystalline form in which the striae, when they do
                    exist, show in a more sensible manner the mechanism of the structure than in
                    this variety of garnet. We may here see the series of decreasing rhombuses which
                    form each of the pyramids CLDEm, CEBHs, &amp;c. (fig. 71), and sometimes the
                    furrows are so deep that they produce a kind of stair, the steps of which have a
                    more particular polish and brilliancy than those of the facets, which are
                    parallel to die faces CEDL, CUBE of the nucleus.</p>
                <p>If the decrements stop abruptly at a certain term, so that the pyramids are not
                    terminated, the twenty-four trapezoids will be reduced to elongated hexagons,
                    which will intercept twelve rhombuses parallel to the faces of the nucleus. To
                    this variety Haüy has given the name of <hi rend="italic">intermediary

                    D, A, I (fig. 68). The same substance also assumes the form of a regular
                    tetrahedron, by the help of a decrement by one row on four only of the eight
                    solid angles before mentioned, such as C, O, F, A. The structure of this
                    tetrahedron is remarkable, as it presents an assemblage of other tetrahedrons
                    with isosceles faces.</p>

                    crystals, or, when such have been found, on account of their being defaced by
                    being water-worn, or otherwise’injured. But from some crystals which were
                    sufficiently characterized, Haüy obtained the following results:</p>

                <p>This mineral crystallizes in the form of a regular hexahedral prism, which is
                    divisible parallel to its bases. According to theory, which points out other
                    joinings parallel to the planes, the molecule is an equilateral triangular
                    prism. The height of this prism, calculated by theory, is a little less than
                    three times the height of the triangle of the base.</p>

                <p>V. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRUCTURE AND INCREMENT.</p>
                <p>In what has been said respecting the decrements to which the laminae of
                    superposition are subjected, the author observes that it was his view only to
                    unfold the laws of structure; and he adds, that he is far from believing that in
                    the formation of a dodecahedral crystal, or one of any other form, having a cube
                    for a nucleus, the crystallization has originally produced that nucleus such as
                    it is extracted from the dodecahedron, by the successive application of all the
                    laminae of superposition with which it is covered. It seems proved, on the
                    contrary, that from the first moment the crystal is already a very small
                    dodecahedron, containing a cubical nucleus proportioned to its small size, and
                    that the crystal afterwards increases by degrees without changing its form, by
                    new layers which envelope it on all sides, so that the nucleus increases also,
                    preserving always the same relation with the whole dodecahedron.</p>
                <p>An example taken from a plane figure will make this more striking; and what is
                    said respecting this figure may be easily applied to a solid, since a plane
                    figure may be always conceived as a section of a solid. Let ElłFN (fig. 74) be
                    an arrangement of small squares, in which the square ABCD, composed of
                    forty-nine partial squares, represents a section of the nucleus, and the extreme
                    squares R, S, G, A, I, L, &amp;c. that of the kind of stair formed by the
                    laminae of superposition. It maybe readily conceived that the arrangement began
                    with the square ABCD, and that different files of small squares were afterwards
                    applied on each of the sides of the central square; for example, on the side AB,
                    first the five squares comprehended between I and M, next the three squares
                    comprehended between L and 0, and then the square E. This increment corresponds
                    with that which would take place if the dodecahedron began by being a cube
                    proportioned to its bulk, and which increased afterwards with the addition of
                    continually decreasing laminae. <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> But, on the other
                    hand, the arrangement may be conceived to be such as is represented in fig. 76,
                    in which the square <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> is composed of only nine
                    molecules, and bears upon each of its sides only one square <hi rend="italic">e,
                    n,f</hi> or r,∙ and that afterwards, by means of the application of new squares
                    arranged round the former, the assortment has become that of fig. 75, where the
                    central square <hi rend="italic">a' ll d d</hi> is formed of twenty-five small
                    squares, and bears on each side of its sides a file of three squares plus a
                    terminating square <hi rend="italic">d n' f',</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >r'</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that, in short, by a farther application,
                    the assortment of fig. 75 is converted into that of fig. 74. These different
                    transitions will give some notion of the manner in which secondary crystals may
                    increase in bulk, and yet retain their form; and from this it will appear that
                    the structure is combined with that augmentation of bulk, so that the law
                    according to which all the laminae applied in the nucleus of the crystal, when
                    arrived at its greatest dimensions, successively decrease in departing from this
                    nucleus, existed already in the rising crystal.</p>
                <p>Such is the ingenious theory of the structure of crystals, which, the author
                    observes, is in this similar to other theories, that it sets out from a
                    principal fact, on which it makes all facts of the same kind to depend, and
                    which are only as it were corollaries. This fact is the decrement of the laminae
                    superadded to the primitive form; and it is by bringing back this decrement to
                    simple and regular laws, susceptible of accurate calculation, that theory
                    arrives at results, the truth of which is proved by the mechanical division of
                    crystals, and by observation of their angles.</p>

                    crystallographic system of Haüy. Since the publication of the beautiful views of
