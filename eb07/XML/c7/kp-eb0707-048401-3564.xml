                <p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">name</hi> given to the military expeditions undertaken by
                    the Christians of Europe for the deliverance of the Holy Land from the dominion
                    of the Saracens and Turks.</p>
                <p>About seventy years after the death of Christ, Jerusalem was taken and destroyed
                    by Titus. But, sixty years afterwards, the city was rebuilt by Hadrian, and the
                    Christians were permitted to return to it. Their establishment, however,
                    existing only by a precarious tolerance, was by no means flourishing, till
                    Constantine embraced the Christian faith, and declared it the religion of the
                    empire. This auspicious change, as might have been expected, greatly improved
                    their condition; and when the Empress Helena visited Jerusalem, this princess,
                    having ordered the places which had been signalized by evangelical events to be
                    cleared of rubbish, caused the most hallowed spots to be inclosed within the
                    walls of a spacious church. But, in the latter days of the empire, as knowledge
                    declined, superstition advanced, and the feelings of reverence originally
                    inspired by Christianity itself were transferred to the material and visible
                    objects with which the principal events in the life of its great founder were
                    associated. Hence, among zealous but ignorant Christians a strong desire was
                    excited to visit the scenes of our Saviour’s miracles and passion; and
                    pilgrimages to Palestine accordingly became a frequent, because they were
                    considered as a meritorious practice, throughout the whole of Christendom. In
                    the year 637, Jerusalem was taken by the Saracens; but either from indifference
                    regarding observances which they despised, or from motives of immediate
                    interest, the resort of pilgrims to Jerusalem was not interdicted nor
                    discountenanced by these conquerors. This toleration however ceased when the
                    Turks, in the year 1063, got possession of the holy city. That wild, fierce, and
                    fanatical horde, though superior in force and military prowess, were yet
                    immeasurably inferior in civilization, to the people whom they had expelled; and
                    as they made no scruple to plunder and insult their Christian visitors, the
                    dangers of the pilgrimage, painted in the darkest colours by those who had
                    returned, began to threaten a discontinuance of what was then considered as a
                    sacred duty. But a strong revulsion of feeling was ere long produced. Terror
                    yielded to the fiercest indignation, and religious enthusiasm, blending itself
                    with the martial spirit of the age, produced and stamped upon the general mind
                    that adventurous character which ultimately led to these memorable expeditions.
                    About this time, too, an opinion prevailed in Europe, which tended much to
                    inflame the desire to visit the Holy Land. It was believed that the thousand
                    years mentioned in the twentieth chapter of the Revelations were fulfilled; that
                    Christ would soon make his second appearance in Palestine to judge the world;
                    and that journeys to that country were consequently in the highest degree
                    meritorious, if not even absolutely necessary. Accordingly, multitudes of
                    pilgrims flocked to Palestine; and as these were systematically plundered and
                    maltreated by the Turks, they on their return filled all Europe with complaints
                    against the infidels who had profaned the holy city by their presence, and
                    derided the sacred mysteries of Christianity even in the place where they were
                    fulfilled. At this time Pope Gregory VII. had formed a design of uniting all the
                    princes of Christendom against the Mahommedans; but hisexorbitant encroachments
                    upon the civil power of princes had created him so many enemies, and rendered
                    his schemes so suspicious, that he was unable to make any considerable progress
                    in the undertaking. The work was reserved for a meaner instrument.</p>
                <p>These memorable expeditions commenced in the year 1096. Peter, commonly called
                    the Hermit, a native of Amiens, in Picardy, had made the pilgrimage to
                    Jerusalem; and, being deeply affected with the dangers to which that act of
                    devotion exposed the pilgrims, as well as with the oppression under which the
                    eastern Christians groaned, he formed the bold, and, to all appearance,
                    impracticable design of leading into Asia, from the farthest extremities of the
                    West, armies sufficient to subdue the warlike nations by whom the Holy Land was
                    now held in subjection. He proposed his scheme to Urban IL, vyho then filled the
                    papal chair; but this pope, though apparently sensible of the advantages which
                    would accrue to himself from such an undertaking, resolved not to interpose his
                    authority until he saw a greater probability of success. He therefore summoned
                    at Placentia a council, consisting of four thousand ecclesiastics and thirty
                    thousand laymen; and as no hall could be found large enough to contain so great
                    a multitude, the assembly was held on a plain. Here the pope himself, as well as
                    Peter, harangued the people, representing the dismal situation of their brethren
                    in the East, and the indignity offered to the Christian name in allowing the
                    holy city to remain in the hands of the infidels. These speeches were so
                    agreeable to those who heard them, that the whole multitude suddenly and
                    vehemently declared for war, and solemnly devoted themselves to perform this
                    service, which they believed to be highly meritorious in the sight of God.</p>
                <p>But though Italy seemed to embrace the design with ardour, yet the pontiff
                    thought it necessary, in order to insure perfect success, to engage the greater
                    and more warlike nations in the same enterprise. Having therefore exhorted Peter
                    to visit the chief cities and sovereigns of Christendom, he summoned another
                    council at Clermont, in Auvergne. The fame of this mighty and pious design being
                    now universally diffused, the greatest prelates, nobles, and princes attended;
                    and when the pope and the hermit renewed their pathetic exhortations, the whole
                    assembly, as if impelled by an immediate inspiration, exclaimed with one voice,
                    “It is the will of God; it is the will of God.” These words were deemed so
                    memorable, and considered so much the effect of a divine impulse, that they were
                    employed as the signal of rendezvous and battle in all the future exploits of
                    the crusaders. Men of every rank now flew to arms with the utmost ardour; a
                    cross was affixed to the right shoulder by all who enlisted in the holy
                    enterprise; and the projected expedition was denominated a <hi rend="italic"
                    >crusade.</hi></p>
                <p>At this time Europe was sunk in the most profound ignorance and superstition. The
                    ecclesiastics had gained a complete ascendant over the human mind; and the
                    people, who committed the most horrid crimes and disorders, knew of no other
                    expiation for their sins than the observances imposed upon them by their
                    spiritual pastors. But amidst the abject superstition which then prevailed, the
                    military spirit had also universally diffused itself; and, though supported
                    neither by art nor by discipline, it had become the general passion of the
                    nations governed by the feudal law. All the great lords possessed the right of
                    peace and war. They were engaged in almost continual hostilities ;—the open
                    country had become a scene of outrage and disorder;—and the cities, being still
                    mean and poor, were neither guarded by walls nor protected by privileges. Every
                    man was obliged to depend for safety upon his own force or his private
                    alliances; and valour was the only quality held in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194753577" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3577-0485"/>esteem, or which gave one man
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> pre-eminence above another. When all the superstitions,
                    therefore, were united in one great object, the ardour for military adventure
                    took the same direction; and the whole of Europe, as the Princess Anna Comnena
                    expresses herself, torn from its foundations, seemed ready to precipitate itself
                    in one united body upon Asia.</p>
                <p>As all orders of men now deemed the crusades the only road to heaven, they became
                    impatient to open the way with their swords to the holy city. Nobles, artisans,
                    peasants, and even priests, inrolled their names; and to decline this service
                    was to incur the reproach of impiety or cowardice, probably of both. The nobles
                    who enlisted themselves were moved by the romantic spirit of the age to hope for
                    opulent establishments in the East, which was at that time the chief seat of
                    arts and commerce; and in pursuit of these chimerical projects, they sold at the
                    lowest price their ancient castles and inheritances, which indeed had by this
                    time lost all value in their eyes. The infirm and the aged contributed to the
                    expedition by presents and money; whilst many of them, not satisfied with this,
                    attended it in person, being determined, if possible, to breathe their last in
                    sight of that city where Jesus Christ had died for tire human race. Even women,
                    having concealed their sex under the disguise of armour, attended the camp; and,
                    as is said, forgot their duty still more, by prostituting themselves to the
                    army. The greatest criminals were forward in a service which they considered as
                    an expiation of their crimes; and, during the course of these expeditions, the
                    most enormous disorders were committed by men inured to wickedness, encouraged
                    by example, and impelled by necessity. The multitude of adventurers soon
                    increased so greatly, that their more sagacious leaders became apprehensive lest
                    the vastness of the armament should cause the ruin of the enterprise. For this
                    reason they permitted an undisciplined multitude, computed at three hundred
                    thousand men, to go before them under the command of Peter the Hermit, and
                    Gaultier or Walter, surnamed the Moneyless, from his being a soldier of fortune.
                    These took the road through Hungary and Bulgaria towards Constantinople; and
                    trusting that heaven, by supernatural assistance, would supply all their
                    necessities, they made no provision for subsistence on their march. But they
                    soon found themselves obliged to obtain by plunder what they had vainly expected
                    from miracles; so that the enraged inhabitants of the countries through which
                    they passed attacked the disorderly multitude, and slaughtered them almost
                    without resistance. The more disciplined armies followed after; and, having
                    passed the strait of Constantinople, they were mustered in the plains of Asia,
                    to the amount of nearly seven hundred thousand men.</p>
                <p>The first crusade, as already mentioned, occurred in the year 1096 The princes
                    engaged in it were Hugo, count of Vermandois, brother of Philip I. king of
                    France; Robert, duke of Normandy; Robert, earl of Flanders; Raymond, earl of
                    Toulouse; Godefroy of Bouillon, duke of Lorrain, with his brothers Baldwin and
                    Eustace; Stephen, earl of Chartres and Blois; Hugo, count of St Paul; with a
                    great number of other lords. The general rendezvous, as above stated, was at
                    Constantinople. Having besieged and taken Nice, and defeated Solyman, in 1097,
                    the crusaders under Godefroy proceeded eastward, where Baldwin conquered Edessa,
                    and erected it into a principality. In the end of 1098 they took the town, but
                    not the citadel, of Antioch, I and defeated an army of six hundred thousand
                    Saracens which had advanced to the relief of the latter. In 1099 they advanced
                    to Jerusalem, with little more than a twentieth part of their original number,
                    and, after a siege of forty days, carried it by storm, putting all its
                    inhabitants, except the Christians, to the sword. The victorious Godefroy was
                    now raised to the throne of Jerusalem, and soon added security to his conquest
                    by defeating the soldan of Egypt with an innumerable army on the plains of
                    Askalon. But the heroic chief was deprived of the reward of his valour by a
                    papal legate, who had been elected patriarch, and who contrived to unite the
                    temporal with the spiritual power, leaving to Godefroy only the small
                    principality of Jaffa, and some immunities in that of Jerusalem. The crusaders,
                    seeing their object accomplished, now began to return to Europe, and the few who
                    remained in the settlements of Jerusalem, Antioch, Edessa, and the Syrian
                    Tripoli, were obliged to depend for defence against the Turks on the gradual
                    accession of adventurers whom the fame of their exploits had attracted from
                    Christendom. Thus terminated the first crusade.</p>
                <p>The second crusade, preached by Bernard, the founder of the monastic order of
                    Bernardines, and undertaken in the year 1146, was headed by the Emperor Conrad
                    III. and by Louis VII. king of France. Their united forces amounted to about
                    three hundred thousand; but the emperor was defeated by the Turks near Iconium,
                    and with difficulty escaped to Antioch; and, a short time afterwards, Louis
                    suffered a similar reverse, having, through the disaffection of the Christians
                    of Syria, been forced to raise the siege of Damascus, and compelled to witness
                    the ruin of his army. The disastrous issue of these attempts for their relief
                    only hastened the decline of the Christian principalities in Asia. Having
                    defeated the army of Jerusalem at the battle of Tiberias, and made prisoner Guy
                    of Lusignan, who then wore the crown, the soldan of Egypt entered the holy city
                    as a conqueror in the year 1187.</p>
                <p>The third crusade, undertaken in the year 1188, immediately followed the taking
                    of Jerusalem by Saladin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the soldan or sultan.</p></note> The princes engaged in this expedition were,
                    the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and Frederick, duke of Suabia, his second son;
                    Leopold, duke of Austria; Berthold, duke of Moravia; Herman, marquis of Baden;
                    the Counts of Nassau, Thuringia, Missen, and Holland, and above sixty other
                    princes of the empire; together with the Bishops of Besançon, Cambray, Munster,
                    Osnaburg, Missen, Passau, Visburg, and several others. In this expedition the
                    Emperor Frederick defeated the sultan of Iconium; but his son Frederick, having
                    been joined by Guy of Lusignan, king of Jerusalem, in vain endeavoured to reduce
                    St Jean d’Acre or Ptolemais. During these transactions Philip the Second of
                    France, and Richard the First of England, joined the crusade, by which means the
                    Christian army was raised to three hundred thousand fighting men. With this
                    enormous force Ptolemais was again besieged, and, in spite of a very gallant
                    resistance, taken; but Philip, unable to brook the real or affected superiority
                    of his rival, quitted the Holy Land in disgust, and Richard had the undivided
                    honour of defeating the mighty Saladin. His victory, however, was productive of
                    nothing but glory. Reduced by the casualties of war, enfeebled by the influence
                    of climate, and utterly paralysed by intestine broils, the army gradually melted
                    away, and Richard Coeur de Lion, like the preceding leaders, returned to Europe,
                    unaccompanied even by a remnant of his once mighty host. But on his way through
                    Austria he was arrested and detained in prison until an immense ransom had been
                    extracted from his subjects. Before his departure from Syria, however, he had
                    concluded a peace with Saladin, who soon afterwards died.</p>

                    facs="nls:194753590" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3590-0486"/>by the Emperor Henry VI.
                    after Saladin’s death. In this expedition the Christians gained several battles
                    over the infidels, took many towns, and were in a fair way of success, when the
                    death of the emperor obliged them to quit the Holy Land, and return into
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>The fifth crusade was proclaimed by order of Pope Innocent III. in 1198. But
                    those engaged in it made fruitless efforts for the recovery of the Holy Land;
                    for, although John de Neule, who commanded the fleet equipped in Flanders,
                    arrived at Ptolemais a little after Simon of Montfort, Reynard of Dampierre, and
                    others, yet the plague having destroyed many of them, the rest either returned,
                    or engaged in the petty quarrels of the Christian princes. In 1202, Baldwin,
                    count of Flanders, collected an army to act against the Mahommedans, but
                    commenced with the Christians of Greece. Having arrived at Constantinople during
                    a disputed succession, he tempted one claimant to assassinate his rival, then
                    dispatched the other by the hand of the executioner; and, having indulged his
                    followers with the plunder of the city, seated himself on the throne of the
                    eastern empire. In this splendid conquest the original object of the expedition
                    was forgotten, and only a few knights passed over into Asia.</p>
                <p>The sixth crusade commenced in 1228. On this occasion the Christians took the
                    town of Damietta, but were afterwards forced to surrender it. The next year the
                    Emperor Frederick made peace with the soldan of Egypt, brother of Saladin, for
                    ten years, and obtained possession of Jerusalem by treaty. But the holy city was
                    soon wrested from the Christians by a new enemy, namely, the Tartars, who fled
                    before the irruption of Genghis Khan, and, having overrun all Judea, forced the
                    crusaders to confine themselves to the maritime towns on the coast of Syria.
                    About 1240, Richard, earl of Cornwall, and brother of Henry III. king of
                    England, arrived in Palestine at the head of the English crusade; but finding it
                    most advantageous to conclude a peace, he re-embarked, and steered towards
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>The seventh crusade was headed by Louis XI. commonly called St Louis, who in the
                    year 1249 took the town of Damietta. But sickness having broken out in the
                    Christian army, the king endeavoured to retreat. In this, however, he was
                    unsuccessful; for being closely pursued by the Saracens, he was defeated and
                    taken prisoner near Mas-soura, in 1750, along with nearly all his nobility. A
                    truce was then agreed to for ten years, and the king and his followers were set
                    at liberty upon the payment of a ransom.</p>
                <p>The eighth crusade, undertaken in 1270, was headed by the same prince, who having
                    embarked with an armament from the southern ports of his kingdom, landed in
                    Africa, and encamped,near the ruins of Carthage. But he was immediately
                    surrounded and besieged by the Moors; <hi rend="italic">a</hi> contagious
                    distemper now attacked his troops, carrying off great numbers; and Louis, having
                    himself caught it, died in the fifty-fifth year of his age. The king of Sicily,
                    however, having arrived with a considerable fleet, and joined Philip the Bold,
                    son and successor of Louis, the king of Tunis, after several engagements in
                    which he was always worsted, sued for peace, which was granted upon conditions
                    advantageous to the Christians; and after this both princes embarked for their
                    own kingdoms. Prince Edward of England, who arrived at Tunis at the time of this
                    treaty, sailed towards Ptolemais, where he landed with a small body of three
                    hundred English and French, and prevented Bendokdar from laying siege to that
                    place; but being obliged to quit Palestine in order to take possession of the
                    crown of England, this crusade ended without contributing in any degree to the
                    recovery of the Holy Land. In 1291, the town of Acre, or Ptolemais, was taken
                    and plundered by the soldan of Egypt, and the Christians were driven entirely
                    out of Syria.</p>
                <p>After this time there was no crusade, though several popes attempted to stir up
                    the Christians to such an undertaking, particularly Nicholas IV. in 1292, and
                    Clement V. in 1311. Indeed, long before the age of St Louis the appetite for
                    holy wars had been greatly blunted in Europe, and, owing to the small number of
                    recruits who arrived in Palestine, the Christian settlers were gradually led to
                    intermarry with their Moslemin neighbours. The descendants of the crusaders
                    consequently degenerated into a mongrel race, half Christian half Mahommedan,
                    who ere long either forgot their pretensions to an European origin, or became
                    altogether indifferent about the subject. After Tyre and Ptolemais had been
                    wrested from them they soon became blended with theMaliommedan population of
                    Syria, and not a vestige of the Christian conquest remained.</p>
                <p>The foregoing sketch embraces but a faint and meagre outline of these memorable
                    expeditions; but were the details to be filled in so as to constitute an
                    expanded narrative, several volumes would be insufficient to contain it. What we
                    have aimed at is merely to trace out in their order the leading facts, to
                    indicate the prominent characteristics, and to mark the immediate results of
                    each successive enterprise undertaken for the conquest of the Holy Land. Our
                    object has been to direct the attention of the reader, in the first instance, to
                    the events themselves, exclusively of all speculations either as to their
                    general complexion, or the consequences, whether proximate or remote, of which
                    they are supposed to have been productive. What still remains, in order to
                    complete the design of the present article, is, first, to exhibit a general
                    sketch of the grand picture presented by the crusades; and, secondly, to
                    endeavour to estimate the influence which they exerted, both at the time and
                    afterwards, on the state and condition of society.</p>
                <p>I. The history of the middle ages presents no spectacle half so imposing as that
                    of the expeditions undertaken for the recovery of the Holy Land from the
                    Infidels. The picture which these exhibit is that of the people of Europe and
                    Asia reciprocally armed against each other; that of two religions in fierce
                    conflict for the mastery. By a sudden and extraordinary impulse, the West,
                    formerly menaced by the Moslemins, and indeed exposed to their attacks, seemed
                    to rise <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse</hi> in order to
                    precipitate itself on Asia. Forgetful of their individual interests, sinking
                    their mutual jealousies, and abandoning their ancient feuds, the nations of
                    Europe, uniting in a common pursuit, fixed their eyes upon a single country as
                    the only one upon earth worthy the ambition of conquerors, lt might have been
                    supposed indeed that the world contained no city but Jerusalem, and no country
                    fit to be inhabited except that in which Jesus Christ had lived and taught,
                    suffered and died. Every road leading to Palestine was drenched with blood, and
                    along its dreary tract lay scattered at no distant intervals the skeletons and
                    the wrecks of nations. In this general commotion the most sublime virtues were
                    displayed in the midst of the most frightful disorders. The soldiers of the
                    cross, animated with a supernatural enthusiasm, braved hunger and thirst,
                    fatigue and disease, the influence of a deadly climate and the fury of
                    exasperated enemies; in the greatest dangers, and amidst incessant disorders and
                    excesses, nothing could shake their perseverance, nothing exhaust their
                    resignation. After four years of toil, and misery, and victory, Jerusalem was
                    conquered by the crusaders; but as their conquests were not the work of wisdom
                    and prudence, but the fruit of a blind enthusiasm and an ill-directed heroism,
                    they laid the foundation of no permanent settlements, and, in fact, soon melted
                    away like frost-work in the sun.</p>
                <p>When the banner of the cross had passed from the heroic<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194753603" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3603-0487"/> hands of Godefroy of
                    Bouillon into those of his feeble and incompetent successors, Jerusalem, which
                    had now become Christian, was forced to implore fresh succours from the West. At
                    the call of St Bernard, the Christians again took up arms, and, conducted by an
                    emperor of Germany and a king of France, rushed to the defence of the Holy Land.
                    But they had no longer great captains to command them, and no longer did they
                    exhibit the magnanimity and heroic resignation which had distinguished their
                    predecessors. Asia beheld the new invaders without dismay; already it presented
                    a different spectacle from that which the first crusaders had witnessed. The
                    followers of Mahommed had recovered from their consternation; they had even
                    become possessed with a delirium similar to that which had impelled the
                    crusaders against them; they opposed enthusiasm to enthusiasm, and fanaticism to
                    fanaticism; and, in their turn, they burned with a sanguinary zeal to shed blood
                    in a religious war. The spirit of discord, which had formerly <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> proved their ruin, was now confined to the
                    Christians. The luxury, the manners, and the climate of the East had enfeebled
                    the courage of the defenders of the cross, and caused them to forget the objects
                    for which the holy war had been undertaken. Jerusalem, the conquest of which had
                    cost the crusaders so much blood, fell into the hands of the Infidels, and
                    became the prize of a wise and warlike prince, who had united under his banners
                    the forces of Syria and Egypt.</p>
                <p>The genius and fortune of Saladin enabled him to inflict a mortal blow on the
                    ill-cemented power of the Christians in the East. In vain did an emperor of the
                    West, and two kings renowned for their valour, put themselves at the head of the
                    forces of their respective states, and march to deliver Palestine. These new
                    armies of crusaders found everywhere insurmountable obstacles or invincible
                    enemies; and efforts, which promised so much, produced only <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> splendid misfortunes. The kingdom of Jerusalem, the
                    ruins of which were still disputed, had become but the shadow of a name; and
                    even the captivity and misfortunes of the holy city soon ceased to draw tears
                    from the eyes of Christians, or to fill them with the transports of a warlike
                    piety. The crusaders who had armed themselves for the deliverance of the
                    heritage of Christ, allowed themselves to be seduced by the riches of Greece,
                    and instead of rushing with fervid impetuosity on Palestine, stopped short to
                    attempt the conquest of Constantinople. From this time the crusades began to
                    assume a new character, and appear to have had another object, as well as
                    another motive, than at the period of their commencement. W <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> hilst a small number of Christians still shed their
                    blood for the deliverance of the holy sepulchre, the greater part of the
                    princes, leaders, and knights of the cross listened only to the voice of
                    ambition; and the popes completed the corruption of the original spirit by
                    preaching crusades against Christian states and against their personal enemies.
                    Holy wars thus degenerated into civil commotions, in the course of which
                    religion and humanity were equally outraged, while the rights of nations and the
                    liberties of mankind were trampled under foot.</p>
                <p>This abuse of the crusades, and the fatal passions which it called into play, had
                    plunged Europe into disorder and anarchy <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, when a
                    pious monarch undertook once more to arm the West against the Infidels, and to
                    rekindle in the bosoms of new crusaders the heroic ardour which had animated the
                    companions of Godefroy. But the two expeditions, directed by this sainted
                    leader, proved the most disastrous of all. In the first, the world had the
                    spectacle presented to it of an army in captivity, and a king in letters; in the
                    second, that of a powerful monarch perishing near the ruins of Carthage, of the
                    same pestilence which had desolated his ranks. In Egypt, the fortune of arms
                    placed him at the mercy of the Infidels whom he went to conquer; in Africa, the
                    plague claimed him as its victim. These misfortunes contributed powerfully to
                    dispel the illusion which had so long reigned supreme over the public mind; and
                    from this time Jerusalem ceased to excite the passions or to attract the regards
                    of the children of the West. But Europe, much as it had suffered, was, by the
                    compensatory law of Providence, destined to reap important benefits in return.
                    So many revolutions did not take place, so many distant expeditions were not
                    undertaken, in vain. Some gleams of civilization penetrated athwart the darkness
                    of barbarism; and the first effect of the light which the crusades began to
                    scatter abroad, was to weaken the spirit of exaltation in which they <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> had had their origin. Attempts were afterwards made
                    to rekindle the flame which had at first overspread all Europe, and burned with
                    consuming fury in Asia; but these proved utterly abortive. The nations recovered
                    from their pious delirium; languor succeeded to enthusiasm, and lassitude passed
                    into indifference; so that, when Germany found itself menaced by the Moslemins,
                    who were already masters of Constantinople, the banner of the cross could
                    scarcely summon together a few thousand warriors; and Europe, which had risen
                    almost <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> to attack the Infidels in Asia, could
                    oppose to them only a feeble resistance upon its own territory.</p>
                <p>II. Having thus endeavoured to explain the origin and to illustrate the spirit
                    and character of the crusades, it now remains to show what influence they
                    produced upon the state and condition of society. On this subject different
                    opinions have been entertained at different times. In the seventeenth century
                    sentiment prevailed over reason; the heroic valour of the crusaders was admired,
                    their reverses w ere deplored; and, without reference to the good or evil
                    produced by these distant expeditions, men respected the pious motives which had
                    induced the warriors of the West to take up arms. In the eighteenth century,
                    which had imbibed the spirit of reform, an opposite tendency showed itself; and
                    these enterprises were represented as the joint product of ignorance,
                    fanaticism, and barbarism. In 1773 Voltaire published a history of the crusades;
                    but the subject was then so generally decried, and the author had thrown so much
                    ridicule on the events which he related, that his book excited little curiosity,
                    and found but few readers. The same tone was afterwards assumed by the writers
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedic,</hi> who adopted the sarcasms and greatly
                    exaggerated the declamations of Voltaire; and this mode of judging the crusades
                    became so general, that even the panegyrists of St Louis could scarcely forgive
                    that pious monarch his exploits and misfortunes in Egypt and at Tunis. But in
                    due time philosophy, enlightened by research and analysis, investigated the
                    causes of events, studied their effects, and, searching for the truth, abandoned
                    satire and declamation. In the introduction to his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Charles the Fifth,</hi> Robertson expressed his conviction that the crusades had
                    favoured the progress of freedom and the advancement of the human mind; and the
                    conclusion of the historian, whether it flattered some of the opinions of the
                    time, or exercised on the public mind the natural ascendency of truth, soon
                    found many partizans. From this time writers began to judge with less severity
                    of the oriental expeditions of the crusaders, and to consider these as a subject
                    of philosophical inquiry, rather than as a theme for declamation or ridicule.
                    Hence, about twenty years ago, the Institute of France, in a truly liberal and
                    enlightened spirit, proposed to the learned in general, as a subject of
                    competition, the advantages which society had derived from the crusades; and two
                    memoirs, one by M. Hercen, and another by Μ. de Choiseul d’Aillecourt<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194753616" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3616-0488"/>, obtained the
                    prize offered by the Institute on this occasion. The object of both these
                    productions, which are remarkable for the erudition and sound critical spirit
                    which they display, is to establish the principle that the holy wars were, in
                    their consequences, productive of advantages to posterity which greatly
                    overbalanced the calamities they inflicted on contemporary generations. It may
                    be added that these very able and learned memoirs form as it were the basis of
                    Michaud’s more ample and satisfactory work, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >H/istoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des Croisades,</hi> to which we are happy in
                    having an opportunity of expressing our obligations. Upon the whole, then, it
                    appears that, in the course of two centuries, opinions have several times
                    changed on the subject of the crusades; and that, long as the period is which
                    has elapsed since these memorable expeditions were undertaken, there is still
                    great room for the exercise of caution in endeavouring to estimate the precise
                    amount of the influence which they eventually exercised on society.</p>
                <p>It may be observed, indeed, that what the crusades wanted in order to propitiate
                    favourable judgments, was success. Let us, however, suppose for a moment, that
                    these distant expeditions had succeeded to the fullest extent, and endeavour to
                    show what would, in that case, have been the results. Egypt, Syria, and Greece
                    would have become Christian colonies; the nations of the East and of the West
                    would have advanced hand in hand in the career of civilization; the language of
                    the Franks would have penetrated to the extremities of Asia; the coasts of
                    Barbary, inhabited by pirates, would have received the manners and the laws of
                    Europe; and the interior of Africa would not long have remained a region
                    impenetrable to the activity of commerce, or the researches of science and
                    discovery. In order to judge what might have been gained by this union of so
                    many nations and races of men under the same laws and the same religion, it is
                    only necessary to consider the state of the Roman world under the successors of
                    Augustus, forming in some sort but one people, living under the same laws, and
                    speaking the same language. All the seas were free; the most distant provinces
                    communicated with one another by means of admirable roads; cities exchanged
                    their arts, their industry, and their varied productions; nations maintained a
                    commerce of knowledge, on principles of perfect reciprocity. If the crusades had
                    subjected the East to Christendom, it is not unreasonable to believe that this
                    magnificent spectacle, which the human race had only once seen, would have been
                    renewed in modern times; and then opinions would not have been divided as to the
                    advantage of the holy wars. But, unhappily, the crusaders could neither extend
                    nor preserve their conquests; they wanted the faculty of improving victory, and
                    they were unable to repair the consequences of defeat. The results of the
                    crusades, therefore, are on this account more difficult to be determined; whilst
                    the good which is ascribed to them is immeasurably less obvious and striking.
                    The evils which they caused to humanity were great, though temporary; as to the
                    good which they produced, it was like a germ which remained long hid in the
                    earth, and at length developed itself slowly and imperceptibly. Let us, however,
                    glance at the state and condition of the different powers of Europe before,
                    during, and after the crusades, noting the principal changes that occurred, and
                    the ameliorations which were gradually effected.</p>
                <p>1. At the commencement of the twelfth century, the French monarchy had fallen
                    into a state of weakness and decay; but in the course of the succeeding ages, it
                    revived and attained to great prosperity and splendour. Able negotiations,
                    successful wars, useful alliances, the decay of the feudal system, and the
                    progressive emancipation of the commonalty, favoured the dynasty of the Capets
                    in the aggrandisement of their states and the increase of their authority.
                    Several centuries were employed in consummating this great work of fortune or of
                    policy; but the revolution, thus slowly operated, was attended with effects
                    proportionally durable. The policy of the French kings, however, was seconded by
                    the great events of the crusades; and it was natural that the nation which had
                    taken the greatest share in these enterprises, should profit the most by them,
                    for the increase of its power and the amelioration of its social condition. The
                    royal authority derived equal benefit from the exploits and the reverses of the
                    numerous warriors whom the crusades had hurried into Asia. The removal, the
                    death, or the ruin of the great vassals of the crown, equally enabled the
                    sovereign to disengage himself from the fetters of feudal anarchy, and to
                    establish order in the kingdom. More than a century before the first crusade,
                    the barons and the prelates had ceased to meet in general assemblies, for the
                    purpose of regulating the forms of justice, and of giving to the acts of the
                    sovereign the support of their political influence. But at the time of the
                    second crusade, there were several assemblies of the grandees of the kingdom, at
                    which they occupied themselves with preparations for the expedition, and with
                    measures for maintaining public order and the execution of the laws during the
                    absence of Louis VII.; and in these meetings the French beheld a faint image of
                    the assemblies, so celebrated under the former races of kings, in which the
                    monarch and his subjects deliberated together as to the best means of insuring
                    the safety of the throne and the independence of the nation. Thus the crusades
                    aided the kings of France in recovering their legislative power, and enabled the
                    more enlightened portion of the nation to repossess themselves of those ancient
                    prerogatives which they had exercised under the descendants of Clovis and of
                    Charlemagne. The great vassals who, in the time of Hugues Capet, and for more
                    than a century afterwards, had been continually opposed to the crown, from which
                    they had separated their interests, became animated with different sentiments
                    when they saw the French monarchs at the head of expeditions which fixed the
                    attention of Christendom, and in which the cause of Jesus Christ himself and
                    that of all Christian nations was concerned. In a word, to understand how much
                    the kings of France were indebted to the crusades, and how much they gained by
                    the part they took in these expeditions, it is only necessary to compare Philip
                    I. shut up in his palace during the council of Clermont, excommunicated by
                    Urban, condemned by the bishops, and abandoned by his grandees, with
                    Philip-Augustus, victorious over Saladin in Syria, and over the enemies of his
                    kingdom at Bouvines; or with Louis XI. surrounded in his reverses by a faithful
                    nobility, respected by the clergy and people, revered as the firmest supporter
                    of the church, and proclaimed by his age the arbiter of Europe. The crusades,
                    indeed, were the signal of a new order of things in France, the foundations of
                    which were laid with great solidity during the wars in Palestine and in other
                    countries of the East.</p>
                <p>2. If royalty had sunk to a low ebb in France at the period of the first crusade,
                    in England it was lusty and vigorous, and, together with the feudal system,
                    pressed upon the nation with all the weight of the tyranny established by
                    William the Conqueror. But an authority founded by victory and supported by
                    violence, inspired a feeling of opposition which time and circumstances
                    afterwards developed. Military despotism had succeeded in silencing opinion; but
                    it had failed to produce an entire change in the manners of the English, or to
                    eradicate their attachment to their ancient customs. The passions repressed by
                    the sword found vent when the force of terror <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194753629" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3629-0489"/>was removed, and broke out
                    with a vehemence proportioned to the constraints to which they had previously
                    been subjected. In England, therefore, the change which took place was just the
                    reverse of that which had been effected in France. A monarchy formerly powerful
                    began to decline, and liberty made progress at the expense of the royal
                    authority. The crusades, however, had probably less influence on the
                    civilization of England than on that of several other states of Europe; but they
                    may, nevertheless, have concurred with other causes in accelerating the changes
                    which afterwards took place in the English monarchy. Richard Coeur de Lion
                    showed himself more anxious to acquire the renown of a great captain than the
                    reputation of a great king; and in seeking glory in arras, he neglected the
                    cares of government. At his departure for Palestine he sold the revenues,
                    prerogatives, and domains of the crown, and would have sold the city of London
                    itself if he had found a purchaser; but his reverses and his captivity ruined
                    his people, and his long absence nourished the spirit of faction among the
                    nobility, nay even in the bosom of his own family. The English barons several
                    times indicated a determination to set out for the East without the permission
                    of the king; and the thought of opposing a monarch whom they disliked heightened
                    their impatience to embark for Palestine. In fact, princes sought to take
                    advantage of the opinions of their time, and engaged to join the crusades for
                    the sole purpose of obtaining subsidies, which they employed in other
                    enterprises; conduct which brought contempt on their policy, and increased the
                    public distrust of all their proceedings. But there was another cause which
                    mainly contributed to subvert the foundations of absolute monarchy in England;
                    we mean the violent enterprises of the popes against the sovereigns of that
                    country, enterprises which were favoured by the spirit of the religious wars. In
                    the league of the barons against Henry III., the rebels bore the badge or ensign
                    of a cross, as in the wars beyond sea, and the priests promised the crown of
                    martyrdom to all who should die in the cause of liberty. It is a remarkable
                    circumstance that the chief of the league formed for establishing the
                    independence of the English nation was a French gentleman, the son of the Count
                    de Montfort, who had acquired so great renown in the crusade against the
                    Albigenses. After long and persevering efforts, liberty at length took root in
                    that soil whence we trust it will never be eradicated, and many fierce and
                    painful struggles issued in positive and durable results, of which succeeding
                    ages reaped the full benefit.</p>
                <p>3. But whilst the monarchy of France was strengthened at the expense of liberty,
                    and liberty in England was conquered from the monarchy, Germany presented a
                    different spectacle, and the empire, which had flourished till the commencement
                    of the eleventh century, exhibited symptoms of a rapid decline during the period
                    of the crusades. In order to resist the great vassals, the emperors granted
                    several advantages to the clergy, and conferred privileges on the towns. But the
                    clergy employed these advantages in favour of the popes, who attacked the
                    imperial power; and the towns profited by the concessions made to them in order
                    to establish their independence. In spite of all the efforts of the emperors,
                    the crown remained elective, whilst the great fiefs had become hereditary; and
                    thus the</p>
                <p>1 heads of the empire depended for their election on the nobility and princes who
                    had freed themselves from all dependence. The succession was therefore a subject
                    of perpetual intrigue and contention, whilst, in the struggle,</p>
                <p>I ambition was often preferred to moderation and virtue. Amongst the princes who
                    ascended the imperial throne, several were men of great character; but their
                    active and stirring genius hurrying them into disproportionate enterprises,
                    exhausted their means, and accelerated the decline of the empire. The
                    recollection of ancient Rome, and of the power of the Caesars, was continually
                    present to their thoughts. They carried their arms into Italy, where a war of
                    extermination was declared against them by the popes; two families of emperors
                    sunk under the thunders of Rome; and whilst they exhausted themselves in vain
                    efforts to establish their power in Italy, they completed the ruin of their
                    influence in Germany. The policy pursued by the kings of France was wiser and
                    more fortunate. They confined their efforts to the extension of their own power;
                    their conquests tended only to reunite the scattered branches of a great family;
                    and their authority became more popular, in proportion as they came to be
                    considered as the natural bond of connection between the French of all the
                    provinces. But the glory which the emperors of Germany acquired by their
                    conquests was personal to themselves, and possessed no attraction for the German
                    people. It had nothing in common with the nation of which they were only the
                    nominal heads; it was neither a principle of union nor a source of support; it
                    combined no interests, it appealed to no national feelings; and each sought his
                    own safety or his own aggrandisement by his individual means. Hence arose a
                    state of things more fatal to Germany than even the absolute power of the
                    emperors. From the ruins of imperial greatness there sprung up a multitude of
                    small states, opposed to one another by difference of laws and by a spirit of
                    rivalry; and whilst the monarchical spirit predominated in these principalities,
                    secular as well as ecclesiastical,—whilst the great towns were actuated by the
                    love of liberty and independence, and the nobility continued to urge the
                    pretensions of the aristocracy,—it was vain to expect that, having conflicting
                    interests, they would pursue the same policy, or direct their efforts towards
                    any common and salutary end. The popes continually interposed; great disorders
                    were produced; the sceptre of Charlemagne was broken; pretenders to the imperial
                    dignity multiplied, under the encouragement of Rome, in proportion as the empire
                    itself was falling to pieces; and, in the midst of this anarchy, Germany lost
                    its political as it afterwards did its religious unity. The enormous and inert
                    mass of the confederation could never be set in motion; even the presence of
                    actual danger failed to awaken its energy, or to induce it to adopt any vigorous
                    decision for the safety of Germany". In the meanwhile, the crusades afforded a
                    pretext, of which the popes availed themselves, for removing the emperors of
                    Germany, and hurrying them into disastrous expeditions, which accelerated the
                    ruin of their power; and thus the enthusiasm of the holy wars, which contributed
                    to unite other Christian nations, only served to produce confusion and disorder
                    in the bosom of the empire. At the same time, it was under the influence and
                    auspices of the court of Rome, whilst seriously occupied with a crusade, that
                    the family of Rodolph of Hapsburg took its rise; a family whose power restored
                    to the empire something of∖ its ancient splendour, and saved Europe from the
                    invasion of the Turks. It was also during the epoch of the crusades that the
                    cities of Dantzick, Thorn, Elbing, Königsberg, and others, sprung up in the
                    midst of deserts and of forests; that Finland, Lithuania, Pomerania, and
                    Silesia, became flourishing provinces; and that new states were formed, destined
                    afterwards to occupy a high rank among the powers of Europe.</p>
                <p>4. If from Germany we turn to Italy, we shall there find other forms of
                    government, and revolutions of a different character. When the last columns of
                    the Roman empire were overturned, Italy found itself covered with ruins. The
                    Huns, Franks, Vandals, Goths, Germans, and Lombards, successively carried into
                    that fine country the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753642"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3642-0490"/>scourge of their domination, and left there traces
                    of their manners, their legislation, and their character. But, in the tenth
                    century, when the emperors of Constantinople could no longer extend their arms
                    to Italy, other powers arose, some by conquest, others by fortune, and others
                    again by means unknown to history. The influence of the popes sometimes defended
                    Italy with success against the invasions and the yoke of the emperors of
                    Germany; but the struggle was protracted, whilst the various fortune of the
                    contest served only to perpetuate confusion and discord; and, during several
                    centuries, the factions of the Guelphs and Gibelines desolated Italy without
                    defending it. That country, unfortunately, had no point of centralization around
                    which to rally and unite its means of defence. On the contrary, divided into a
                    multitude of petty states, it reckoned within its natural boundaries several
                    nations, and twenty republics, each having its own laws, its own interests, and
                    its own history. Amongst a numerous population thus split into factions, there
                    could scarcely prevail any community of feeling, because there existed no
                    identity of interest; whilst, on the other hand, all the elements of disorder
                    and contention were accumulated in destructive abundance. Hence we find little
                    else than continual wars and strifes, not only between different towns and
                    different states, but even between the citizens of the same town or the same
                    republic; strangers were called in to take part in their intestine feuds; and
                    the same mutual distrust which hired and armed mercenary adventurers to decide
                    their disputes, destroyed the true sentiment of patriotism, and almost effaced
                    the remembrance of the Italian name. The feudal system was abolished in Italy
                    sooner than in other countries; but with this system disappeared the ancient
                    honour of the <hi rend="italic">preux</hi><hi rend="italic">chevaliers,</hi> and
                    all the virtues of chivalry. In republics defended by mercenaries bravery ceased
                    to be respected, and the generous sentiments which it inspires were forgotten. A
                    loose rein was given to the most violent passions; excesses of hatred and
                    vengeance, which appear scarcely probable even in our tragedies, were indulged
                    in; the finest country in Europe seemed to be peopled with demons incarnate; and
                    Dante had only to look around him in order to find the model of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Inferno.</hi> Society, always ready to fall in pieces, seemed to
                    have no other motive force than the fury of parties, no other life than discord
                    and civil war; against anarchy there was no guarantee but tyranny, against
                    tyranny none but the despair of factions and the daggers of conspirators. As the
                    power of the little states which covered Italy was disproportioned to their
                    ambition, their rulers were consequently weak, and, wanting both courage and
                    moderation, they sought their aggrandisement or their safety by all the means
                    which treachery or perfidy could suggest. Any plot however infamous, any
                    proceeding however scandalous, any crime however great, appeared good in their
                    eyes, provided it only served to support their quarrels or to satisfy their
                    ambition and their jealousy. Morality, in short, disappeared; and then was
                    formed that school of politics, the maxims of which are embodied, for the
                    purpose probably of exposing them, in the <hi rend="italic">Prince</hi> of
                    Machiavelli.</p>
                <p>At the period of the crusades, however, the cities of Lombardy, and the republics
                    of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice, had attained great prosperity. This arose from the
                    commerce of the East, which Italy had carried on before the epoch of these
                    expeditions, and which it continued with all the additional advantages offered
                    by the contest in Palestine. But these mercantile republics, which had their
                    attention continually fixed on Syria, Egypt, and Greece, were better fitted to
                    enrich Italy with the products of their commercial industry than to nurse among
                    the Italians the sentiment of true independence. At the same time, the power of
                    Venice was everywhere advanced by the arms of the crusaders, and by the men of
                    that age the queen of the Adriatic was regarded as the empress of the East. Her
                    decay commenced only at the period when the progress of navigation, to which she
                    had so greatly contributed, opened a new passage to the Indies, and led to the
                    discovery of a new world. The greater part of the other republics had neither
                    the same lustre nor the same duration, but, towards the close of the crusades,
                    disappeared in the chaos and tumult of discord and civil war. As to the kingdom
                    of Naples and Sicily, it formed, as it were, part of the high road by which the
                    crusaders marched to Greece and to Palestine; and as its riches appeared to have
                    no protectors, a country which its inhabitants had never been able to defend
                    naturally tempted the cupidity of the princes and knights proceeding to seek
                    their fortunes in Asia. For more than two centuries, accordingly, its history is
                    blended with that of the crusades, which often served as a pretext or occasion
                    for conquering it; whilst, as to the wars in which this kingdom engaged, they
                    exhibit monstrous crimes rather than glorious exploits, revolts instead of
                    battles, and consummate cowardice united with remorseless and unsparing
                    cruelty.</p>
                <p>5. During the course of the crusades Spain was chiefly occupied in defending her
                    own hearths against the same Saracens whom the people of other nations of Europe
                    went to combat in the East. Accordingly, she did not take part in these
                    enterprises until the spirit in which they originated had begun to decline in
                    the rest of Europe. This country, however, derived some advantages from the
                    expeditions to the East. In almost all the enterprises of Christendom against
                    the Moslemins of Asia, a great number of crusaders disembarked on the shores of
                    Spain in order to combat the Moors; and several crusades were published in the
                    West against the infidel masters of the Peninsula. The celebrated victory gained
                    over the Moors at Tolosa was the fruit of a crusade preached in Europe, and
                    particularly in France, by order of the sovereign pontiff. The expeditions
                    beyond sea also aided the cause of the Spaniards, by detaining in their own
                    country the Saracens of Egypt and Syria, who might otherwise have joined those
                    on the coasts of Africa, and proceeded to the assistance of their countrymen in
                    Spain. The kingdom of Portugal was moreover conquered and founded by the
                    crusaders; and their expeditions first suggested the idea of certain orders of
                    chivalry, which, in imitation of those of Palestine, were formed in Spain, and
                    mainly contributed to enable the people of that country to triumph over the
                    Moors. We may add, that Spain is the country where the memory of the crusades
                    was longest preserved. In the course of last century there used to be published,
                    every year, in all the provinces, a bull called <hi rend="italic">Crusadα,</hi>
                    which solemn publication recalled to the Spanish nation the triumphs which their
                    ancestors had gained over the Moorish invaders of their country.</p>
                <p>In thus surveying the condition of the principal countries of Europe at the epoch
                    of the crusades, it is impossible not to be struck with the great diversity
                    observable in their manners, their institutions, and the destiny of their
                    inhabitants. But still it is no easy task to follow and to mark the progress of
                    civilization in so many monarchies and republics, some emerging in splendour
                    from the bosom of barbarism, and others falling back into decay and ruin. Nor is
                    it less difficult to detect the influence exercised by the crusades amidst so
                    many revolutions, which had often the same origin, though their effects were
                    different and sometimes opposite. Nevertheless, this influence was in all cases
                    considerable, and in a few strikingly great. In France it favoured the growth of
                    the monarchy at the expense of a turbulent and powerful feudal aristocracy. In
                    England, it favoured the growth of liberty at the expense<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194753655" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3655-0491"/> of an absolute monarchy. In
                    Germany, it accelerated the decline of an empire with an elective head, and
                    depressed the aristocracy, whilst it encouraged the industry and enterprise of
                    the towns, enabling them at the same time to secure a sort of independence. In
                    Italy, if it failed to mitigate the political evils with which that country was
                    unhappily cursed, it gave a new stimulus to commerce and navigation; enriched
                    those mercantile republics which then monopolized the trade of the East; and
                    gradually paved the way for discoveries which have since produced the most
                    striking effects on the destinies of mankind. And, lastly, in Spain, it
                    powerfully contributed to the deliverance of the Peninsula from the yoke of the
                    Saracens, and gave rise to the institution of the Cortes, the emancipation of
                    the commonalty, the enfranchisement of the towns, and other measures which
                    signalized the decline of the feudal system and of the absolute authority of the
                    sovereign in that country. Such were the more immediate political results of the
                    crusades. Let us now for an instant inquire what effects they produced on the
                    authority of the church, and on the institutions and manners of the middle
                    ages.</p>
                <p>III. The situation of the popes in the middle ages presents a singular spectacle.
                    As sovereigns of Rome, they had scarcely any authority, and were frequently
                    exiled from their own states; as the heads of Christendom, they exercised an
                    absolute empire to the very extremities of the world, and their name was revered
                    wherever the gospel was preached. Possessing this unlimited spiritual authority,
                    the popes obtained credit with some for originating the crusades; but they’ who
                    support such an opinion have little knowledge of the general movement which then
                    agitated the Christian world. No power on earth was capable of producing so
                    mighty and universal a commotion; it belonged only to Him who raises and stills
                    the tempest at his pleasure to inspire of a sudden into the hearts of men that
                    enthusiasm which absorbed all other passions, and hurried on vast multitudes as
                    if impelled by an invisible force. It has also been said that the crusades
                    greatly increased the authority of the popes; and this is true, though perhaps
                    scarcely to the extent which some are willing to believe. At first, indeed, the
                    popes did not seem to be aware of the advantages which they might derive from
                    these expeditions; and, accordingly, it was not until the second crusade that
                    they became sensible of the ascendency which the holy see might exercise by
                    means of the efforts made for the conquest of the Holy Land. Latterly, however,
                    the crusades furnished the popes with a pretext for usurping, in all the states
                    of Europe, the principal prerogatives of the sovereign power. In name of the
                    holy war, they assumed the right of raising armies and levying imposts; their
                    legates exercised supreme authority in all the countries of Christendom; the
                    presence of these haughty envoys inspired respect and fear; wherever they went
                    their will was law. Armed with the cross, they exacted the most implicit
                    obedience from the clergy; and as the latter naturally possessed a very great
                    ascendency over the people, the empire of the popes knew neither limits nor
                    opposition. At the same time, the papal power received but little increase in
                    Asia during the holy wars; whilst the quarrels and disorders which incessantly
                    disturbed the Christian colonies multiplied their embarrassments without adding
                    to their power. Their voice was not always listened to amidst the din of arms;
                    and sometimes the soldiers of the cross resisted the will and contemned the
                    counsels of the pontiffs. The legates of the holy see were often at variance
                    with the chiefs of the Christian armies, and their character was not always
                    respected in the midst of camps; whilst, on the other hand, as the popes aspired
                    to direct the crusades, they were held in some sort responsible for misfortunes
                    and disorders which they could not prevent; and this responsibility, exposing
                    them to be judged with rigour, impaired their reputation for ability and
                    sagacity. By a gross abuse of the crusading spirit, the popes also engaged in
                    wars where ambition was more concerned than religion; they thought of their
                    temporal when they should have attended only to the interests of their spiritual
                    dominion; and in seeking to advance the one they neglected the other. The
                    crusade against the Albigenses was productive of no solid advantage to the papal
                    authority. The intolerance which occasioned that war may no doubt be regarded as
                    an emanation of the fierce spirit of the time; but the Inquisition, which then
                    took its rise, awakened more passions than it repressed. The enormous tributes
                    imposed on the clergy also served to weaken the papal authority, by the
                    universal discontent which these exactions produced. Tenths were raised not only
                    for a crusade, but for every attempt at a crusade, and not only for the
                    expeditions to the East, but for every enterprise undertaken against the enemies
                    of the court of Rome; whilst the rigour with which the agents of the pontiffs
                    collected the imposts, and the scandalous manner in which they often misapplied
                    the sums wrung from the faithful, excited the most lively indignation, and
                    called forth loud remonstrances. “Rien ne fut plus funeste à l’au-torité
                    pontificale (says Michaud) que ces plaintes qu’on entendait de toutes parts, et
                    dont s’arma enfin la redoutable hérésie de Luther.” In short, to quote the words
                    of the same author, “la domination des papes alla toujours s’accroissant pendant
                    un siècle jusqu’à Innocent III.; elle alla ensuite en déclinant pendant un autre
                    siècle, jusqu’à Boniface VIII., époque où finissait les croisades
                    d’outre-mer.”</p>
                <p>2. Before the period of the crusades, the feudal system had begun to exhibit some
                    symptoms of decline. Founded on the basis of military colonization, the
                    governments of the middle ages may be compared to a victorious army dispersed in
                    a conquered country, having the territory which it occupied parcelled out in
                    certain definite proportions, and always ready at the signal of its officers or
                    supreme head to march against the common enemy, and to defend its possessions.
                    Hence, as long as discipline and obedience subsisted in these colonies, public
                    order was not disturbed. But when the reciprocal relations of protection and
                    submission, service’^and duties, became enfeebled— when discipline relaxed, and
                    the rigour of military law had been insensiblymitigated—society then presented
                    the spectacle of an army abandoned to license, ór freed in some measure from the
                    control of its chief or head; and every successive abatement was so much
                    withdrawn from the strength and solidity of the fabric of feudalism, so much
                    added to the antagonist force which had already begun to attack its foundations.
                    Still, at the period of the crusades, the ties of fidelity produced by the
                    feudal relations were so powerful that the preachers of these expeditions
                    sometimes invoked these in their exhortations; they preached the duties of
                    feudalism in concurrence with the precepts of the gospel; and, to excite the
                    Christian warriors to assume the cross, they called them <hi rend="italic">the
                    vassals of Jesus Christ.</hi> The crusades, however, unquestionably exercised a
                    salutary influence upon the spirit and manners of feudalism; they contributed to
                    destroy, by exhausting, the ferocity’ which that system had nurtured, as well as
                    to eradicate some of the grosser abuses which it had engendered; they preserved,
                    by stimulating and encouraging, the generous sentiments which it had inspired;
                    and they concurred in developing whatever it contained that was favourable to
                    the progress of civilization. They opened a seasonable and sufficient outlet for
                    an overboiling spirit, which, if compressed, would have blown to pieces the
                    whole fabric of society; and, by their re-action, they favoured the growth <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194753668" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3668-0492"/> and expansion of
                    interests which became identified with the cause of general improvement and of
                    public order. The whole of man was not yet known, and the idea of virtue was
                    still in a great measure merged in that of mere duty or obedience. But the
                    crusades created a desire, or we should rather say produced a necessity, for
                    acquiring personal distinction, in addition to that conferred by mere rank or
                    possessions; every man above the common herd was compelled by ambition to
                    illustrate his name with some brilliant achievement; and even the meanest and
                    humblest individual became in some sort ennobled by the performance of great
                    actions. This feeling belongs to a rising civilization; it is the first
                    indication of that spirit which sooner or later issues in the intellectual,
                    moral, and political improvement of society.</p>
                <p>3. The crusades were not altogether without fruits even to that class which, in
                    the first instance, suffered most by them; we mean the nobility. Some acquired
                    principalities in the East; many of the cities of Greece and Syria were erected
                    into signories; and the military orders which were then introduced afforded them
                    some compensation for the losses which they had sustained. A few, more fortunate
                    than the rest, ascended the thrones of David and of Constantine, and took their
                    place among the great monarchs of Christendom. All acquired distinction or
                    renown; and, by means of sirnames and armorial bearings, which were now
                    introduced, their glory was emblazoned and preserved in the achievements of
                    their escutcheons. The feudal system declined apace, and the power of the great
                    barons was gradually but certainly yielding to the encroachments of royalty on
                    the one hand, and the inroads of public liberty on the other. But the spirit of
                    chivalry came instead of the colder and more repulsive principle of feudalism;
                    and if the nobility served the state in a new character, they still retained a
                    predominant influence, and, in fact, constituted the greater part of its
                    defensive force.</p>
                <p>4. The condition of the people was more slowly ameliorated, and they long groaned
                    under intolerable oppressions. The peasantry remained in a state of servitude or
                    villeinage, subject to the arbitrary jurisdiction of their feudal lords, and
                    without any law to protect them against tyranny of the worst description. But
                    the inhabitants of the towns were more fortunate; and as the policy of princes
                    concurred with the advancement of their consequence, they were early enabled to
                    shake off the fetters which long weighed so heavily on the serfs of the plains.
                    The cities of Lombardy, and of a great part of Italy, were the first to throw
                    off the feudal yoke; in Germany the towns also became free, though at a later
                    period; in England the manifestation of the spirit of liberty dates from the era
                    of the crusades, prior to which the towns, with the exception of London, which
                    had obtained some privileges, seem never to have once dreamed of independence;
                    and in Spain, the war against the Moors not only favoured the rise of the
                    commons, but secured them the protection of institutions which guaranteed the
                    enjoyment of a large measure of freedom. The towns of the south of France soon
                    followed the example of those of Italy and Spain, and obtained franchises which
                    in time became consecrated by usage as well as by positive laws. The liberty of
                    the towns commenced with corporations; because experience had taught their
                    inhabitants that they were only strong when united, and also because the
                    conservation of their privileges and franchises would otherwise have been
                    impossible. This emancipation of the commons, however, was attended with very
                    different results to the great vassals and to the crown. It weakened the
                    authority of the barons and feudal lords, because the spirit of liberty
                    naturally turned against its more immediate and dangerous enemies; but it
                    increased the royal authority, because the cities which were either free, or
                    expected to become so, naturally turned towards the monarch, the author of that
                    boon, whose interest, in one important particular, was identical with their own.
                    Hence we find kings and princes placing themselves, as it were, at the head of
                    the general movement of society, and seeking to establish order and to promote
                    improvement because they knew that they would thereby extend their power and
                    increase their authority. The serfs of the plains, however, groaned in
                    subjection to tyranny long after the towns had become free. From the crusades
                    they derived little or no direct advantage. They could not unite, likq the
                    inhabitants of towns; they were dispersed, and therefore feeble. But a
                    propitious impulse had been given, and the day of deliverance at length arrived.
                    Some cities in Germany contributed to the freedom of the peasants of their
                    territory; the same thing occurred in Italy and Spain; and although in England
                    the yoke of villeinage was worn for a longer period, yet it was at length
                    removed, and with it the last external badge of feudal servitude.</p>
                <p>5. The crusades have been reproached with having first given the idea and
                    introduced the practice of taxation. The notion, however, is too simple in
                    itself to make it necessary to search so far back for its origin. But it is not
                    improbable that the mode in which the tenths were levied for the holy wars
                    served as a model to those who afterwards established regular contributions.
                    Further, when the feudal regime, which cost nothing, had been overturned, it
                    became necessary to provide for the expenses of a new system of administration;
                    and when the state could no longer calculate on the defenders with which the
                    tenure of military service had supplied it, it was obliged to seek for others,
                    and of course to pay them for their services. Hence arose the necessity for
                    stipendiary armies and regular and permanent imposts. Other means, indeed, were
                    at first employed. The coin of the realm was debased; the·Jews were persecuted;
                    violence was employed; justice was sold. But all these resources, which tended
                    at once to corrupt the government and the nation, were soon exhausted, and none
                    other than that of taxation remained. With regard to regular armies, again,
                    there can be no doubt whatever that the first idea of these was suggested by the
                    expeditions to Palestine and other countries of the East. These distant and
                    protracted enterprises changed the conditions of the feudal service, and
                    accustomed men to see permanent armies, supported and commanded by princes.</p>
                <p>6. Chivalry was known in the West before the era of the crusades. But these wars,
                    which appeared to have the same object as chivalry, namely, that of defending
                    the oppressed, serving the cause of God, and combating the Infidels, imparted to
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> this institution greater lustre and consistence,
                    and gave it a direction at once more extensive and more salutary. On this
                    important branch of the subject, however, it is only necessary here to refer to
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Chivalry</hi> in this work, which contains a
                    clear, eloquent, and masterly exposition of the more prominent features of that
                    extraordinary institution, and, in particular, explains the changes and
                    modifications which it underwent in consequence of the memorable expeditions of
                    which we are treating. When the institution of chivalry fell by the abuse which
                    had been made of it, and particularly in consequence of the changes which had
                    taken place in the military system of Europe, there still remained in the mind
                    of society some of the sentiments which it had inspired; in the same manner as
                    there remains with those who have forgotten the religion in which they were
                    born, something of its preeepts, and especially of the impressions which they
                    had received in their infancy. In the time of chivalry, the price of good
                    actions was glory and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753681"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3681-0493"/>honour; and this coin, which is so useful to
                    nations, yet costs them nothing, did not fail to possess some currency in the
                    ages which followed. Such is the effect of a glorious recollection, that the
                    marks and distinctions of chivalry still serve as the most appropriate and
                    enviable recompense of bravery and merit. Seeing, then, that the crusades added
                    some lustre and gave some ascendency to an institution which formed, as it were,
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> barrier against license and barbarism, it must be
                    admitted that these expeditions, however wild in themselves, have, in this
                    respect at least, conferred a real service on humanity.</p>
                <p>IV. Having thus viewed the crusades in connection with the effects which they are
                    supposed to have produced on the condition of different classes of society, and
                    having traced to the same source the origin of several of our institutions, it
                    now only remains to advert shortly to the progress which was made, during the
                    same period, in navigation, commerce, industry, the sciences, arts, letters, and
                    useful knowledge.</p>
                <p>1. Before the twelfth century, the seas of Europe and Asia, with the exception of
                    the Mediterranean, were scarcely frequented by the nations who occupied their
                    shores. Át the commencement of the crusades, France had only two or three ports
                    on the coast of Normandy, and not one either in the Atlantic or the
                    Mediterranean, till the seventh crusade, when Louis XI. caused that of
                    Aigues-Mortes to be constructed. England had not made greater advances; and the
                    trifling navigation of that age was carried on by some towns on the coasts of
                    the Baltic, in Holland, Flanders, and Spain. But when the crusades commenced,
                    the spirit of devotion uniting with that of commerce, gave a new and more
                    extended scope as well as impulse to the enterprises of navigators. The
                    inhabitants of Denmark appeared in the seas of Syria; and the Norwegians, who
                    had arrived in ships, assisted at the capture of Sidon. At the siege of
                    Ptolemais were found citizens of Lubeck and Bremen; and from all the coasts of
                    the West sailed vessels and even fleets to transport pilgrims, provisions, and
                    arms, into the kingdom of Jerusalem and the other principalities in Asia founded
                    by the arms of the crusaders. Thus the navigators of all countries were met in
                    the seas of the East; and, under the auspices of the cross, commercial relations
                    began to be established between the maritime states of Europe. At the
                    commencement of the twelfth century, a fleet of Pisans, united with some other
                    Italians, assisted the Aragonese in conquering the Balearic Isles; and the
                    navigators of Italy thus extended their knowledge of the shores of Spain, with
                    which they had previously been so little acquainted that they' mistook the
                    coasts of Aragon for the country of the Moors. Having gained experience in
                    distant voyages, the navigators of Lubeck, Bremen, and Denmark also explored the
                    hitherto unknown coasts of the Baltic ;—a communication was established between
                    the Baltic, the Mediterranean, the Spanish Ocean, and the seas of the North ;—a
                    spirit of emulation and enterprise united different nations in pursuit of the
                    same advantages;—and nautical science received important accessions in almost
                    all its branches. The configuration of coasts, and the position of capes,
                    harbours, bays, islands, and headlands was determined; seas were explored to
                    their furthest extremities; the direction of winds, of currents, and of tides,
                    was observed; and various points in hydrography were likewise settled with
                    tolerable precision. Lastly, the discovery of the compass, which had been made
                    about this time, although it did not come into general use until a subsequent
                    period, enabled those navigators who had obtained possession of the secret, to
                    embark in more adventurous voyages, and to brave the terrors of the ocean. Naval
                    architecture was also improved during the crusades. The construction of vessels
                    was rendered more solid, at the same time that their size was increased; and
                    they were for the first time provided with several masts, in order to multiply
                    their sails, and enable them to shape a course upon a wind. To guard the
                    interests and protect the freedom of navigation, a code of maritime law was
                    likewise framed, upon the model which had been furnished by the nautical sages
                    of Barcelona about the beginning of the twelfth century. In an assembly held at
                    St Sophia, in 1255, the Venetians adopted the code entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Consulat</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Mer,</hi> which was afterwards recognised
                    by the Pisans and the Genoese, and became the common law of the seas of the
                    East; whilst another code, first published by Eléonore de Guyenne, and
                    afterwards by Richard Coeur de Lion, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Poles
                    d’Oleron</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> obtained the assent of several
                    maritime states, and was at length accredited in all the seas of the West.
                    Protected by this legislation, navigators reaped the fruits of their lengthened
                    enterprises, and were soon enabled to dispute the empire of the Mediterranean
                    with the Infidels. Indeed, if Italy and several countries of the West were not
                    subjugated by the Saracens, they owed their safety more to the superiority of
                    their fleets than to that of their armies. In short it is more than probable
                    that, without the crusades, the genius of navigators would not, till a much
                    later period, have enabled them to traverse the immense space which separates
                    the Baltic from the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, or to shoot across the
                    mighty waste of waters interposed between the Old and the New World.</p>
                <p>2. Every climate has its peculiar productions; and this diversity of wealth
                    naturally leads to interchange or commerce, which in time establishes
                    communications between the most distant regions. In the middle ages, the
                    indolent and effeminate Greeks neglected to import into the West the merchandise
                    of Asia; and the Saracens landed on the coasts of Europe only to subject them to
                    the scourge of war. But the commercial enterprise of the West sought out those
                    products which had ceased to be imported; and the frequent voyages to the East
                    were altogether to the advantage of the Occidentals. Before the period of the
                    crusades, the merchandise of Asia had arrived in Europe, sometimes by the
                    overland route, traversing the Greek empire, Hungary, and Bulgaria; more
                    frequently by way of the Mediterranean, which may be said to abut, as it were,
                    on all the ports of Italy. Both these routes were rendered easy by the holy
                    wars; and then commerce, protected by the standard of the cross, advanced with
                    rapid strides. Most of the maritime towns of the West enriched themselves by
                    supplying Europe with the productions of the East; and they also derived
                    considerable advantages from the transport of pilgrims and of the Christian
                    armies. Fleets hovered around the coasts where the crusaders fought, supplying
                    them with munitions of war and provisions; and thus commerce brought back to
                    Europe part of the treasures which had been carried into Asia by the princes and
                    barons who had ruined themselves in order to provide the necessary means for
                    combating the infidels. In fact, all the riches of the maritime towns of Syria,
                    and even of Greece, belonged to the merchants of the West. They were masters of
                    the greater part of the Christian cities of Asia; they possessed all the islands
                    of the Archipelago; for a time, they ruled in Constantinople; and the Greek
                    empire was almost another Venice, with its laws, its fleets, and its armies. The
                    Latins, however, were not long masters of Constantinople, Jerusalem, and most of
                    the countries conquered by their arms. But commerce, more fortunate than war,
                    persevered in its conquests after the crusades. The city of Tana, built at the
                    mouth of the Tanais, became to Venice a colony which opened useful relations
                    with Persia, Tartary, Tauris, Trebizond, Bagdad, and Bassora; whilst the
                    Genoese, established in the small <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753694"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3694-0494"/>town of Caffa, in the Crimea, explored the mines
                    of the Caucasus, and received the treasures of India by way of Astracan. But
                    several of the great kingdoms of Europe had as yet but little share in this
                    commerce, which still continued in the hands of a few maritime towns. England
                    had nothing but her wool to give in exchange for the merchandise of Asia,
                    imported by Spanish and Italian merchants. The towns of France, excepting
                    Marseilles, had little share in the trade of the East. Italy, from her position,
                    which commands the Mediterranean, enjoyed almost exclusively this advantage, and
                    became the grand emporium of a traffic as extensive as it was profitable;
                    sending into all parts of Europe, not legions and proconsuls like Rome in the
                    days of its greatness, but caravans of merchants, who subjected the provinces
                    they traversed to the calculations and wants of commerce, and disposed, by their
                    industry, of all the money which then circulated in the West. In a word, Europe
                    has scarcely a great city where the name of Lombard affixed to some street or
                    quarter does not to this day attest the long residence of the Italian
                    merchants.</p>
                <p>3. It is not easy to separate the progress of industry, or even of agriculture,
                    from that of commerce. In order to ascertain, however, what each gained by the
                    relations with the East, it is necessary to attend to the state of these two
                    sources of wealth among the Orientals at the period of the crusades. Before this
                    time the Saracens had manufactures of various stuffs, such as silk, woollen, and
                    linen. At Damascus and in the towns of Egypt they worked in metals with greater
                    perfection than in the West. The Christians of Palestine often went to Damascus
                    to purchase arms. At Tripoli in Syria, camlets were manufactured; and, in the
                    same town, as well as in several of the cities of Greece, there were a great
                    number of trades connected with the preparation and manufacture of silk. All
                    this could not escape the observation of the merchants and pilgrims who visited
                    the East. We find, in fact, that, about the middle of the twelfth century, Roger
                    II. king of Sicily, caused several of these artisans to be brought over to
                    Palermo; that this was the result of an expedition to the coasts of Greece; that
                    the mulberry tree throve in the fine climate of Italy as well as in that of the
                    Morea; and that the Sicilians soon surpassed the Greeks in this valuable species
                    of industry. Several useful inventions were also derived from the East; among
                    which wind-mills have been mentioned. Tyre was then renowned for its glass ware,
                    which the fine sand in the neighbourhood enabled its workmen to bring to a
                    degree of perfection unknown in other countries; and to this place the Venetians
                    were indebted for instruction in an art in which they afterwards greatly
                    excelled. It is probable, also, that the Greek fire suggested the idea of
                    gunpowder, and ultimately led to the important invention which has immortalized
                    the name of Berthold Schwartz. During the fourth crusade, Boniface of Montferrat
                    sent maize and wheat from Turkey to Italy; the plum of Damascus was imported by
                    a duke of Anjou, who had visited Jerusalem; our gardens owe to the holy wars the
                    ranunculus, so dear to the Orientals, and the echallotes, which derive their
                    name from Askalon; and the knowledge or rather the use of saffron, of alum, and
                    of indigo, is also due to the crusades. In the territory of Tripoli in Syria,
                    the crusaders beheld, for the first time, the sugar cane, which was transported
                    to Sicily about the middle of the twelfth century, and thence passed into other
                    countries. It was transferred by the Spaniards to Madeira, whence it is supposed
                    to have been carried, at a subsequent period, to the New World. Natural history,
                    which is connected with the progress of industry and agriculture, was enriched
                    with some useful discoveries during the crusades. The productions of distant
                    climates were exchanged; and Europe acquired a knowledge of several animals
                    peculiar to Africa and Asia.</p>
                <p>4. Architecture was also greatly improved. The sight of the monuments and superb
                    edifices of the East excited wonder, and awakened a spirit of emulation. Nothing
                    could equal the astonishment of the crusaders when they first beheld the city of
                    Constantine. Foucher de Chartres exclaimed in his enthusiasm, “Oh, que
                    Constantinople est une belle et vaste cité and the French knights, on viewing
                    the magnificent towers and superb palaces of Byzantium, could scarcely persuade
                    themselves, “que si riche ville pust être en tout le monde.” These no doubt were
                    the feelings produced by novelty and surprise; but they soon gave place to a
                    desire to imitate the fabrics which had excited so much admiration. Italy, in
                    particular, profited much by the classical masterpieces of Greece, which served
                    as models; whilst the wealth acquired by commerce enabled the inhabitants to
                    indulge their taste for the embellishment of their cities. With the exception of
                    architecture, however, the fine arts owed little to the frequent intercourse
                    with the East. Painting was despised by the Mosleminö, who were forbidden by the
                    Koran to make any image of man or beast; and the Latins, after the capture of
                    Constantinople, destroyed the greater part of the monuments erected by the
                    genius of sculpture, converting into coin some of the masterpieces of Phidias
                    and Praxiteles. The Orientals had no music, and Greece had long lost the secret
                    of those melodious strains which, in the time of Linus and Orpheus, were fabled
                    to have tamed savage beasts, charmed Rhodope, and led captive the woods of
                    Maenalus. The history of this art, therefore, has but little relation to the
                    holy wars.</p>
                <p>5. The science which derived most improvement from these distant expeditions was
                    unquestionably that of geography. Before the crusades, this science was
                    altogether unknown. Countries the least remote had no communication with one
                    another. Burgundy was scarcely known in Paris, or Paris in Burgundy. The
                    crusaders who followed Peter the Hermit were ignorant of the names of the towns
                    which they passed through in Germany and Hungary. They experienced a defeat at
                    Merseburg; but the contemporary chroniclers, unacquainted with the name of the
                    place, content themselves with calling it <hi rend="italic">Malkvilk,ox</hi> the
                    city of misfortune. But if the Franks scarcely knew their own country, what must
                    have been their ignorance of the countries of the East? It was so great indeed
                    that they were under the necessity of hiring guides among the Greeks, whom they
                    distrusted, and of committing the fate of expeditions to conductors by whom they
                    were often deceived and abandoned. Several armies, in fact, perished from not
                    knowing· the places to which they were conducted by victory. The greater part of
                    the chroniclers were as ignorant as the crusaders; and hence it is difficult to
                    follow their details respecting Asia Minor, Egypt, and Syria. Of more than two
                    hundred who speak of Egypt, not one makes the least mention of the pyramids.
                    James ofVitry, who had sojourned long in Palestine, and who appears to have
                    possessed all the knowledge of his time, repeats, in his description of the
                    East, the fables of the Amazons and the Phoenix. And Joinville, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> tells us gravely that the trees of the terrestrial
                    paradise produced cinnamon, ginger, and cloves, and that these spices were
                    fished out of the waters of the Nile, to which they were carried by the winds.
                    In a word, the crusaders, continually occupied with fighting, had neither time
                    nor inclination to study the countries conquered by their arms. But in their
                    train religion and commerce, guided, the one by a desire to spread the gospel,
                    and the other by the hope of amassing riches, opened some new routes, and
                    collected much useful information respecting the East. Missionaries<pb

                    court of Rome also traversed the most extensive regions of Asia; and the
                    relations of Rubruquis, Asselin, Carpin, and Marco Paolo contain observations,
                    the truth and accuracy of which have since been fully confirmed. At the same
                    time, the geographical charts of this period exhibit neither the configuration
                    of the globe, nor the extent of countries, nor the position and boundaries of
                    states; they are limited merely to tracing, by vague designations, what struck
                    the majority of travellers, as, for example, the curiosities of each country,
                    animals, edifices, and men differently dressed. Maps were equally rude. They
                    wanted the four cardinal points, whilst on the four sides were sometimes
                    inscribed the names of the principal winds; Jerusalem was placed in the centre
                    of the three parts of the known world, and around it were grouped the cities of
                    Palestine, Syria, and Egypt, whilst distances were marked without the least
                    regard to accuracy. In short, geography was still in its infancy; but, from the
                    impulse given by the crusades, it soon made considerable progress; and, in the
                    fourteenth century, the countries of the East were much better known.</p>
                <p>If the crusaders had profited by the knowledge of the Orientals, some of the
                    sciences most useful to man, such as medicine, might also have been improved. In
                    medicine particularly the Arabians had more positive knowledge than the Latins.
                    At the siege of Ptolemais, Saladin sent his physicians to Richard; but we do not
                    learn that Richard sent his to Saladin when the soldan fell sick. In the first
                    crusade of St Louis, the physicians who accompanied the army understood nothing
                    of the ravages which scurvy and the ordinary epidemic diseases committed in the
                    Christian camp; and their ignorance was not less fatal than the contagion.
                    Nevertheless, the East furnished some processes and remedies from which medicine
                    long derived very great advantage. Cassia and senna came from Asia, and were
                    known in the West at the epoch of the crusades. Treacle, which had so
                    distinguished a place assigned it in the medicine of the middle ages, was
                    brought from Antioch to Venice. And Robert of Normandy, returning from the Holy
                    Land after the capture of Jerusalem, obtained from the school of Salerno a
                    collection of those precepts of health which have since become proverbs amongst
                    all the nations of Europe. Nevertheless, the discoveries and the knowledge of
                    the Orientals in the healing art served in no material degree to enlighten the
                    West; and it may with truth be said that more new diseases than new remedies
                    were imported from the East during the holy wars. Amongst these may be mentioned
                    numerous leprosies, which, for a considerable time, committed great ravages, and
                    at length disappeared, without the aid of medicine.</p>
                <p>6. The crusades contributed in several ways to advance the cause of learning.
                    They established relations, which were never wholly interrupted, between the
                    cities of Italy and the empire of Byzantium; and some sparks of the genius of
                    the Greeks irradiated Italy even before the taking of Constantinople by the
                    Turks. A college of young Greeks was established at Paris during the reign of
                    Philip Augustus; and, in the thirteenth century, flourished the Universities of
                    Bologna, Paris, and Salamanca, where the Greek tongue was taught, and latterly
                    the Oriental languages, (conformably to a decree of the council of Vienna. When
                    the Turks became masters of Constantinople, the learned, exiled from their own
                    country, established themselves in Italy, where the Greek were, so to speak,
                    married to the Latin muses. The venerable interpreters of antiquity were
                    everywhere cordially received, and the communication of their knowledge repaid
                    the attentions of a generous hospitality. About the same time printing was
                    discovered, and employed to preserve the literary treasures derived from the
                    East against the accidents of time, the fury of war, or the hand of barbarism.
                    The Iliad and the Odyssey found readers in the scenes which had inspired the
                    Aeneid; the orations of Demosthenes were perused amidst the ruins of the forum,
                    where still lingered the echo of the voice of Cicero; the genius of the
                    Italians, inspired by the great works of ancient Greek and Roman art, produced
                    new masterpieces; and Italy presented a phenomenon which the world will never
                    again perhaps behold, —that of a nation which, in the space of a few centuries,
                    had twice obtained the palm of literature in two different languages. It is to
                    Constantinople that we are indebted for the philosophy of Aristotle; but whether
                    or not the friends of real knowledge ought to felicitate themselves on this boon
                    seems exceedingly doubtful. Aristotle had disciples, partisans, even martyrs;
                    and the authority of the Bible itself could scarcely compete with that of the
                    philosopher of Stagyra. Reason was studied, not in the mind of man, but in the
                    dogmas laid down in a book; and the laws of the universe were not investigated
                    by induction, but sought for in Aristotle. The schools also exhibited a species
                    of intellectual fencing or gladiatorship. In an age when every thing was decided
                    by violence, the mind even desired to indulge in a species of warfare; and as,
                    in ordinary affairs, victory constituted justice, so, in the schools, it passed
                    for reason. It may be supposed that this disputatious philosophy was little
                    favourable to the advancement of real knowledge; but, on the other hand, whilst
                    it exercised the faculties of men, it contributed to their development; and if
                    it for a season misdirected the human mind, it certainly did not retard its
                    advancement. In the early stages of society, it is not the misdirection of the
                    mind, but its inactivity, which tends to keep nations in the darkness of
                    barbarism.</p>
                <p>7. Among the productions of the human mind, the first place is due to those which
                    have for their object to preserve the memory of past events. In all the epochs
                    of the middle ages, there appeared chronicles in which facts of importance to
                    history were recorded, with greater or less fidelity. In several monasteries
                    there were kept registers or journals, in which every remarkable occurrence was
                    inscribed; and the monks sometimes communicated these registers at their general
                    assemblies, in the view of rendering their chronicles more complete. The old
                    chroniclers were simple and pious men, who regarded the slightest falsehood as a
                    mortal sin, and sometimes scrupled to tell the truth, even when they knew it, if
                    a shadow of doubt crossed their minds». The greater part would have thought
                    themselves wanting in their duties as historians, if they had not ascended to
                    the creation of the world, or at least to the deluge. Amongst the events which
                    they relate, they never forget those which are calculated to strike the vulgar,
                    and which indeed made a strong impression upon themselves, such as revolutions
                    of nature, famines, and prodigies. But we are at the same time sensibly touched
                    by their simplicity, and interested by their naïveté; and when they speak of
                    marvellous occurrences, which were believed in their time, and of the reality of
                    which they themselves seem fully persuaded, they only delineate their own
                    character, and that of the age in which they lived. Further, it wpuld be a great
                    error to imagine that the Oriental chronicles of the same period are in any
                    degree superior to those which we have been endeavouring to describe. On the
                    contrary, they exhibit the same spirit of superstition and credulity which
                    appears in the chronicles of the West, united with that belief in fatalism which
                    characterizes the Mahommedan religion, and with a degree of negligence or
                    caution which deprives these productions of all individual interest. The
                    chronicles of the middle ages, therefore, have nothing to envy in those of the
                    East. The greater part, it is true, are extremely<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194753720" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3720-0496"/> dry, and destitute alike of
                    precision and method; but there are several which appear to be not altogether
                    unworthy of the attention of historians. Among these may be mentioned William of
                    Tyre, who may be styled the Livy of the crusades; Albert of Aix; Baudry,
                    archbishop of Doi; Odon of Deuil; James of Vitry, whose lively and animated
                    descriptions are clothed in a style at once rapid and flowery, and whose
                    narrative is almost always elegant; and, lastly, Ville-Hardouin and Joinville,
                    who wrote in the French language, and whose works constitute the earliest
                    monuments of French literature.</p>
                <p>8. The muse of the troubadours celebrated chivalry, love, and beauty; that of the
                    trouveurs, who inhabited the banks of the Loire, and the provinces situated
                    beyond that river, delighted in graver strains. The trouveurs had rivals both in
                    England and in Germany. Those poetshad created for themselves a new and heroic
                    world, which inspired their lofty lays. They celebrated the high feats of
                    Arthur, Renaud, the knights of the round table, Charlemagne, Rolland, and the
                    twelve peers of France; and to these names they added those of Godefroy,
                    Tancred, Richard, and Saladin, whose names possessed a lively interest for all
                    the Christian nations of the middle ages. But these chivalric strains soon gave
                    place to wilder and bolder creations, into which the marvellous entered as a
                    predominant ingredient. The traditions of the North were blended with those of
                    the' South, and produced a semi-barbarous mythology, which, in its composite
                    form, had nothing in common with the gay and gorgeous mythology of Greece. But
                    the labours, the perils, and the exploits of a religious war, carried on at a
                    great distance, like that of the crusades, gave a nobler direction to the
                    imagination of poets, and effectually guarded them against whatever was common
                    or extravagant in the romanesque conceptions of a rude age. Hence arose a
                    literature adapted to a new state of society: and if this literature, which had
                    impressed upon it a strong character of national originality, had produced such
                    masterpieces as the Iliad and the Odyssey, the muses would have entered upon a
                    career unknown to the ancients; the language would have been enriched, improved,
                    and fixed; and history would have spoken of the age of the crusades as it now
                    speaks of that of Pericles and Augustus. But the greater part of the poets and
                    romancers of this epoch, having no models upon which to form themselves, and
                    wanting the taste necessary to guide them, could discover no other means of
                    interesting their readers, than by exaggerating tlìe sentiments of chivalry.
                    Imitation, pushed to the extreme, was mistaken for reality; and there were
                    knights, like the hero of Cervantes, who wished to put in practice what they had
                    read in poems and romances. This was the origin of knight-errantry; a practical
                    caricature of chivalry, which, by bringing it into contempt, exposed it to
                    ridicule, and thus sealed the doom of an institution which, with all its
                    follies, absurdities, and vices, has conferred essential benefits upon mankind.
                    The romances which were consecrated to -chivalry and the crusades, underwent
                    modifications conformable to those which the manners and usages of society had
                    received; and literature took its tone from the spirit of the time, and in its
                    turn re-acted upon the state of society which had originally imparted to it its
                    peculiar direction and character.</p>
                <p>Little more remains to be said as to the results of the crusades. To appreciate
                    the advantages which they produced, it is only necessary to consider what would
                    in all probability have occurred if these expeditions had not taken place. In
                    the eleventh century several countries of Europe were invaded, and others were
                    menaced by the Saracens. That remarkable race were then in the full career of
                    victory and conquest; while the Christian states, distracted by discord, a prey
                    to anarchy, and plunged in barbarism, were destitute of all means of defence.
                    If, then, Christendom had not, as it were, gone out by all her gates to attack
                    this formidable enemy, and, at different times, poured forth fresh multitudes of
                    assailants, impelled by a fierce enthusiasm, this enemy, profiting by the
                    inaction of the Christian nations, would have surprised them in the midst of
                    their divisions, and subjugated them one after another to its sway. France,
                    Germany, England, and Italy, might have experienced the fate of Greece and of
                    Palestine, and the crescent might have been elevated in triumph above the
                    shivered fragments of the cross. The crusades, as we have already remarked,&gt;
                    presented the spectacle of a fierce and sanguinary contest between two religions
                    contending for the empire of the world. Butin this formidable struggle, the real
                    means of defence consisted in superiority of knowledge, civilization, and social
                    qualities. As long as ignorance and barbarism prevailed among the nations of the
                    West, as well as among those of Asia, the victory remained uncertain; but when
                    Europe beheld the dawn of civilization, it then knew security, and its enemies
                    also began to know fear. The Mahominedan religion, by its doctrine of fatalism,
                    taught its disciples to despise the calculations of prudence, and in the day of
                    calamity served to depress rather than to elevate the courage of its warriors.
                    The Christians, on the contrary, lost none of their faculties in their reverses,
                    which often served to redouble their energy and their activity; and the defeats
                    experienced by their armies in Asia excited, even more than their victories, the
                    enthusiasm of the warlike population of Europe. Thus Christianity, and the
                    heroic virtues with which it inspired its disciples in the middle ages, served
                    as an impenetrable buckler to Europe, enabling it to force back the invaders who
                    had long threatened its independence, and to inflict a blow on their power, from
                    which it never afterwards recovered. “On ne peut done nier,” says Michaud, “que
                    les croisades n’aient puissament contribué à sauver les sociétés Européennes de
                    l’invasion des barbares, et ce fut là sans doute le premier et le plus grand de
                    tous les avantages qu’en ait retiré Thumanité.”</p>
