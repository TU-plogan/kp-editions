                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    as-Ca-ritat</hi></label>, Marquis of, a French philosophical, political, and
                    biographical writer, of distinguished eminence, descended from an ancient family
                    in the principality of Orange, and born at Ribemont, in Picardy, in 1743. He
                    received his education at the college of Navarre, where he was distinguished at
                    an early period of life for his strong attachment to the study of physics and
                    mathematics. On his entrance into public life, he established a friendly
                    intercourse with Voltaire, D’Alembert, and other literary characters who
                    professed opinions analogous to his own, and formed a very powerful party among
                    the French literati, whose united efforts to propagate their ideas of religion
                    and politics have been applauded or condemned according to the principles of
                    their different judges. Condorcet first attracted the attention of the public as
                    a mathematician, obtaining their approbation for his treatise on integral
                    calculations, which he composed at the age of twenty-two. In the year 1767 his
                    solution of the problem of the Three Bodies made its appearance, and in the
                    following year the first part of his Essay on Analysis. In the year 1769 he was
                    received as a member of the Academy of Sciences, the memoirs of which were
                    greatly enriched by him with different papers on the most abstruse branches of
                    mathematical science. His justly-merited reputation pointed him out as a fit
                    person to co-operate with D’Alembert and Bossut, in assisting the celebrated
                    minister and able financier Μ. Turgot with arithmetical calculations. In the
                    mean time he laboured indefatigably in the study of politics and metaphysics,
                    and defended, in an anonymous publication, the sect of philosophers to which he
                    had attached himself, from an attack made upon them in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trois Siècles;</hi> and replied to Μ. Necker’s essay on Corn Laws. He was
                    appointed secretary to the Academy of Sciences in the year 1773, when he
                    employed much of his time in writing eulogies on such of its deceased members as
                    Fontenelle had passed over in silence. Condorcet having, like D’Alembert and
                    some others, united in himself the characters of an elegant writer and a man of
                    profound research, was admitted into the French academy in 1783, when he
                    pronounced an oration on the influence of philosophy, which was ordered to be
                    printed. From the time of D’Alembert’s death, which happened this year, he
                    filled the situation of secretary to that academy, rendering his name
                    conspicuous by the publication of eulo-&lt; gies on different eminent
                    characters. His panegyric on D’Alembert, to whom he was most sincerely attached,
                    is a very elaborate performance, and is esteemed as a candid account of the
                    genuine merits of that great philosopher. The encomium he bestowed on Euler
                    furnished him with a favourable opportunity of giving a circumstantial account
                    of the specific improvements and inventions conferred on a peculiar branch of
                    science by the labours of that illustrious individual; a talent which Condorcet
                    appears to have possessed in an eminent degree, and which is of the greatest
                    importance to a biographical writer. His eulogy on the minister Turgot was read
                    with avidity, and admired by all those who approved of Turgot’s plans of
                    government and system of finance. In the year 1787 lie gave to the public his
                    Life of Voltaire, which was highly elaborate, and replete with lofty panegyric,
                    on the merits of which mankind were much divided, according to their sentiments
                    respecting that author’s philosophy. The last of his biographical works was an
                    eulogy on the celebrated Dr Franklin, published in 1790; but all of them will be
                    read with some degree of prejudice by those who are inimical to the school of
                    philosophy to which he belonged.</p>
                <p>The memorable event of the French Revolution, which the writings of Condorcet and
                    his associates unquestionably accelerated, naturally interested his feelings,
                    and called forth his exertions; but the conduct of the political parties and
                    their leaders, during this tumultuous period, is painted in colours so
                    diametrically opposite, that a proper estimate of it is even yet scarcely
                    possible. In this part of Condorcet’s life, therefore, we must confine ourselves
                    to such facts as are universally acknowledged, leaving it to our readers to draw
                    inferences for themselves.</p>
                <p>At an early period he employed his talents to promote those reforms, for such
                    they appeared to his mind, which were to pave the way to a new order of things.
                    A work entitled <hi rend="italic">La Bibliothèque</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’
                    Homme Public,</hi> intended to exhibit an analysis of the writings of the most
                    eminent politicians, was chiefly conducted by him; as was also a newspaper
                    called <hi rend="italic">La Chronique</hi><hi rend="italic">de Paris,</hi>
                    filled with declamation against royalty. He had likewise a share in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal de Paris,</hi> a paper conducted on similar principles.
                    About the time when the king fled to Varennes, he proposed a paper called <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Républicain,</hi> the intention of which is clearly deducible
                    from its title. He was an indefatigable member of the Jacobin club, and spoke
                    frequently, though not forcibly, in that too famous association. He was chosen a
                    representative for Paris when the constituent assembly was dissolved, and
                    followed the general political course of the Brissotine party. A plan for public
                    instruction now exercised his abilities, and he finished it in two elaborate
                    memoirs on the subject, which are allowed to contain some exalted and enlarged
                    ideas, but perhaps rather too extensive to be reduced to practice. He was
                    likewise author of the manifesto addressed to the European powers by the people
                    of France on the approach of a war. He wrote a letter of expostulation to the
                    king while he was president of the assembly, which some have considered as by
                    far too severe, and as destitute of that ceremony to which the sovereign was
                    entitled. When the king was insulted by the populace at the Tuil-Ieries, in
                    being offered the red cap, it is said that he vindicated their proceedings. We
                    are also informed, that whilst he was degrading royalty in this manner, he was
                    secretly soliciting the office of tutor to the Dauphin; a proposition which the
                    king utterly rejected, on account of his avowed infidelity. Attempts have been
                    made to fix upon his character the most abominable ingratitude, by making him
                    accessory to the murder of the Due de la Rochefoucault, to whom he was under the
                    strongest obli-gâtions, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194749989"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-9989-0209"/>and from whose family he had received a most
                    accomplished wife with a large fortune; but it is believed that this calumny
                    originated entirely from the malevolence of party spirit. When the trial of the
                    king came to be agitated, Condorcet gave it as his opinion that he could not be
                    brought to judgment in a legal manner; yet it must be confessed that bis conduct
                    in regard to the sentence was rather of an ambiguous nature, and betrayed that
                    timidity and want of resolution which formed the most prominent feature of his
                    political career. The judgment of Madame Roland concerning the moral
                    constitution of this wonderful man has the air of perfect impartiality. “The
                    genius of Condorcet,” said that lady, “is equal to the comprehension of the
                    greatest truths; but he has no other characteristic besides fear. It may be said
                    of his understanding, combined with his person, that it is a fine essence
                    absorbed in cotton. The timidity which forms the basis of his character, and
                    which he displays even in company, does not result from his frame alone, but
                    seems to be inherent in his soul, and his talents furnish him with no means of
                    subduing it. Thus, after having deduced a principle or demonstrated a fact in
                    the assembly, he would give a vote decidedly opposite, overawed by the thunder
                    of the tribunes, armed with insults, and lavish of menaces. The properest place
                    for him was the secretaryship of the academy. Such men should be employed to
                    write, but never permitted to act.” After the execution of the king, the
                    Girondin party employed him to frame a new constitution, the plan of which was
                    presented to the convention, and obtained their approbation. It was not thus
                    esteemed by the people at large; and it has, perhaps not without reason, been
                    considered as a mass of metaphysical absurdities. During the violent struggle
                    between the Girondin and Mountain parties, Condorcet took no decided part with
                    either; which seems to have been owing to the native timidity of his mind, and
                    his abhorrence of the state of public affairs. He was not comprehended among the
                    number of those who were sacrificed with their leader Brissot; but having
                    employed his pen against the victorious party, he fell under the invincible
                    displeasure of that inhuman and blood-thirsty monster Robespierre, who issued a
                    decree of accusation against him in July 1793. He, however, found means to
                    effect his escape from the arrest, and during nine months concealed himself in
                    Paris. But at length dreading that the tyrant would order a domiciliary visit
                    for the purpose of discovering the place of his retreat, he passed through the
                    barriers without being noticed, and went to the house of a person in whom he
                    confided, on the plain of Mont-Rouge. Unfortunately for Condorcet, however, this
                    friend was at that time in the metropolis; and he was in consequence under the
                    necessity of passing two dreary nights in the open fields, a prey to hunger and
                    to cold. On the third day he obtained an interview with his friend, who
                    unhappily durst not venture to afford him shelter under his roof; so that he was
                    once more compelled to wander in the fields. At length, worn out by hunger and
                    fatigue, and life being no longer supportable without sustenance, he applied at
                    a public house for an omelette, which, as soon as he obtained it, he devoured
                    greedily. His cadaverous appearance and uncommonly keen appetite roused the
                    suspicion of a municipal officer who happened to be present, and by whom he was
                    interrogated; and the ambiguity and hesitation which characterized his answers
                    made the officer conclude that it would be proper to apprehend him. He was
                    accordingly consigned to a dungeon, to be next day conducted to Paris; but his
                    melancholy fate rendered such a measure unnecessary. He was found dead in the
                    morning; and as it was generally understood that he constantly carried with him
                    a dose of poison, to this cause his melancholy exit was ascribed. Thus
                    terminated the career of Condorcet, on the 28th of March 1794, who for many
                    years sustained a brilliant and honourable reputation in the republic of
                    letters. His manners were replete with urbanity, and he was as well qualified to
                    please in company as could be expected in a man who was conceived, whether
                    rightly or not, to be destitute of heart. “La bonté brillait dans ses yeux,”
                    says Grimm, <hi rend="italic">“et</hi> il aurait eu plus de tort qu’aucun autre
                    de n’être pas honnête homme, parce qu’il aurait trompé davantage par sa
                    physionomic, qui annonçait les qualités les plus paisibles et les plus douces.”
                    His character, though not exempt from pride, was always peaceful and obliging.
                    He appeared timid and embarrassed in a numerous circle; but, with his friends,
                    he displayed a gaiety and liveliness quite fascinating, and never made any
                    pretensions to superiority on account of the great extent of his knowledge. He
                    had read a great deal, and his memory was prodigious. Soon after his death
                    appeared his <hi rend="italic">Sketch of an Historical Draught of the Progress
                    of the Human Mind,</hi> a methodical performance, evincing profound research, in
                    which he strongly recommends his favourite idea of gradually bringing human
                    nature to a state of perfection by considering what man has been, now is, and
                    may be. This treatise will no doubt be viewed by some as rather fanciful; but it
                    is clearly the effort of a superior genius, and must be peculiarly interesting,
                    when it is known that it was composed while its author was in circumstances of
                    danger and distress. The idea of man’s progressive advancement towards
                    perfection and happiness inspired him with consolation under his complicated
                    misfortunes. Although he was an enemy to revealed religion, he was certainly a
                    man of virtue and integrity; yet all his philosophy could never inspire him with
                    that heroic fortitude and contempt of death in a just cause, for which the
                    sincere votaries of Christianity have ever been conspicuous.</p>
                <p>An uniform edition of the works of Condorcet was printed at Paris in 1804, and
