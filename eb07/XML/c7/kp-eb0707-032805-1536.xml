                    rend="italic">Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">Suber,</hi> Lin.</p>
                <p>In order to take off the bark, an incision is made from the top to the bottom of
                    the tree, and at each extremity another round the tree, perpendicular to the
                    first. When the tree is fifteen years old, it may be barked for eight years
                    successively; and the quality of the bark improves with the age of the tree.
                    When stripped from the tree, which does not therefore die, the bark is piled up
                    in a pond or ditch, and loaded with heavy stones to flatten it, and reduce it
                    into a tabular form. It is then removed to be dried; and when sufficiently dry,
                    put in bales for carriage. If care be not taken to strip the bark, it splits and
                    peels of itself, being pushed up by another bark formed underneath.</p>
                <p>The cork tree, and the uses to which the bark may be applied, were known both to
                    the Greeks and Romans. Pliny informs us that the Romans employed it to stop all
                    kinds of vessels; but the use of it for this purpose does not appear to have
                    been common till the invention of glass bottles, of which, according to
                    Professor Beckman, there is no mention before the fifteenth century.</p>
                <p>Other vegetable productions have been sometimes employed instead of cork. The <hi

                    brought to England for the purpose of stopping vessels. The roots of liquorice
                    are applied to the same use, and on this account the plant is much cultivated in
                    Sclavonia, and exported to other countries. A tree called <hi rend="italic"
                    >myssa,</hi> which grows in North America, has been found also to answer as a
                    substitute for cork.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cork</hi><hi rend="italic">Jacket</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Waistcoat</hi>, is an invention of one Dubourg, a gentleman fond of swimming,
                    but subject to the cramp, which led him to consider of some method by which he
                    mig^*enjoy his favourite diversion in safety. The waistcoat is composed of four
                    pieces of cork, two for the breasts and two for the back; each nearly equal in
                    length and breadth to the quarters of a waistcoat without flaps; and the whole
                    is covered with coarse canvass, and provided<pb break="no" facs="nls:194751549"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1549-0329"/> with two holes to put the arms through. There is
                    also a space left between the two back-pieces, and the same betwixt each
                    breast-piece, that they may the more easily fit to the body. Thus the waistcoat
                    is only open before, and may be fastened on the wearer with strings, or buckles
                    and leather straps. This waistcoat does not weigh above twelve ounces, and may
                    be made for an expense of about five or six shillings. Dubourg tried his
                    waistcoat in the Thames, and found that it not only supported him in the water,
                    but that two men could not sink him, though they used their utmost efforts for
                    the purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cork,</hi> the largest and most populous county in Ireland,
                    and the most southern in position, is bounded on the north by the county of
                    Limerick, on the east by those of Tipperary and Waterford, on the south by the
                    Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by the county of Kerry. Its surface comprehends
                    1,769,560 acres, or 2765 square miles. In length it measures eighty-six miles
                    from Crowhead in the west to Youghal in the east; its breadth, measured in a
                    northeastern direction from Baltimore to Charleville, is sixty miles. According
                    to Ptolemy, it was inhabited by the tribes of the Juvernii, the Coriundi, and
                    the Vodii. Before the arrival of the English it was considered as a distinct
                    sovereignty or principality, over which the Macarthys held the chief sway. It
                    was granted by Henry II. to Robert FitzStephen and Milo de Cogan, with the
                    exceptions of the city of Cork and the cantred belonging to the 0stmen of the
                    same city, which the king retained. King John made it shire-ground in 1210, and
                    appointed sheriffs and other local officers for its government. But, during many
                    subsequent years, the royal writs were of but little efficacy in many parts of
                    it, as the great families, the principal of which were the Macarthys, the
                    O’Sullivans, the O’Callaghans, the O’Driscols, the O’Learys, the O’Mahonys, the
                    O’Donovans, the Barrys, the Roches, and the Condons, still virtually commanded
                    the allegiance of the inhabitants. The county is now divided into two ridings,
                    eastern and western, in one or other of which its twenty-two baronies are
                    included as follow: East riding, Barrett’s, Barrymore, Condon’s and
                    Clangibbon’s, Du-hallow, Fermoy, Imokilly, Kerrycurrihy, Kinnalea, Kinna-taloon,
                    Kinsale, East Muskerry, and Orrery and Kilmore; west riding, Bantry, Bere, East
                    and West Carbery (each of which is again subdivided into an eastern and western
                    division), Courcey’s, Ibane and Barryroe, Kinalmeaky, and West Muskerry. The
                    city and liberties of Cork constitute a separate jurisdiction, though included
                    in the east riding. These baronies are subdivided into two hundred and
                    twenty-five parishes, and one part of a parish, the remainder of which is in the
                    county of Waterford. The smallest territorial divisions are denominated
                    ploughlands, a vague i and undefined measure, said by some writers to contain
                    upwards of four hundred English acres.</p>
                <p>The county contains the three dioceses of Cork, Ross, and Cloyne. The first
                    occupies chiefly the central parts of the county; the church of St Finbar’s, in
                    the city of Cork, being the cathedral of the see. Ross lies in the western
                    parts, extending through the baronies of Bantry and Bere, and part of Carbery.
                    Its cathedral, built in the town of Ross, was formerly known by the name of the
                    church of Faughan Ross, from having been founded by St Feaghan, who flourished
                    in the ninth century. The eastern part of the county is occupied by the diocese
                    of Cloyne, the cathedral of which is in the town of the same I name. The
                    wardenship of Youghal, formerly an exempted jurisdiction, was united to the last
                    named of these <unclear cert="high" instant="false" reason="illegible"
                    >dioceses</unclear> in 1639. The see of Cloyne was united to that or Cork in
                    1431, and so continued till 1638. After the restoration it was annexed to those
                    of Cork and Ross, which had been united in 1586, and the three continued to be
                    held in con junction until 1678, when that of Cloyne was separated from the
                    others, and has remained so, the union of Cork and Ross having continued to the
                    present day. According to the new arrangements for the church of Ireland, these
                    three dioceses are to be re-united.</p>
                <p>The surface of this county is very uneven, forming natural basins or protracted
                    valleys, each being the channel of a large river. Those basins have an eastern
                    direction, and are separated from each other by ridges of elevated land, the
                    highest of which are the Bogra Mountains, a vast uncultivated tract of heath and
                    bog, grazed by numerous herds and flocks during the summer. The Kilworth
                    Mountains are in the north of the county, south of which is the basin of the
                    Blackwater, a river which, rising on the confines of Kerry, and flowing eastward
                    through the ’ northern baronies, enters Waterford county, where, changing its
                    direction southwards, its estuary forms the boundary between the two counties,
                    and spreads itself into Youghal Bay. During its course it receives the Alla, the
                    Awbeg (celebrated by Spencer under the name of the Mulla), the Araglin, and the
                    Bride. Few rivers present a greater variety of rich and picturesque scenery. The
                    Lee rises in the small lake of Gougane Barra, sometimes called Lough Lee, and
                    after expanding itself into another lake of larger dimensions named Inchigeela,
                    it flows through the city of Cork, where it becomes navigable for large vessels,
                    and empties itself through a vale of singular beauty into Cork harbour. Its
                    chief branches are the Toone, the Similaire, the Foherish, the Dripsey, the
                    Bride, the Awbeg, and the Glanmire. The Bandon river flows from the Dun-manway
                    Mountains, by Bandon town, into Kinsale harbour; its only tributary stream of
                    any importance is the Brinney. The Arigadeen river passes by Timoleague into
                    Courtmacsherry Bay. The only river of any note which swerves from the eastern
                    direction already noticed is the Illen, which takes a southern direction through
                    the western districts by Skibbereen into Baltimore Bay. The general character of
                    these rivers is rapidity, which, though unfriendly to inland navigation, is
                    singularly favourable to the extension of manufactures, from the multiplicity of
                    mill-sites they form.</p>
                <p>The only lakes worthy of notice are those already mentioned as the sources of the
                    Lee, which claim attention, not from their extent, but from their scenic
                    beauties. Gougane Barra is a very small lake, inclosing a still more diminutive
                    island or peninsula, on which the ruins of a religious cell attributed to St
                    Finbar are still visible. Solitary devotion could not have selected a more
                    appropriate spot. From the base of a steep and rocky mountain bursts forth a
                    most copious spring, the waters of which, thrown back by a rugged eminence at a
                    little distance from their source, form the lake. A little farther is the long
                    narrow lake of Inchigeela, extending nearly three miles, studded with several
                    small islands, and surrounded by mountains of rude grandeur and imposing
                    altitude, which exhibit many varieties of cataract and waterfall. .The loss of
                    the timber which formerly clothed the mountains and islands has considerably
                    diminished the beauties of these lakes.</p>
                <p>The want of the means of inland navigation is in a great degree compensated by
                    the numerous bays and inlets capable of admitting large vessels, with which the
                    coast is indented. Proceeding westwards from Youghal Bay, and passing that of
                    Ballycotton, which, though large, is wholly unsheltered, the fine and capacious
                    inlet of Cork harbour appears, completely landlocked, and capable of
                    accommodating a royal fleet. Its narrow entrance is defended by batteries on
                    each side, and on the great island opposite to its mouth. Spike Island and
                    Hawlbowling Island, within the harbour, are strongly fortified, and used as
                    naval arsenals. Kinsale harbour, though incommoded <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194751562" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1562-0330"/>by a bar at the entrance, has
                    depth enough within for the largest vessels. Cloghnakilty and Castlehaven
                    harbours are fit for smaller vessels only; but Baltimore Bay has deep water, and
                    enjoys the shelter of Cape Clear Island, and several others at its entrance.
                    Crookhaven is narrow, but well sheltered. Dι∣nmanus Bay, though having deep
                    water and good anchorage, is little frequented except by small craft, or during
                    summer, in consequence of its exposure to the western gales. Bantry Bay is
                    large, safe, and commodious for vessels of any size. Within its entrance is Bear
                    island, and much farther inwards Whiddy Island, off which lay the French fleet
                    that attempted an invasion in 179G. The water is deep almost close to the
                    shores, and free from rocks and shoals. Ballydonaghan Bay and Quola⅛h Bay lie
                    near the mouth of Kenmare river. This last-named inlet, though called a river,
                    is an estuary of large dimensions, separating the counties of Cork and Kerry,
                    and capable of accommodating the largest vessels.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable among the numerous islands along the coast, besides those
                    already mentioned, are Inchidony, in Cloghnakilty Bay; Cape Clear, Inisherkin,
                    and Ringa-rona or Donegal Island, in Baltimore Bay; and Dursey’s Island, off the
                    southern point of Bere Barony. Of these, Cape Clear is the largest and most
                    remarkable. It was formerly supposed to be the most southern point of Ireland;
                    but Bro'vhead, near Mizenhead, is now found to have the right to this mark of
                    distinction. The inhabitants of Cape Clear live almost wholly secluded from the
                    world, being governed by a system of unwritten law peculiar to themselves. The
                    island has a small lake near its centre, possessed of the singular quality <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> of purifying any tainted vessels that he for a short
                    time in it.</p>
                <p>The climate of Cork is not so varied as might be supposed in a district so
                    extensive, and of a surface so diversified. Its general character is that of a
                    mean between the extremes of beat and cold. Along the sea coast winter is
                    disarmed of much of its severity by the prevalence of southern winds, which
                    seldom suffer the heaviest snow to lie many hours undissolved, except on the
                    northern sides of high hills; the sea breeze equally tempers the violence of the
                    summer heat. There is also reason to believe that the climate has been
                    materially improved by the felling of the forests and the drainage of the bogs
                    and marshes.</p>
                <p>The geological divisions of the county may be arranged under four heads. The
                    first includes the calcareous districts in the northern parts. These contain
                    extensive beds of marble and limestone, the base of which is unknown. A second
                    vein of limestone extends from the west of Cork city eastwards to Youghal Bay.
                    Coal appears in the north-western extremity of this district, which, from its
                    approaching the surface in many places considerably distant, may be conjectured
                    to be abundant. It is raised in several places, but the disadvantages of
                    situation in mountainous districts remote from water carriage prevent its
                    general use. The second geological division is chiefly contained in the western
                    mountainous districts, but it also comprehends two elevated ranges which inclose
                    the calcareous basin of the Blackwater. The more northern of these contains
                    siliceous breccia with red argillite, none of which is to be found in the
                    southern. The stone of the highest hills on the northern side of Bantry Bay
                    consists chiefly of masses of siliceous grit; and the secondary hills contain a
                    slaty argillite, intermixed with veins of grit. The eastern mountains have a
                    thick covering of clay; those of the west are more bare and rocky. The third
                    division, or redstone district, occupies most of the northern parts that are ņot
                    calcareous, and also the whole of the great elevated tract between the basins of
                    the Lee and the Blackwater. The quarries near Cork supply abundance of stone fit
                    for building, but hard to be worked. The fourth or greystone district includes
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the greater part of the county south of the Lee.
                    It contains several kinds of argillite and of grit, a few veins of calcareous
                    schistus, and a large proportion of slate. The city of Cork, and most parts of
                    the northern districts, are supplied with this article from the numerous
                    quarries along the southern coast. Large masses of quartz, generally inclining
                    to a globular form, and weighing three or four hundredweight, appear frequently
                    on the surface, particularly in Carbery Barony. Near Ross is a very remarkable
                    rock composed entirely of white quartz, the blocks of which are of great size
                    and regular conformation. Bogs of great extent are almost exclusively confined
                    to the mountainous parts; their usual substratum is hard rock or retentive clay.
                    The county contains little of the strong clayey loam so common in England, still
                    less of sandy ground, and no chalk. Iron was formerly raised and smelted in
                    large quantities, until the process was stopped by the exhaustion of the timber
                    used for fuel. Lead, generally combined with quartz, and in small veins, and
                    copper, are of rare occurrence, though there are grounds for conjecturing that
                    this latter metal exists in some of the hills.</p>
                <p>Near the town of Mallow is one of the most celebrated mineral springs in Ireland.
                    It resembles the waters of Bristol in its sensible and operative qualities, and
                    is applied to the same medicinal purposes. Strong chalybeate springs have been
                    discovered at Kanturk and in the neighbourhood of Macroom. St Bartholomew’s
                    well, near the city of Cork, is of a sulphureous quality.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of this county are in general of the middle size, muscular in
                    their limbs, and capable of enduring great fatigue. Instances of men of very
                    large stature and athletic proportions are not uncommon. The O’Driscols, who
                    formerly possessed Cape Clear, are described as being much above the common
                    height. A thigh bone of one of the last members of that family is still to be
                    seen, and, according to the measurements of some scientific persons, must have
                    belonged to a man upwards of seven feet in height. In the labouring classes, the
                    women as well as the men perform their journeys on foot, and seldom seem to be
                    affected by fatigue, though loaded with heavy burdens. Before the general
                    extension of posts, messages were usually corn eyed by foot runners, who
                    executed their missions with surprising speed. Fifty Irish miles a day was
                    considered as no very extraordinary performance for an active footman. It is
                    somewhat remarkable, that though both sexes are equally well-limbed in
                    childhood, the full growm women are seldom well formed in their legs; a
                    circumstance attributable only to their carrying heavy burdens, and to their
                    mode of sitting in a crouching posture in their cabins. When young they are
                    well-looking; but owing to early marriages, frequent child-births, and the smoky
                    state of their dwellings, they soon contract an old and withered look. In their
                    disposition the labouring classes are lively and cheerful; indeed grave or
                    gloomy dispositions are very uncommon. They indulge in sports of every kind,
                    particularly in dancing, in which they move with ease and alacrity, keeping
                    accurate time with the music. Nor are they less remarkable for a continual flow
                    of conversation, even though there be but two persons present. In a convivial
                    party, the difficulty generally is to find a listener. The Irish language still
                    continues to be a common medium of intercourse in many parts; but its use is
                    every year more and more limited to the unfrequented and mountainous
                    districts.</p>
                <p>There is a great intermixture of English blood among the inhabitants. Besides the
                    followers of Strongbow, whose descendants have long ranked among the most
                    influential families, the English settlers were the founders</p>

                <p>of most of the towns. To these succeeded the numerous bands of adventurers whose
                    services were rewarded at different periods with grants of conquered or
                    forfeited lands. With these came many followers, whose intermarriages with the
                    natives gradually instilled into their posterity the manners and prejudices of
                    the natives. The Danes also, who possessed several of the sea-ports and the
                    adjoining districts, increased these international varieties of character. It is
                    said that this people, at no very distant period, had maps of the lands formerly
                    held by them in Ireland, and that they frequently threw in an Irish settlement
                    as part of a daughter’s marriage portion. The easy communication between this
                    county and the Spanish peninsula also led to a commercial intercourse, which,
                    together with the military invasions of the Spaniards during the reigns of the
                    Tudors, has had its due effect in impressing a distinctive character on the
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The population of the county, including that of the city and liberties, was
                    ascertained to be as follows in the several annexed periods :—</p>
                <p>The census of 1821 is the only one of these which can be considered as
                    approximating to accuracy; yet the two others, taken under acts of parliament,
                    though avowedly imperfect, afford sufficient data for inferring a rapid and
                    undeviating increase of population. It has nearly doubled in forty years.</p>
                <p>Previously to the Union, the country returned twenty-six members to parliament;
                    two for the county at large, and two for each of the boroughs of Baltimore,
                    Bandon, Castlemartyr, Charleville, Cloghnakilty, Doneraile, Kinsale, Mallow,
                    Middleton, Rathcormuck, and Youghal. At the Union, the number was reduced to
                    eight; two for the county, two for the city, and one for each of the boroughs of
                    Bandon, Kinsale, Mallow, and Youghal. The reform act has made no change in the
                    representation. The number of freeholders entitled to vote at the county
                    election, before the disfranchisement of the forty-shilling freeholders, was
                    about 6000; by that measure it was reduced to 3100. Under the reform act it
                    amounts to 4020.</p>
                <p>The state of education is as follows, according to the reports of the board of
                    education in 1824-26. There were then 1354 schools, in which somewhat more than
                    69,000 pupils were instructed. Of these, 45,000 were boys and 24,000 girls. Of
                    the whole number, 9494 were of the established church, 58,174 were Roman
                    Catholics, 340 dissenters; and of the remaining 1110, the religious persuasion
                    had not been ascertained. Of the total number, 51,347 paid for their education;
                    and but 17,771 were educated through the contributions of private individuals,
                    or by grants of public money; and of these two latter classes, the one amounted
                    to 15,392, the other only to 5242. The great preponderancy of the Roman Catholic
                    religion may be fairly inferred from the preceding statement. The number of
                    dissenters’ children receiving education is extremely small, and chiefly limited
                    to the city of Cork and ι few of the larger towns.</p>
                <p>In a district of such extent and variety of surface, the state of agriculture
                    must be liable to much variation. The more populous parts near the sea, and in
                    the vicinity of the great lines of communication, exhibit very favourable
                    specimens of agricultural improvement. In the more retired and mountainous
                    distriets, several of which, from the want of well-constructed roads, are still
                    nearly impervious except to the residents, the cultivation of the soil is
                    carried on according to the habits of the past century. Spade cultivation is
                    used to a considerable extent. In the improved parts, limestone and sea-sand arc
                    largely used, where facilities of carriage are to be had. Dairies are much
                    attended to. The character of the Cork butter stands high, both in the British
                    and foreign markets. In several parts fences are made of a high bank, with
                    abroad top, on which furze is sown. This plant, if due attention be paid to it,
                    not only forms an impenetrable hedge, but, by being cut periodically, affords a
                    valuable supply of fuel in the districts remote from a sea-port, and where turf
                    is not easily procurable.</p>
                <p>Manufactures are not earned on to any great extent, notwithstanding the frequent
                    attempts made to establish them. Linen cloth is wrought in some places, but not
                    in much larger quantities than the demands of the surrounding districts require.
                    Sail-cloth is wrought in the liberties of Cork. A factory for the finer kinds of
                    woollen cloth was erected about thirty or forty years ago at Middleton; but it
                    was soon afterwards relinquished, and the buildings converted into a barrack.
                    The woollen manufacture is now confined to frieze and coarse blanketings. An
                    attempt lately made to establish the silk trade, by naturalizing the silk worm,
                    completely failed, after a large portion of land had been planted with mulberry
                    trees for their sustenance. The only extensive manufactures are those of whisky
                    and porter, which cause a considerable demand for the agricultural produce.
                    There are large paper-mills on some of the numerous mill-sites; but the late
                    changes in the excise laws, and the interference of British papermakers whose
                    extensive capital enables them to furnish the article on terms highly
                    advantageous to the purchaser, have rendered this manufacture a very hazardous
                    speculation. The supply of salted provisions for the navy and the West Indies
                    during the late war, was a source of great profit both to the city of Cork,
                    where the business was chiefly carried on, and to the farmers throughout the
                    county. The export, though considerably diminished since the peace, is still of
                    much importance.</p>
                <p>The county abounds in antiquarian relics. Among the most ancient are cromleachs,
                    raths, pillars consisting of a single stone, and sometimes two pillars
                    dissimilar in height, placed at a short distance from each other, and caves in
                    several instances of considerable length. Vaults with low entrances are often
                    found in raths; these also are sometimes of a square form. The remains of
                    ancient monasteries and other ecclesiastical structures are numerous, but none
                    of them is very remarkable. Many examples occur of the relics of very small
                    churches, built of stone without mortar, and totally destitute of architectural
                    ornament. There have been built two round towers in the county; one at Cloyne,
                    the other at Kinneagh. Ruins of military structures are equally common, bearing
                    strong marks, even in their dilapidated condition, of the period in which they
                    were erected. Some few are well preserved, and arc the residences of families of
                    respectability.</p>
                <p>The city of Cork is situated on the river Lee, about eleven miles from its mouth.
                    Though now second only to the metropolis of Ireland in magnitude and importance,
                    it was but lately that it attained so high a situation. Originally it was
                    confined to a swampy island, formed by the diverging branches of the river; from
                    which circumstance it derived its name of Corcagh, which signifies low marshy
                    land. Its commencement is thought to be coeval with that of the bishopric
                    founded by St Finbar in the seventh century. In the ninth century it was walled
                    in by the Danes. At the time of the arrival of the English, and for several
                    centuries afterwards, it consisted merely of a single street, passing through
                    the island from north to south, connected<pb break="no" facs="nls:194751588"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1588-0332"/> by bridges secured by gates, and having a few
                    lanes branching out in an eastern and western direction, together with a suburb
                    on the southern bank of the river. In 1690, it was besieged and taken by the
                    Duke of Marlborough for William III. The Duke of Grafton, a natural son of
                    Charles II. and a volunteer in the besieging army, was killed before the walls.
                    Since that period, the city has increased rapidly in size and wealth, covering
                    not only the island, but extending northwards and southwards over the adjacent
                    mainland. Its increase is chiefly attributable to ^advantageous situation for
                    the provision trade, which was carried on here with great profit during the
                    American and French revolutionary wars. The detached parts of the city have been
                    connected by bridges of elegant construction; the lesser branches of the river,
                    which formed several petty islets, have been arched over, several fine streets
                    erected, and public buildings, both for civil and ecclesiastical purposes,
                    raised on a scale commensurate with the growing prosperity of the place. The
                    exchange, the corn-market, and the court-house, are built according to approved
                    rules of modern architecture. The jails for the county and city are extensive
                    and well arranged. The barracks afford accommodation for 4000 infantry and 1000
                    cavalry. The new market is held in a spacious building, according to the plan of
                    the town market of Liverpool. The ecclesiastical buildings have not kept pace
                    with those just described. The cathedral, dedicated to St Finbar, is a structure
                    of very moderate architectural pretensions, being remarkable chiefly for a tower
                    at its west end supporting a spire of considerable height and of very inelegant
                    form. The principal Roman Catholic place of worship is of large proportions, and
                    highly ornamented in the interior. The situation of the city, in a valley
                    closely surrounded by grounds of considerable elevation, renders it generally
                    gloomy, and very subject to rain and fogs; but its environs are peculiarly
                    beautiful. On the west, the Mardyke Walk extends for a mile along the banks of
                    the Lee; and the roads in other directions towards the Black Rock, Blarney,
                    Glanmire, and, above all, to Cove, exhibit a variety of highly ornamental and
                    picturesque scenery, seldom to be paralleled in the environs of a great
                    city.</p>
                <p>The public institutions are numerous. Of those of a benevolent character, the
                    principal are, the house of industry, founded in the hope of extirpating
                    mendicity; the fever hospital; the asylum for lunatics and for penitent
                    prostitutes; the foundling hospital, and the lying-in hospital; besides several
                    schools, in which corporeal support is combined with intellectual improvement.
                    The most remarkable of these is the blue-coat school. The principal literary
                    association is the Cork Institution, the endowment of which, granted by
                    parliament in 1807, for maintaining lectureships in several branches of science,
                    and for the support of a botanic garden and museum of minerals, has been lately
                    withdrawn. A society of arts was formed in 1815. Besides these, there are
                    libraries and reading-rooms, supported by voluntary subscriptions. In former
                    times, the city was celebrated for several monastic institutions, founded for
                    the double purpose of ascetic devotion and acts of beneficence. Among these were
                    an Augustinian, a Franciscan, and a Dominican friary, and a preceptory of the
                    knights templars.</p>
                <p>The municipal government, according to a charter granted by James I. in 1608, is
                    vested in a corporation, consisting of a mayor, two sheriffs, a board of
                    aidermen, a recorder, and an unlimited number of freemen, who are all entitled
                    to vote at the elections of members of parliament. The number of freemen
                    previously to the passing of the reform act was 1700; since that period it has
                    increased to 3876, of which 2331 are freemen, and 1555 freeholders. The city,
                    including the liberties, occupies a considerable district, covering 45,000
                    acres. It contains fifteen parishes, besides seven parts of parishes, the
                    remaining parts of which are in the county at large. Seven of these parishes are
                    in the city itself, the remainder are spread over the liberties.</p>
                <p>The population of the city and liberties was, in 1821, 100,658, and in 1831,
