                    >Marie-Anne-Charlotte</hi></label>, was born in 1768, at St Saturnin, near Séez,
                    in Normandy, and descended of a noble family. After the events of the 31st May
                    1793, the heads of the republican party of the convention, Guadet, Gensonné,
                    Pétion, and others, having been proscribed by Robespierre, sought refuge in the
                    departments of the Eure and the Calvados, where they hoped to stir up in their
                    favour the numerous population of Normandy. At this time the works of certain
                    popular writers, and particularly those of the Abbé.Raynal, her favourite
                    author, had obliterated from the mind of Charlotte Çorday those lessons of
                    gentleness and resignation which she had imbibed in the peaceful convent where
                    she had been educated; whilst the cause of the refugees, which she now accounted
                    alike honourable and patriotic, the energy and charm of their conversation, and
                    the interest which a generous nature always feels in behalf of men of merit
                    unjustly persecuted, excited beyond measure her ardent imagination. Accordingly,
                    observing that those around her manifested but little desire to inflict
                    vengeance upon the oppressors of her country, she resolved singly to strike a
                    blow which should spread terror and dismay among the ranks of the .triumphant
                    faction. She therefore ’ repaired to Paris, where she at first occupied herself
                    in endeavouring to ascertain the temper of the public mind; and she then managed
                    to get introduced to the gallery of the convention by the Abbé Fauchet, to whom
                    she applied for the purpose, and who soon afterwards ex piated on the scaffold
                    this simple act of complaisance towards an unknown female stranger. At that time
                    the convention resounded with the most violent declamations against the
                    proscribed patriots, and the only question was who should propose to adopt the
                    most furious measures against them. Such vehement invectives against men whose
                    cause she had embraced, redoubled the indignation of Charlotte Corday, and she
                    hesitated no longer about executing the project she had formed. Marat, who of
                    all the conventional deputies had contributed the most publicly to the
                    revolution of the 31st May, had not for several days made his appearance in the
                    assembly. But this extraordinary woman, whose purpose nothing could shake,
                    having discovered his lodging, wrote to him in these terms:— “Citizen, I have
                    just arrived from Caen. Your love for your native place doubtless makes you
                    desirous to learn the events which have occurred in that part of the republic. I
                    shall call at your residence in about an hour;— have the goodness to receive me
                    ;—I will put you in a condition to render a great service to France.” This
                    letter, and a second of a similar description, having remained unanswered, she
                    wrote a third, on the 15th July 1793, in which she spoke of great secrets which
                    she had to reveal, and of personal misfortunes to which she hoped the generous
                    soul of Marat would not be insensible. She followed the bearer of this last
                    billet, and arrived almost as soon as he at the door of the deputy. Two women,
                    who were in the antichamber, refused at first to allow her to enter; but Marat,
                    having gathered from their conversation that it was the person who had
                    repeatedly written to him, ordered her to be admitted. He was then in a
                    bathingtub, being afflicted with a disgusting malady, which had reduced him
                    almost to a state of putrefaction. The conversation commenced as to what was
                    passing in the Calvados, when Marat inquired of his unknown visitor the names of
                    the deputies and administrators who were then at Caen and at Evreux, wrote them
                    down from her dictation, and ended by saying, that in a few days he would cause
                    them all to be guillotined at Paris. This was enough. Without waiting to hear
                    more, she drew a knife which she had concealed under her gown, and buried it to
                    the hilt in the breast of Marat, who, having exclaimed “A moi, ma chère amie !”
                    almost instantly expired. The two women, alarmed by the noise, rushed into the
                    apartment just as the wretch was breathing his last, whilst Corday, still
                    holding the bloody knife in her hand, endeavoured to make her escape. Not daring
                    to lay hold of her, the women overturned some articles of furniture in her way,
                    and shouted out murder. The guard arrived, and the heroic assassin being seized,
                    was immediately handed over to the revolutionary tribunal. But her firmness did
                    not for an instant forsake her. Fouquicr-Tinville attempting to pronounce an
                    eulogy on the murdered terrorist, she interrupted him sharply, declaring that
                    Marat was a monster, w ho well merited his fate. The offence and all its
                    circumstances being not only confessed, but defended by the accused as a
                    meritorious and patriotic act, her doom could not for a moment be doubtful.
                    Still this bloody tribunal, which had so often condemned without evidence or
                    against it, affected to exhaust all the ordinary judicial formalities before
                    pronouncing sentence, and appointed Chauveau-Lagarde to defend the accused. The
                    defence consisted merely of a repetition of the confession which the prisoner
                    herself had previously made, with a striking allusion to the imperturbable
                    tranquillity and sublime abnegation of every personal or selfish consideration
                    exhibited by her almost in the presence of death itsélf, and a hint, which,
                    however, was wholly thrown away, that she might have acted under the influence
                    of some strong mental hallucination. The prisoner gracefully thanked <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194751471" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1471-0323"/> her counsel for
                    the few words he had uttered in her defence, declaring at the same time that the
                    only plea worthy of her was an avowal of the act in which she gloried; and she
                    heard sentence of death pronounced with the same unequalled serenity, and
                    without the least perceptible change either in the colour or the expression of
                    her countenance. The same extraordinary force of character or strength of
                    enthusiasm sustained her in her last moments, and rendered her at once an object
                    of interest, astonishment, and terror. On her way to the guillotine she was
                    assailed, without being in the slightest degree affected, by the bootings of the
                    rabble; and, in presence of the apparatus of death, she stood unmoved, whilst
                    her fine and noble figure seemed to assume a more dignified and imposing
                    attitude. When the executioner proceeded to remove part of her dress, the
                    sentiment of offended mo-. desty was strongly expressed by her features; but as
                    to the life of which she was about to be deprived, it seemed not to cost her a
                    thought, nor to give her an instant’s concern. She was decapitated on the 17th
                    July 1793, at the age of twenty-five. (Couet de Gironville, <hi rend="italic"
