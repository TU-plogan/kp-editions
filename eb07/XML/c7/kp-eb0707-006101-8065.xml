                <p>Is the passage of any substance from the liquid to the so-∣ lid form, in
                    consequence of the abstraction of heat. The conversion of water into ice could
                    not fail to draw the notice of men in all ages. The minute and divided fragments
                    of the same production^ which descend from the clouds in the shape of snow or
                    hail, displayed the various powers of nature. The ancients imagined that water
                    which has lain for ages in a frozen state acquires at last a permanent
                    consolidation. They extended accordingly the name of ice <hi rend="italic"
                    >(%gυ&lt;fraaλoi or crystal}</hi> to the pure and pellucid kind of quartz which
                    often occurs on the sides of lofty mountains, near the boundary of perpetual
                    congelation.</p>
                <p>It was early remarked that melted ice has the lightness and quality of boiled
                    water. In fact, the portion of air combined with ordinary water is discharged in
                    the act of freezing, as well as in that of boiling. Water thus deprived of its
                    air is therefore prepared for a readier congelation. The ancients accordingly,
                    we have seen, always boiled the water which they designed afterwards to cool.
                    Aristotle relates, in his <hi rend="italic">Metcorotogy,</hi> that the fishermen
                    who cast their nets in the Pontine Lake, used to carry in close vessels boiled
                    water, for the purpose of sprinkling the reeds, that these might quickly freeze
                    together, and cease to disturb the fish by their rustling noise. The expulsion
                    of air from water during the progress of congelation, was afterwards fully
                    proved by Mariotte, one of the earliest members of the French Academy of
                    Sciences. If two wine glasses, filled, the one with water from the well, and the
                    other with water recently boiled, be exposed to the frost, the ice of the latter
                    will seem almost uniformly pellucid, while the ice of the former will appear
                    charged with small air-bubbles crowding towards the centre of the mass, to which
                    they arc driven by the advance of the congelation.</p>
                <p>That congelation shoots at angles of 120 degrees, was first observed in the
                    beginning of the seventeenth century by the great Kepler; and this ardent and
                    inventive genius, in an elaborate dissertation, which he printed as a new year’s
                    present, investigated the various forms and modifications of the icy crystals.
                    The subject was next discussed by Des Cartes and Bartholinus, and about a
                    century afterwards resumed by Mairan, and may be considered as a step towards
                    the general theory of crystallography, which has been since reared by the
                    patience and ingenuity of Haüy.</p>
                <p>Other liquids, such as vinegar, dilute mineral acids, weak spirits, and saline
                    solutions, are likewise capable of&lt; being frozen; but they yield an ice
                    distinctly different' from that of pure water, resembling an aggregation rather
                    than an uniform solid, and wanting consistency, strength, and clearness. The
                    frost appears to seize on the water only, and to fill the compound liquid with
                    close spicular shoots, entangling the stronger acid or brine in their
                    interstices. It was a mistake, therefore, to assert that the ice of sea-water is
                    really fresh. In the process of melting, some portion of the brine may probably
                    flow off, but the residue still is always brackish. This fact is even positively
                    stated by the missionary Crantz, in his accurate account of Greenland. The Very
                    intelligent and enterprising navigator Mr Scoresby reckons the specific gra~</p>

                <p>vity of the spongy salt-water ice to be *873, while that of fresh-water ice
                    amounted to ∙937.</p>
                <p>The ancients were altogether unacquainted with artificial congelation, and with
                    any cold, indeed, below that of freezing. The application of nitre to the
                    cooling of water seems, before the close of the sixteenth century, to have
                    suggested to the Italians the experiment of mixing it with snow. A very intense
                    degree of cold was thus generated, capable of converting speedily into solid ice
                    a body of water contained in a smaller vessel immersed in the dissolving
                    mixture. Sanctorio, who may be regarded as the father of modern physics,
                    mentions, in his <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Avicenna,</hi> that he produced
                    the same effect by employing common salt instead of nitre, in the proportion of
                    the third part of the snow, and had repeatedly performed the experiment in the
                    presence of a numerous auditory.</p>
                <p>From Italy this discovery was gradually communicated over the rest of Europe. In
                    the course of the seventeenth century iced creams, fruits, and various
                    confitures, were first produced on the tables of the luxurious. The famous
                    coffeehouse, <hi rend="italic">Procope,</hi> was founded at Paris in 1G6O, by a
                    Florentine of that name, a vender of lemonade, who was very successful in the
                    art of preparing rich ices. Thirty years afterwards the use of such artificial
                    delicacies in that city had become quite common.</p>
                <p>The cold resulting from the addition of saline powders to snow or pounded ice,
                    depends on the powerful attraction of those salts, which restores the frozen
                    mass to its liquid form, and therefore augments its capacity for heat.
                    Fahrenheit fixed the commencement of his thermometrical scale at the temperature
                    of the compound of salt and snow, conceiving it to be the lowest possible; but
                    much lower degrees of cold are now produced. One part of the muriate of soda, or
                    purified common salt, being added to two parts of dry snow or pounded ice, will
                    sink the thermometer five degrees below zero. One part of sal-ammoniac, and two
                    of common salt, joined to five parts of snow, will bring it seven degrees lower;
                    but equal parts of the nitrate of ammonia and common salt, joined to two parts
                    and a half of snow, will depress the thermometer twenty-five degrees below the
                    freezing point.</p>
                <p>Still more intense cold might be produced, if the ingredients were, before their
                    mixture, cooled down to congelation. Thus* five parts of the muriate of lime,
                    added to four parts of snow, will sink the thermometer to forty degrees below
                    the beginning of the scale, or the limit of freezing mercury; and if the muriate
                    of lime were crystallized, the effect would be ten degrees more. The same
                    extreme energy is exerted on adding four parts of dry caustic potash to three
                    parts of snow.</p>
                <p>The mineral acids likewise, in a diluted state, produce similar effects. Two
                    parts of weak sulphuric acid, joined to three of snow, will sink the thermometer
                    to twenty-three degrees below zero. The muriatic and nitric acids, in nearly the
                    same proportions, will depress it from four to seven degrees more.’ By repeating
                    the applications, therefore, a most intense cold may be created; yet, to succeed
                    completely, a skilful manipulation is required. The saline matters should be
                    reduced to a fine powder, and the freezing mixtures should be made in very thin
                    vessels, not larger than will barely hold them. In this way, by successive
                    stages of cooling, Mr Walker once obtained the enormous cold of ninety-one
                    degrees below the commencement of Fahrenheit’s scale.</p>
                <p>The mere evaporation of some very volatile liquids is sufficient to produce
                    excessive cold. Thus, if a thermometer, having its bulb covered with lint, be
                    dipped in the common or sulphuric ether, it will, on exposure to the air, sink
                    perhaps thirty or forty degrees. This effect is augmented under the receiver of
                    an air-pump. If a nar row thin tube of glass, filled with water, and cased on
                    the outside with lint soaked in ether, be suspended above the pump, and the
                    exhaustion quickly made, a cylinder of ice will be formed.</p>
                <p>The same property is manifested in a higher degree by a singular liquid,
                    discovered by Lampadius in 1796, by distilling a mixture of pyrites and
                    charcoal. It was called at first the <hi rend="italic">alcohol of sulphur,</hi>
                    but now more appropriately the <hi rend="italic">sulphuret of carbon.</hi>
                    According to Dr Marcet, who has completed the investigation of its properties, a
                    thermometer having its bulb covered with lint wetted by this liquid, and held in
                    the open air, will sink not fewer than sixty degrees; but if the same experiment
                    be performed within the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, the alcohol of the
                    barometer will even descend to eighty-two degrees below zero. It must be
                    observed, however, that these effects produced by the evaporation of ether, and
                    of the sulphuret of carbon, are quite evanescent, and that the receiver becomes
                    soon charged with their fumes, which then prevent any farther action. Those
                    fumes likewise corrode the valves of the pump, and soon render it quite useless.
                    Neither ether, therefore, nor the sulphuret of carbon, could be applied in
                    practice with any sort of advantage to the production of ice, even on the
                    smallest scale.</p>
                <p>We have now to relate a discovery which will enable human skill to command the
                    refrigerating powers of nature, and, by the help of an adequate machinery, to
                    create cold and produce ice, on a large scale, at all seasons, and in the
                    hottest climates of the globe; but to explain this interesting subject with
                    greater clearness and accuracy, it is requisite to trace the successive advances
                    which conducted to the result. Where a conclusion appears simple, the careless
                    observer is apt to suppose it easily attained; yet, though sound philosophy
                    tends always to simplification, the rare quality of simplicity is scarcely ever
                    the flash of intuition, but the slow fruit of close and patient investigation.
                    In pursuing the researches with his hygrometer, Professor Leslie was early
                    induced to inquire into the condition of the higher atmosphere, and its
                    relations to humidity. He thus detected a fact of great importance in
                    meteorology, and pointing at various ulterior views.</p>
                <p>’ As rarefaction enlarges the capacity of air for heat, so it likewise augments
                    the disposition to hold moisture; at the same time that the removal of the
                    ordinary pressure facilitates the expansion of the liquid matter, and its
                    conversion into a gaseous form. Accordingly, if the hygrometer be suspended
                    within a large receiver, from which a certain portion of air is quickly
                    abstracted, it will sink with rapidity. In summer, the additional dryness thus
                    produced amounts to about fifty hygrometric degrees each time the air has its
                    rarefaction doubled; so that, supposing the operation of exhausting to be
                    performed with expedition, and the residuum reduced to a sixty-fourth part, the
                    hygrometer would mark a descent of 300°. But this effect is only momentary, for
                    the thin air very soon becomes charged with moisture, and, consequently, ceases
                    to act on the wet ball of the hygrometer. The cold, however, excited on the
                    surface of that ball, by such intense evaporation, will have previously frozen
                    the coating.</p>
                <p>The increased power of aqueous solution which air acquires as it grows thinner,
                    being ascertained and carefully investigated, the object was to combine the
                    action of absorbent with the transient dryness produced within a receiver by
                    rarefaction. The sentient ball of the hygrometer being covered with dry salt of
                    tartar, the instrument first indicated increasing dryness, and afterwards, as
                    the rarefaction proceeded, it changed its course, and marked humidity. The same
                    variation of effect nearly was observed<pb break="no" facs="nls:194748091"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-8091-0063"/> when the hygrometer had been wetted as usual with
                    pure water, and a broad saucer containing the mild vegetable alkali was plaeed
                    on the plate of the air-pump. It was thus proved that the action of this impel
                    feet absorbent is soon overpowered by the tendency to vaporization in attenuated
                    air, and that, beyond a certain limit, it surrenders its latent moisture.</p>
                <p>Mr Leslie resolved, therefore, to try the effect of sulphuric acid, whose
                    peculiar energy as an absorbent he had, under other circumstances, already
                    ascertained; but various incidents prevented him, for a considerable time, from
                    resuming his philosophical inquiries. At last he began those projected
                    experiments, and was almost immediately rewarded by the disclosure of a
                    property, the application of which blazed on his fancy. In the month of June
                    1810, having introduced a surface of sulphuric acid under the receiver of an
                    air-pump, he perceived with pleasure that this substance only superadded its
                    peculiar attraction for moisture to the ordinary effects resulting from the
                    progress of exhaustion; and, what was still more important, that it continued to
                    support with undiminished energy the dryness thus created. The attenuated air
                    was not suffered as before to grow charged with humidity; but each portion of
                    that medium, as fast as it became saturated by touching the wet ball of the
                    hygrometer, transported its vapour to the acid, and was thence sent back denuded
                    of the load, and fitted again to renew its attack with fresh vigour. By this
                    perpetual circulation, therefore, between the exhaling and the absorbing
                    surface, the diffuse residuum of air is maintained constantly at the same state
                    of dryness. The sentient ball of the hygrometer, which had been covered with
                    several folds of wetted tissue paper, was observed, at an early stage of the
                    operation, suddenly to lose its blue tint and assume a dull white, while the
                    coloured liquor sprung upwards in the stem, where it continued for the space of
                    a minute stationary, and again slowly subsided. The act of congelation had
                    therefore at this moment taken place, and the paper remained frozen several
                    minutes, till its congealed moisture was entirely dispersed. Pursuing this
                    decisive intimation, the hygrometer was removed, and a watch-glass filled with
                    water substituted in its place. By a few strokes of the pump the whole was
                    converted into a solid cake of ice, which being left in the rare medium,
                    continued to evaporate, and, after the interval of perhaps an hour, totally
                    disappeared. A small cup for holding the water was next adopted, and the whole
                    apparatus gradually enlarged.</p>
                <p>The powers both of vaporization and of absorption be- .ing greatly augmented in
                    the higher temperatures, the; same limit of cold nearly is in all cases attained
                    by a certain measure of exhaustion. When the air has been rarefied 250 times,
                    the utmost that, under such circumstances, can perhaps be effected, the surface
                    of evaporation is cooled down 120 degrees of Fahrenheit in winter, and would
                    probably sink near 200 in summer. Nay, a far less tenuity of the medium, when
                    combined with the action of sulphuric acid, is capable of producing and
                    supporting a very intense cold. If the air be rarefied only 50 times, a
                    depression of temperature will be produced, amounting to 80 or even 100 degrees
                    of Fahrenheit’s scale.</p>
                <p>We are thus enabled, in the hottest weather, to freeze ŗ.a mass of water, and to
                    keep it frozen, till it gradually wastes away, by a continued but invisible
                    process of evaporation. The only thing required is, that the surface of the acid
                    should approach tolerably near to that of the water, and should have a greater
                    extent; for otherwise the moisture would exhale more copiously than it could be
                    transferred and absorbed; and, consequently, the dryness ol the rarefied medium
                    would become reduced, and its evaporating energy essentially impaired. The acid
                    should be poured to the depth perhaps of half an inch, in a broad flat dish,
                    which is covered by a receiver of a form nearly hemispherical; the water exposed
                    to congelation may be contained in a shallow cup, about half the width of the
                    dish, and having its rim supported by a narrow porcelain ring, upheld above the
                    surface of the acid by three slender feet. (See fig. 1 and 2, Plate CLXXIII.) It
                    is of consequence that the water should be insulated as much as possible, or
                    should present only a humid surface to the contact of the surrounding medium;
                    for the dry sides of the cup might receive, from communication with the external
                    air, such accessions of heat as greatly to diminish, if not to counteract, the
                    refrigerating effects of evaporation. This inconvenience, however, is in a great
                    measure obviated, by investing the cup with an outer case at the interval of
                    about half an inch. If both the cup and its case consist of glass, the process
                    of congelation is viewed most completely; yet when they are formed of a bright
                    metal, the effect appears on the whole more striking. But the preferable mode,
                    and that which prevents any waste of the powers of refrigeration, is to expose
                    the water in a pan of porous earthenware. If common water be used, it will
                    evolve air bubbles very copiously as the exhaustion proceeds; in a few minutes,
                    and long before the limit of rarefaction has been attained, the icy spiculae
                    will shoot beautifully through the liquid mass, and entwine it with a
                    reticulated contexture. As the process of congelation goes forward, a new
                    discharge of air from the substance of the water takes place, and marks the
                    regular advances of consolidation; but after the water has all become solid ice,
                    which, unless it exceed the depth of an inch, may generally be effected in less
                    than half an hour, the circle of evaporation and subsequent absorption is still
                    maintained. A minute film of ice, abstracting from the internal mass a redoubled
                    share of heat, passes, by invisible transitions, successively into the state of
                    water and of steam, which, dissolving in the thin ambient air, is conveyed to
                    the acid, where it again assuiŉes the liquid form, and, in the act of
                    combination, likewise surrenders its heat.</p>
                <p>In performing this experiment, the object is generally to seek at first to push
                    the rarefaction as far as the circumstances will admit. But the disposition of
                    the water to fill the receiver with vapour being only in part subdued by the
                    action of the sulphuric acid, a limit is soon opposed to the progress of
                    exhaustion; and the included air can seldom be rarefied above a hundred times,
                    or till its elasticity can support no more than a column of mercury about three
                    tenths of an inch in height. A smaller rarefaction, perhaps from ten times to
                    twenty times, will be found sufficient to support congelation after it has once
                    taken place. The ice then becomes rounded by degrees at the edges, and wastes
                    away insensibly, its surface being incessantly corroded by the play of the
                    ambient air, and the minute exhalations conveyed by an invisible process to the
                    sulphuric acid, which, from its absorbing the vapour, is all the time maintained
                    above the temperature of the apartment. The ice, kept in this way, suffers a
                    very slow consumption; for a lump of it, about a pound in w eight and two inches
                    thick, is sometimes not entirely gone in the space of eight or ten days. During
                    the whole progress of its wasting, the ice still commonly retains an uniform
                    transparent consistence; but, in a more advanced stage, it occasionally betrays
                    a sort of honeycombed appearance, owing to the minute cavities formed by
                    globules of air, set loose in the act of freezing, yet entangled in the mass,
                    and which are afterwards enlarged by the erosion of the solvent medium.</p>
                <p>But almost every practical object is attained through far inferior powers of
                    refrigeration. Water is the most <pb break="no" facs="nls:194748104"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-8104-0064"/>easily frozen, by leaving it, perhaps for the
                    space of an hour, to the slow action of air that has been rarefied only in a
                    very moderate degree. This process meets with less impediment; and the ice
                    formed by it appears likewise more compact, when the water has been already
                    purged of the greater part of its combined air, either by distillation or by
                    long-continued boiling. The water which has undergone such operation should be
                    introduced as quickly as possible into a decanter, and filled up close to the
                    stopper, else it will attract air most greedily, and return nearly to its former
                    state in the course of a few hours.</p>
                <p>The most elegant and instructive mode of effecting artificial congelation, is to
                    perform the process under the transferrer of an air-pump. A thick but clear
                    glass cup being selected, of about two or three inches in diameter, has its lips
                    ground flat, and covered occasionally, though not absolutely shut, with a broad
                    circular lid of plate glass, which is suspended horizontally from a rod passing
                    through a collar of leather (see fig. 6, Plate CLXXIII.) This cup is nearly
                    filled with fresh distilled water, and supported by a slender metallic ring,
                    with glass feet, about an inch above the surface of a body of sulphuric acid,
                    perhaps three quarters of an inch in thickness, and occupying the bottom of a
                    deep glass basin that has a diameter of nearly seven inches. In this state the
                    receiver being adapted, and the lid pressed down to cover the mouth of the cup,
                    the transferrer is screwed to the air-pump, and the rarefaction, under those
                    circumstances, pushed so far as to leave only about the hundred and fiftieth
                    part of a residuum; and the cock being turned to secure that exhaustion, the
                    compound apparatus is then detached from the pump, and removed to some
                    convenient apartment. As long as the cup is covered, the water will remain quite
                    unaltered; but on drawing up the rod half an inch or more, to admit the play of
                    the rare medium, a bundle of spicular ice will, after the lapse perhaps of five
                    minutes, dart suddenly through the whole of the liquid mass; and the
                    consolidation will afterwards descend regularly, thickening the horizontal
                    stratum by insensible gradations, and forming in its progress a beautiful
                    transparent cake. On letting down the cover again, the process of evaporation
                    being now checked or almost entirely stopped, the ice returns slowly into its
                    former liquid condition. In this way the same portion of water may, even at
                    distant intervals of time, be repeatedly congealed and thawed successively
                    twenty or thirty times. During the first operations of freezing, some air is
                    liberated; but this extrication diminishes at each subsequent act; and the ice,
                    free from the smallest specks, resembles a piece of the purest crystal.</p>
                <p>This artificial freezing of water in a cup of glass or metal affords the best
                    opportunity of examining the progress of crystallization. The appearance
                    presented, however, is extremely various. When the frigorifie action is most
                    intense, the congelation sweeps at once over the whole surface of the water,
                    obscuring it like a cloud: but, in general, the process advances more slowly;
                    bundles of spiculae, from different points, sometimes from the centre, though
                    commonly from the sides of the cup, stretching out and spreading by degrees with
                    a sort of feathered texture (see fig. 4). By this combined operation, the
                    surface of the water soon becomes an uniform sheet of ice. Yet the effect is at
                    times singularly varied; the spicular shoots, advancing in different directions,
                    come to inclose, near the middle of the cup, a rectilineal space, which, by
                    unequal though continued encroachment, is reduced to a triangle; and the mass
                    below, being partly frozen, and therefore expanded, the water is gradually
                    squeezed up through the orifice, and forms by congelation a regular pyramid,
                    rising by successive steps; or, if the projecting force be greater, and the hole
                    more contracted, it will dart off like a pillar. The radiating or feathered
                    lines which at first mark the frozen surface are only the edges of very thin
                    plates of ice, implanted at determinate angles, but each parcel composed of
                    parallel planes. This internal formation appears very conspicuous in the
                    congealed mass which has been removed from a metallic cup, before it is entirely
                    consolidated. Sea-water will freeze with almost equal ease, but it forms an
                    incompact ice, like congealed syrup, or what is commonly called <hi
                    rend="italic">water-ice.</hi></p>
                <p>When cups of glass or metal are used, the cold excited at the open surface of the
                    liquid extends its influence gradually downwards. But if the water be exposed in
                    a porous vessel, the process of evaporation, then taking effect on all sides,
                    proceeds with a nearly regular consolidation towards the centre of the mass,
                    thickening rather faster at the bottom, from its proximity to the action of the
                    absorbent, and leaving sometimes a reticulated space near the middle of the
                    upper surface, through which the air, disengage d by the progress of
                    congelation, makes its escape.</p>
                <p>When very feeble powers of refrigeration are employed, a most singular and
                    beautiful appearance is, in course of time, slowly produced. If a pan of porous
                    earthenware, from four to six inches wide, be filled to the utmost with common
                    water till it rise above the lips, and planted above a dish of ten or twelve
                    inches diameter, containing a body of sulphuric acid, and then a broad round
                    receiver placed over it; on reducing the included air to some limit between the
                    twentieth and the fifth part-of its usual density, according to the coldness of
                    the apartment, the liquid mass will, in the space of an hour or two, become
                    entwined with icy shoots, which gradually enlarge and acquire more solidity, but
                    always leave the fabric loose and unfrozen below. The icy crust which covers the
                    rim, now receiving continual accessions from beneath, rises perpendicularly by
                    insensible degrees. From each point on the rough surface of the vessel,
                    filaments of ice, like bundles of spun glass, are protruded, fed by the humidity
                    conveyed through its substance, and forming in their aggregation a fine silvery
                    surface, analogous to that of fibrous gypsum or satin-spar. At the same time,
                    another similar growth, though of less extent, takes place on the under side of
                    the pan, so that continuous icy threads might appear vertically to transpierce
                    the ware. The whole of the bottom becomes likewise covered over with elegant icy
                    foliations (see fig. 5). Twenty or thirty hours may be required to produce those
                    singular effects; but the upper body of ice continues to rise for the space of
                    several days, till it forms a circular wall of near three inches in height,
                    leaving an interior grotto lined with fantastic groups of icicles. In the
                    meanwhile, the exfoliations have disappeared from the under side, and the outer
                    incrustation is reduced, by the absorbing process, to a narrow ring. The icy
                    wall now suffers a regular waste from external erosion, and its fibrous
                    structure becomes rounded and less apparent. Of its altitude, however, it loses
                    but little for some time; and even a deposition of congealed films along its
                    coping or upper edge seems to take place at a certain stage of the process. This
                    curious effect is owing to a circumstance which, as it serves to explain some of
                    the grand productions of nature, particularly the <hi rend="italic">icebergs
                    of</hi> the arctic circle, merits particular attention. The circular margin of
                    the ice, being nearer the action of the sulphuric acid than its inner cavity,
                    must suffer, by direct evaporation, a greater loss of heat; and, consequently,
                    each portion of thin air that rises from the low cavity, being chilled in
                    passing over the colder ledge, must deposit a minute corresponding share of its
                    moisture, which instantly attaches itself and incrusts the ring. Whatever
                    inequalities existed at first in the surface of the ice, will hence continually
                    increase.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194748117" xml:id="kp-eb0707-8117-0065"/>
                <p>Artificial congelation is always most commodiously performed on a large scale.
                    Since the extreme of rarefaction is not wanted, the air-pump employed in the
                    process admits of being considerably simplified, and rendered vastly more
                    expeditious in its operation. Two or three minutes at most will be sufficient
                    for procuring the degree of exhaustion required, and the combined powers of
                    evaporation and absorption will afterwards gradually produce their capital
                    effect. In general, plates of about a foot in diameter should be preferred,
                    which can be connected at pleasure with the main body of the pump. The dish
                    holding the sulphuric acid is nearly as wide as the flat receiver; and a set of
                    evaporating pans belongs to it, of different sizes, from seven to three inches
                    in diameter, which are severally to be used according to circumstances. The
                    largest pan is employed in the cold season, and the smaller ones may be
                    successively taken as the season becomes sultry. On the whole, it is better not
                    to overstrain the operation, and rather to divide the water under different
                    receivers, if unusual powers of refrigeration should be required. As soon as the
                    air is partly extracted from one receiver, the communication is immediately
                    stopped with the barrel of the pump, and the process of exhaustion is repeated
                    on another. In this way, any number of receivers, it is evident, may be
                    connected with the same machine. If we suppose but six of these to be used, the
                    labour of a quarter of an hour will set as many evaporating pans in full action,
                    and may, therefore, in less than an hour afterwards, produce nearly six pounds
                    of solid ice. The waste which the water sustains during this conversion is
                    extremely small, seldom indeed amounting to the fiftieth part of the whole. Nor,
                    till after multiplied repetitions, is the action of the sulphuric acid
                    considerably enfeebled by its aqueous absorption. At first that diminution is
                    hardly perceptible, not being the hundredth part when the acid has acquired as
                    much as the tenth of its weight of water. But such influence gains rapidly, and
                    rises with accelerated progression. When the quantity of moisture absorbed
                    amounts to the fourth part by weight of the acid, the power of supporting cold
                    is diminished by a twentieth; and, after the weights of both these come to be
                    equal, the refrigerating energy is reduced to less than the half. Sulphuric acid
                    is hence capable of effecting the congelation of more than twenty times its
                    weight of water, before it has imbibed near an equal bulk of the liquid, or has
                    lost about the eighth part of its refrigerating power. The acid should then be
                    removed, and concentrated anew by slow distillation.</p>
                <p>When the exhaling and absorbing surfaces are rightly disposed and apportioned,
                    the moderate rarefaction, from twenty to forty times, which is adequate to the
                    freezing of water, may be readily procured by the condensation of steam. In all
                    manufactures where the steam-engine is employed, ice may, therefore, at all
                    times be formed in any quantity, and with very little additional expense. It is
                    only required to bring a narrow pipe from the condensing vessel, and to direct
                    it along a range of receivers, under each of which the water and the acid are
                    severally placed. These receivers, with which the pipe communicates by distinct
                    apertures, may, for the sake of economy, be constructed of cast iron, and
                    adapted with hinges to the rim of a broad shallow dish of the same metal, but
                    lined with lead to hold the acid.</p>
                <p>The combined powers of rarefaction and absorption are capable of generating much
                    greater effects than the mere freezing of water. Such frigorifie energy,
                    however, is at all times sufficient for effecting the congelation of mercury.
                    Accordingly, if mercury, contained in a hollow pear-shaped piece of ice, be
                    suspended by cross threads near a broad surface of sulphuric acid under a
                    receiver; on urging the rarefaction, it will become frozen, and may remain in
                    that solid state for the space of several hours. But this very striking
                    experiment is easily performed without any foreign aid. Having introduced
                    mercury into the large bulb of a thermometer, and attached the tube to the rod
                    of a transferrer, let this be placed over the wide dish containing sulphuric
                    acid, in the midst of which is planted a very small tumbler nearly filled with
                    water. After the included air has been rarefied about fifty times, let the bulb
                    be dipped repeatedly into the very cold but unfrozen water, and again drawn up
                    about an inch; in this way it will become incrusted with successive coats of
                    ice, to the thickness perhaps of the twentieth part of an inch. The water being
                    now removed, the pendant icicle cut away from the bulb, and its surface smoothed
                    by the touch of a warm finger, the transferrer is again replaced, the bulb let
                    down within half an inch of the acid, and the exhaustion pushed to the utmost.
                    When the syphon-gage has come to stand under the tenth of an inch, the icy crust
                    starts into divided fissures, and the mercury, having gradually descended in the
                    tube till it reach its point of congelation, or 39 degrees below zero, sinks by
                    a sudden contraction almost into the cavity of the bulb; and the apparatus being
                    then removed and the ball broken, the metal appears a solid shining mass, that
                    will bear the stroke of a hammer.</p>
                <p>But a still greater degree of cold may be created, by applying the same process
                    likewise to cool the atmosphere which encircles the apparatus itself. A glass
                    matrass was blown nearly of a hemispherical shape, its bottom quite flat, and
                    about three inches in diameter, and its neck about half an inch wide and cut
                    square over. The whole was covered with a coat of patent lint, which takes up
                    water very copiously. A portion of sulphuric acid was next introduced, forming a
                    layer of perhaps a quarter of an inch thick; and a spirit of wine thermometer,
                    having its bulb also cased with wetted lint, was then inserted within the
                    matrass, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> brass ring attached to the tube securing it in
                    the right position. Things being thus arranged, the matrass or flat bottle, with
                    its thermometer, was placed on a slender stool with glass feet, about an inch
                    above the sulphuric acid in the broad basin, and the large receiver luted over
                    it. The air was then partly extracted, till the gage came below one inch. In a
                    few minutes the lint was frozen entirely, and looked white. After an interval of
                    a quarter of an hour, to allow time for the evaporation of that icy coat to cool
                    down the interior apparatus, the pump was again urged, and the exhaustion pushed
                    to about three tenths of an inch. In a short while the inclosed thermometer sunk
                    not fewer than 180 degrees, and remained stationary till the ice had wasted
                    away.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, therefore, that the refrigerating powers could be pushed still
                    further by a judicious combination of the apparatus. An idea of the mode of
                    proceeding may be formed from the inspection of figure 8. It would be easy to
                    show that the maximum effect is obtained, wdιen the dimensions of the successive
                    cases rise in a geometrical progression. The action, however, is not doubled for
                    each additional case, but increased rather more than one half.</p>
                <p>» These plans are difficult in the execution, and, though they enlarge our
                    conceptions of the extent of the descending scale of heat, yet they furnish
                    merely speculative results. A very important practical improvement has been
                    lately made in the process of artificial congelation. Sulphuric acid is
                    certainly a cheap and most powerful agent of absorption; but the danger in using
                    such a corrosive liquid, especially by unskilful persons, formed always a
                    serious obstacle to its general adoption. Mr Leslie had <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194748130" xml:id="kp-eb0707-8130-0066"/>early noticed the remarkable
                    absorbent quality of our mouldering whinstone or porphyritic trap; and in April
                    1817 he substituted that material, grossly pounded and dried before a kitchen
                    fire, instead of sulphuric acid, and actually froze a body of water with great
                    facility. This earth will attract the fiftieth part of its weight of moisture
                    before its absorbent power is reduced to the one half, and is hence capable of
                    freezing the sixth part of its weight of water. It may be repeatedly dried, and
                    will, after each operation, act with the same energy as at first.</p>
                <p>But an absorbent still more convenient and powerful afterwards occurred to Mr
                    Leslie; namely, <hi rend="italic">parched oatmeal.</hi> With a body of oatmeal
                    of a foot in diameter, and rather more than an inch deep, he froze a pound and a
                    quarter of water, contained in a hemispherical porous cup. The meal is easily
                    dried and restored again to its action. In a hot climate the exposure to the sun
                    alone might prove sufficient. By the help of this simple material, therefore,
                    ice may easily and safely be produced in any climate, and even at sea.</p>
                <p>Otlíer substances could no doubt be employed as absorbents. But, except the
                    muriate of lime, or what is called the <hi rend="italic">oil of salt</hi>
                    desiccated, none hold out any prospect of success. Dried common salt will barely
                    effect congelation; and stucco, or the sulphate of lime, deprived of its water
                    of crystallization, which might seem to promise a powerful absorption, has
                    scarcely any efficacy whatever. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.)</hi></p>
                <p>EXPLANATION OF PLATE CLXXIΠ.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1 represents a large air-pump intended for the purpose of freezing water,
                    consisting of six receivers, each of them having a broad glass saucer for
                    holding sulphuric acid, and a small porous earthen cup containing the water.</p>
                <p>Fig. 2, a section of the above, showing the communication between the receivers
                    and the body of the pump.</p>
                <p>Fig. 3, the lever key for opening and shutting the cocks.</p>
                <p>Fig. 4, the more ordinary appearance of the surface of the water in the porous
                    cup, at the moment when the act of congelation begins.</p>
                <p>Fig. 5, the very singular kind of ice, striated, columnar, and cavernous, which,
                    under a slight rarefaction, but in cold weather, rises slowly and changes its
                    form by degrees, while part of the remaining water is drawn through the
                    substance of the cup, and covers the outside with a thick icy collar above those
                    irregular foliations.</p>
                <p>Fig. 6 represents an elegant mode of almost instantaneously freezing within a
                    transferrer. Above the saucer of the sulphuric acid is placed a glass cup
                    holding water, and the air having been previously exhausted, and the instrument
                    detached from the pump, on pulling up the rod, the water, now left exposed to
                    the most powerful evaporation, quickly runs into spicular ice, which gradually
                    increases and consolidates into a pure transparent mass. The lid being let down
                    again upon the glass cup, the action ceases, and the ice returns slowly to the
                    state of water.</p>
                <p>Fig. 7, a refrigeratory for cooling water at all times to a moderate degree,
                    without the operation of an air-pump; a body of sulphuric acid lying at the
                    bottom of the pan, while a porous vessel containing water is set in the centre
                    of the refrigeratory, and the air is confined about it by replacing the lid.</p>
                <p>Fig. 8 exhibits a system of vessels for producing spontaneously great cold. It
                    consists of a series of leaden or pewter vessels, placed one within the other,
                    and whose surfaces form a descending geometrical progression, being covered
                    externally with soft wet lint, and holding each of them a portion of sulphuric
                    acid. The powerful evaporation maintained by this arrangement causes the
                    interior vessels to become successively colder, and thus augments by a repeated
                    multiplication the final effect. Placed under the receiver of the air-pump, this
                    system of evaporating vessels, with no very high degree of exhaustion, and at
                    all seasons, excites ultimately the most intense cold yet produced, far
                    exceeding what is required for the congelation of mercury.</p>
