                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    a profound and ingenious theoretical mechanic and natural philosopher, descended
                    from a distinguished family of Montpellier, was born at Angoulême, on the 14th
                    of June 1736. At an early period 'of his life he felt a strong preference for
                    mathematical studies, and would gladly have devoted his whole attention to the
                    pursuit of science; but he found it more convenient to enter the military
                    profession as an engineer. This department, however, afforded him ample scope
                    for <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752797" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2797-0425"/>the
                    exercise of his powers of observation and calculation; and. after having been
                    ordered on service to America, and remaining abroad nine years, with some injury
                    to his health, he presented to the Academy of Sciences, in 1773, a memoir on
                    cohesion, and on the resistance of various works of masonry, which, for the
                    accuracy and originality of the views it exhibits, for the clearness and
                    neatness of the demonstrations, and for the practical utility of the results, is
                    fully equal to any of his later productions, and shows a mind still in the
                    vigour of youth, and yet matured by the approach of middle age. The academy paid
                    him the compliment of making him one of its correspondents; and in 1779 he had
                    the satisfaction of sharing, with the laborious Van Swinden, the prize proposed
                    for improvements in the construction of compasses. He resided for some time at
                    Rochefort, where he had abundant opportunity of prosecuting, in the naval
                    arsenal, his experimental researches on friction, which obtained him in 1781 the
                    double prize for the theory of the effects of simple machines. In the same year
                    he had the good fortune to be stationed permanently at Paris, and becoming a
                    member of the academy, he devoted himself entirely to the investigation of the
                    laws of electricity and magnetism, and of the force of frictions and resistances
                    of various kinds. He is generally supposed to have been the first who proved, by
                    direct experiments, the law of the decrease of electrical and magnetic forces in
                    the proportion of the squares of the distances; but it must not be forgotten
                    that the late Lord Stanhope had published an experiment five years before the
                    date of Μ. Coulomb’s researches, which sufficiently established this law with
                    respect to electricity; although the extension of the same law to the operation
                    of magnetism appears to belong exclusively to M. Coulomb. He continued to occupy
                    himself in these researches till the time of the revolution, when he was
                    expelled from Paris by the decree which banished all the nobility; having before
                    given up the appointment of intendant-general of fountains, and having otherwise
                    very materially suffered in his property. He retired with his friend Borda to a
                    small estate which he possessed at Blois; and during his residence there, made
                    some observations on vegetable physiology, which he afterwards presented to the
                    Institute.</p>
                <p>He was recalled to Paris in order to take part in the new determination of
                    weights and measures, which had been decreed by the revolutionary government. He
                    returned,soon afterwards, into the country, wishing to devote himself to the
                    care of his family, and of the remains of his little fortune. But upon the
                    establishment of the National Institute, he again became an inhabitant of the
                    metropolis. He had, however, occasion to undertake a tour of considerable
                    extent, in discharging the duty of an inspector of public instruction; and he
                    was remarked, in his examinations of the young students, for the singular good
                    nature and paternal tenderness of his manners. He still continued his
                    application to his favourite pursuits, and in particular to the investigation of
                    the magnitude of forces of various kinds, by means of the principles of torsion.
                    And his last study was an inquiry respecting the universal diffusion of the
                    magnetic power through nature, which he at first supposed to be almost
                    unlimited; although he afterwards found reason to conclude, that its general
                    cause was the presence of a minute quantity of iron. A short summary of his
                    numerous and elaborate memoirs will best illustrate the extent and accuracy of
                    his researches.</p>

                    Elr.</hi> vii. 1773, p. 343. The fluxional modes of ascertain-I ing maxima and
                    minima are applied, in this admirable memoir, to the determination of the
                    strength of blocks of stone, and of pillars of masonry, and to that of the
                    resistance of semifluids, and the thrust of earth. The author’s manner of
                    considering the subject was at that time new; it has been still further extended
                    by some subsequent researches in this country (Hutton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mathematical Dictionary,</hi> article <hi rend="italic">Pressure')</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and many of the calculations contained in the articles <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bridge</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Carpentry</hi> of this
                    work are principally founded on the same basis. M. Coulomb very properly objects
                    to Musschenbroeck’s mode of representing columns as exerting their passive
                    strength like bars resisting flexure; and it is surprising that Μ. Lagrange did
                    not profit by his remarks, in abridging his laborious investigations of their
                    elastic force. Μ. Coulomb appreciates the friction of soft materials by the
                    angle at which they will stand unsupported; an angle which has been termed in
                    this country the angle of repose, by an author who perhaps imagined there was
                    more novelty in the idea, than he would have done if this memoir had been fresh
                    in his mind. For the thickness of the walls of an embankment, one seventh of the
                    height is recommended as a good proportion in common cases, with an increase of
                    one sixth towards the bottom; but the calculation is left in some measure
                    incomplete, although it may be sufficiently accurate for the cases which most
                    commonly occur in practice. In the last place, the proper direction of the
                    joints of flat arches is determined; and the point of easiest fracture of arches
                    in general is investigated, by an approximative method, applied successively to
                    each joint.</p>

                    Sax. Etr.</hi> ix. p. 165. This memoir contains a laborious and accurate
                    investigation, both of the operation of the force of magnetism, and of the
                    resistances exhibited to' the motion of a needle by friction or by other causes.
                    The author lays down, as a fundamental principle, the equality of the
                    accelerative force acting on a given needle, in all positions, when referred to
                    the direction of the meridian; so that the properties of its vibrations become
                    precisely similar to those of a pendulum actuated by the force of gravity. From
                    the existence of an attractive and a repulsive force at the same time in each
                    particle of the body, with respect to the opposite magnetical poles of the
                    earth, he concludes the total impossibility of explaining the effects by means
                    of any ethereal currents or vortices, which had been admitted by some of the
                    best mathematicians of the century, then still surviving. He examines the
                    comparative force of needles of different dimensions, and proves the extreme
                    delicacy of the suspension afforded by a long fibre, whether of hair or silk;
                    and he describes a compass in which the reading is performed by means of a
                    microscope fixed to a graduated arm, serving as a vernier. In order to find the
                    true direction of the magnetic action of a needle, he turns it upside down, and
                    takes the mean of the observations. He ascertains the magnitude of the friction
                    of steel on glass by measuring the angle of repose; and he finds that it is
                    equal to - <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ths of the pressure. He then proceeds to calculate the
                    friction of a pivot, supposing it to be compressed most at the centre; but
                    concludes, from a hasty experiment, that the magnitude of the surface is not
                    much changed by a change of pressure. He infers, however, that a light needle
                    has an advantage over a heavy one. A perforation in the middle of a needle
                    appears to interfere but little with its magnetic force. He proposes to
                    ascertain the position of the dipping needle, by measuring the frequency of the
                    horizontal vibrations, and the force required to keep it level; and he concludes
                    his memoir with an account of the diurnal variations of the needle, and a
                    conjecture 'respecting the operation of the sun and his atmosphere, which he
                    compares to a large aurora borealis; referring the secular change of the
                    variation to the slow motion of the sun’s apogee.</p>

                    1797. The academy of Rouen had proposed a prize for an essay on the best mode of
                    lowering a rock in the Seine, at Quillebeuf, which was about a foot below
                    water-mark. This essay was originally written for the prize, but it was
                    published without waiting for the competition, at the request of some engineers,
                    who wished to have it made known without loss of time. The method recommended
                    consists in employing a floating air-chest in the manner of a diving bell,
                    forcing out the water from its lower part by means of bellows, after shutting up
                    the workmen in the upper part. In the additional paper, printed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal de Physique,</hi> a stronger pneumatic apparatus is
                    described, somewhat resembling the air vessel of a fire engine, which discharges
                    its air into the chest, and is then filled again by letting out the water; it is
                    also proposed to employ mercury,'in a similar manner, in the construction of an
                    air-pump. The proposed apparatus does not appear to have been tried; but there
                    can be no doubt that it might often be of advantage, when the inequalities of
                    the rock, or any other causes, prevented the construction of a cofferdam.</p>

                    friction and of the stiffness of ropes. Mem. 'Sav. Etr.</hi> X. p. 161. This
                    essay gained the double prize proposed by the academy for 1781; the difficulty
                    of performing experiments on a large scale having probably prevented the
                    presentation of any memoir sufficiently comprehensive the preceding year, when
                    the subject was first proposed. The author’s principal merit consists in the
                    determination of the different magnitude of the initial adhesion, according to
                    the time that the substances had continued in contact with each other, and had
                    been pressed together, and of the effect of the magnitude of the surface of
                    contact of particular substances, as well as of the causes of the occasional
                    difference of friction, with different velocities, especially when the unctuous
                    substances employed are rendered too soft by the heat which is produced by the
                    motion. He compared the effect of the mutual contact of a great variety of
                    substances; and, for the purpose of launching ships, he recommends the use of
                    oak, sliding on elm, previously well rubbed with hard tallow; but in some other
                    cases he found tallow, if not frequently renewed, rather injurious than
                    serviceable. He observed, that the rigidity of ropes increased more rapidly than
                    their diameter, but somewhat less rapidly than their strength; and that in order
                    to overcome this rigidity, besides a constant force, an additional force was
                    required, proportional to the weight employed. With every allowance for
                    resistance of all kinds, he calculates, that a well-constructed machine, for
                    instance a simple capstan, raising a large weight, will produce an effect
                    equivalent to nine tenths of the force employed. But, in many of the simple
                    machines in common use, for instance in ships’ blocks of the ordinary
                    construction, it appears, from the reports of other authors, that the loss
                    frequently amounts to more than half of the power.</p>

                    their sails. Mem. Ac. Par.</hi> 1781, p. 65. The inclination of the sails found
                    to succeed best in practice varied from sixty to eighty degrees in their
                    different parts. The force was estimated by the ĩveight of the stampers raised
                    in the processor extracting rape oil, and it appeared that only about one
                    seventh of the power of the wind was lost. On an average, the wind was observed
                    to blow eight hours a day, with the velocity of fifteen English miles an hour;
                    and the work of the mill was generally so arranged that the velocity of the
                    sails was in a certain proportion to that of the wind, experience having shown
                    that the effect thus obtained was the greatest possible. M. Coulomb attempted to
                    become a tenant of one of the mills for a few months, in order to make
                    experiments on it with the greater convenience; but the proprietors suspected
                    that he wished to discover some of their secrets, and refused to comply with his
                    proposal.</p>

                    Torsion. Mem. Ac. Par.</hi> 1784, p. 229. The force of torsion is here very
                    accurately and elegantly determined for substances of different diameters; and
                    it may be inferred from Μ. Coulomb’s experiments, that the resistance of a steel
                    wire, to a force tending to twist it, is always equal to that of a fixed axis,
                    supposed to be <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> θ
                    as great in diameter, having the same wire coiled round it, or rather simply
                    attached to a point of its circumference. For brass wire the proportion must be
                    <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>-∩j; and, according to Mr Cavendish’s experiments,
                    it must be <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θ for
                    copper. The reaction of brass, notwithstanding its greater flexibility, is more
                    perfect and durable than that of steel, and it is therefore preferred for the
                    construction of balances for the measurement of minute forces by the effect of
                    torsion, several varieties of which are here described. And as an instance of
                    their utility, the author has ascertained, that the resistance of liquids
                    depends almost entirely on two forces, the one varying as the velocity, the
                    other as its square, the constant portion of the resistance being scarcely
                    perceptible in any case. He proves, that tempering a bar or wire of any metal
                    has no effect in the immediate force of its resistance at a given flexure,
                    although it very materially modifies the extent of its action. Continued
                    twisting of a soft wire seems to produce a very equable degree of hardness,
                    which enables it to retain nine times as much magnetic power as in its original
                    state; and on account of this increase of hardness only, a soft wire appears to
                    exhibit a greater extent of elastic recoil when it is twisted round several
                    times, than when only once or twice,</p>

                    The needle is suspended by a number of single threads of silk, made to adhere by
                    dipping them in hot water, or by means of a little gum, each thread being
                    capable of bearing a weight of about fifty grains. The needle is to be so
                    suspended that the thread may have no tendency to cause it to deviate from the
                    magnetic meridian; and this is to be ascertained by substituting a copper wire
                    in its place. Cassini was in the habit of employing a compass of this
                    construction, for making accurate observations on the diurnal variation.</p>

                    repel each other with a force decreasing as the squares of the distances
                    increase. One of the instruments employed was so delicate that each degree of
                    the circle of torsion expressed a force of only one-hundred-thousandth of an
                    English grain; another, suspended by a single fibre of silk four inches long,
                    made a complete revolution with a force of one-seventy-thousandth of a grain,
                    and turned to the extent of a right angle when a stick of sealing wax which had
                    been rubbed was presented to it at the distance of a yard. The second memoir
                    relates to the laws of electric attraction, and of the magnetic forces, which
                    are all found to vary in the same proportion as the electric repulsion. The
                    direct experiments on the attraction oſballs contrarily electrified presented
                    some difficulties, and the vibration of a small needle, at different distances
                    from an electrified body, was employed for a collateral experiment. The poles in
                    which the magnetic forces appear to be concentrated are at some little distance
                    from the respective ends of a magnetic bar, and not exactly at the extremities.
                    In the third memoir, M. Coulomb investigates the laws of <pb break="no"

                    electricity of an insulated body, which seems to be always proportional to the
                    intensity of the charge, and independent both of the form and of the conducting
                    power, except in the case of sharp points or edges; it appears also to vary
                    nearly as the cube of the quantity of water contained in the air, though
                    probably somewhat diminished by an increase of temperature. It is however
                    remarkable, that changes of moisture, indicated by the hygrometer, are not
                    discoverable in the conducting power for a considerable time afterwards. The
                    quantity of electrity carried off by the air being ascertained, that which is
                    lost by the imperfection of the insulating support remained to be determined;
                    and it was found that a certain length of a fibre of silk, varying as the square
                    of the intensity, produced complete insulation with respect to all weaker
                    charges.</p>

                    independent of any chemical attraction of the body for the supposed fluid; since
                    balls of copper and of pith, or plates of iron and of paper, when brought into
                    contact with each other, divide the electricity in equal proportions. It is also
                    experimentally proved, by boring cylindrical holes in a large piece of wood, and
                    touching the bottom of the holes with a small circle of gilt paper, that the
                    interior parts of an electrified body remain in a state of indifference.</p>

                    is stronger than that of the larger, but never twice as strong. It is proved by
                    measuring the intensity of the electricity of a varnished wire.,or cylinder,
                    that bodies are not surrounded by an electric atmosphere, but receive the charge
                    within their substance; for the varnish, which is impermeable to the fluid, does
                    not sensibly affect the capacity of the cylinder.</p>

                    617. This interesting investigation relates to the distribution of electricity
                    between a nuιpber of equal globes; in the different parts of a long cylinder;
                    between a large globe and a number of small ones; and between a globe and a
                    cylinder. In showing the agreement of the theory with experiments, M. Coulomb’s
                    industry and ingenuity are very successfully exerted in order to overcome the
                    difficulties of the approximative calculation, although it might perhaps have
                    been not much more laborious, and yet far more satisfactory, to have proceeded
                    to a more correct and conclusive analysis. In a series of twenty-four globes,
                    the charge of the first was to that of the second as three to two, and to that
                    of the twelfth as seven to four; in a cylinder fifteen diameters long, the
                    intensity at the end was to the intensity at the middle as twenty-three to ten.
                    Of twenty-four small globes in contact with a larger, the last exhibited an
                    intensity about four times as great as the first. The experiments on globes and
                    cylinders combined are still more interesting, as affording an immediate
                    application to the effects of conductors in carrying off electricity. At the
                    remote end of a long cylinder equal in diameter to one twelfth of that of the
                    globe, the intensity was nearly twenty times as great as that of the globe; and
                    it increased almost in the same proportion as the diameter of the cylinder or
                    wire was diminished; but a short wire received a much weaker charge. From the
                    formulae founded on these experiments, M. Coulomb calculates that a cloud, a
                    thousand feet in diameter, will cause a wire a line in diameter, raised by a
                    kite, to receive an electricity at the lower end more than sixty thousand times
                    as great as its own. He also observes, that a point projecting but little from a
                    large surface discharges electricity but slowly; a plane touching a globe
                    received an electricity equally intense with that of the globe, on both its
                    surfaces. M. Coulomb considers the hypothesis of the existence of two electric
                    fluids aslessobjectionable'thanthe theory of Franklin, Aepinus, and Cavendish,
                    though he does not attempt to give any direct proof that he can decide the
                    question; but he finds it difficult to believe that matter can rcpel matter, and
                    attract the electric fluid, with forces precisely equal, at the same time that
                    matter is known to attract matter with a force of gravitation varying according
                    to the same law, but incomparably less active. It does not, however, appear that
                    this difficulty is by any means a very important one, since we may avoid it
                    altogether, by supposing that matter only rcpels matter, and that it attracts
                    the electric fluid, with which matter is commonly saturated, with a force
                    somewhat greater, so that the difference of these forces constitutes
                    gravitation; which thus, like the recently-discovered chemical attractions
                    depending on electricity, may be reduced to a modification of the power of this
                    wonderfully universal agent; an agent which appears almost to combine the
                    subtilty of spirit with the energetic qualities of matter. It must, however, be
                    remembered, that we have no evidence of the separate existence of electricity
                    independently of matter; it does not pass, like light and heat, through the
                    vacuum of the barometer; nor, in all probability, through the empty spaces
                    interposed between the different parts of the solar system; although the
                    accelerative force depending on it is not confined by these or by any other
                    limits; and it will probably long remain a question, whether electricity may not
                    rather be a modification of matter or motion in the bodies concerned, than a
                    semimaterial substance pervading them; especially among those who even doubt of
                    the materiality of light and heat as separate substances.</p>

                    1789, p. 455. In order to check the irregular oscillations of needles very
                    delicately suspended, Μ. Coulomb finds it convenient to, attach to them a
                    horizontal plate, immersed in a vessel of water. The directive power of a needle
                    of given thickness appears to be nearly proportional to its length, the quantity
                    of magnetism accumulated near the ends being constant, except that it extends to
                    the distance of about twenty-five diameters; and if the needle is too short to
                    allow space for this accumulation, the directive power decreases as the square
                    of the length. The directive forces of similar needles, composed of pieces of
                    the same twisted wire, arc nearly as their weights. Μ. Coulomb observes the
                    difficulty of accounting for the well-known fact, that neither half of a needle,
                    when it has been divided, appears to be attracted either northwards or
                    southwards; and he thinks, that whether we admit the existence of one magnetic
                    fluid or of two, it will still be necessary to consider every magnet as made up
                    of minute parts, each possessing a north and a south pole, of intensities
                    varying according to their situation; and he remarks, that the high charges of
                    electricity, supported by very thin plates, afford an analogy favourable to the
                    existence of this kind of partial charge of magnetism. He might also have added,
                    after the happy combinations of Volta, that the electro-chemical battery
                    exhibits an arrangement almost identical with that which he attributes to a
                    magnet. With respect to the forms of needles, the rhomboid appeared to have some
                    advantage over the rectangle; the temper required to be neither very hard nor
                    very soft, and it was found best to anneal the needles to a dark red, or to
                    employ plates of a spring temper when they required to be larger. A number of
                    needles combined into a mass lost more than half their strength, so that it is
                    of advantage to attach several parallel needles, at a distance from each other,
                    to the card of a compass. Μ. Coulomb<pb break="no" facs="nls:194752836"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2836-0428"/>’s mode of communicating magnetism is to lay the
                    ends of the bar on those of two strong magnets, placed opposite to each other,
                    and to draw two other magnets repeatedly along it, in an inclined position, from
                    the middle to the respective ends, in opposite directions, at the same time. His
                    large battery consisted of a number of plates surrounding two pairs of pieces of
                    soft iron, which formed the ends of each compound magnet, while the middle was
                    left hollow; the whole weighed thirty or forty pounds, and would lift eighty or
                    a hundred, and it communicated to common needles as much magnetism as they were
                    capable of retaining when their ends were merely placed on it without any
                    further operation.</p>

                    17S0, p. 448. Μ. Coulomb taeitly acknowledges, in this paper, a slight
                    inaceuracy in his former experiments on the friction of pivots, the result of
                    which seemed to indicate that the rotatory resistance of the friction, was
                    simply as the pressure, independently of any change of the magnitude of the
                    minute surface of contact. He now finds that this is only true of smaller
                    weights, when the pivot has already supported a larger, and its surface has
                    probably been a little flattened; otherwise the observation agrees more nearly
                    with the theory, and perfectly so on the supposition of a conical point
                    affording a resistance proportional to the displacement of the surface. The
                    friction of steel on garnet is a little less than half as much as on steel, on
                    agate a little more than half, and on glass four fifths. Light needles, with a
                    pivot tapering in an angle of about 20°, seem to be the most advantageous for
                    common purposes; but if the needle is heavy, the point must be more obtuse. The
                    conoidal caps, commonly used for suspending needles, had always an irregularity
                    at the centre, which made the friction many times greater than that of a
                    well-finished surface uniformly concave.</p>

                    considerably larger portion of air, which is extricated with a hissing noise
                    when the tree is cut or bored; it is not, however, certain that this air is in
                    an elastic state while the vessels remain closed. The phenomenon was first
                    observed in April, and continued throughout the summer, being most distinct in
                    the hottest sunshine.</p>

                    employment of strength in ascending stairs; but he observes, that former authors
                    have very frequently exaggerated the whole amount of a man’s daily labour. In
                    faet, the day’s work which he assigns to a man of ordinary strength thus
                    employed, is less than half of that which Ďesaguliers attributes to a labourer
                    turning a winch; and Professor Robison has recorded more than one instance of a
                    much larger result of the labour of a man ascending an inclined plane, even
                    besides the force lost in the machinery employed; so that we must suppose the
                    labourers in France to be commonly less vigorous than in Great Britain; almost
                    in the same proportion as Μ. Coulomb has observed the work of the same man in

                    experiments here related demonstrate that the constant part of the resistance of
                    fluids is insensible; that the portion varying simply as the velocity is more
                    than seventeen times as great in oil as in water, while the portion which varies
                    as the square of the velocity is nearly equal in both these fluids. The
                    resistance did not increase with the depth of immersion; on the contrary, it was
                    a little greater when the body was partly above the surface. It was observed
                    that very slow oscillations were somewhat accelerated even by the motion of a
                    carriage passing along the street. Greasing the surface of the solid did not
                    sensibly lessen the resistance to its motion, nor was it materially increased by
                    sprinkling sand on the grease; so that the particles of the liquid seemed to
                    slide rather on each other than on the solid. But it is probable that these
                    differences would have been more perceptible in greater velocities; for it seems
                    reasonable to expect that the friction between a fluid and a solid should
                    partake, in a slight degree, of the nature of the friction between two solids,
                    so as to increase less rapidly with an increase of velocity, than the friction
                    of the particles of fluids among themselves.</p>

                    by a mild gaiety, which made him very amiable in society. His disposition was
                    generous and benevolent; but, notwithstanding all his modesty <hi

                    the same class with Franklin, Aepinus, and Cavendish. He was less original than
                    Franklin, but much more profound. He gave to the speculations of Aepinus both a
                    more defined application and a more satisfactory demonstration; and he was
                    equally accurate with Cavendish, but much more persevering with respect to the
                    more limited objects of his researches; and his improvements in the theory of
                    electricity may be considered as having immediately prepared the way for the
                    elegant inventions of Volta, and the still more marvellous discoveries of Davy.
                    In short, among all the men of science who have <pb break="no"

                    would be difficult to point out a single individual who, with regard to the
                    cultivation of terrestrial physics, could at all be put in competition with Μ.
                    Coulomb. His health had long been extremely feeble, and, in addition to his more
                    chronic complaints, he was at last attacked by a slow fever, to which he fell a
                    victim on the 23d of August 1806. He had been a lieutenant-colonel of engineers,
                    a chevalier of the order of St Louis, and a member of the legion of honour; but
                    he had acquired little property, and he left to his two sons scarcely any other
                    patrimony'than the public gratitude and esteem for his merits and his virtues.
