                    la</hi></label>, a practical geographer and cultivator of science in general,
                    son of Charles de la Condamine, a receiver-general of finances, and Margaret
                    Louise de ChourCes, was born the ‘28th of January 1701.</p>
                <p>His early education was by no means neglected, although he complains, in a
                    manuscript memoir which he left respecting the progress of his studies, and the
                    development of his'faculties, that he was made to learn, as boys frequently are,
                    too much by rote, without understanding the complete sense and bearing of the
                    words which lie repeated. It is, however, by no means certain that any great
                    loss of time is ultimately incurred by this practice; for in fact the memory is
                    much strengthened by the constant habit of getting by heart, and it does not
                    appear that the judgment is at all impaired by it. He afterwards pursued his
                    studies under Father Brisson, and in 1717 supported a thesis on the Cartesian
                    philosophy, which the Jesuits were then beginning to introduce into their
                    seminaries, while it was elsewhere giving way to the Newtonian. In 1719, after
                    he had left college, he entered the army, and accompanied his uncle, the
                    Chevalier de Chources, to the siege of Rosas, as a volunteer; and both on this
                    and other occasions he exhibited sufficient proofs of the contempt of danger and
                    the spirit of enterprise which were so much required in those pursuits that
                    afterwards occupied a considerable portion of his life. Notwithstanding the
                    dissipations in which military men are very commonly involved, he was moderate
                    in the pursuit of pleasure; and he used to consider the distortion which the
                    small-pox had left in his features as having afforded him some compensation for
                    the injury done to his vanity, by diminishing the temptations to which his
                    sensibility might otherwise have exposed him.</p>
                <p>Having no prospect of speedy advancement in the army, and having suffered
                    considerably in his fortune from a participation in the extravagant speculations
                    of Law, he quitted the service, in hopes of finding a more advantageous
                    employment in science. He distinguished himself as an active member of a society
                    of arts, then recently established at Paris by the Count de Clermont; and, in
                    1730, he obtained a situation in the Academy of Sciences, as adjunct of the
                    class of chemistry, having previously presented to the academy a memoir on the
                    mathematical and mechanical properties of the lathe, which obtained him
                    considerable credit. Soon afterwards he embarked in the squadron of Duguay
                    Trouin, and made a voyage in different parts of the Mediterranean; he passed
                    several months at Constantinople, and visited the plain of Troy, and many other
                    parts of the Levant; after his return he gave an account of his tour to the
                    academy; and a servant, who had accompanied him, published also a separate
                    journal of his own.</p>
                <p>Chemistry, as it was cultivated at that period, afforded' but little scope for
                    the employment of an active mind; and La Condamine, after the publication of one
                    chemical memoir only, was removed from the class of chemists in the academy to
                    that of astronomers. In this capacity he was the first to propose the
                    measurement of a degree of latitude in the neighbourhood of the equator; and he
                    seems to have felt the importance of the undertaking, not only for the purpose
                    of deciding a great question in science, but also for that of attracting the
                    attention of the public, and establishing the system of gravitation in France by
                    a grand operation, executed, with great labour and at a great distance, by
                    Frenchmen only. His ideas were readily seconded by Maurepas, then prime
                    minister; and he was appointed by the academy, together with Bouguer and Godin,
                    for carrying the proposal into effect.</p>
                <p>In this expedition he was absent from his country for nearly ten years, from 1735
                    to 1745; and he had to combat with difficulties of every kind. <hi rend="italic"
                    >A</hi> distant voyage; an uncivilized and sometimes uninhabited country;
                    impracticable roads; want of regular remittances; the necessity of disposing of
                    valuable articles disadvantageously, in order to procure a temporary supply; a
                    malicious prosecution upon the pretence of a contraband traffic, founded only on
                    this circumstance; and the still more violent attacks of a fanatical mob, who
                    murdered the surgeon of the expedition: all these tilings, to say nothing of the
                    awful appearance of an eruption of Cotopaxi, and the no less formidable
                    operations of the hostile squadron of Lord Anson, required nothing less than the
                    dauntless spirit and energy of character which he possessed, to bear him up
                    against them; and at last the little jealousies, which will often arise among
                    persons of science employed in the same pursuits, embarrassed and embittered the
                    conclusion of his enterprise. The activity and fluency of La Condamine made the
                    public disposed to imagine that Bouguer had been only his humble attendant; and
                    Bouguer was too conscious of his own superiority as a mathematician to bear this
                    injustice with patience. He complained, but the laugh was against him; and he
                    revenged himself by refusing all communication in the statement of the results
                    of the operations; so that each observer gave ultimately a separate account of
                    his own measurements and calculations.</p>
                <p>In consequence of all the fatigues and vicissitudes to which La Ċondamine had
                    been exposed, he became extremely deaf, and partially paralytic, after his
                    return; but the powers of his mind appear to have remained unimpaired.</p>
                <p>In 1748 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society of London; and he
                    afterwards exerted himself with great zeal and success in promoting, among his
                    countrymen, the general introduction of the variolous inoculation, which had
                    long been practised in England, and in some other parts of Europe. In 1757 he
                    took a journey to Italy, and spent a considerable time at Rome, partly with a
                    view to the improvement of his health, and to the observation of a variety of
                    facts connected with his scientific pursuits; but principally, perhaps, in order
                    to obtain a dispensation from the pope for a marriage with his niece, who seems
                    to have had a high respect for his talents, and even a sincere attachment to his
                    person, notwithstanding the disparity of their ages, and the caprices of a
                    temper not a little impatient and irritable. He became, in 1760, one of the
                    forty members of the French Academy, and contributed considerably to an improved
                    edition of their dictionary. In 1763 he paid a short visit to England, which was
                    rendered less agreeable to him on account of the difficulty that he found in
                    obtaining legal redress for <pb break="no" facs="nls:194749859"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-9859-0199"/>some slight injury which he had received: after
                    his return, the insensibility of his limbs increased, and he was obliged to
                    relinquish all his pursuits of science, retaining only the amusement of making
                    some light attempts in poetry, and occasionally inserting in the periodical
                    works of the day a few tales in verse, besides a poetical translation of a part
                    of Virgil’s <hi rend="italic">Eneid</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> although it
                    seems natural to suppose that the exercise of the inventive fancy of a poet
                    would tend to exhaust the debilitated faculties even still more than the
                    methodical investigation of mathematical or physical subjects.</p>

                    the surface of the cone itself; but it is not remarkably distinguished either
                    for clearness of conception or for accuracy of expression.</p>

                    glass or agate, by means of an iron nail; and the only remarkable circumstance
                    attending them is the extension of the ramifications to parts at a considerable
                    distance from the nail which supplies the iron in the place of the silver
                    deposited, exhibiting a faint resemblance of the astonishing transfers and
                    interchanges which have been more lately discovered in electro-chemical

                    Domingo,</hi> Μ. Ac. Par. 1735, p. 529. The academicians were detained at St
                    Domingo more than three months, and they took advantage of the delay in order to
                    ascertain the length of the pendulum in that latitude. Mr de la Condamiue
                    employed a ball of brass, suspended by a thread of the aloe, and attached to it
                    by means of a piece of ' sticking plaster; the pendulum making a vibration in
                    about two seconds, he observed in how many vibrations a second was lost or
                    gained. The length thus determined was thirty-six French inches seven and a
                    quarter lines, or 39Ό125 English inches. Messrs Godin and Bouguer made it one
                    twelfth of a line longer, or 39∙020; and a calculation from the best modern
                    observations for the latitude, which was 18° 27', gives us 39∙029. The thread
                    was fixed by a clip, and it was probably very flexible, since its rigidity must
                    necessarily have tended to increase the curvature of the path of the ball, and
                    to give a measure somewhat too long. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    226. Jussieu, who was the botanist of the expedition, had pointed out to La
                    Condamine a number of circumstances respecting the cinchona, which required
                    investigation; and he was enabled to illustrate them in a satisfactory manner,
                    from having to pass through Loxa in the course of his investigations. It appears
                    that the bark known under the name of <hi rend="italic">quina-quina</hi> before

                    Μ. Ac. Par. 1745, p. 391, Pl. 63. After the completion of the operations at
                    Quito, Mr de la Condamine determined to take the course of the river Marañon for
                    his return towards Cayenne; and in the course of this route, of more than 2000
                    miles, which he performed partly by land, but principally on a raft, he had an
                    opportunity of making a multitude of interesting observations of various kinds.
                    He found in several places a singular agreement of traditions respecting the
                    former existence of a republic of women only, in the neighbourhood of the river
                    which has received its most usual denomination from them. He observed the effect
                    of the tides at Pauxis, a point 600 miles from the mouth of the river, but not
                    much elevated above it; and he was informed that there were always a number of
                    alternations at high and low water at the same time between this point and the
                    mouth of the river; in some places, where the water was shallow, he encountered
                    the tide rising in the form of a bore, called by the French a <hi rend="italic"
                    >barre</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mascaret,</hi> and by the inhabitants there a

                    ascent, and frequently producing accidents to boats unprepared for its
                    reception. After his arrival at Para, he measured the length of the pendulum
                    there, and found that the force of gravitation was about -ŗŋðļ, greater than at
                    the summit of Pichincha. He next proceeded to Cayenne, and was obliged, on
                    account of the war, to return to Europe by a Dutch ship, which sailed from
                    Surinam.</p>

                    same determination of the arc, but a different series of trigonometrical

                    disposed to the admission of beneficial innovations; for scarcely in any part of

                    336, H. P. 6. From an examination of several ancient standards, and from a
                    comparison of the remains of buildings supposed to have occupied a certain round
                    number of feet, Mr de la Condamine concludes that the old Roman foot was equal
                    to 130 ’ 9 French lines; that is, to 969 thousandths of an English foot. Mr
                    Folkes had before made it 966; but Mr Raper has shown, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1760, by a very careful comparison of a
                    multitude of documents, that, before the reign of Titus, it somewhat exceeded
                    970, and under Severus and Diocletian it was less than 965; the original
                    standard in the temple of Juno Moneta having probably been destroyed by fire. Mr
                    de la Condamine also viewed the races on the Corso with an eye equally
                    mathematical, and observed’that the Barbary horses ran at the rate of about
                    forty English feet in a second; but his correspondents in England furnished him
                    with unexceptionable evidence that the horse <hi rend="italic">Childers</hi> ran
                    the four mile course at Newmarket at the rate of very nearly fifty English feet
                    in a second, while no other horse exceeded forty-eight; and he observes that, in
                    this instance, truth far outruns probability; a remark which has been somewhat
                    misrepresented in this country, and converted, by the lovers of the amusements
                    of the turf, into a laugh against the lovers of the amusements of science; the
                    story being told as if the French mathematicians had demonstrated the absolute
                    maximum of a horse’s utmost possible speed, and, a bet having been made on the
                    occasion, an English horse had been found that actually exceeded the maximum.
                    Our author also notices the awkward effect of the Roman mode of beginning the
                    day at sunset, which renders it necessary to make continual alterations in the
                    clocks, directions being given in the almanacks for putting them forwards or
                    backwards a quarter of an hour at a time; and the precise time of noon happening
                    in summer at sixteen o’clock, and in winter not till nineteen. He observes that
                    a single signal, properly placed on the Apennines, would be visible at once near
                    Trieste and near Monaco, giving a difference of longitude of not less than five
                    degrees.</p>

                <p>In 1768 bis name is mentioned as having excited the attention of the members of
                    the academy by a relation of</p>
                <p>Spallanzani’s experiments on the reproduction of the heads of snails, which
                    several of them repeated with success. In fact, there was scarcely any one of
                    the sciences to which he did not occasionally render some service, although he
                    wanted patience and perseverance to make any very important discoveries or
                    improvements by his individual exertions only. But his knowledge was universal;
                    he understood and wrote all languages; he corresponded with men of celebrity in
                    all countries; he published upon all subjects; he contributed to all the
                    literary and scientific journals of the day; he answered all criticisms, and he
                    accepted all compliments, even from persons whom he despised; for he delighted
                    in the parade of a pre-eminent reputation. His style was simple and natural,
                    somewhat negligent, but still elegant and lively; his manner was animated and
                    somewhat singular; his temper was warm and restless; he sighed for repose, and
                    was incapable of enjoying it; thinking nothing that occurred indifferent to him,
                    and allowing none about him'to be idle. He obtained the rank of chevalier in
                    several orders, and was a member of several foreign academies; he had also the
                    appointment of honorary secretary to the Duke of Orleans. At the age of
                    sixty-eight he addressed to his wife an account of his education, and of the
                    earlier progress of his mental faculties, as a practical illustration of his
                    opinions respecting the cultivation of the mind. The memoir was not published;
                    but it is perhaps unfortunate for mankind that men of celebrity seldom find a
                    sufficient motive for communicating candidly to the world the results of such a
                    self-examination. A few years before his death he printed a memorial in behalf
                    of Mr Godin, who had been reduced to indigent circumstances; and he had the
                    pleasure of obtaining for him the assistance which he required. He suffered
                    occasionally from a hernia, and having read of the marvellous cures which some
                    empiric professed to have performed by the application of a caustic, he
                    determined to make the experiment on himself, without the knowledge of his
                    family, and without much hope of success; but he fell a victim to the courage or
                    the curiosity that prompted him to submit to the operation. In the course of the
                    six weeks that he survived, he was still employed in writing or dictating a
                    memoir containing answers to some questions respecting the manners of the
                    Americans. He died on the 4th February 1774, leaving many of his books and
                    instruments by will to the Academy of Sciences. <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Acad.
