                <p><label type="entry">COOPER</label>, an artificer who makes casks and coops, tubs,
                    barrels, and all kinds of wooden vessels which are bound together with hoops. It
                    would appear that the art <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751237"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1237-0305"/>of the cooper is of great antiquity, and that it
                    soon attained all the perfection which it at present possesses.</p>
                <p>But although this art is very ancient, there are some countries in which it is as
                    yet unknown, and in others, from the scarcity of wood, or from different causes,
                    earthen vessels and skins lined with pitch are used for containing liquors. The
                    Latin word <hi rend="italic">dolium</hi> is usually translated a cask; but it
                    was employed by the Romans to denote earthen vessels used for the same purposes.
                    The word <hi rend="italic">dolare,</hi> to plane or smooth, from which <hi
                    rend="italic">dolium</hi> is derived, and the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >dolarius,</hi> a cooper, may naturally enough be applied, the former to the
                    construction of casks, which are made of several pieces of the same tree planed
                    and fitted for joining together, and the latter to the artificer himself.</p>
                <p>Pliny ascribes the invention of casks to the people who lived at the foot of the
                    Alps. In his time they lined them with pitch. From the year 70 of the Christian
                    era, in the time of Tiberius and Vespasian, the art of constructing vessels of
                    different pieces of wood seems to have been well known. Indeed, previous to this
                    period, Varro and Columella, in detailing the precepts of rural economy, speak
                    distinctly of vessels formed of different pieces, and bound together with
                    circles of wood, or hoops. The description which they have given accords exactly
                    with the construction of casks. The fabrication of casks, on account of’the
                    great abundance of wood, was probably very early introduced into France. It is
                    uncertain when this art was first practised in Britain; but it seems not
                    improbable that it was derived from the French.</p>
                <p>The figure of a cask is that of two truncated cones, or rather conoids, joined
                    together; for the lines are not straight, as in the cone, but are curved from
                    the vertex to the base. As the place where the junction seems to be made is the
                    most capacious, it is commonly called the belly of the cask. In the choice of
                    wood, old, thick, and straight trees are preferred, from which thin planks are
                    hewn, which are then formed into staves. In France the wood is prepared in
                    winter; the staves and bottoms are then formed, and they are put together, or,
                    in the language of the artificer, the cask is mounted, in summer. Planing the
                    staves is one of the most difficult parts of the work, and it is at the same
                    time one of the most important in the fabrication of casks. In dressing staves
                    with the plane, the workman is directed to cut across the wood, the reason of
                    which is probably to prevent the instrument following the course of the fibres,
                    which may not always be in the same plane with the surface of the stave, and
                    thus render it of unequal thickness.</p>
                <p>In the formation of the staves, it ought to be recollected that each must
                    constitute part of a double conoid. It must therefore be broader at the middle,
                    and gradually become narrower, but not in straight lines, towards the
                    extremities. The outside of the staves across the wood must be wrought into the
                    segment of a circle, and it must be thickest near the middle, growing gradually
                    thinner towards the ends. Great experience is requisite for the nice adjustment
                    of the different curves to the size and shape of the cask; but less attention is
                    paid to the rounding or dressing of the inside of the stave.</p>
                <p>After the staves have been dressed, and are ready to be arranged in a circular
                    form, it might be supposed necessary, for the purpose of making the seams tight,
                    to trim the thin edges in such a manner that the contiguous staves may be
                    brought into firm contact throughout the whole joint, or sloped similar to the
                    arch-stones of a bridge. But this is not the practice usually followed by the
                    artificer. Without attempting to slope them, so that the whole surface of the
                    edge may touch in every point, he brings the contiguous staves into contact only
                    at the inner surface; and in this way, by driving the hoops hard, he can make a
                    closer joint than could be done by sloping them from the outer to the inner
                    side. In this, perhaps, and in giving the proper curvature to the staves,
                    consist the principal part of the cooper’s art.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cooper,</hi><hi rend="italic">Anthony Ashley,</hi> first
                    Earl of Shaftesbury, a very able statesman, was the son of Sir John Cooper,
                    Baronet, of Rockburn, in Hampshire, and was born in 1621. He was elected member
                    for Tewkesbury at nineteen years of age, in the short parliament which met in
                    April 1640. He seems to have been well affected to the king’s service at the
                    beginning of the civil wars, for he repaired to the king at Oxford with offers
                    of assistance; but Prince Maurice having broken articles with a town in
                    Dorsetshire, which he had got to receive him, this furnished him with a pretence
                    for going over to the parliament, froip which he accepted a commission. When
                    Richard Cromwell was deposed, and the Rump again came into power, they nominated
                    Sir Anthony as one of the council of state, and a commissioner for managing the
                    army. At that very time he had engaged in a secret correspondence for restoring
                    Charles II., and, upon the king’s return, he was sworn of the privy council. He
                    was one of the commissioners appointed for the trial of the regicides; and was
                    soon afterwards made chancellor of the exchequer, and then a commissioner of the
                    treasury. In 1672 he was created Earl of Shaftesbury, and he was subsequently
                    raised to the office of lord chancellor. He filled this situation with great
                    ability and integrity; and though the short time he was at the helm proved a
                    tempestuous season, it is only doing him justice to say that nothing could
                    either distract or terrify him. The great seal was taken from him in 1673,
                    twelve months after he had received it; but though out of office, he still made
                    a distinguished figure in parliament, for it was not in his nature to remain
                    inactive. He drew upon' himself the implacable hatred of the Duke of York, by
                    steadily promoting, if not originally inventing, the project of a bill of
                    exclusion; and when his enemies came into power, he found it necessary to
                    consult his safety by retiring into Holland, where he died about six weeks after
                    his arrival, in 1683. Whilst his great abilities are confessed by all, it has
                    been his misfortune to have his history recorded by enemies who have studied to
                    render him odious. Butler has drawn a severe character of him in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hudibras.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Cooper,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthony Ashley,</hi> Earl of Shaftesbury, was son of Anthony Earl of
                    Shaftesbury, and grandson of Anthony first Earl of Shaftesbury, lord high
                    chancellor of England. He was born in 1671, at Exeter House, in London, where
                    lived his grandfather, who from the time of his birth conceived so great an
                    affection for him, that he undertook the care of his education; and young Cooper
                    made so good a progress in learning that he could write with ease both the Latin
                    and Greek languages when only eleven years old. In 1683 his father carried him
                    to the school at Winchester, where he was often insulted on account of his
                    grandfather, whose memory was odious to the zealots for despotic power; he
                    therefore prevailed with his father to consent to his desire of going abroad.
                    After three years stay abroad, he returned to England in 1689, and was offered a
                    seat in parliament for some of those boroughs where his family had an interest.
                    But this offer he declined accepting, in order that he might not be interrupted
                    in the course of his studies, which he prosecuted five years more with great
                    vigour and success; till, upon Sir John Trenchard’s death, he was elected
                    burgess for Poole. Soon after his coming into parliament, he had an opportunity
                    afforded him of evincing that spirit of liberty by which he uniformly directed
                    his conduct on all occasions. This consisted of the bringing in and pro- .
                    moting “the act for regulating trials in cases of high treason<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194751250" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1250-0306"/>.” But the fatigues of
                    attending the House of Commons in a few years so impaired his health, that he
                    was obliged to decline coming again into parliament after the dissolution in
                    1698. He then went to Holland, where the conversation of Mr Bayle, Μ. le Clerc,
                    and several other learned and ingenious men, induced him to reside a
                    twelvemonth. During this time there was printed at London, in 8vo, an imperfect
                    edition of Lord Ashley’s <hi rend="italic">Inquiry concerning Virtue.</hi> It
                    had been surreptitiously taken from a rough draught, sketched when he was not
                    more than twenty years of age. His lordship, who was greatly chagrined at this
                    event, immediately bought up the impression before many copies were sold, and
                    set about completing the treatise as it afterwards appeared in the second volume
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Characteristics.</hi> Soon after Lord Ashley’s return
                    to England, he became, by the decease of his father, Earl of Shaftesbury. But
                    his own private affairs prevented his attending the House of Lords till the
                    second year of his peerage, when he was very earnest in supporting the measures
                    of King William, at that time projecting the grand alliance. So much was he in
                    favour with the king, that he had the offer of the office of secretary of state;
                    but his declining constitution would not allow' him to accept of it. Though he
                    was disabled from engaging in business, the king consulted him on matters of
                    very high importance; and it is pretty well known that he had the greatest share
                    in composing that celebrated last speech of King William, delivered on the
                    31stDeeember 1701. Upon Queen Anne’s accession to the throne, he returned to his
                    retired manner of life, being no longer advised with concerning the public; and
                    he was also removed from the vice-admiralty of Dorset, which had been in the
                    family for three generations. In 1703 he made a second journey to Holland, and
                    returned to England the year following. The French prophets, soon after this,
                    having by their enthusiastic extravagances made a great noise throughout the
                    nation, and, among different opinions, some having advised a prosecution, the
                    Lord Shaftesbury apprehended that such a measure would tend rather to inflame
                    than to cure the disease. This was the origin of his Letter concerning
                    Enthusiasm, which he sent to Lord Somers, then president of the council; and
                    which being approved of by that nobleman, and other gentlemen to whom it was
                    shown, was published in 1708, though without the name of the author, or that of
                    the person to whom it was addressed. His Moralist, a philosophical rhapsody,
                    being a recital of certain conversations on natural and moral subjects, appeared
                    in January 1709; and in the May following. his <hi rend="italic">Sensus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Communis,</hi> an essay upon the freedom of wit and humour, in a
                    letter to a friend. In the same year he entered into the married state with Mrs
                    Jane Ewer, the youngest daughter of Thomas Ewer, Esq. of Lee, in Hertfordshire.
                    By this lady, to whom his lordship was related, he had an only son, Anthony,
                    afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury. In 1710 was published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Soliloquy, or Advice to an Author,</hi> London, 8vo. Whilst he was thus
                    employing himself in literary composition, his health declined so fast that it
                    was recommended to him to try the benefit of a warmer climate. Accordingly, in
                    July 1711, he set out for Naples, and pursuing his journey by way of France, was
                    obliged to pass through the Duke of Berwick’s army, which at that time lay
                    encamped near the borders of Piedmont. Here he was entertained by that
                    celebrated captain in the most friendly manner, and every assistance was
                    afforded to conduct him in safety to the Duke of Savoy’s dominions. But our
                    author’s removal to Italy proved of no service to the re-establishment of his
                    health; for after having resided at Naples about a year and a half, he departed
                    this life on the 15th of February 1713, being then in the forty-second year of
                    his age. The only pieces which lie finished after he arrived at this city were
                    the Judgment of Hercules, and the Letter concerning Design, which last was added
                    to the impression of the <hi rend="italic">Characteristics</hi> which appeared
                    in 1732. It was in 1711 that the first complete edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Characteristics</hi> was published, in the order in which they now stand. But
                    this publication not being entirely to his lordship’s satisfaction, he chiefly
                    employed the latter part of his life in preparing his writings for a more
                    elegant edition, which was given to the world in 1713, soon after his decease∙
                    The several prints which were then first interspersed throughout the volumes
                    were all invented by himself, and designed under his immediate inspection; and
                    for this purpose he was at the pains of drawing up a most accurate set of
                    instructions, the manuscript of which is still preserved in the family. That no
                    mistakes might be committed, the earl did not leave to any other hands so much
                    as the drudgery of correcting the press. In the three volumes of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, and Times,</hi> he
                    completed the whole of his works which he intended for the public eye. Not long
                    before his death he had formed a scheme of writing a discourse on painting,
                    sculpture, and the other arts of design, which, if he had lived to finish it,
                    might have proved a very pleasing and useful work, as he had a fine taste in
                    subjects of this kind; but his premature demise prevented his making any great
                    progress in the undertaking. The Earl of Shaftesbury had an esteem for the works
                    of the best English divines, one remarkable instance of which was displayed in
                    Ids writing a preface to a volume of Dr Whichcot’s Sermons, published in 1698.
                    Copies of these sermons had been taken in short·hand, as they were delivered
                    from the pulpit; and the earl had so high an opinion of them, that he not only
                    introduced them to the world by his preface, but had them printed under his own
                    particular inspection. In his <hi rend="italic">Letters to a Young Man at the
                    University,</hi> he speaks of Bishop Burnet and Dr Hoadley in terms of great
                    applause, and he has done justice to the merits of Tillotson, Barrow,
                    Chillingworth, and Hammond, as the chief pillars of the church against
                    fanaticism. For a further account of his character as a philosopher and writer,
                    we refer to Sir James Mackintosh’s <hi rend="italic">Discourse,</hi> in the
                    first volume of this work.</p>

                    rend="italic">Thomas,</hi> a pious and learned prelate in the reign of Queen
                    Elizabeth, was born at Oxford about the year 1517. He was educated in the school
                    adjoining to Magdalene College, of which he was a chorister, and where also, in
                    1539, he was elected probationer, and fellow the following year. About the year
                    1546, having quitted his fellowship, he applied himself to the study of physic,
                    took the degree of bachelor in that faculty in 1556, and practised as a
                    physician at Oxford. Being inclined to the Protestant religion, this probably
                    was only a prudent suspension of his final intentions during the reign of Queen
                    Mary; for on the accession of Elizabeth he resumed the study of divinity, became
                    a celebrated preacher, and was made dean of Christ-Church and vice-chancellor of
                    the university, having taken the degrees of bachelor and doctor in divinity. In
                    1569 he was made Dean of Gloucester, and the year following Bishop of Lincoln;
                    but in 1584 he was translated to the see of Winchester, in which city he died,
                    on the 28th of April 1594. The several writers who have mentioned Dr Cooper
                    unanimously describe him as an eloquent preacher, a learned divine, and a good
                    man. He wrote, 1. <hi rend="italic">The Epitome of Chronicles,</hi> from the
                    seventeenth year after Christ to 1540, and thence to 1560; 2. <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cooper,</hi><hi rend="italic">John Gilbert,</hi> a
                    miscellaneous writer, was born in 1723, and descended from an ancient family in
                    the county of Nottingham, whose fortune was injured in the last century by their
                    attachment to the principles of monarchy. He resided atThurgarton Priory, in
                    Nottinghamshire, which had been granted by King Henry VIII. to William Cooper,
                    one of his ancestors. This mansion Mr Cooper inherited from his father, who in
                    1739 was high sheriff of the county, and transmitted it to his son, who filled
                    the same respectable office in 1783. After passing through Westminster school
                    under Dr John Nicol, along with Lord Albemarle, Lord Buckinghamshire, Major
                    Johnson, Mr George Ashby, and many other eminent and ingenious persons, he
                    became, in 1743, a fellow commoner of Trinity College, Cambridge, and resided
                    there two or three years; but he quitted the university on his marriage with
                    Susanna, the daughter of William Wrighte, Esq. son of the lord Reeper of that
                    name, and also recorder of Leicester from 1729 to 1763. In the year 1745 he
                    commenced author, by the publication of <hi rend="italic">The Power of
                    Harmony,</hi> a poem, in 4to; and in 1746 and 1747 he produced several essays
                    and poems under the signature of Philalcthes, in a periodical work called <hi
                    rend="italic">The Museum,</hi> published by Mr Dodsley. In the same year he came
                    forward as an author, under his own name, in a work which received much
                    assistance from his friend the llev. John Jackson of Leicester, who communicated
                    several learned notes, in which he contrived to manifest his dislike to his
                    formidable antagonist Mr Warburton. It was entitled The Life of Socrates,
                    collected from the <hi rend="italic">Memorabilia</hi> of Xenophon and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> of Plato, and illustrated further by Aristotle,
                    Diodorus Siculus, Cicero, Proclus, Apuleius, Maximus Tyrius, Boethius, Diogenes
                    Laertius, Aulus Gellius, and others, 1749, 8vo. In this work Mr Cooper gave
                    evident marks of a superior genius, warm, impetuous, and impatient of restraint.
                    In 1754 Mr Cooper published his <hi rend="italic">Letters on Taste,</hi> 8vo; an
                    elegant little volume, on which no small share of his reputation is founded: and
                    in 1755 appeared <hi rend="italic">The Tomb of Shakspeare, a Vision,</hi> 4to; a
                    tolerable performance, in which, however, there is more of wit and application
                    than of nature or genius. In 1756 he assisted Mr Moore, by writing some numbers
                    of the <hi rend="italic">World</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and he attempted to
                    rouse the indignation of his countrymen against the Hessians, who had recently
                    been brought over to defend the nation, in a poem called <hi rend="italic">The
                    Genius of Britain,</hi> addressed to Mr Pitt. In 1758 he published <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistles to the Great,</hi> from Aristippus in Retirement, 4to;
                    <hi rend="italic">The Call of Aristippus,</hi> Epistle IV. to Mark Akenside,
                    M.D.; and also, <hi rend="italic">A Father s Advice to his Son,</hi> in 4to. In
                    the Annual Register of the same year appeared his Translation of an Epistle from
                    the King of Prussia to Monsieur Voltaire. In 1759 he published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ver Vert, or the Nunnery Parrot,</hi> an Heroic Poem, in four cantos, inscribed
                    to the Abbess of D. translated from the French of Monsieur Cresset, 4to, and
                    reprinted in the first volume of Dilly’s Repository, 1777; and, in 1764, <hi
                    rend="italic">Poems on Several Subjects,</hi> by the Author of the Life of
                    Socrates, with a prefatory advertisement by Mr Dodsley. In this little volume
                    were included all the separate poetical pieces which have been already
                    mentioned, excepting <hi rend="italic">Ver Vert,</hi> which is a sprightly
                    composition. Mr Cooper died at his father’s house in May Fair, on the 17th of
                    April 1769, after a long and excruciating illness arising from calculus in the
                    bladder.</p>
