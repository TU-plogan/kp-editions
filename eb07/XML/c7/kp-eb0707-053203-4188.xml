                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CULLEN</label>, a royal burgh of Scotland, in the county of
                    Banff. It is situated on a commanding eminence which overlooks the sea, and
                    possesses a harbour, which, however, is of little use. The manufacture and
                    bleaching of linen goods are now carried on with considerable success, and dried
                    fish are exported to some extent. There is an annual fair held here on the last
                    Tuesday of September. In 1821 the population of the burgh and parish amounted to
                    1452, and in 1831 to 1593.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cullen,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dr William,</hi> an eminent
                    physician and medical teacher, was born in Lanarkshire, in the west of Scotland,
                    on the 11th of December 1712. His father was for some time chief magistrate of
                    the town of Hamilton; but though a very respectable man, his circumstances were
                    not such as to permit him to expend much money on the education of his son.
                    William, therefore, after serving an apprenticeship to a surgeon apothecary in
                    Glasgow, went several voyages to the West Indies as a surgeon in a trading
                    vessel from London; but of this employment he soon became tired, and settled
                    himself, at an early period of life, as a country surgeon in the parish of
                    Şhòtts, where he resided a short time practising among the farmers and country
                    people, and then went to Hamilton with a view to practise as a physician, having
                    never been fond of operating as a surgeon.</p>
                <p>Whilst he resided near Shotts, Archibald duke of Argyll, who at that time bore
                    the chief political sway in Scotland, chanced to pay a visit to a gentleman of
                    rank in that neighbourhood. The duke was fond of literary pursuits, and was then
                    particularly engaged in some chemical researches, which required to be
                    elucidated by experiment. Eager in these pursuits, his grace, while on his
                    visit, found himself much at a loss from the want of some small chemical
                    apparatus, which his landlord could not furnish; but the latter happily
                    recollecting young Cullen, mentioned him to the duke as a person who could
                    probably furnish what he wanted. Cullen was accordingly invited to dine, and
                    thus introduced to his grace, who was so much pleased with his knowledge,
                    politeness, and address, that he formed an acquaintance which laid the
                    foundation of Dr Cullen’s future advancement.</p>
                <p>The name of Cullen had by this time become familiar at every table in the
                    neighbourhood, a circumstance which made him known by reputation to the Duke of
                    Hamilton, who then resided for a short time in that part of the country; and his
                    grace having been suddenly taken ill, the assistance of young Cullen was called
                    in. This proved a fortunate occurrence, as it served to promote his advancement
                    to a station in life more suited to his talents than that in which he had
                    hitherto moved.</p>
                <p>The duke was highly delighted with the sprightly character and ingenious
                    conversation of his new acquaintance; and receiving instruction from the latter
                    in a much more pleasing and an infinitely easier way than he had ever before
                    obtained it, the conversation of Cullen proved highly interesting to the duke.
                    Accordingly his grace soon found means to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> his
                    favourite doctor, who was already the esteemed acquaintance of the man through
                    whose hands all preferments in Scotland were obliged to pass, appointed to a
                    place in the university of Glasgow, where his singular talents for discharging
                    the duties of teacher soon became very conspicuous.</p>
                <p>During his residence in the country, however, several important incidents
                    occurred, which ought not to be passed over in silence. It was during this time
                    that a connection in business was formed in a very humble line between two men,
                    who became afterwards eminently conspicuous in much more exalted stations.
                    William, afterwards Dr Hunter, the celebrated lecturer on anatomy in London, was
                    a native of the same part of the country; and not being in affluent
                    circumstances any more than Cullen, these two young men, stimulated by the
                    impulse of genius to prosecute their medical studies with ardour, but thwarted
                    by the narrowness of their fortune, entered into a copartnery business as
                    surgeons and apothecaries in the country. The chief object of their contract
                    being to furnish the parties with the means of prosecuting their medical
                    studies, which they could not so well enjoy separately, it was stipulated that
                    one of them should alternately be allowed to study in whatever college he
                    inclined, during the winter, whilst the other should carry on the business in
                    the country for the common advantage. In consequence of this arrangement, Cullen
                    was first allowed to study in the university of Edinburgh for one winter; but
                    when it came to Hunter’s turn next winter, he preferred London to Edinburgh, and
                    accordingly proceeded to the former place. Here his singular neatness in
                    dissecting, and uncommon dexterity in making anatomical preparations, his
                    assiduity in study, his mildness of manner and pliability of temper, soon
                    recommended him to the notice of Dr Douglas, w ho then read lectures upon
                    anatomy and midwifery, and who engaged Hunter as an assistant in discharging the
                    duties of the chair which the latter afterwards filled with so much honour to
                    himself and satisfaction to the public.</p>
                <p>Thus was dissolved, in a premature manner, a copartnership of as singular a kind
                    as is to be found in the annals of literature; nor was Cullen a man of a
                    disposition to let any engagement with him prove a bar to his partner’s
                    advancement in life. The articles were freely departed from by him; and Cullen
                    and Hunter ever afterwards kept up a very cordial and friendly correspondence,
                    though it is believed they never from that time had a personal interview.</p>
                <p>During the period that Cullen practised as a country surgeon and apothecary, he
                    formed another connection of a more permanent kind, which, happily for him, was
                    not dissolved till a very late period of his life. With the ardour of
                    disposition which he possessed, it cannot be supposed that he beheld the fair
                    sex with indifference. Very early in life he formed a strong attachment for an
                    amiable woman, Miss Johnston, daughter of a clergyman in the neighbourhood; and
                    being nearly of his own age, she was prevailed on to unite her fortune with his,
                    at a time when he had nothing else to recommend him to her except his person and
                    dispositions. After producing to him a numerous family, and participating with
                    him in the changes of fortune which he experienced, she died in the summer of
                    1786.</p>
                <p>In the year 1746, Cullen, who had now taken the degree of doctor in physic, was
                    appointed lecturer in chemistry in the university of Glasgow; and in the month
                    of October he began his lectures on that science. His singular<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194754201" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4201-0533"/> talents for arrangement, his
                    distinctness of enunciation, his vivacity of manner, and his knowledge of the
                    science which he taught, rendered his lectures interesting to the students in a
                    degree till then unknown at the university. He became, therefore, in some
                    measure, the idol ∣of the students. The former professors were eclipsed by the
                    brilliancy of his reputation; and he had to experience :all those little
                    difficulties which envy and disappointed am- !bition naturally threw in his wav.
                    Regardless, however, of these secret chagrins, he pressed forward with ardour in
                    his literary career; and, supported by the favour of the public, he consoled
                    himself for the contumely which he ιmet with from a few individuals. His
                    practice as a physician increased from day to day; and a vacancy having occurred
                    in the year 1751, he was then appointed by the iking professor of medicine in
                    that university. This new appointment served only to call forth his powers, and
                    to bring to light talents which he was not formerly known to possess; so that
                    his fame continued to increase.</p>
                <p>About this period the patrons of the university of Edinburgh being constantly on
                    the watch for the most eminent medical men to support the rising fame of their
                    college, their attention was soon directed towards Cullen; and on the death of
                    Dr Plummer, professor of chemistry, he was, in 1756, unanimously invited to fill
                    the vacant chair. This invitation he accepted; and having resigned his
                    employments in Glasgow, he, in the month of October of that year, commenced his
                    academical career in Edinburgh, where he resided till his death.</p>
                <p>If the admission of Cullen into the university of Glasgow gave great spirit to
                    the exertions of the students, this was, if possible, still more strongly felt
                    in Edinburgh. Chemistry, which till that time had been of small account in our
                    university, and attended to by very few of the students, instantly became a
                    favourite study; and the lectures upon this science were more frequented than
                    any others in the university, anatomy alone excepted. The students in general
                    spoke of Cullen with the rapturous ardour which is natural to youth when they
                    are highly pleased. But as these eulogiums appeared extravagant to moderate men,
                    and could not fail to prove disgusting to bis colleagues, a party was formed
                    among the students or opposing this new favourite of the public; and, by
                    misrepresenting the doctrines of Cullen to those who could ιot have an
                    opportunity of hearing those doctrines themselves, they induced some even of the
                    most intelligent nen in the university to think it their duty publicly to oppose
                    these imaginary tenets. The ferment was thus augmented; and some time elapsed
                    before the professors liscovered the arts by which they had been imposed ιpon,
                    and before harmony was restored.</p>
                <p>During this ferment Cullen went steadily forward, with- &gt;ut taking any part
                    whatever in these disputes. He never ;ave ear to tales respecting his
                    colleagues, nor took noice of the doctrines which they taught; and although ome
                    of their unguarded strictures may at times have :ome to his knowledge, these
                    seemed to make no impres-ion whatever on his mind.</p>
                <p>The attempts of a party of students to lower the cha-deter of Cullen at his first
                    outset in the university of Edinburgh having proved fruitless, his fame as a
                    profes-or, and his reputation as a physician, became more and nore extensive
                    every day. Nor could it well be other-rise. Cullen’s professional knowledge was
                    always great, nd his manner of lecturing singularly clear and intelli-ible,
                    lively and entertaining; whilst to his patients his eneral conduct as a
                    physician was so pleasing, his address o affable and engaging, and his manner so
                    open, kind, nd little regulated by pecuniary considerations, that it as
                    impossible for those who had occasion to avail themselves once of his medical
                    assistance, ever to be satisfied on any future occasion without it. He became
                    the friend and companion of every family he visited, and his future acquaintance
                    could not be dispensed with.</p>
                <p>The general conduct of Cullen to his students waá excellent. With all whom he
                    observed to be attentive and diligent he formed an early acquaintance, by
                    inviting them in small parties at a time to sup with him, conversing with them
                    on these occasions with the most engaging ease, and freely entering with them on
                    the subject of their studies, their amusements, their difficulties, their hopes,
                    and future prospects. In this way he usually invited the whole of his numerous
                    class, till he had made himself acquainted with their abilities, their private
                    character, and their particular objects of pursuit. Those amongst them whom he
                    found the most assiduous, the best disposed, or the most friendless, he invited
                    the most frequently, till an intimacy was gradually formed, which proved highly
                    beneficial to them. Their doubts with regard to their objects of study he
                    listened to with attention, and solved with the most obliging condescension. His
                    library, which consisted of an excellent assortment of the best books,
                    especially on medical subjects, was at all times open for their accommodation;
                    and his advice, in every case of difficulty to them, they had it always in their
                    power to obtain. They seemed to be his family; and few persons of distinguished
                    merit left the. university of Edinburgh in his time, with whom he did not keep
                    up a correspondence till they were fairly established in business. By these
                    means lie came to have a most accurate knowledge of the state of every country,
                    with respect to practitioners in the medical line; and the only use he made of
                    this knowledge was to direct students in their choice of places, where they
                    might have an opportunity of engaging in business with a reasonable prospect of
                    'Success.</p>
                <p>'Nor was it in this way only that he befriended the students <hi
                    rend="superscript"> s</hi> atthe university of Edinburgh. Possessing a
                    benevolence oSmind which made him ever think first of the wants of others, and
                    recollecting the difficulties which he had himself had to struggle with in his
                    younger days, he was at all times singularly attentive to their pecuniary
                    concerns. From his general acquaintance among the students, and the friendly
                    habits he cultivated with many of them, he found no difficulty in discovering
                    those among them who were in’ rather embarrassed circumstances, without being
                    obliged to hurt their delicacy in any degree. To such persons, when their habits
                    of study admitted of it, he was peculiarly attentive. They were more frequently
                    invited to his house than others; they were treated with more than usual
                    kindness and familiarity; they were conducted to his library, and encouraged by
                    the most delicate address to borrow from it freely whatever books he thought
                    they had occasion for ;—and as persons in these circumstances were usually more
                    backward in this respect than others, books were sometimes pressed upon them by
                    the doctor insisting on having their opinion of such or such passages they had
                    not read, and desiring them to carry the book home for that purpose. In short,
                    he behaved to them rather as if he courted their company, and stood in need of
                    their acquaintance, than otherwise; and he thus raised them in the opinion of
                    their acquaintance to a much higher degree of estimation than they could
                    otherwise have obtained; conduct which, to persons whose minds were depressed by
                    penury, and whose sense of honour was sharpened by the consciousness of an
                    inferiority of a certain kind, proved singularly engaging. In this way they were
                    inspired with a secret sense of dignity, which elevated their minds, and excited
                    an uncommon ardour of pursuit, instead of that melancholy inactivity <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194754214" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4214-0534"/> which is so
                    natural in such circumstances, and which too 1 often leads to despair. Nor was
                    he less delicate in the man- 1 ner of supplying their wants, than attentive to
                    discover them. He often found out some polite excuse for refusing i to take
                    payment for a first course, and never was at a loss for ∣ one as to an after
                    course. Before they could have an opportunity of applying for a ticket, he would
                    sometimes lead the conversation to a subject which had occurred in the course of
                    his lectures; and as his lectures were never put in writing by himself, he would
                    beg the favour to see their notes, if he knew they had been taken with
                    attention, under a pretext of assisting his memory. Sometimes he expressed a
                    wish to have their opinion of a particular part of his course, and presented
                    them with a ticket for that purpose; and sometimes he refused to take payment,
                    under the pretext that they had not received his full course the preceding year,
                    part of it having been necessarily omitted for want of time, which he meant to
                    include in this course. By such delicate address, in which he greatly excelled,
                    he took care to forerun their wants; and thus he not only gave them the benefit
                    of his own lectures, but by refusing to take their money, he also enabled them
                    to attend those of others which were necessary to complete their course of
                    studies. Such were the devices he adopted towards individuals to whom economy
                    was necessary; but it was a general rule with him, never to take money from any
                    student for more than two courses of the same set of lectures, permitting him to
                    attend these lectures gratis as many years longer as he pleased.</p>
                <p>The first lectures which Cullen delivered in Edinburgh were on chemistry; and for
                    many years he also gave clinical lectures on the cases which occurred in the
                    Royal Infirmary. In the month of February 1763, Dr Alston died, after having
                    begun his usual course of lectures on the materia medica; and the magistrates of
                    Edinburgh, as patrons of that professorship in the university, appointed Dr
                    Cullen to the chair, requesting that he would finish the course of lectures
                    which had been begun for that season. This he agreed to do; and though he was
                    under the necessity of going on with the course in a few days after he was
                    nominated, he did not once think of reading the lectures of his predecessor, but
                    resolved to deliver an entirely new course of his own. The popularity of Cullen
                    at this time may be guessed by the increase of students who came to attend his
                    course in addition to the eight or ten who had entered to Dr Alston. The new
                    students exceeded a hundred. An imperfect copy of these lectures, thus
                    fabricated in haste, having been published, the doctor thought it necessary to
                    give a more correct edition of them in the latter part of his life. But his
                    faculties being then much impaired, his friends looked in vain for those
                    striking beauties which had characterised his literary exertions in the prime of
                    life.</p>
                <p>Some years afterwards, on the death of Dr White, the magistrates once more
                    appointed Dr Cullen to give lectures in his stead on the theory of physic; and
                    it was on this occasion that Dr Cullen thought it expedient to resign the
                    chemical chair in favour of Dr Black, his former pupil, whose talents in that
                    department of science were then well known, and who filled the chair till his
                    death with great satisfaction to the public. Soon afterwards, on the death of Dr
                    Rutherford, who for many years had given lectures with applause on the practice
                    of physic, Dr John Gregory having become a candidate for this situation along
                    with Dr Cullen, a sort of compromise took place between them, by which they
                    agreed each to give lectures alternately on the theory and on the practice of
                    physic during their joint lives, reserving to the survivor to hold either of the
                    classes he should prefer. In consequence of this agreement, Dr Cullen delivered
                    the first course of ectures on the practice of physic in the winter of 1766, and
                    )r Gregory succeeded him in that branch the following rear. Never perhaps was a
                    literary arrangement entered nto which could have proved' more beneficial to the
                    stillen ts than this. Both these men possessed great talents, hough of a kind
                    extremely dissimilar. Both of them had certain failings or defects, which the
                    other was aware of. and counteracted. Each of them knew and respected the
                    talents of the other. They co-operated, therefore, in the happiest manner, to
                    enlarge the understanding, and to forward the pursuits of their pupils. But
                    unfortunately this arrangement was soon put an end to by the unexpected death of
                    Dr Gregory, who was cut off in the flower of life by a sudden and unforeseen
                    event. After this time, Cullen continued to give lectures on the practice of
                    physic till a few months before his death, which happened on the 5th of February
                    1790, in the seventy-seventh year of his age.</p>
                <p>In his prelections Dr Cullen never attempted to read. His lectures were delivered
                    <hi rend="italic">viva voce,</hi> without having been previously put into
                    writing, or thrown into any particular arrangement. The vigour of his mind was
                    such, that nothing more was necessary than a few short notes before him, merely
                    to prevent him from varying from the general order which he had been accustomed
                    to observe. This gave to his discourses an ease, a vivacity, a variety, and a
                    force, which are rarely to be met with in academical discourses. His lectures
                    upon the same subject, therefore, were never exactly the same. Their general
                    tenor indeed was not much varied; but the particular illustrations were always
                    new, well suited to the circumstances which attracted the general attention of
                    the day, and were delivered in the particular way which accorded with the cast
                    of mind the prelector found himself in at the time. To these circumstances must
                    be ascribed that energetic, artless elocution, which rendered his lectures so
                    generally captivating to his hearers. Even those who could not follow him in the
                    extensive views which his penetrating mind glanced at, or who were not able to
                    understand the apt allusions to collateral objects which he could only point at
                    rapidly as he went along, could not help being warmed in some measure by the
                    vivacity of his manner. But to those who followed him in his rapid career, the
                    ideas he suggested were so numerous, the views he laid open were so extensive,
                    and the objects to be attained were so important, that every active faculty of
                    the mind was roused; and such an ardour of enthusiasm was excited in the
                    prosecution of study, as appeared to be perfectly inexplicable to those who were
                    merely unconcerned spectators. In consequence of this unshackled freedom in the
                    composition and delivery of his lectures, every circumstance was in the nicest
                    unison with the tone of voice and expression of countenance which the particular
                    cast of his mind at the time inspired.</p>
                <p>It would seem as if Dr Cullen had considered the proper business of a preceptor
                    to be that of putting his pupils into a proper train of study, so as to enable
                    them to prosecute those studies at a future period, and to carry them on much
                    farther than the short time allowed for academical prelections would admit. He
                    did not, therefore, strive so much to make those who attended his lectures
                    deeply versed in the particular details of a subject, as to give them a general
                    view of the whole; to show them what had already been attained respecting it; to
                    point out what remained yet to be discovered; and to put them in a train of
                    study which should enable them at a future period to remove those difficulties
                    which had hitherto obstructed our progress, and thus to advance to higher
                    degrees of perfection. And if these were his views, nothing could be more
                    happily adapted to them than the mode which he invariably pursued. He first
                    drew, with the striking touches<pb break="no" facs="nls:194754227"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4227-0535"/> of a master, a rapid and general outline of the
                    subject, by which the whole figure was seen at once to start boldly from the
                    canvass, distinct in all its parts, and unmixed with any other object. He then
                    began anew to retrace the picture, to touch up the lesser parts, and to finish
                    the whole in as perfect a manner as the state of knowledge at the time would
                    permit. Where materials were wanting, the picture remained imperfect. The wants
                    were thus rendered obvious; and the means of supplying them were pointed out
                    with the most careful discrimination. The student, whenever he looked back to
                    the subject, perceived the defects; and his hopes being awakened, he felt an
                    irresistible impulse to explore that hitherto untrodden path which had been
                    pointed out to him, and to fill up the chasm which still yawned. Thus were the
                    active faculties of the mind most powerfully excited; and instead of labouring
                    himself to supply deficiencies which far exceeded the power of any one man to
                    accomplish, he set thousands at work to fulfil the task, and put them in a train
                    of going on with the work. Dr Cullen died on the 5th February 1790, in the
                    seventy-seventh year of his age. His external appearance, though striking, was
                    not elegant, but nevertheless pleasing. His countenance was expressive, and his
                    eye remarkably lively and penetrating. In his person he was tall and thin, but
                    he stooped very much. When he walked he had a contemplative look, and seemed
                    insensible to what was passing around him.*</p>
