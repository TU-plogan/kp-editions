                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">CYANOMETER</label>, a word compounded from the Greek,
                    signifying a measure of the intensity of blue. On high mountains the sky appears
                    of a deeper blue than on the plain, because there the air contains a smaller
                    proportion of opaque vapour. In order to have a comparable specimen of the shade
                    o’f blue of the sky, at different times and at different places, Saussure
                    contrived the cyanometer. It consists of pieces of paper of three quarters of an
                    inch by half an inch, each coloured with a different shade of Prussian blue. The
                    piece number 1 is coloured of a very light shade, differing in so small a degree
                    from white that it is not distinguishable from white at a distance at which a
                    black circular spot of one line and three quarters in diameter becomes
                    invisible. The piece number 2 is of a shade of blue a little darker than number
                    1, so that it is not to be distinguished from number 1 when viewed from the
                    distance before determined by the black spot. The other pieces are coloured with
                    shades of blue successively darker, each being undistinguishable from that which
                    precedes it when at the distance ascertained by the black spot. The darkest
                    piece differs little from black, and is not to be distinguished from black at
                    the ascertained distance. The series begins with a white piece and ends with a
                    black one. Including these two, the whole number of pieces is fifty-one; and
                    these pieces are pasted close to each other, and in succession from the lightest
                    to the darkest, round the border of a circular piece of pasteboard.</p>
                <p>The colour of the sky is ascertained by holding up this pasteboard, and comparing
                    it with the sky in an open place. If this comparison were made from a window,
                    the coloured pasteboard would not receive all the light from the sky, but would
                    be illuminated in part by the light reflected from the building. The direct
                    light of the sun should not fall on the cyanometer, as the instrument ought to
                    be used in similar circumstances, and the direct light of the sun cannot always
                    be had.</p>
                <p>The colour of the sky depends on the quantity of opaque vapour in the air. The
                    less vapour there is, the darker is the colour of the sky. If the air were
                    entirely free from . opaque vapour, the sky would appear black. The particles of
                    opaque vapour in the air reflect chiefly the blue rays, and thus give rise to
                    the blue colour of the sky. The colour of the sky at the zenith is darker than
                    at the horizon, because the quantity of vapour through which the eye looks at
                    the horizon is greater than at the zenith.</p>
                <p>Saussure observed, that on the summit of the Col du Géant, from four in the
                    morning to six, the colour of the sky at the zenith became darker by eleven
                    shades. During the next four hours it became darker by four shades; at ten it
                    was at the darkest, and continued so till eleven; from eleven to six it became
                    lighter by six shades; and from six to eight it became lighter by twelve shades.
                    The colour of the sky during the night was light blue. A cyanometer was observed
                    at Chamouni, and another at the same time at Geneva; the shades and the change
                    of shades at the same hours were different in each, and different also from
                    those observed on the Col du Géant. At Geneva the colour of the sky was darkest
                    from ten to twelve, as on the Col du Géant. In the morning the colour of the sky
                    is not much deeper on the Col du Géant than on the plain at Geneva, which shows
                    that the air on the mountain is then as much loaded with opaque vapour as on the
                    plain. In the evening the colour of the sky is lighter on the Col du Géant than
                    at Geneva; the quantity of opaque vapour therefore is greater at that time of
                    the day in the zenith of the Col du Géant than in the zenith of the plain. In
                    the middle of the day the colour of the sky is much darker on the Col du Géant
                    than it is on the plain, which shows that the quantity of opaque vapour is at
                    that hour less than on the plain. Hence it appears that the mid-day sun has a
                    great effect in rarefying the opaque vapours on high mountains, and that it does
                    not diminish in so great a degree the quantity of opaque vapour on less elevated
                    plains. Saussure, <hi rend="italic">Description du Cyanometre, Mem. de
