                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">CUTLERY</label>, generally speaking, includes all cutting
                    tools made of steel. Various countries and cities have at different periods
                    excelled in the manufacture of some particular article, as Damascus for a
                    beautiful sword blade, which has hitherto baffled all attempts at imitation. If
                    this blade is made, as is commonly supposed, by welding together extremely fine
                    wires of iron, steel, and gold, laid alternately on each other, the dexterity
                    required is such as must astonish the most active and experienced workmen of
                    other countries. The peculiar wave, usually called the water, so universally
                    admired, is effected by the application of a weak acid to the polished surface
                    of iron and steel; at Damascus sulphate of alumine is used; but any dilute acid
                    seems to answer the purpose. The cutlery of England is deservedly held in high
                    estimation in every part of the civilized world. The finer articles, as razors,
                    penknives, scissors, and surgical instruments, are made of cast-steel, that is,
                    steel purified and equalized by fusion. Dexterity and nice attention on the part
                    of the workman to a variety of circumstances, as the quality of the steel,
                    nature of the fuel, accuracy in the processes of hardening and tempering, and
                    many other minor considerations, are essential to the production of a good
                    cutting instrument. Wootz, a steel from India, has been <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194754630" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4630-0566"/>most successfully employed.
                    For table-knives, and all cutlery of that description, sheer-steel is generally
                    used; the tang and shoulder of the table-knife and fork are iron, united to the
                    blade by welding.</p>
                <p>The principal manufactories in England are at London and Sheffield; the former
                    are chiefly confined to articles of fine cutlery, as razors, penknives, and the
                    like, and the making of surgical instruments belongs almost exclusively to it.
                    This important branch of the trade is there carried to a very high state of
                    perfection. Describing the process of making any one blade, a razor for
                    instance, will suffice for most other articles of cutlery. The workman being
                    furnished with a bar of cast-steel, forges his blade, using a forge similar to
                    that of a smith; the brow of his anvil and his hammer being convex, enable him
                    to give to the blade a degree of concavity which greatly facilitates and
                    accelerates the subsequent work of grinding. The blade is then fashioned more
                    exactly with a file. It is again heated to a cherry-red colour, and instantly
                    quenched in a cold fluid, commonly water. In this stage the blade is extremely
                    hard, and requires to be tempered; a process usually performed by brightening
                    one side, then heating it over a fire free from flame and smoke, until the
                    brightened surface assumes a straw colour. It is again quenched, and is then
                    ready for grinding. As this method of tempering is liable to many objections, a
                    tempering-bath, with thermometer, will be described, the superior advantages of
                    which appear too obvious for comment. But it now remains to grind and polish the
                    blade; and this is so generally understood as hardly to need explanation. The
                    diameter of the stone is chosen according to the degree of concavity required;
                    and in polishing, care is necessary to avoid heating the blade by friction,
                    which would render it useless. In London, the blade is generally the production
                    of one workman, who is accountable for the whole manipulation, and who, if the
                    work is faulty, can transfer no blame to another. At Sheffield, by division of
                    labour, and the local advantages of coal and water to carry on extensive
                    machinery, more dispatch is attained,,and the manufacture afforded at a price
                    considerably below that of London. Numerous attempts have been made to preserve
                    from rust that beautiful polish given to the cutlery of England; the most
                    effectual method is to coat the surface with ethereal solution of gold, or, what
                    is still better, with muriate of platina. The late Mr Stodart has given his
                    method of preparing and using these solutions in the eleventh volume of
                    Nicholson’s <hi rend="italic">Journal.</hi> The process is interesting,
                    independently of its utility, as a chemical experiment, proving the almost
                    infinite divisibility of gold.</p>
                <p>It is worth mentioning, that the iron procured from meteoric stones is less
                    susceptible of oxidation than any other. This is most probably owing to its
                    being combined with nickel. Perhaps by artificially combining the two metals, we
                    might obtain an alloy valuable for making instruments that, from necessity, are
                    exposed to moisture. Having objected to the common method of hardening and
                    tempering steel, on which process the excellence of the instruments so much
                    depends, we proceed to state some improvements in that art. The method of
                    tempering with a thermometer was practised by Mr Stodart with perfect success.
                    The following experiment is simple, and clearly exhibits and illustrates this
                    manner of tempering. Let a plate of steel finely polished be so laid as to float
                    on the surface of a bath of mercury, or of the fusible alloy of tin, lead, and
                    bismuth; into the bath plunge the bulb of a thermometer, graduated up to 600°
                    Fahrenheit; a good argand will heat the bath. No change of colour will be
                    visible on the steel until the mercury has risen to 430°, and it will then be so
                    faint as only to be perceptible by comparison with a plate that has not been
                    heated. At 450° the colour will be a fine pale straw, which, as the heat
                    increases, will become deeper, and successive changes will take place until it
                    be heated up to the boiling point of mercury.</p>
                <p>The advantages of this mode of tempering will now appear obvious and conclusive.
                    If, for example, a straw colour indicates the best temper for a penknife, the
                    blade, or ten thousand blades, are suffered to remain in the bath until the
                    thermometer rises to the number corresponding to that colour, when they are
                    instantly removed from further increase of heat, and, consequently, are all of
                    one temper. After the first experiment, it is unnecessary for the bath to be
                    metallic—oil will answer the purpose equally well.</p>
                <p>The late Mr Nicoson, who devoted much attention to the subject of steel, used, in
                    hardening delicate articles, a bath of lead; and a metallic bath may, perhaps,
                    frequently be advantageous in hardening as well as in tempering. Á very
                    ingenious method of hardening steel work was communicated to Mr Stodart by Dr
                    Wollaston. The steel is inclosed in a tube, surrounded by the well-known fusible
                    alloy of eight parts lead, two tin, and five bismuth. The tube, with its
                    contents, is heated in a furnace to redness, and then plunged into a cooling
                    fluid. It is afterwards thrown into boiling water, by which the alloy is fused,
                    and the steel is left perfectly hardened, and unaltered by twisting, cracking,
                    or in any way changing its shape. Several experiments have been made to
                    ascertain the best cooling fluid, without any very satisfactory result A large
                    quantity of water cooled down to about 40° Fahrenheit seems to answer as well as
                    any thing hitherto tried. Mr Stodart quenched a scalpel in snow and muriate of
                    lime, without perceiving any advantage from the extreme cold.</p>
                <p>Having mentioned the wootz of India as valuable for fine articles of cutlery, a
                    brief account of it may be acceptable. For the introduction of wootz into this
                    country, we are indebted to the late Sir Joseph Banks, who submitted some of it
                    to the experiments of intelligent workmen in the year 1795. -It was soon found
                    to contain valuable properties. From the cake (as the lump is called in the
                    state in which it is imported) a small penknife was made. The forging was
                    attended with considerable difficulty, partly owing to the unmanageable form of
                    the cake, but more especially to the inequality of the mass; the steely
                    principle being deficient in some parts, whilst others were quite overcharged
                    with it. The penknife, however, proved excellent, and fully justified and
                    encouraged further trials. The inequality in the mass was evidently owing to
                    imperfect fusion, which defect will most likely remain until the Indian
                    steel-maker is acquainted with the formation and management of a proper furnace.
                    If he was likewise instructed to pour the fluid metal into a mould instead of
                    allowing it to crystallize in the crucible, and afterwards to form it into bars
                    with a tilt-hammer, it might be imported in the shape of English cast-steel, and
                    probably at a price not greatly exceeding that article. The Indian account of
                    wootz-making is the following. Pieces of forged iron are inclosed in a crucible
                    with wood, and heated together in a furnace; the fire is urged by three or more
                    bellows peculiar to the country; thus the wood is charred, the iron fused, and
                    at the same time converted into steel. The metal is suffered to crystallize in
                    the crucible, and in this state it is imported. This method of steel-making is
                    neat and ingenious. Its chief peculiarity consists in the wood not being
                    previously charred, its apparent defect in the fusion not being complete. When
                    wootz is submitted to. a second and more perfect fusion, it improves so much as
                    scarcely to be recognised. This advantageous change is evidently owing to the
                    whole mass being purified and equalized when in a state as thin <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194754643" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4643-0567"/>as water. It is now fit for
                    all purposes of fine cutlery, and is in fact infinitely superior to the best
                    cast steel of England. Is this owing to the use of uncharred wood, or is it not
                    rather, as suspected by Mr Stodart, owing to some particular property of the
                    iron ore of India highly favourable to steel-making? The present state of
                    chemical knowledge does not militate against the supposition, that this steel
                    maybe alloyed with one or more of the metals of the earth. We know that a very
                    minute quantity of one metal is capable of producing extraordinary effects by
                    combining with another. Sir Humphry Davy’s discovery is a fine example of this,
                    namely, that mercury is rendered solid, and has its specific gravity diminished
                    from 13 to 3, by combination with ammonium. Wootz requires from the workman
                    every attention and care in forging. If overheated it is useless. In hardening,
                    it should be quenched at a cherry red colour, and, in tempering, be heated from
                    thirty to forty degrees higher than our best cast steel. Thus if a razor of
                    cast-steel should be removed from the bath at 460°, one of wootz may remain to
                    500°, and even then it will be the hardest of the two. Notwithstanding its
                    excellence, this steel has hitherto been little used by cutlers.</p>
                <p>Wehave already mentioned a branch of cutlery, which, from its importance to the
                    cause of humanity, claims some further notice. Knives and other edge instruments
                    for surgical operations, made and finished in the very best manner, are indeed
                    invaluable. When fortunately the form and physical properties of the instrument
                    are exactly to the wish of the operator, he is freed from many embarrassments
                    inseparably connected with a bad or an indifferent instrument, consequently the
                    sufferings of the patient are lessened both in intensity and duration. This
                    truly desirable state of excellence is confessedly of difficultattainment. The
                    choicest pieces of steel should be carefully selected (that from India merits a
                    preference), and the skill and undivided attention of the best workman devoted
                    to the whole manipulation of forging, hardening, tempering, grinding, and
                    polishing. By want of ability or diligence during these' various processes, the
                    knife may be rendered totally unfit for the purposes for which it was intended.
                    Finishing the edge, technically termed setting, is a work of much delicacy and
                    skill. Very few acquire this art in the highest degree of perfection. The artist
                    must be in a situation undisturbed by noise or conversation, and his attention
                    must be exclusively devoted to the object on which he is engaged. This very nice
                    and delicate process is performed on a hone moistened with fine oil. The best
                    are from Germany. They are imported in large quantities; not many, however, of
                    superior quality can be selected. The very finest of these are still inadequate
                    to give the last finish to the edge. This is performed on a beautiful green
                    stone, found in some parts of the old pavement of London; the only known
                    material capable of giving perfect smoothness to the points of lancets and other
                    delicate instruments. These points, when made and finished in the very best
                    manner, will perforate a thin piece of leather, by which they are usually
                    proved, with such case and facility, that no more resistance is sensibly felt,
                    or noise made, than would be if the point was dropped into a fluid, as water or
                    oil. Nothing short of this proof of excellence is satisfactory; mediocrity
                    cannot, at least ought not, to be admitted. These observations apply generally
                    to every description of knife used in surgery; but the nature of each particular
                    operation should be considered, in judging of the requisite degree of strength
                    or delicacy of edge. Next in importance to the knives are the saws used in
                    surgery. All of these must be of the best spring temper, which, for the
                    cast-steel blade, is about 570° of Fahrenheit, and for one of Indian steel 600°,
                    or quite the boiling point of mercury. Of another class of instruments, namely,
                    those denominated blunt, it will be sufficient to observe, that what is known by
                    the name of sheer steel is best adapted for the purpose. Case-hardened iron has
                    been most improperly used, this hardening being very superficial. It is, in
                    fact, converting the surface only into steel, by heating it to redness, in a
                    close vessel, in contact with animal coal, such as charred bone, leather, or
                    horn, and quenching it when red hot in a cold fluid. Iron thus treated will take
                    a beautiful polish; but, except for ornamental purposes, it ought never, to be
                    employed. Some instruments are necessarily made of gold or silver, as catheters,
                    and other tubes and probes. When for these ductility is required, the metals
                    should be unalloyed; the extra expense will be more than compensated by the
                    convenience of giving to the instruments, in all cases, the desired curve and
                    form. The elastic catheter consists of a tube of wove silk, coated with a fine
                    varnish, pretty generally supposed to be made from caoutchouc, or Indian rubber.
                    This material, doubtless, forms a component in the varnish; alone it will not
                    answer, as, in using, it would soon be partially decomposed; but when digested
                    with the letharge of lead and linseed oil, it forms a varnish of great beauty,
                    elasticity, and durability, exactly adapted to make the fine surface of the
                    elastic catheter. Tiιese valuable instruments were invented and first made at
                    Paris. They are now manufactured in London, and finished in the most exquisite
                    manner.</p>
                <p>The handles of instruments, together with all ornamental parts, must in a great
                    measure depend on the taste and choice of the purchaser. It would be well,
                    however, to avoid such materials as are known to produce chemical action when in
                    contact with polished steel. Ivory and mother-of-pearl are objectionable, as is
                    ebony, although much used. The fine walnut-tree, such as the London gunmakers
                    employ, is perhaps of all the woods the best for the purpose. Sandal-wood
                    answers very well, although it by no means deserves all the credit which has
                    been given to it as a preservative of steel from rust. The instrument-maker who
                    wishes to excel will do well to avail himself of every opportunity of witnessing
                    the operative part of surgery; he can then judge how far the instrument is
                    mechanically and physically adapted to its purpose; and, if imperfect, he is
                    better able to make the requisite alteration.</p>
                <p>British cutlery has deservedly obtained a high degree of reputation in almost
                    every part of the civilized world; and it is of vast importance to the
                    commercial interests of the country that its character should be preserved and
                    rendered permanent. It must not, however, be concealed, that some danger does
                    exist of this branch of our manufacture suffering from the use of very improper
                    materials, from which considerable quantities are fabricated. Thus a patent was
                    obtained by a Sheffield manufacturer for a process of casting cutlery from a
                    species of pig iron. This iron is, from the superabundance of its carbon, highly
                    susceptible of liquidity, and readily cast into the required form. In this state
                    the cast-iron cutlery is extremely hard, and as brittle as glass; but it is
                    reduced from this hardness by decomposition, being subjected to a strong and
                    long-continued fire in close vessels; and, in contact with iron ore, oxide of
                    iron, or any substance containing oxygen, with which the superabundant carbon
                    combines, when kept at a high temperature, and flics off in the state of
                    carbonic acid gas. In this way, table-knives, forks, razors, scissors,
                    penknives, and other articles are cast, saving all the labour of forging from
                    the bar by the hammer.</p>
                <p>This cast-iron cutlery is, when finished, not always, in appearance,
                    distinguishable from that made at the forge; and as it can be afforded at a much
                    lower price, it ought, in common justice, to be specifically marked as <hi
                    rend="italic">cast iron»</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:194754656"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4656-0568"/>This very fusible iron maybe advantageously
                    applied to many purposes. It is hardly necessary to add, that it is altogether
                    unfit for any description of edge instrument.</p>
