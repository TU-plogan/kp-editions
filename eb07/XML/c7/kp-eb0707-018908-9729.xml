                    habitude, and natural disposition of the body; but more often the colour of the
                    face and skin.</p>
                <p>Few questions in philosophy have engaged the attention of naturalists more than
                    the diversities among the human species, among which that of colour is the most
                    remarkable. The great differences in this respect have given occasion to several
                    authors to assert that the whole human race have not sprung from one original,
                    but that as many different species of men were at first created as there are now
                    different colours to be found among them. It is certainly a matter of no small
                    difficulty to account for the remarkable variations of colour that are to be
                    found among different nations. On this subject Dr Blunter published a thesis, in
                    which he considers the matter more accurately than has commonly been done, and
                    determines absolutely against any specific difference among mankind. He
                    introduces his subject by observing, that when the question has been agitated,
                    whether all the human race constituted only one species or not, much confusion
                    has arisen from the sense in which the term <hi rend="italic">species</hi> has
                    been adopted. He therefore thinks it necessary to set out with a definition of
                    the term. He includes under the same species all those animals which produce
                    issue capable of propagating others resembling the original stock from whence
                    they sprung. This definition he illustrates, by having recourse to the human
                    species as an example; and, in this sense of the term, he concludes that all of
                    them are to be considered as belonging to the same species. And as, in the case
                    of plants, one species comprehends several varieties depending upon climate,
                    soil, culture, and similar accidents; so he considers the diversities of the
                    human race to be merely varieties of the same species, produced by natural
                    causes. Of the different colours observable among mankind, he gives the
                    following view :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Black.</hi> Africans under the line.</p>

                    Europe; as Sicilians and Spaniards, as well as the Abyssinians in Africa.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">White.</hi> Most of the European nations; as,</p>

                <p>Inhabitants of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <p>In attempting to investigate the causes of these differences, our author
                    observes, that there can be no dispute of the seat of colour being placed in the
                    skin; that it is not <pb break="no" facs="nls:194749742"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-9742-0190"/>even extended over the whole of this, but confined
                    to that part named the cuticle, consisting of the epidermis and reticulum; and
                    that it chiefly occupies the latter of these. The cuticle is much thicker and
                    harder in black than in white people; the reticulum in the latter being a thin
                    mucus, in the former a thick membrane. He concludes that this seat of colour in
                    the whites is transparent, and either totally deprived of vessels, or only
                    furnished with very few; as the yellow colour appearing in jaundice vanishes on
                    the cause of the disease being removed, which is not the case with stains in the
                    cuticle from gunpowder or similar causes. He next points out three causes
                    destroying the pellucidity of the cuticle, giving it a brown colour, and
                    rendering it thicker. These are, access of air, nastiness, and the heat of the
                    sun. The influence of each of these he proves by many examples, and from them he
                    is inclined to consider the last as by much the most powerful. If, however, it
                    be admitted that these causes have this effect, he thinks that all the diversity
                    of colour which is to be observed among mankind may be thus accounted for. He
                    remarks that all the inhabitants of the torrid zone incline more or less to a
                    black colour. When we observe the differences which occur among them, we must at
                    the same time remember that a black colour is not referred to heat alone, but to
                    the other causes also; and when we attend to the diversity of temperature that
                    occurs even in the torrid zone, the existence of a white nation there would by
                    no means destroy the argument. He is further of opinion that the existence of a
                    brown colour, and of considerable varieties from white, in the northern and
                    coldest parts of Europe, may very easily be explained. This he accounts for from
                    the manner of life of the inhabitants, by which they are either exposed to the
                    inclemency of the air, or to constant nastiness from smoky houses.</p>
                <p>Having thus attempted to account, from natural causes, for the varieties which
                    occur among mankind with respect to colour, our author observes that, to all
                    this reasoning an objection will naturally be made from considering that infants
                    bring these marks into the world along with them, before they can be exposed to
                    any such causes. Dr Hunter imagines, however, that this may readily be explained
                    upon the supposition that many peculiarities acquired by parents are transmitted
                    to their posterity; and of this he thinks no one can entertain the least doubt
                    who attends to hereditary diseases. Thus gout, scrofula, mania, and many other
                    affections, although at first induced by particular accidents, will continue to
                    affect families for many generations. In the same manner a parent exposed to
                    causes destroying the natural whiteness of his complexion will beget swarthy
                    children; and the same causes continuing to operate upon the son, the blackness
                    will be increased. Thus all the different shades may have been at first induced,
                    and afterwards continued.</p>
                <p>The subject of complexion has been very well illustrated by Mr Clarkson, in a
                    dissertation introduced in bis essay on the commerce and slavery of the human
                    species. The first point that occurs to be ascertained is, what part of the skin
                    is the seat of colour? The old anatomists usually divide the skin into two parts
                    or laminae; the exterior and thinnest, called by the Greeks <hi rend="italic"
                    >epidermis,</hi> by the Homans <hi rend="italic">cuticula,</hi> and hence by us
                    <hi rend="italic">cuticle</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the interior, called
                    by the former <hi rend="italic">derma,</hi> and by the latter <hi rend="italic"
                    >cutis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">true skin.</hi> Hence they must necessarily
                    have supposed that, as the true skin was in every respect the same in all human
                    subjects, however various their external hue, so the seat of colour must have
                    existed in the cuticle or upper surface.</p>
                <p>Malpighi, an eminent Italian physician of the last century, was the first person
                    who discovered that the skin was divided into three laminae or parts, the
                    cuticle, the true skin, and a certain coagulated substance situated between
                    both, which he distinguished by the title of n&gt;⅛ rowcoíWMř,· which coagulated
                    substance adhered so firmly to the cuticle as, in all former anatomical
                    preparations, to have come off with it, and from this circumstance to have led
                    the ancient anatomists to believe that there were but two laminae or divisible
                    portions in the human skin.</p>
                <p>This, discovery was sufficient to ascertain the point ⅛ question; for it appeared
                    afterwards that the cuticle, when divided according to this discovery from the
                    other lamina, was semitransparent; that the cuticle of the blackest negro was of
                    the same transparency and colour as that of the purest white; and hence, the
                    true skins of both being invariably the same, that the rete mucosum was the seat
                    of colour.</p>
                <p>This has been further confirmed by all subsequent anatomical experiments, by
                    which it appears that, whatever is the colour of this intermediate coagulated
                    substance, nearly the same is the apparent colour of the upper surface of the
                    skin. Neither can it be otherwise; for the cuticle, from its transparency, must
                    necessarily transmit the colour of the substance beneath it, in the same manner,
                    though not in the same degree, as the cornea transmits the colour of the iris of
                    the eye. This transparency is a matter of ocular demonstration in white people.
                    It is conspicuous in every blush; for no one can imagine that the cuticle
                    becomes red as often as this happens: nor is it less discoverable' in the veins,
                    which are so easy to be discerned; for no one can suppose that the blue streaks
                    which he constantly sees in the fairest complexions are painted, as it waere, on
                    the surface of the upper skin. From these, and a variety of other observations,
                    no maxim is more true in physiology than that on the rete mucosum depends the
                    colour of the human body; or, in other words, that the rete mucosum being of a
                    different colour in different inhabitants of the globe, and appearing through
                    the cuticle or upper surface of the skin, gives them that various appearance
                    which strikes us so forcibly in contemplating the human race.</p>
                <p>As this can be incontrovertibly ascertained, it is evident that, whatever causes
                    co-operate in producing this different appearance, they produce it by acting on
                    the rete mucosum, which, from the almost incredible manner in which the cuticle
                    is perforated, is as accessible as the cuticle itself. These causes are probably
                    those various qualities of things which, combined with the influence of the sun,
                    contribute to form what we call <hi rend="italic">climate.</hi> For when any
                    person considers that the mucous substance before mentioned is found to vary in
                    its colour, as the climates vary from the equator to the poles, his mind must be
                    instantly struck with the hypothesis, and he must adopt it without any
                    hesitation as the genuine cause of the phenomenon.</p>
                <p>This fact of the variation of the mucous substance, according to the situation of
                    the place, has been clearly ascertained in the numerous anatomical experiments
                    that have been made, in which subjects of all nations have come under
                    consideration. The natives of many of the kingdoms and isles of Asia are found
                    to have their rete mucosum black: those of Africa, situated near the line, of
                    the same colour; those of the maritime parts of the same continent of a dusky
                    brown, nearly approaching to it; and the colour becomes lighter or darker in
                    proportion as the distance from the equator is either greater or less. The
                    Europeans are the fairest inhabitants of the world. Those situated in the most
                    southern regions of Europe have in their rete mucosum a tinge of the dark hue of
                    their African neighbours; hence the epidemic complexion prevalent <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194749755" xml:id="kp-eb0707-9755-0191"/>among them is nearly of the
                    colour of the pickled Spanish olive; while in this country, and those situated
                    nearer the north pole, it appears to be nearly, if not absolutely, white.</p>
                <p>These are facts which anatomy has established; and we acknowledge them to be such
                    that we cannot divest ourselves of the idea that climate has a considerable
                    share in producing a difference of colour.</p>
                <p>The only objection of any consequence that has ever been made to the hypothesis
                    of climate is this, that people under the same parallels are not exactly of the
                    same colour. But this is no objection in fact; for it does not follow that those
                    countries which are at an equal distance from the equator should have their
                    climates the same. Indeed nothing is more contrary to experience than this.
                    Climate depends upon a variety of accidents. High mountains in the neighbourhood
                    of a place make it cooler, by chilling the air that is carried over them by the
                    winds. Large spreading succulent plants, if among the productions of the soil,
                    have the same effect; they afford agreeable cooling shades and a moist
                    atmosphere from their continual exhalations, by which the ardour of the sun is
                    considerably abated. While the soil, on the other hand, if of a sandy nature,
                    retains the heat in an uncommon degree, and makes the summers considerably
                    hotter than those which are found to exist in the same latitude where the soil
                    is different. To this proximity of what may be termed <hi rend="italic">burning
                    sands,</hi> and to the sulphureous and metallic particles which are continually
                    exhaling from the bowels of the earth, are ascribed the different degrees of
                    blackness by which some African nations are distinguished from each other,
                    though under the same parallels. To these observations we may add, that though
                    the inhabitants of the same parallel are not exactly of the same hue, yet they
                    differ only by shades of the same colour; or, to speak with more precision, that
                    there are no two people in such a situation, one of whom is white and the other
                    black To sum up the whole, suppose we were to take a common globe, to begin at
                    the equator, to paint every country along the meridian line in succession from
                    thence to the poles, and to paint them with the same colour which prevails in
                    the respective inhabitants of each, we should see the black, with which we had
                    been obliged to begin, insensibly changing to an olive, and the olive, through
                    as many intermediate colours, to a white; and if, on the other hand, we should
                    complete any one of the parallels according to the same plan, we should see a
                    difference perhaps in the appearance of some of the countries through which it
                    ran, though the difference would consist wholly in shades of the same
                    colour.</p>
                <p>The argument, therefore, which is brought against the hypothesis is so far from
                    being an objection, that it may be considered as one of the first arguments in
                    its favour; tor if the climate has really an influence on the mucous substance
                    of the body, it is evident that we must not only expect to see a gradation of
                    colour in the inhabitants from the equator to the poles, but also different
                    shades of the same colour in the inhabitants of the same parallel.</p>
                <p>To this argument may be added one that is incontrovertible, which is, that when
                    the black inhabitants of Africa are transplanted to colder, or the white
                    inhabitants of Europe to hotter climates, their children born there are of a
                    different colour from themselves; that is, lighter in the first, and darker in
                    the second instance. As a proof of the first, we shall give the words of the
                    Abbé Raynal. “The children,” says he, “which they (the Africans) procreate m
                    America, arc not so black as their parents were. After each generation the
                    difference becomes more palpable. It is possible, that after a numerous
                    succession of generations, the men come from Africa would not be distinguished
                    from those of the country into which they may have been transplanted.” This
                    circumstance we have had the pleasure of hearing confirmed by a variety of
                    persons who have been witnesses of the fact; but particularly by many
                    intelligent Africans, who have been parents themselves in America, and who have
                    declared, that the difference is so palpable in the northern provinces, that not
                    only they themselves have constantly observed it, but that they have heard it
                    observed by others.</p>
                <p>Neither is this variation in the children from the colour of the parents
                    improbable. The children of the blackest Africans are born white. In this state
                    they continue for about a month, when they change to a pale yellow. In process
                    of time they become brown. Their skin still continues to increase in darkness
                    with their age, till it becomes of a dirty sallow black; and at length, after a
                    certain period of years, glossy and shining. Now, if climate has any influence
                    on the mucous substance of the body, this variation in the children from the
                    colour of their parents is an event which must be reasonably expected; for being
                    born white, and not having equally powerful causes to act upon them in colder,
                    as their parents had in the hotter climes which they left, it must necessarily
                    follow that the same effect cannot possibly be produced.</p>
                <p>Hence also, if the hypothesis be admitted, may be deduced the reason why even
                    those children who have been brought from their country at an early age into
                    colder regions, have been observed to be of a lighter colour than those who have
                    remained at home till they arrived at a state of manhood. For having undergone
                    some of the changes which we mentioned to have attended their countrymen from
                    infancy to a certain age, and having been taken away before the rest could be
                    completed, these farther changes, which would have taken place had they remained
                    at home, seem either to have been checked in their progress, or weakened in
                    their degree, by a colder climate.</p>
                <p>We come now to the second and opposite case; for a proof of which we shall appeal
                    to the words of Dr Mitchell, in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions,</hi> No. 476, sect. 4: “The Spaniards who have inhabited America
                    under the torrid zone for any time, are become as dark coloured as our native
                    Indians of Virginia, of which I myself have been a witness; and were they not to
                    intermarry with the Europeans, but lead the same rude and barbarous lives with
                    the Indians, it is very probable that, in a succession of many generations, they
                    would become as dark in complexion.”</p>
                <p>To this instance we shall add one, which is mentioned by a late writer, who,
                    describing the African coast, and the European settlements there, has the
                    following passage. “There are several other small Portuguese settlements, and
                    one of some note at Mitomba, a river in Sierra Leone. The people here called <hi
                    rend="italic">Portuguese</hi> are principally persons bred from a mixture of the
                    first Portuguese discoverers with the natives, and now become, in their
                    complexion, and woolly quality of their hair, perfect negroes, retaining,
                    however, a smattering of the Portuguese language.”</p>
                <p>These facts with respect to the colonists of the Europeans are of the highest
                    importance in the present case, and deserve a serious attention. For when we
                    know to a certainty from whom they are descended; when we know that they were,
                    at the time of their transplantation, of the same colour as those from whom they
                    severally sprung; and when, on the other hand, we are credibly informed that
                    they changed it for the native colour of the place which they now inhabit; the
                    evidence in support of these facts is as great as if a person, on the removal of
                    two or three families into another climate, had determined to ascertain the
                    circumstance; as if he had gone with them and watched their children; as if he
                    had communicated <pb break="no" facs="nls:194749768"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-9768-0192"/>his observations at his death to a successor; as
                    if his successor had prosecuted the plan; and thus an uninterrupted chain of
                    evidence had been kept up from their first removal to any determined period of
                    succeeding time.</p>
                <p>But though these facts seem sufficient of themselves to confirm our opinion, they
                    are not the only facts which can be adduced in its support. It can be shown,
                    that the members of the very same family, when divided from each other, and
                    removed into different countries, have not only changed their family complexion,
                    but that they have changed it to as many different colours as they have gone
                    into different regions of the world. We cannot have, perhaps, a more striking
                    instance of this than in the Jews. These people are scattered over the face of
                    the whole earth. They have preserved themselves distinct from the rest of the
                    world by their religion; and as they never intermarry with any but those of
                    their own sect, so they have no mixture of blood in their veins that they should
                    differ from each other; and yet nothing is more true, than that the English Jew
                    is white, the Portuguese swarthy, the Armenian olive, and the Arabian copper: in
                    short, that there appear to be as many different species of Jews as there are
                    countries in which they reside.</p>
                <p>The same principles with the above we find adopted and further illustrated by
                    Professor Zimmerman, in his <hi rend="italic">Geographical History of Man.</hi>
                    He there proves, in the most satisfactory manner, that the complexion of the
                    human species is uniformly correspondent with the degree of heat or cold to
                    which they are habitually exposed. In maintaining this position, he makes a very
                    proper distinction with regard to climate. By <hi rend="italic">climates</hi> we
                    are to understand, not simply or solely those distinguished by the geographical
                    divisions of the globe, to the exclusion of what he terms <hi rend="italic"
                    >physical</hi> climate, or that which depends on the changes produced in any
                    given latitude by such adventitious circumstances as the lower or more elevated
                    situations of a country, its being encompassed by water or large tracts of land,
                    overspread or surrounded with forests, placed in an extensive plain, or
                    environed by lofty mountains. Peculiarities of the like kind, as has been
                    already noticed, frequently prevent the <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> climate
                    from corresponding entirely with the <hi rend="italic">geographical,</hi> as a
                    country influenced by them is often much warmer or colder than other re*· gions
                    placed under the same degree of latitude. The influence of these secondary or
                    modifying circumstances has been already adverted to, and need not be further
                    enlarged upon: we shall here only observe, that the erroneous reasoning of Lord
                    Kames on this subject seems to have been owing to his inattention to the
                    difference above mentioned. At Senegal, and in the adjacent lands, the
                    thermometer is often at 112 or 110 degrees in the shade; and here we find the
                    inhabitants jet black, with woolly hair. The heat is equally great in Congo and
                    Loango, and these countries are inhabited by negroes only; whereas in Morocco,
                    to the north of these regions, and at the Cape of Good Hope, to the south, the
                    heat is not so intense, nor are the inhabitants of so deep a hue. Lord Kames
                    asks, wherefore are not the Abyssinians and the inhabitants of Zaara of as dark
                    a complexion as the Moors on the coast of Guinea? Μ. Zimmerman answers, that
                    “these countries are much cooler. The desert is not only farther from the
                    equator, but the winds blowing over the Atlas Mountains, which, like the Alps,
                    are covered with snow, and the westerly wind coming from the sea, must
                    considerably mitigate the héat. Nor is Abyssinia so warm as either Monomotapa or
                    Guinea. The north-east winds from the side of Persia and Arabia are cooled by
                    their passage over the Red Sea; the northern winds from Egypt lose much of their
                    heat on the chain of the mountains that is extended between the countries; the
                    winds from the south and the west are sea winds. Thus, the only quarter from
                    which they can derive excessive heat is from the east, as the air on this side
                    must pass over tracts of heated lands.” For a similar reason it is that negroes
                    are not found either in Asia or South America under the equator. The situations
                    of these countries, our author observes, expose them to sea-breezes and cooling
                    winds from the continent. He confirms this hypothesis by observing, that the
                    mountaineers of warm climates, as in Barbary and Ceylon, are much fairer than
                    the inhabitants of the valleys; that the Saracens and Moors who conquered the
                    north-east part of Africa in 1700, from being brown, are become like the negroes
                    near the equator; that the Portuguese who settled at Senegal in 1400 became
                    blacks; and Tudela the Jew asserts, that his countrymen in Abyssinia acquired
                    the dark complexion of the original natives.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, colour and figure may be styled habits of the body. Like other
                    habits, they are created, not by great and sudden impressions, but by continual
                    and almost imperceptible touches. Of habits both of mind and body, nations are
                    susceptible as well as individuals. They are transmitted to offspring, and
                    augmented by inherit» ance. Long in growing to maturity, national features, like
                    national manners, become fixed only after a succession of ages. They become,
                    however, fixed at last; and if we can ascertain any effect produced by a given
                    state of weather or of climate, it requires only repetition during a sufficient
                    length, of time to augment and impress it with a permanent character. The
                    sanguine countenance will, for this reason, be perpetual in the highest
                    latitudes of the temperate zone; and we shall for ever find the swarthy, the
                    olive, the tawny, and the black, as we descend to the south.</p>
                <p>All the foregoing observations have been well illustrated and enforced by the
                    Reverend Dr S. S. Smith, professor of moral philosophy in the college of New
                    Jersey, in his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Causes of the Variety of
                    Complexion and Figure in the Human Species.</hi> See further on this subject the
