                <p><label type="entry">CUPAR</label>, a royal burgh of Scotland, and capital of the
                    county of Fife, is pleasantly situated on the left bank of the Eden, at the
                    distance of ten miles west of St Andrews, and twenty-two miles north-east of
                    Kinghorn. It is a place of considerable antiquity, but in the present day it
                    pos- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> sesses all the appearance of a modern
                    thriving town, and has less of the usual aspect of a royal burgh than any other
                    town of the same magnitude which bears that appellation. At an early period the
                    Macduff family had a castle here; and under its protection they founded and
                    supported a convent of dominicans or black friars, which was afterwards attached
                    to the religious establishment at StMonans. All vestiges of these edifices are
                    now however gone. The situation of the town is well chosen. It lies on a slight
                    elevation, in a secluded vale, open to the east and west, and overhung on the
                    south by a range of hilly ground. The town is composed of one principal and
                    rather I long street, running from west to east, which communicates with the
                    Kinross road, and another street projected from the south side of this, near its
                    cast end, which communicates with the road to Edinburgh by means of a bridge
                    which crosses the Eden. The centre of the town is at the junction of these
                    thoroughfares, both of which are lined with good houses of from one to three
                    stories in height. East from the junction of the streetsis a short street called
                    St Catherine Street, composed of very elegant modern edifices. On the south side
                    are the county buildings, a large tontine, and some public offices and private
                    buildings. On the opposite side stands an episcopal chapel, and nearly in the
                    centre of the town is situated the parish church, a very plain building. This is
                    relieved, however, by a fine old turret or spire, the only remaining portion of
                    the old Gothic church, which was built in 1415. The best public building in the
                    town is the county jail, which is ∣ built in a neat Grecian style. The chief
                    trade of Cupar consists in the weaving of linens. There are also manufactories
                    of leather, candles, ropes, bricks, and tilcs, with several breweries and corn
                    and fulling mills. There are eight annual fairs, and a weekly market is held
                    every Thursday. Cupar and the adjoining district support a weekly newspaper. As
                    a royal burgh, Cupar is governed by a provost, three bailies, and a dean of
                    guild, with a treasurer and twenty-one councillors. Besides the parish church,
                    there are several dissenting meeting houses. The population of the burgh and
                    parish, in 1821, amounted to 5892, and in 1831 to 6473.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cupar-Angus,</hi> a town of Scotland, lying partly in the
                    county of Perth, and partly in that of Forfar, is pleasantly situated to the
                    south of the Isla, a few miles above its junction with the Tay, at the distance
                    of twelve and a half miles east by north of Perth. A rivulet tributary to the
                    Isla runs through the town, and that part which lies to the south of -this
                    stream is all that belongs to the county of Angus. In ancient times this place
                    was noted for an abbey of Cistertian monks, which was founded by Malcolm IV. in
                    the year 1164. This building was destroyed at the reformation, but a fragment of
                    the ruins overgrown with ivy still remains. Cupar-Angus is a well-built little
                    town. The church, which stands on the Angus side, is a very plain bpilding, and
                    there is a steeple detached from it, which comprises a sort of town-house and
                    jail. The trade of the town consists of the manufacture of linen, and the
                    tanning of leather, and in the vicinity there are several bleachfields· Besides
                    the parish church, there are two dissenting meeting houses and an episcopal
                    chapel. The population of the town and parish amounted, in 1821, to 2622, and in
                    1831 to 2615.</p>
