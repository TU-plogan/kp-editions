                <p><label type="entry">CORDOVA</label>, one of the four divisions of the province of
                    Andalusia, in Spain. It is now in all public documents usually called the
                    kingdom of Cordova. It is bounded on the north side by Castile, on the west by
                    Estremadura, on the south by Seville, and on the east by Murcia. The superficial
                    extent is 724 square miles, and in 1804 the number of inhabitants was
                    252,028.</p>
                <p>The principal river which runs through it is the Guadalquivir, by which it is
                    divided into two parts; to the north of that stream it is called the Sierra, and
                    to the south the Campina. The Sierra is an elongation of the Sierra Morena,
                    which proceeds from the most southern part of La Mancha, and abounds with
                    pastures, fine woods, hives of bees, sheep, goats, and animals of the chase. The
                    Campina is distinguished by the excellence of its soil, and the abundance of
                    grapes and olives which it yields, by which a part of Castile is supplied with
                    some wine and much oil. In both divisions of Cordova there are several mines of
                    various metals. ∙</p>
                <p>Agricultural industry is, however, in general much neglected; so that, with a
                    soil highly favourable for its growth, the province does not yield wheat
                    sufficient for its own consumption. This neglect of cultivation arises in a
                    great degree from the larger portions of land being held in máyo-razo, a species
                    of entail of a very strict nature. The occupiers of land are in general very
                    deficient in capital, and not likely, under the system of letting it for short
                    terms, and collecting the rent in produce, to accumulate much more. A general
                    scarcity of water is experienced during many months, and there is no sum
                    expended in the business of irrigation at all adequate to the want of it that is
                    experienced. The manufacturing industry of this province has gradually declined
                    ever since the expulsion of the Moors. It is now reduced to some looms of silk
                    for various descriptions of taffetas, ribbons, and other goods. Hats are made
                    here, and there are manufactories of soap, leather, and silversmiths’ goods.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cordova,</hi> a city of Andalusia, the capital of the
                    kingdom of that name, and long the metropolis of the empire of the Moors in
                    Spain. It is situated in a most delightful spot, being on the southern declivity
                    of the Sierra Morena, which protects it from the cold winds of the north and the
                    east; and it is also on the right bank of the Guadalquivir, whose waters are
                    used for irrigating the rich plain that surrounds it. The most striking remains
                    of the Moorish magnificence are now visible in the enormous cathedral which .was
                    formerly the principal Mahommedan mosque. This edifice was finished by the Moors
                    about the year 800, and was then nearly a Square building, being 420 by 510
                    feet. The roof was not high, being but thirty-five feet from the floor. It was
                    supported by numerous marble columns, according to some descriptions amounting
                    to 1000, according to others to 780, which formed nineteen aisles from east to
                    west, and twenty-nine from north to south, according to the description of that
                    accurate and minute antiquarian Morales. There were gates covered with bronze,
                    embossed in a most curious and expensive manner. Four thousand seven hundred
                    lamps were lighted in this mosque every night, and the oil used in them was
                    mixed with the wood of aloes, with ambergris, and other expensive perfumes. The
                    Arabian monarch of the race Ommiades, who reigned in this capital, and who
                    possessed enormous revenues, seems to have most profusely lavished them in the
                    decorations of Cordova. At the death of Abdelrahman, this city is said to have
                    contained within its walls two hundred thousand houses, six hundred mosques,
                    nine hundred baths, and numerous public libraries; whilst on the bank of the
                    Guadalquivir, under the power of that monarch, there were eight cities, three
                    hundred towns, and twelve thousand populous villages. The twelve caliphs, his
                    successors, gradually declined in power, and with it the wealth and population
                    of the country decreased, till the period when the seat of the Moorish
                    government was transferred in 1013 to the ' city of Granada.</p>

                <p>The mosque, now become a Christian church, is diminished in size, by having a
                    part which served the Mahommedans for the ablutions which their ritual
                    prescribed, converted into a kind of garden, which is planted with orange trees
                    and cypresses, and has three beautiful fountains. This garden, and the portico,
                    supported by pillars, is five hundred and ten feet in length. The lowness of the
                    roof forms a striking contrast with the lofty arches which support the roofs of
                    the other cathedrals in Spain, whether of Gothic or of more recent erection. The
                    originality of the style of the building is destroyed by the addition of a
                    modern lofty tower, and the building being surrounded with houses, the beauty is
                    hid; so that it now rather exhibits the extravagant expenditure, than the taste,
                    of the period in which it was erected. It is, however, the most curious monument
                    of the extraordinary race who for seven centuries ruled in Spain, and exhibited
                    during that period a degree of knowledge, civilization, and taste, which had no
                    equal among the Christian nations of Europe.</p>
                <p>Before the Moors entered Spain, Cordova was a city of considerable importance.
                    Under the Roman government it was well known by the name of Corduba, and was
                    strongly fortified. The remains of the Roman walls are still to be seen, in the
                    same imperishable state as when that people abandoned them.</p>
                <p>At present Cordova does not contain more than thirty thousand inhabitants, who
                    depend in some degree on manufactures, but much more on agriculture. The country
                    around it is highly diversified; and the hills forming the lower range of the
                    Sierra Morena send forth abundance of limpid streams. These hills are covered
                    with pines and evergreen oaks; whilst the valleys are covered with olive trees
                    or cultivated corn-fields. The farm-houses are built within inclosurcs, and
                    surrounded with orchards of orange and pomegranate trees. The cultivators are,
                    however, generally in indigent circumstances, and pay the rent by a proportion
                    of the produce. On the more gentle risings there are vineyards, from which some
                    indifferent wine is produced; but many of them are used for producing vinegar,
                    and some for making brandy.</p>
                <p>The principal buildings of the city are the bishop’s palace and the holy office,
                    both of which, though ņot elegant, are very extensive. An orphan-house is more
                    modern, and built in a better style, and is adorned with a cupola that displays
                    considerable architectural taste. A bridge of sixteen arches across the
                    Guadalquivir, built by the Moors, and well preserved, is the only access to the
                    southern part of the province; and it is defended by a tower which, when the
                    Moors constructed it, must have been a sufficient defence, but it is now of no
                    other use than as a toll-house. This province is famous for its breed of horses;
                    and the royal stables, as well as the army, draw their best supplies from the
                    vicinity of this city.</p>
