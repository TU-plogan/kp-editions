                <p><label type="entry">CRAWFORD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Adair</hi></label>, a
                    physician distinguished by his researches in chemical physiology, was born in
                    Ireland about the year 1748. His father, the Rev. Thomas Crawford, was the
                    Presbyterian minister of Crumlin, near Belfast, in the county of Antrim. The
                    family were originally from Scotland; a remote ancestor, who was a clergyman,
                    having fled from that country to Ireland during the reign of Charles 1I., in
                    order to escape the fury of religious persecution directed against all who like
                    himself had refused to conform. The zeal which had stood so severe a test
                    appears to have been cherished and perpetuated as an honourable inheritance in
                    the family, which exhibited for six generations the clerical profession
                    descending from father to son. Adair Crawford was, from his early youth,
                    remarkable for the sweetness of his temper, the excellence of his heart, and the
                    strength of his understanding; qualities'which were so happily united, as at
                    once to engage the affections and to command the respect of all who knew him. To
                    his nearest relatives he was an object of extraordinary interest, from the
                    delicacy of his constitution, which required that he should be brought up with
                    peculiar care; but so amiable was his disposition, that no shade of jealousy was
                    ever excited among his brothers and sisters by the greater attention that was
                    paid to him. He received his classical education from his father; and at the age
                    of fourteen was sent to Glasgow for the prosecution of his studies.
                    Distinguished from a child by a thirst for knowledge, his progress at the
                    university was rapid, and corresponded with the warmest hopes of his parents.
                    They had intended him for the vocation of Presbyterian clergyman, which was also
                    the destination of his eldest brother; and he at one time bestowed much pains on
                    the composition of sermons with that view, but he afterwards relinquished the
                    plan on account of the weakness of his voice. It was then proposed to him to
                    pursue the profession of the law, for succeeding in which he was eminently
                    qualified by the excellence of his memory, and the acuteness of his reasoning
                    powers; though the same physical incapacity as to exertions in public speaking
                    might, in a great measure, confine his practice to that of a chamber lawyer. He
                    accordingly turned his attention to this new course of study, which he pursued
                    under the guidance of the celebrated Dr Millar of Glasgow. Atthis period his
                    younger brother, Alexander,was a student of medicine in the college of
                    Edinburgh, and was sufficiently advanced in the knowledge of his profession to
                    discover the immensity of the field which this science lays open to an ardent
                    mind, and the scope which it affords for the exertion of industry and genius,
                    such as he knew his brother possessed. Convinced that extraordinary success
                    would be the result of this new application of his powers, he persuaded him once
                    more to change his views; and whilst they were together at their father’s house
                    he one day left him, on setting out on a journey, a skull and a few other dry
                    bones, together with Monro’s book on <hi rend="italic">Osteology.</hi> On his
                    return he found, as he had expected, that Adair had already outstript his
                    preceptor in accurate knowledge of the subject. It was then decided that he
                    should return to Glasgow on the ensuing winter, for the purpose of attending the
                    medical classes. This plan he carried into execution with great steadiness; and
                    as early as the following spring had begun to direct his inquiries to the
                    connection between respiration and animal heat, a subject which for a long time
                    engaged a principal share of his attention. In the next winter he, went to
                    Edinburgh, still pursuing the same objects of study at that university. His
                    views of the theory of animal heat were favourably received by the professors,
                    and were long taught by Dr Monro in his anatomical lectures. In the ensuing
                    spring, 1779, he went to London, where he then published the first edition of
                    the work which has gained him so much celebrity. In the beginning of the same
                    winter, a degree, probably an honorary one, of Doctor of Physic, was conferred
                    upon him by the university of Glasgow. He was held in much respect by the
                    professors of that university, his long residence among whom had given them the
                    means of appreciating his worth and talents. It was observed by the celebrated
                    Dr Reid, on his quitting them, that he had left no man behind him better
                    qualified for the professorships of Greek and of Natural Philosophy than Adair
                    Crawford. The facility with which he acquired knowledge of every kind was,
                    indeed, extraordinary, and appeared to be the result of the singular faculty he
                    possessed of concentrating the whole force of his mind upon any subject to which
                    he chose to direct his attention. He now determined upon settling in London, and
                    soon after offered himself as candidate for one of the dispensaries, to which,
                    after a severe contest, he succeeded in being elected physician. His talents
                    speedily· brought him forward in the philosophical world, as well as in his own
                    profession. He was elected a member of the Royal Society, and shortly afterwards
                    he obtained the appointment of physician to St Thomas’s Hospital. In the year
                    1788 he published a second edition of his work, greatly corrected and improved,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Experiments and Observations on Animal
                    Heat, and the Inflammation of combustible Bodies, being an attempt to resolve
                    these Phenomena into a general Law of Nature.</hi> His reputation as a
                    philosopher was now established, and procured him the notice of all the
                    scientific noblemen of the kingdom, and the appointment of lectur- <pb

                    >er</hi> on chemistry to the academy of Woolwich. Being led from speculation to
                    suppose that barytes might prove an efficacious article of the materia medica,
                    he made several experiments on the effects of the muriated solution upon
                    himself, principally with a view of determining the dose that might be taken
                    with safety. He then applied the remedy, to some bad cases of scrofula at St
                    Thomas’s Hospital, with a degree of success that raised in his mind the most
                    sanguine expectations of its proving a specific for the cure of that untractable
                    disease; expectations which, as has happened to so many new remedies, subsequent
                    experience has far from realized.</p>
                <p>Dr Crawford was now rising into great eminence as a medical practitioner; but his
                    incessant application to the laborious duties of his profession, as well as to
                    bis philosophical pursuits, was beginning to undermine a constitution naturally
                    weak. He was invited by the first Marquis of Lansdowne to his seat of Hârdwell
                    Cliff, near Lymington, in hopes that the change of air might have a beneficial
                    effect upon his health. But the foundations of his disorder were too deeply
                    laid; he gradually declined, and shortly after died at Lymington, on the 29th of
                    July 1795. He was buried in the church at Hârdwell. It was the intention of his
                    noble patron to have erected a monument to his memory, and, at his lordship’s
                    solicitation, two very appropriate and elegant compositions were written, the
                    one by Dr Denman, who was among his early friends, and the other by the
                    well-known Gilbert Wakefield. Lord Lansdowne, however, did not live to see his
                    design carried into execution.</p>
                <p>During the year 1785, he married Miss Stone, a lady from Devonshire, by whom he
                    left four children, two sons and two daughters; the eldest son being a
                    clergyman, the other in the medical profession. The daughters, who were infants
                    at his death, were principally educated under the immediate superintendence of
                    the celebrated Miss Elizabeth Hamilton, who was first cousin to their father,
                    and who adopted them as her own children.</p>
                <p>His eldest brother, the Reverend William Crawford, and the father of Dr Stewart
                    Crawford of Bath, was a man of considerable literary attainments; he published
                    <hi rend="italic">Remarks on Lord Chesterfield'</hi><hi rend="italic">'s</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Letters,</hi> which met with success, and also <hi rend="italic"
                    >Translations from Turreiine,</hi> and a short <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Ireland.</hi> His second brother, John, was for many years a surgeon in the
                    service of the East India Company, and published, many years ago, a pamphlet
                    showing, from a number of cases, the efficacy of calomel, conjoined with other
                    purgatives, in the treatment of those morbid affections of the liver to which
                    the inhabitants of India are so prone; a work which probably laid the first
                    foundation of the practice which has since been so generally adopted. FIis
                    brother Alexander, whom we have already had occasion to mention, was a physician
                    at Lisburn in Ireland, and obligingly furnished most of the particulars above
                    given, relative to his brother, who was endeared to him by the strongest ties of
                    affection, and of whose moral worth he spoke in terms of the highest
                    veneration.</p>
                <p>The published works of Dr Crawford, besides that on <hi rend="italic">Animal
                    Heat,</hi> above noticed, were, a paper in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions, On the power inherent in the Human Constitution of resisting high
                    degrees of Temperature</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and another <hi
                    rend="italic">On the effect of Muriate of Idarytes in the Cure of certain
                    Diseases.</hi> A posthumous work of his <hi rend="italic">On the effect of
                    Tonics on the Animal Fibre,</hi> was edited by his brother, Dr Alexander
                    Crawford.</p>
                <p>He had a taste for poetry, which, however, he indulged but sparingly. An elegy
                    which he wrote <hi rend="italic">On the death of Lady Sarah Stewart,</hi> the
                    mother of Lord Castlereagh, afterwards Marquis of Londonderry, was supposed to
                    have considerable merit, but he could never be prevailed on to publish it.
