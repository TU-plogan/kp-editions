                <p><label type="entry">COCHIN CHINA</label>. This extensive kingdom is situated in
                    the southern extremity of Asia, and forms part of the peninsula between China
                    and Hindustan. It is not separated, however, by any distinct boundary from the
                    neighbouring countries; and its limits have been greatly extended by conquest
                    beyond those of Cochin China proper, which is merely a strip of land between the
                    China Sea and the mountains, and is not above sixty or seventy miles broad. The
                    empire of Cochin China, which took its actual form in the beginning of the
                    present century, comprehends Cochin China proper, Tonquin, the principal part of
                    Cambodia, and the little state of Chiampa. This state, as it has been
                    aggrandised by conquest, extends from the point of Cambodia, in about 8° 30'
                    north latitude, to the northern confines of Tonquin, which reach within a very
                    few miles of the tropic, and from the longitude of 105° to about 109° east. It
                    is bounded on the north by the Chinese Quangsi or Kiangsi and Yunan, on the west
                    by the kingdoms of Lao and Siam; while the Gulfs of Siam, Tonquin, and the China
                    Sea bound it on the southwest, east, and north-east. This great country is
                    divided by long ranges of mountains, which run nearly north and south, and in
                    almost parallel chains, forming it into separate provinces, divided by physical
                    boundaries, and inhabited by distinct tribes and nations, although subject to
                    the same sovereign. By these mountainous ridges Tonquin and Cochin China proper
                    are separated from Lactho Laos and Cambodia. Another chain separates the three
                    latter states from Siam and China, and gradually diminishes in height as it
                    approaches the south, terminating at the southern extremity of Cambodia. The
                    soil in Cochin China, especially in the low lands, is fertile, and its products
                    are extremely valuable. Of these, sugar is the staple commodity; it is produced
                    in the central districts of Cochin China proper, and is manufactured by the
                    labour of the natives, and not, as in Siam, by that of the Chinese. The whole
                    exportation, which is "principally to China, amounts to about 2000 tons, or
                    30,000 peculs. Raw silk is the next article in importance. Its culture, as Mr
                    Craufurd and the embassy which accompanied him to Siam and Cochin China had an
                    opportunity of observing in 1822, is carried on to a great extent in Cochin
                    China, and to a still greater extent in Tonquin. The quantity which could be
                    annually exported from the whole kingdom is estimated at 120,000 lbs.
                    Considerable quantities were carried away by some French ships which visited
                    Cochin China, and the coarser kind was found to bear a fair price in the French
                    market. Cochin China produces the true cinnamon; and the quantity annually
                    exported appears to be about 266,000 lbs. Pepper of a good quality, but in small
                    quantity and of high price, is produced in the central provinces of Cochin
                    China; but the quantity is inadequate to the demand which the Chinese trade
                    creates for its exportation. It grows among the central mountains of Cochin
                    China, whence it is exported to Cambodia and Tonquin, but principally to China,
                    where it is much more highly valued than any other quality of this aromatic. It
                    is not however prepared in a manner to suit the Indian or European markets; for
                    which purpose it would be necessary that the natives should be instructed to
                    free it from the <hi rend="italic">epidermis,</hi> and otherwise to pack and to
                    prepare it, as is practised in Ceylon. Another exclusive product of the central
                    parts of the kingdom, which is extensively cultivated and sent to the
                    neighbouring provinces, is tea, which is a very coarse and cheap commodity, the
                    price seldom exceeding a penny or two pence a pound. It is doubtful, however,
                    whether this tea would be fit for the consumption of Europe. There are two
                    species of rice, namely, the mountain rice, and another which is produced in the
                    alluvial lands. The other productions of these lands and of the adjacent forests
                    are gamboge, gum, cardamums, eagle wood, areca∙nut, betel-leaf, ivory,
                    sticklack; hides, consisting of deer skins, buffalo, elephants, and rhinoceros
                    hides; peltry, consisting of tiger, leopard, otter, and cat skins; feathers,
                    salt fish, horns and bones, dyewoods, and woods for ship-building and for
                    domestic<pb break="no" facs="nls:194747402" xml:id="kp-eb0707-7402-0012"/>
                    purposes. Valuable timber is found only in Cambodia, and a small quantity of
                    teak wood is found in the forests; also ebony, cedars, mimosas, walnuts,
                    iron-wood, and poon, and most of the other trees found in the woods of India.
                    The wood used for ship-building and for domestic purposes is strong and durable,
                    and is carried to the capital in large quantities. Mr Craufurd’s embassy had no
                    opportunity of examining its botanical character. There is a hard black wood
                    extensively used in cabinet-work, and of large dimensions, which takes <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> fine polish, and might form an article of exportation.
                    Cambodia also produces the Portuguese rosewood, which the Chinese export as they
                    do from Siam; also sandal wood and other scented woods. Among the products of
                    Tonquin is a species of vegetable root, a cheap material, which forms the
                    deadweight of all the Chinese cargoes exported from Tonquin, and is used
                    extensively both throughout Cochin China and the adjacent countries, and also in
                    China, as the material of a red dye. Edible bird-nests, the sea-slug usually
                    called biche de mer, molluseas, and sea-blubber, and other marine productions of
                    a gelatinous quality, form standing articles of trade with China, and are always
                    in demand. Among the mountains of Tonquin is the only portion of the Cochin
                    Chinese empire which produces iron, gold, and silver. The iron received from
                    these mines, which is as cheap as that from Siam, supplies the whole kingdom,
                    with the exception of Siagun, which is furnished from the latter country. Gold
                    dust is found in many of the rivers; and there are prodigious rocks of marble
                    situated on the banks of the river Faifoo, on a kind of sandy plain, of which
                    large quantities have been exported.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The foreign trade of the Cochin Chinese is almost exclusively with China, the
                    trade carried on with Siam being inconsiderable, and that with European nations
                    still smaller. But there is no indisposition to trade, though among the European
                    nations the notion has been propagated by travellers that the resort of European
                    traders is in a great measure interdicted in this kingdom, on the same principle
                    as in Japan and in all the ports of the Chinese empire, with the exception of
                    one. On the contrary, there is no Asiatic country in which Europeans are
                    admitted on more easy terms than in Cochin China. In 1818, a new tariff was
                    imposed on foreign vessels, by which the high duties imposed on all foreign
                    vessels prior to 1818 were repealed, and equal duties substituted in their
                    stead. By this regulation all vessels pay a rated measurement duty, moderate in
                    its amount; and arc exempted from all import duties payable previous to 1818.
                    Vessels that are driven into the ports of Cochin China by stress of weather, or
                    that visit them for the purpose of commercial inquiries, are free from all
                    charges; and four of the principal ports of the Cochin Chinese empire arc open
                    to European commerce. It is also of great importance to the interests of foreign
                    trade that in Cochin China neither the sovereign nor any of his officers have
                    any thing to do with commercial concerns. There are no royal monopolies, nor any
                    claims of preference in the market; which odious privileges are far more
                    pernicious to commerce than the heaviest duties. Of all the European nations,
                    the French alone have availed themselves of these new regulations in favour of
                    European trade; four French ships of considerable burden having since visited
                    Cochin China, bringing out fire-arms, iron, copper, woollens, and some
                    curiosities for the court, and having received in return full cargoes of sugar,
                    with considerable quantities of raw silk.</p>
                <p>The productions which the Cochin Chinese receive from China are manufactured
                    silks, porcelain, medical drugs, a very large supply of paper, principally for
                    religious purposes, and some fine teas; and until the establishment of
                    Singapore, about 150 chests of opium were obtained indirectly from Canton, some
                    portion of it by sea in junks, and a good deal by land. This trade with China is
                    chiefly conducted with Cachao in Tonquin, Saigun in Cambodia, and Taifo and Hue
                    in Cochin China. There is also some inconsiderable intercourse with other parts
                    of the empire. From the Malayan countries Cochin China receives pepper, cloves,
                    nutmegs, with sandal-wood and tin, and from India opium and saltpetre. From
                    Europe the present importations consist of broad cloth, which has long been
                    consumed in Cochin China, and is required for the army, consisting of 40,000
                    men, who are amply and uniformly clothed in British broad cloth of coarse
                    scarlet. There is also a demand for some woollens of a finer fabric among the
                    better classes, for an occasional winter dress. Some trade has lately commenced
                    with Singapore; and from that port as well as Canton, junks have of late brought
                    small quantities of fine heavy cotton goods, which are in much request among the
                    better classes. Chintzes and other coloured cotton goods are not at all in
                    request, with the exception of handkerchiefs; neither are the coarse white
                    cottons, such as are manufactured in India, fit to enter into competition with
                    the domestic manufactures of Cochin China. The Cochin Chinese, notwithstanding
                    their skill in the manufacture of cannon and ammunition, do not manufacture a
                    supply of fire-arms sufficient for the home demand. A French vessel which came
                    out in 1819 supplied the king of Cochin China with 10,000 stand of arms, which
                    still however continue in demand. European iron is also imported, which, from
                    the little loss that it sustains in forging, compared with the native metal, has
                    a superiority over it in point of economy.</p>
                <p>Cochin China, from its central situation, its navigable rivers, and its
                    innumerable and excellent harbours, possesses extraordinary advantages for
                    commerce. Within the whole kingdom there appear to be no less than five
                    considerable rivers, which, while they diffuse fertility over the country, also
                    greatly facilitate its internal communications. These are Kangkao, Cambodia,
                    Saigun, Tonquin, and Hue. The first empties itself into the Gulf of Siam, and on
                    it are situated Athien and Pontia-mas. It is connected with the great river
                    Cambodia, and by means of it with Panompin, the capital of the kingdom, formerly
                    much frequented by the European traders. This great river is described as
                    navigable by ships of the largest size to the distance of forty miles up the
                    country, where the city of Saigong is situated, having a capacious and
                    commodious port, and an extensive naval arsenal.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Barrow’s <hi rend="italic">Voyage to Cochin
                    China,</hi> p. 24Ĵ.</p></note> There is no river of any great magnitude in
                    Cochin China. The river Hue has but a very short course; although broad, it is
                    shallow, and does not materially facilitate navigation, either external or
                    internal. But its estuary forms, during the south-west monsoon, a fine harbour,
                    which ships of 200 tons burden may enter and quit with safety, while it is
                    almost inaccessible during the opposite monsoon. There is a river in Tonquin
                    which in former periods was well known to Europeans, and appears to have been
                    accessible, notwithstanding the bar at its mouth, to vessels of 400 or 500 tons.
                    It is now greatly obstructed by sand banks, and not navigable for vessels of
                    above 200 <pb break="no" facs="nls:194747415" xml:id="kp-eb0707-7415-0013"/>tons
                    burden. This river has it√5 source in the centre of the great Chinese province
                    of Yu-nan. Few countries are so amply provided with harbours, there being within
                    the C⅜ degrees of latitude which intervene between Cape St James and the Bay of
                    Turon, no less than nine of the finest harbours in the world, accessible in
                    every wind, quite safe to approach, and affording the most complete protection.
                    The Bay of Turon, situated in latitude 16. 7. north, is equalled by few in the
                    eastern world, and surpassed by none, for the security and convenience which it
                    affords.</p>
                <p>The principal town is Hue, the capital, situated seventy or eighty miles
                    north-east of Turon, on a river navigable for vessels of moderate burden. It is
                    fortified; and in the arsenal every thing is in a style of neatness, magnitude,
                    and perfection, which denotes a bold and warlike people. The other towns are
                    Cachao in Tonquin; Saigun in Cambodia, a mercantile town of considerable size,
                    on a branch of the Saigun river; and Taifo or Faifo, situated about fifteen
                    miles from the entrance of the river, and now in ruins; Turon also, formerly the
                    chief mart of trade between China and Japan, now surrounded with marks of
                    ruin.</p>
                <p>Cochin China, until within a few centuries after the Christian era, formed a part
                    of the Chinese empire; and in the general features of the natives, many of their
                    customs, their written language, and their religious opinions and ceremonies, it
                    is easy to trace their Chinese origin. The Cochin Chinese, for example,
                    resemble, according to Barrow, their Chinese progenitors in the ceremonies and
                    processions observed at marriages and funerals, in the greater part of their
                    religious superstitions, in the offerings presented to idols, in the
                    consultation of oracles, and in the universal desire of inquiring into futurity
                    by the casting of lots; in charming away diseases, in their diet and cookery, in
                    their public entertainments, in their instruments of music, in games of chance,
                    in cock-fighting, quail-fighting, and the devices of their fire-works. Their
                    language, however, though originally Chinese, has now deviated so much from its
                    standard as to be wholly unintelligible to a Chinese. But the Cochin Chinese
                    have effectually preserved the written character of the Chinese language; and
                    when the country was visited by Barrow, he found no difficulty in communicating
                    with them by means of the Chinese priests who accompanied him.</p>
                <p>In external appearance the Cochin Chinese are the most diminutive of the Mogul
                    race. They are short and squat. They want the broad face of the Malay, the
                    cylindrical cranium and expanded lower jaw remarked in the Siamese, and the
                    oblique eyes of the Chinese. Their heads and countenances arc round; and they
                    possess, according to Mr Finlayson, an expression of sprightliness,
                    intelligence, and good humour, not to be found either in the Chinese or Siamese.
                    Morals in Cochin China, as in every part of Asia, are at a very low ebb; and the
                    women especially are in a very degraded state, and are permitted to indulge in
                    every species of licentiousness. Neither parents nor husbands in any rank
                    scruple for a moment to prostitute for gain either their wives or daughters. The
                    females in general have but slender pretensions to beauty; yet this want is
                    compensated by a lively and cheerful temper, totally different from the morose
                    character of the Chinese. They are doomed by the men to labour from morning to
                    night in the most toilsome occupations. All the labours and the various
                    employments connected with agriculture fall to their share; and in some places
                    they superintend all the details of commerce. They even assist in constructing
                    and keeping in repair their mud-built cottages; they manufacture coarse
                    earthenware vessels; navigate boats on rivers and in harbours; bear articles to
                    market; draw the cotton-wool from the pod, spin it and weave it into cloth, dye
                    it, and make it up into dresses for their families.<note anchored="true"

                    thirds of those who are fit for service are compelled to serve as soldiers at a
                    paltry rate of pay; by which the people are taken away from agricultural and
                    mechanical pursuits, and initiated into idle and unprofitable habits. Those of
                    the men who are not so employed engage occasionally in fishing, in. collecting
                    swallows’ nests and sea-slug in the neighbouring islands, and in various other
                    occupations. But they have always leisure for their amusements, while the women
                    are condemned to unremitting toil, being considered by the lower classes much in
                    the light of beasts of burden fitted for use, and by the higher classes as the
                    slaves of their pleasures. These latter arc arrogant in the extreme, and
                    offensively coarse in their manners; while their inferiors are described as mild
                    and inoffensive, lively and good humoured, affable and polite to strangers, but,
                    under this exterior, as cunning, deceitful, impudent, conceited, and tyrannical
                    where they can be so with impunity. These vices are traced to the nature of the
                    government, which is completely despotic, the sovereign being the supreme
                    disposer, both of the lives and properties of his subjects. “The bamboo,” says a
                    traveller, “which is perpetually at work, is the universal reformer of manners
                    throughout Cochin China;” and the moral character of the people corresponds
                    entirely to this illiberal and despotic system under which it has been formed.
                    It is owing to the same cause, namely, the insecurity of property which prevails
                    all over Asia, that the arts and manufactures make no progressive improvement,
                    and that agriculture also is in such a backward state. The country exhibits
                    nowhere the marks of industrious cultivation; and the inhabitants are generally
                    poor, and living in miserable cottages, with little furniture. The only branch
                    of the arts in which they particularly excel is naval architecture, for which,
                    however, they are not a little indebted to the size and quality of the timber
                    employed for that purpose. Their row-galleys for pleasure are remarkably fine
                    vessels, being from fifty to eighty feet in length, and composed of fine single
                    planks, each extending from one extremity to the other. They employ various
                    descriptions of vessels in the coasting trade, in fishing, arid in collecting
                    the biche de mer or sea-slug, and the swallows’ nests among the cluster of
                    islands called the <hi rend="italic">Paracels.</hi> Many of them are covered
                    with sheds of matting, under which a whole family constantly reside; and others
                    resemble the common prows of the Malays, both in their hulls and rigging. Their
                    foreign traders arc built on the plan of the Chinese junks.</p>
                <p>The religion of the Cochin Chinese is a modification of the widely extended
                    system of Buddha, to whom they offer the firstlings of their flocks and the
                    first fruits of their fields. They have temples filled with the idolatrous
                    imsges of this deity, and the natives are extremely superstitious. Besides
                    voluntary offerings, which are made by individuals, a yearly contribution is
                    levied by the government, in order to support a certain number of monasteries,
                    in which the priests invoke the deity for the public welfare.</p>
                <p>The ancient history of Cochin China, like that of most of the other eastern
                    countries, is very little known; and it is only from the year 1774 that there
                    are any authentic accounts. The reigning family was at that time expellee.</p>

                <p>from Quinong, the capital, by three brothers, who divided the country among them.
                    At the time the revolt took place, the young prince Caung Shung, with the queen
                    and his family, escaped by the assistance of a French missionary named Adran,
                    into a forest; whence the king was compelled to fly, first to Putowai, a desert
                    island in the Gulf of Siam, and afterwards to Siam, which he was obliged to
                    quit. The son was carried by Adran to France, where he endeavoured to procure
                    assistance; but the revolution breaking out, all these schemes were frustrated.
                    Caung Shung, after remaining in the woods, sustaining many hardships, landed in
                    his own country in 1790, and succeeded in expelling the successors of the
                    usurpers; and in 1802 he effected the conquest of Tonquin, and established an
                    extensive empire on a solid basis, which has flourished ever since that time. He
                    was greatly aided by the missionary Adran, who had acquired the most perfect
                    mastery over the language, and compiled a code of laws and a book of
                    instructions for the government of the country. The king, after his death,
                    evinced his gratitude for his services by erecting a monument to his memory,
                    with an inscription in gold characters, an honour confined to the royal
                    family.</p>
                <p>Several attempts have been made to open an amicable intercourse with the Cochin
                    Chinese; one in 1778 by Mr Hastings, and one in 1804 by an envoy from Canton;
                    but both proved unsuccessful, through the intrigues of Frenchmen, by whom the
                    sovereign Caung Shung was completely surrounded. In 1822 Mr Craufurd was sent by
                    the Fast India Company as an envoy to Siam and Cochin China. He was not well
                    received at the Cochin Chinese court, and does not appear to have obtained any
                    peculiar advantages for commerce. Both he and Mr Finlayson, surgeon to the
                    embassy, have published the result of their observations; and it is from the
                    information procured by them that the previous account is chiefly compiled; also
                    from Barrow’s <hi rend="italic">Account of Cochin China,</hi> the <hi
