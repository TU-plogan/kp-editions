                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">COLLINS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthony</hi></label>, a
                    polemical writer, born at Hes-ten, near Hounslow, in the county of Middlesex, in
                    1676, was the son of Henry Collins, a gentleman of about L.1500 a-year. He was
                    first bred at Eton College, and then went to King’s College, Cambridge, where he
                    had for his tutor Mr Francis Hare, afterwards Bishop of Chichester. He was
                    subsequently a student of the Temple; but not relishing the law, he soon
                    abandoned the study. He was an ingenious man, and the author of several curious
                    books. His first remarkable piece was published in 1707, being entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">An Essay concerning the Use of Reason in Propositions, the
                    Evidence whereof depends on Human Testimony.</hi> In 1702, he entered into the
                    controversy between Mr Clarke and Dr Dodwell concerning the immortality of the
                    soul. In 1713, he published his discourse on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Free-thinking,</hi> which made a prodigious noise. In 1725 he retired into the
                    county of Essex, and acted as a justice of peace and deputy-lieutenant for the
                    same county, as he had before done for that of Middlesex and the liberty of
                    Westminster. The same year he published a <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Essay
                    concerning Human Liberty.</hi> In 1718 he was chosen treasurer of the county of
                    Essex; and this office he discharged with great credit. In 1724 he published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Historical and Critical Essay on the Thirty-nine
                    Articles.</hi> Soon afterwards he published his <hi rend="italic">Discourse of
                    the Grounds and Deasons of the Christian Religion</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    to which is prefixed <hi rend="italic">An Apology for Free Debate and Liberty of
                    Writing;</hi> which piece was immediately attacked by a great number of authors.
                    In 1726 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Scheme of Literary Prophecy considered,
                    in a View of the Controversy occasioned by a late Hook, entitled A Discourse of
                    the Grounds,</hi> &lt;S-'C. In this Discourse he mentions a manuscript
                    dissertation of his, showing that the Sibylline oracles were a forgery executed
                    in the times of the primitive Christians, who, for that reason, were called <hi
                    rend="italic">Sibyllists</hi> by the Pagans; but it never appeared in print. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Scheme of Literary Prophecy</hi> was replied to by several
                    writers, and particularly by Dr John Rogers, in his <hi rend="italic">Necessity
                    of Divine Revelation asserted;</hi> in answer to which our author wrote <hi
                    rend="italic">A Letter to the Reverend Dr Rogers,</hi> on the occasion on this
                    publication. His health began to decline some years before his death; and he was
                    much afflicted with the stone, which at last put an end to his life, at his
                    house in Harley Square, in 1729. He was interred in Oxford Chapel, where a
                    monument, with an epitaph in Latin, was erected to his memory. His curious
                    library was open to men of letters, to whom he readily communicated all the
                    assistance<pb break="no" facs="nls:194748403" xml:id="kp-eb0707-8403-0087"/> in
                    his power; he even furnished his antagonists with books to confute himself, and
                    directed them how to give their arguments ail the force of which they were
                    capable. He was, independently of his scepticism, a sincerely good man.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Collins,</hi><hi rend="italic">William,</hi> an admired
                    poet, was born at Chichester about the year 1724. He received his classical
                    education at Winchester, after which he studied at New College in Oxford, was
                    admitted a commoner of King’s College in the same university, and at length
                    elected a demy of Magdalene College. Whilst at Oxford he applied himself to the
                    study of poetry, and published his Oriental Eclogues; after which he came to
                    London. He was naturally possessed of an car for all the varieties of harmony
                    and modulation; his heart was susceptible of the finest feelings of tenderness
                    and humanity, and was particularly carried away by that high enthusiasm which
                    gives to imagination its strongest colouring; and he was at once capable of
                    soothing the ear with the melody of his numbers, of influencing the passions by
                    the force of pathos, and of gratifying the fancy by the luxury of description.
                    With these powers he attempted lyric poetry, and in 1746 published his Odes
                    descriptive and allegorical; but the sale of this work being not at all
                    answerable to its merit, he, from a feeling of indignation, burnt the remaining
                    copies. Being a man of a liberal spirit and small fortune, his pecuniary
                    resources were unhappily soon exhausted; and his life became a miserable example
                    of necessity, indolence, and dissipation. He projected books which he was well
                    able to execute, and became in idea an historian, a critic, and a dramatic poet;
                    but he wanted the means and encouragement to carry these ideas into execution.
                    Day succeeded day, for the support of which he had made no provision; and he was
                    obliged to subsist, either by the repeated contributions of friends or the
                    generosity of casual acquaintance. His spirits became oppressed, and he sunk
                    into a sullen despondence. Whilst in this gloomy state of mind, his uncle
                    Colonel Martin died, and left him a considerable fortune. But this came too late
                    for enjoyment; he had been so long harassed by anxiety and distress, that he
                    fell into a nervous disorder, which at length reduced the finest understanding
                    to the most deplorable childishness. In the first stages of this disorder he
                    endeavoured to relieve himself by travelling, and passed into France; but his
                    growing malady obliged him to return; and having, with short intervals,
                    continued in this pitiable state till the year 1756, he died in the arms of his
                    sister.</p>
                <p>The following character of the poetry of Collins is drawn by Mrs Barbauld, and is
                    extracted from an essay prefixed to an edition of his works published in 1797.
                    “He will be acknowledged to possess imagination, sweetness, bold and figurative
                    language. His numbers dwell on the ear, and easily fix themselves in the memory.
                    His vein of sentiment is by turns tender and lofty, always tinged with a degree
                    of melancholy, but not possessing any claim to originality. His originality
                    consists in his manner, in the highly figurative garb &lt;n which he clothes
                    abstract ideas, in the felicity of his expressions, and his skill in embodying
                    ideal creations. He had much of the mysticism of poetry, and sometimes became
                    obscure, by aiming at impressions stronger than he had clear and well-defined
                    ideas to support. Had his life been prolonged, and had lie with life enjoyed
                    that ease which is necessary for the undisturbed exercise of the faculties, he
                    would probably have risen far above most of his contemporaries.”</p>
                <p>lhe last and best edition of his works is that published by the Rev. A. Dyce in
                    1827, in 8vo. It contains his Life by Dr Johnson, observations on his writings
                    by Dr Langhorne, and biographical and critical notes by the editor.</p>
