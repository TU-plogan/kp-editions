                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    that which bears some historical inscription digested according to the order of
                    time; as by lustres, olympiads, fasti, epochas, annals, and the like. At Athens
                    there were columns of this kind, on which was inscribed the whole history of
                    Greece, digested into olympiads.</p>

                    eighty-five steps, and is illuminated by forty-three little windows, each of
                    which is divided by tambours of white marble. The Monument or fire-column at
                    London has also a staircase, but it does not reach to the top. These kinds of
                    columns are also called <hi rend="italic">columnoe, coclideae,</hi> or <hi

                    the son of Peisistratus raised another of this kind, of stone, containing the

                    order, fluted, hollow, with a winding staircase, and terminated at the top with
                    waving flames. There is also another of the kind, in form of an obelisk, on the
                    banks of the Rhine, in the Palatinate, in memory of the famous passage of that
                    river by the great Gustavus Adolphus and his army.</p>

                    and Ascanius refer to one Menias, who having sold his house to Cato and Claccus,
                    consuls, to be converted into a public edifice, reserved to himself the right of
                    raising a column on the outside, to bear a balcony, whence he might see the
                    shows.</p>

                    the Romans, a column on which was engraven a list of the forces in the Roman
                    army, ranged by legions in their proper order, with the design of preserving the
                    memory of the number of soldiers, and of the order observed in any military
                    expedition. They had another kind of military column, which they called <hi
                    rend="italic">columna bellica,</hi> standing before the temple of Janus, at the
                    foot of which the consul declared war by throwing a javelin towards the enemy’s
                    country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Military</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Column</hi> was a
                    column of marble raised by order of Augustus in the middle of the Roman forum,
                    and whence, as a centre, the distances of the several cities and stations of the
                    empire were reckoned, by other milliary columns disposed at equal distances on
                    all the great roads. This column was of white marble, the same with that which
                    is now seen on the balustrade of an edifice in the capitol at Rome. Its
                    proportion is massive, being a short cylinder, the symbol of the globe of the
                    earth. It was called <hi rend="italic">milliarium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aureum,</hi> as having been gilt, at least the ball, by order of Augustus. It
                    was restored by the emperors Vespasian and Hadrian, as appears by the
                    inscriptions.</p>

                    anciently a column erected on a tomb or sepulchre, with an inscription on its
                    base. Those over the tombs of persons of distinction were very large; those for
                    the common people, small. The latter are called <hi rend="italic">stelloe</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">cippi.</hi></p>

                    before the church of Santa Maria at Rome, to support a statue of the Virgin,
                    which is of gilt brass. This column was dug up in the temple of Peace; its shaft
                    is a single block of white marble, forty-nine feet six inches in height, and
