                <p><label type="entry">COTTON MANUFACTURE</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> cotton manufacture had its origin in the East,
                    where the cotton plant is indigenous, and where the climate renders a light and
                    absorbent fabric a suitable clothing for the people. It has in consequence been
                    long established over every part of Asia, although it is only in India that it
                    is carried on extensively, with a view to foreign exchange.</p>
                <p>Arrian mentions cotton cloth among the commodities which the Romans brought from
                    India; but the quantity imported by them was inconsiderable, arising from the
                    preference which they gave to woollen clothing. Dr Robertson remarks, that the
                    difference between the cargoes imported from India in ancient and in modern
                    times, appears to have arisen, not from any diversity in the nature of the goods
                    prepared for sale in that country, but from variety in the tastes or in the
                    wants of the nations with which they have successively traded.</p>
                <p>The implements used by the Indians in the different processes of the cotton
                    manufacture, from the cleaning of the wool to its conversion into the finest
                    muslin, may be purchased for the value of a few shillings, and are of so rude
                    and simple a construction as to be evidently the invention of a very early
                    period. With the exception of the loom, none of them deserves the name of a
                    machine, or displays the slightest mechanical ingenuity. They spin the yarn upon
                    the distaff; and yet, with all the advantages which we in this country derive
                    from machinery, we have never been able to equal, either in fineness or quality,
                    the yarn which is produced by means of this primitive instrument. The well
                    managed use of the finger and thumb of the Indian spinner, patiently and
                    carefully applied in the formation of the thread, and the moisture at the same
                    time communicated to it, are found to have the effect of incorporating the
                    fibres of the cotton more perfectly than can be accomplished by our most
                    improved machines.</p>
                <p>The loom is composed of a few sticks or reeds, which the Indian carries about
                    with him, and puts up in the fields under the shade of a tree, or at the side of
                    his cottage. He digs a hole large enough to contain his legs, and the lower part
                    of the “geer,” and fastens the balances to some convenient branch over head. Two
                    loops underneath the geer, in which he inserts his great toes, serve as
                    treadles, and he employs the shuttle, formed like a large netting needle, but of
                    a length somewhat exceeding the breadth of the cloth, as “battoon,” using it
                    alternately to draw through the weft and strike it up. The reed is the only part
                    of the weaving apparatus which approaches, in the perfection of its
                    construction, to the instruments we use. The loom has no beam, and the warp is
                    laid out upon the ground the whole length of the piece of cloth. The weavers
                    live entirely in villages, as they could not, if shut up in towns, work in this
                    manner. Upon this rude machine, worked in the way we have mentioned, the Indians
                    produce those muslins which,have long been such objects of curiosity, from the
                    exquisite beauty and fineness of their texture.</p>
                <p>It is probable that the whole of the implements which we have just described
                    existed as we now find them before the people of India were divided into castes.
                    The transmission of the same employment from father to son, which, although not
                    specially enjoined by the Hindu code, is the invariable practice in India, while
                    it has the effect of conveying unimpaired the knowledge acquired in any art,
                    tends to check its farther advancement. It is the opinion of Mr Rickards, who so
                    ably advocated the interests of the natives of India in the discussion in
                    parliament on the renewal of the Company’s charter (1814), that latterly this
                    form of society, with all its dependencies, habits, and restraints, has been
                    held together chiefly by the oppression of the fiscal exactions, the want of a
                    free trade, and the consequent universal poverty of the people. In support of
                    this opinion, he refers to what the Hindu population of Calcutta and Bombay have
                    achieved in the pursuits of commerce. We trust, however, that we may now look
                    forward to the speedy abolition of this system, so much opposed to all
                    development of talent, and which, by reducing man to the condition of a machine,
                    has paralyzed the exertions and arrested the improvement of the people of
                    India.</p>
                <p>To the same cause, however, which has thus precluded invention, is to be
                    attributed that dexterity in his particular employment, which the Indian artisan
                    possesses. From the earliest age he learns to spin and weave under the direction
                    of his father, and having no hope or desire of advancement in any other line, he
                    gains, through constant practice, that wonderful skill, which may thus be
                    considered almost as a family inheritance. To be able to manage his
                    ill-constructed loom, even in the production of ordinary fabrics, he is obliged
                    to acquire such a sleight of hand, that it is not surprising if, out of the
                    multitude trained in this manner, a few should be found capable of producing
                    those muslins which are said, when spread upon the grass, to appear like the
                    gossamer web. From the superiority of these goods, and from their retaining
                    their appearance longer than European muslins, it has been supposed that the
                    cotton of which they are made is of better quality than any known to the
                    European manufacturers. This, however, is a mistake; there is no cotton in India
                    of a quality superior to the best sea island. The excellence which these muslins
                    possess is to be ascribed wholly to the skilful tact of the workman in the
                    processes of spinning and weaving.</p>
                <p>But how dearly is this excellence of art purchased by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194752420" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2420-0396"/>the sacrifice of the better
                    faculties of man! How different is the effect produced by this branch of
                    industry upon the people and circumstances of India, from that produced by it
                    upon the people and circumstances of England! In the East, the cotton
                    manufacture has probably been carried on as extensively as at present, for some
                    thousand years; yet it has given birth to no inventions, to no increase of
                    national riches, to no improvement in the condition of the labouring class. The
                    scanty pittance which the poor artisan gains from h13 labour is spent by him in
                    his sustenance almost as soon as it is received. In England, the same
                    manufacture has not existed for more than seventy years, yet in that short time
                    it has given rise to some of the happiest efforts of ingenuity; it has been of
                    incalculable use in promoting mechanical skill; and the demand for additional
                    power created by the extension of its processes, has led to the perfecting of
                    the steam-engine, the most successful attempt which man has ever made to bend
                    the properties of matter to his will. How many canals, bridges, and rail-roads
                    have been formed for the circulation of its products; how many new cities, and
                    what an increase of population, has it called into existence; how many new
                    agricultural markets has it been the cause of establishing; and how mightily has
                    it thus increased the comforts and the means of enjoyment of the community!</p>
                <p>In India, this manufacture has not only failed to improve the condition of the
                    people—it does not appear even to have afforded to those engaged in it the means
                    of accumulating the capital necessary to carry it on; for both the price of the
                    material and the wages of the workmen, in place of being supplied by the master
                    manufacturer, are advanced by the purchaser of the goods.</p>
                <p>Thus, the East India Company, who until lately were in the habit of making a
                    great part of their remittances in manufactures, actually advanced, through
                    their Residents, the funds required to enable the workmen to produce the goods.
                    To assist, this officer, they placed under him a number of European servants,
                    and an establishment of native clerks and of persons termed Peons, whose duty it
                    was to watch and control the weavers. The resident, when he had to provide an
                    investment, entered into a contract for the goods, either with the native
                    merchants acting as brokers, or with the master manufacturer or headsman, and
                    these parties made subsidiary agreements with the weavers. The resident then
                    advanced money for carrying on the work to the chief contractors, who
                    distributed it to the different classes of workmen, and were responsible for the
                    delivery of the manufactured goods at the Company’s warehouse, in the state
                    stipulated in the contract. The commercial resident never interfered with the
                    arrangements or operations of the contractors, except when complaints were made
                    of delay or fraud, arising from the interference of other brokers, or
                    contractors acting for other parties than the Company, and then a host of Peons
                    were sent forth by him to intimidate, and, if necessary, to coerce the weaver.
                    The resident, when not engaged in providing goods for the Company’s investment,
                    was authorized to employ the weavers on his own account. This greatly increased
                    his influence over those people, who having him constantly among them, as head
                    of the little colony, and being unable at any time to move a step without his
                    advances, felt themselves in a state of entire dependence upon him. Thus,
                    although the brokers, who made contracts for the Portuguese and others, were
                    gene- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> rally willing to give higher prices than
                    those which the resident arbitrarily fixed, the weavers, however they might be
                    disposed to elude his orders, or to outwit him in his operations, never ventured
                    openly to dispute his will. Various laws and regulations were enacted to protect
                    these poor people in their transactions with the Company’s agents, but where the
                    sovereign was the chief trader, and a party in the cause, the impartial
                    administration of justice was not to be looked for.</p>
                <p>For some years past, the East India Company have ceased to remit so large a part
                    of their revenue as formerly in manufactured produce. So far, however, as they
                    still do so, the goods are provided in the manner we have pointed out; and the
                    same mode is followed by private merchants, trading on their own account, for
                    the purpose of obtaining goods for export.</p>
                <p>Common muslins are made in every village throughout the peninsula. Orme says,
                    “When not near the high road or a principal town, it is difficult to find a
                    village in which every man, woman, and child, is not employed in making a piece
                    of cloth.”</p>
                <p>The very fine muslins to which we have alluded, of such exquisite texture as to
                    have been poetically designated “webs of woven wind,” are made at Dacca. They
                    were intended chiefly for the use of the potentates of the country, who kept
                    agents to superintend the workmen employed in the manufacture; but since the
                    assumption by the Company of the territories of these Indian princes, the demand
                    has fallen off, and a considerable part of the population have betaken
                    themselves to the cultivation of indigo. The cotton from which the muslins of
                    Dacca are woven, grows in a district of not more than forty miles in length by
                    three in breadth, and in such limited quantity as never to have become an
                    article of commerce.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Since this article was sent to the press, we have received a communication
                    from Moorshedabad on the present state of the Dacca muslin manufacture,
                    accompanied by a sample of the Dacca cotton wool, and some skeins of the yarn
                    spun from it. The wool is equal in fineness to the very best sea island, of
                    still stronger staple, but so short as to preclude the possibility of its being
                    spun by our machinery. The district in which the cotton is grown is stated to be
                    periodically overflowed. The yam is of different grists, the coarsest <hi
                    rend="italic">greatly</hi> finer than the highest number spun in this country
                    (No. 250), while the finest has been rated by an experienced spinner to whom we
                    have shown it, to be of a fineness not under 350. It is beyond our conception
                    how this yarn can be spun by the distaff and spindle, or woven afterwards by <hi
                    rend="italic">any</hi> machinery.</p></note></p>
                <p>The long cloths and fine pullicats are made chiefly within the presidency of
                    Madras, the coarse piece goods and pullicats in Surat, the finest calicoes at
                    Masulipa-tarn, and tablecloths of a superior quality at Patna. Each district
                    varies from the others in the nature of its productions, as may be seen from the
                    different denominations of cotton goods to be found in every investment coming
                    from India. - - - —</p>
                <p>An apprehension has sometimes been expressed that the inhabitants of India, in
                    possession of the raw material, may obtain <hi rend="italic">a</hi> knowledge of
                    our machinery, and, by combining with its péeuliar advantages their cheaper
                    labour and superior manual dexterity, may be enabled to undersell us to such a
                    degree as to ruin and put an end to our manufacture; but in the state of the
                    people of India there are circumstances which Vender this impossible, without a
                    change being first produced upon their moral condition, their institutions, and
                    their habits. ’ The training which makes the Indian, with such imperfect tools,
                    able to perform his work so well, disqualifies him from doing it in any other
                    way, or with any other implements than those to which he has been familiarized
                    from his infancy. The attempt· to introduce our machinery into India is,
                    however, now making. A spinning mill has <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752433"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2433-0397"/>been built at Calcutta, and although the private
                    company which commenced the undertaking has failed, the work continues to be
                    carried on. There are at present nearly seven hundred persons employed in the
                    mill, engaged at the rate of about seven shillings each per month; but these
                    people, it is found, cannot continue to work beyond a few hours at a time, and a
                    succession of hands to carry on the operations through the day is required. To
                    train them, in such circumstances, to dexterity and skill, is impossible; and,
                    accordingly, the yarn spun is not only of inferior quality, but, even with the
                    low nominal wages, costs so much as to disqualify it for competition with the
                    yarn of this country.</p>
                <p>The extensive introduction of machinery into Great Britain has meanwhile, by
                    reducing the price of our manufactures, enabled us not only to maintain a
                    successful competition with the India goods at home, but to send cottons to a
                    great amount to India itself. A complete revolution has in consequence taken
                    place in the nature of the exports from that country to Europe, and indeed to
                    all the markets on this side of the Cape of Good Hope. When we first got
                    possession of India, our investments at home were principally (in point of value
                    almost entirely) composed of manufactured produce. They are now in a great
                    measure made up of the produce of the soil, indigo, cotton wool, raw silk,
                    saltpetre, &amp;c.&amp;c. It might have been expected that this change would
                    have produced most distressing effects upon the crowded population of a country
                    such as India, which in all ages has been a great manufacturing and exporting
                    community; but no materially unfavourable consequences have flowed from it. In
                    India every manufacturer is at the same time a husbandman. When not employed to
                    make a web, he supports his family by agricultural labour. It thus happened,
                    that in proportion as the demand for goods for export declined, the natives,
                    without difficulty, and without that distress which generally attends a change
                    of employment in other countries, were able to direct their attention more and
                    more to agriculture, and the result has hitherto been rather an improvement in
                    their condition than otherwise.</p>

                <p>The cotton manufacture of China is of immense amount, and is carried on almost
                    entirely for home consumption; but its origin is not of the same remote date as
                    that of India. Indeed the lateness of its rise, and the slowness of its
                    progress, in a situation so favourable, appear extraordinary. In the accounts of
                    the revenues and of the art’s of China during the period of the celebrated
                    dynasty which commenced about 1100 years before the Christian era, and lasted
                    for some centuries, no mention is made of the cotton plant; nor indeed is there
                    any notice of cotton in these records until about 200 years before the Christian
                    era, from which period to the sixth century, the cotton cloth, which was either
                    paid in tribute, or offered in presents to the emperors, is always mentioned as
                    a thing rare and precious.</p>
                <p>The annals record as a singular circumstance that the Emperor Ou-ti, who mounted
                    the tliróne in 502, had a robe of cotton. In the seventh century we find the
                    cotton plant mentioned, but its cultivation appears to have been then confined
                    to gardens; and the poems and romances of that period are occupied in
                    celebrating the beauty of its flowers. From these circumstances we may venture
                    to say that there could have been no manufacture of the article in the country
                    at that time. It was in the eleventh century that the cotton plant was first
                    removed from the gardens to the fields, and became an object of common culture;
                    and it is not until this period that we can date the commencement of the
                    manufacture. So slow and backward sometimes are nations, far advanced in other
                    respects, to prosecute objects, afterwards considered<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194752446" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2446-0398"/> by them as indispensable to
                    their comforts. This is the more remarkable in the case of the Chinese, a
                    peo-þle possessed of much ingenuity, and awake to every thing connected with
                    self-interest.</p>
                <p>The cotton tree was introduced into China at the time of the conquest of that
                    country by the Mogul Tartars, in the year 1280; after which period every
                    encouragement was given by government to the culture and manufacture of cotton.
                    But there were considerable difficulties to be encountered, in the prejudices of
                    the people, and in the opposition of those engaged in the manufacture of woollen
                    and linen; and it was not until the year 1368 that these obstacles were
                    altogether surmounted. After that date the progress of the cotton manufacture
                    was rapid, and now nine tenths of the population are clothed in its fabrics.</p>
                <p>Almost the only cotton goods exportcd from China are nanl&lt;cens. Barrow states
                    the production of all the fabrics of the Chinese manufacture at the time lie
                    visited the country in 1792 to be stationary, attributing this to the want of
                    proper encouragement from the government, and to the rigid adherence of the
                    people to ancient usages. To keep a manufacture in a progressive state, there
                    must be a progressive demand for its products; and the Chinese manufacturers
                    having no means of disposing of any surplus quantity, must accommodate the
                    supply to the wants of their own consumption. It is said by travellers who have
                    obtained access to that country, that the people show a great desire for
                    articles of British manufacture. How valuable then to both countries would be
                    the establishment of a free intercourse, and how conducive probably to the
                    increase of the productions of both!</p>
                <p>The Chinese, over and above the cotton wool which they raise at home, import
                    largely from British India, and from the Burmese territories. This intercourse
                    commenced about fifty-five years ago. A famine, which happened in China about
                    that period, induced the government to direct, by an imperial edict, that a
                    greater proportion of the land should be thrown into the cultivation of grain.
                    Since then, the importation of cotton from India has been considerable, although
                    constituting but a small part of what is consumed in their manufacture. The
                    amount of the importations is stated at 40,000 bales.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of cotton goods in Europe is said to have been first attempted by
                    the commercial states of Italy, before the discovery of the passage to India by
                    the Cape of Good Hope. These enterprising communities were the entrepôts through
                    which the cotton fabrics, of India passed to the different markets of the West;
                    and being situated in the neighbourhood of countries where the cotton wool was
                    grown, and familiar with manufacturing processes, it is supposed that they were
                    led to attempt the imitation of articles so much valued, and bringing so high a
                    price. Another speculation places the introduction of the cotton manufacture
                    into Europe at a later date, and gives to the people of the Low Countries the
                    honour of having been the first manufacturers of these articles, in imitation of
                    the cotton fabrics which the Dutch, about the beginning of the seventeenth
                    century, began to import from India. But this last account cannot be correct;
                    for Guicciardini, in 1560, in a very full list which he gives of the different
                    articles annually imported into and exported from Antwerp,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Macpherson’s <hi rend="italic">Annals of
                    Commerce.</hi></p></note> then the greatest commercial mart in Europe, specifies
                    fustians and dimities of many fine sorts among the manufactured articles
                    imported from Milan, and mentions cottons generally among those brought from
                    Venice. But in the articles exported from Antwerp, although we find linens sent
                    to almost every country, cotton cloth is not once mentioned. Italy, therefore,
                    at that time had a cotton manufacture, which, it is probable, soon after made
                    its way to the Netherlands; for we know it was brought from the latter country
                    to Britain by Protestant refugees about the close of the sixteenth or early in
                    the seventeenth century.</p>
                <p>That this manufacture was carried on in England at a pretty early period of the
                    seventeenth century, we know from good authority. Lewis Roberts, in his
                    “Treasure of Traffic,” published in the year 1641, says, “The town of Manchester
                    buys linen yarn from the Irish in great quantity, and weaving it, returns the
                    same again in linen into Ireland to sell. Neither does her industry rest here;
                    for they buy cotton wool in London that comes from Cyprus and Smyrna, and work
                    the same into fustians, vermilions, and dimities, which they return to London,
                    where they are sold, and from thence not seldom are sent into such foreign
                    parts, where the first material may be more easily had for that manufacture.”
                    These goods were woven chiefly about Bolton, and were purchased there at the
                    weekly market by the Manchester dealers, who afterwards finished them, and
                    either sent them to London for export, or sold them to their customers over the
                    country-</p>
                <p>At this period, and for a long time after, the weaver provided his own warp,
                    which was of linen yarn, and the cotton wool for his weft, buying them wherever
                    he could best supply himself. But as the trouble of looking about for these
                    materials was found to be an unprofitable application of his time, the
                    Manchester purchasers established agents in the different villages for the sale
                    of those articles. In this way of conducting the business, each weaver’s cottage
                    formed a separate and independent little factory. The yarn for his warp was
                    bought by him in a prepared state, the wool for his weft was carded and spun by
                    the female part of his family, and the cloth was woven by himself and his
                    sons.</p>
                <p>This is the situation in which we generally find a manufacture before the
                    introduction of machinery, and particularly before it has been carried to such
                    an extentas to allow of a division of labour, and a separation of the different
                    processes into distinct employments. At this stage, the workman has usually his
                    residence in the country, where lie can be accommodated with a little garden
                    ground, and perhaps with grass for a cow; and there, in the bosom of his family,
                    aided by the industry of its different members, he prosecutes his employment.
                    How much more of the comforts of life and of the means of natural enjoyment
                    belong to this state of the manufacture than to the more advanced one, in which
                    combined systems of machinery, and a more perfect division of labour, collect
                    the workmen into factories and towns 1</p>
                <p>It would be impossible to enumerate all the descriptions of cotton goods which,
                    in succession, were brought forward from the commencement of the
                    manufacture.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    fustians that were made at this early period of the manufacture were those
                    denominated herring-bone, pillows for pockets and outside wear, strong cotton
                    ribs and barragon, broad raced linen thickset and tufts, with whitened diaper,
                    striped dimities, and jeans. At some distance of time there were added to these,
                    cotton thicksets, goods figured in the loom; and at a still later date, cotton
                    velvets, velveteens, and strong and fancy cords· (Aitken’s <hi rend="italic"

                    houses in the trade, which were circulated from time to time through the kingdom
                    and over the continents of Europe and America, exhibited specimens of nearly two
                    thousand kinds, comprehending in the assortment every variety of taste and
                    fancy.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752459" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2459-0399"/>
                <p>For the introduction and after improvement of many of these articles, the country
                    is indebted to the late Mr John Wilson of Ainsworth. This gentleman was
                    originally a manufacturer of fustians at Manchester, but had early engaged in
                    the manufacture of cotton velvets, and by persevering efforts he succeeded in
                    bringing it to the utmost degree of perfection. His improvement of the mode of
                    dressing, of finishing, and particularly of dyeing these goods, acquired for
                    them so high a character, that both in the home and foreign market his articles
                    sold in preference to those of every other manufacturer. His plan for cleaning
                    off the loose and uneven fibres was by the use of razors. He afterwards
                    successively employed for this end singeing by spirits of wine, and the
                    application of a hot iron resembling a weaver’s drying iron, which last
                    instrument had been introduced for the same purpose in the manufacture carried
                    on in the Manchester house of correction, by Mr Whitlow, governor of that
                    institution. At a later period Mr Wilson effected his object by drawing the
                    goods rapidly over a cylinder of cast iron heated to redness, by which they were
                    in a superior manner cleared of the down or pile which had been raised upon them
                    in the various operations of weaving,washing, bleaching, or dyeing. These
                    successive inventions of Mr λVilson, for performing this process, give us some
                    idea of the manner in which improvements are introduced into our manufactures,
                    when fortunately the efforts of self-interest are directed by intelligence and
                    talent. Mr Wilson having a turn for chemical inquiries, investigated the
                    different known processes of dyeing; and, by the improvements he introduced in
                    the application of them to his own manufacture, materially advanced that art.
                    Having succeeded to his satisfaction in dyeing the other rich colours, he
                    procured from the Greeks of Smyrna the secret of dyeing Turkey red. An account
                    of this process was given by him in two essays, read to the Philosophical and
                    Literary Society of Manchester, and which, on his retiring from business, he
                    printed and distributed among his friends. The many valuable improvements
                    introduced by Mr Wilson into the different processes connected with the cotton
                    manufacture had the effect not only to establish it more firmly, but rapidly to
                    enlarge its extent.</p>
                <p>A considerable share of the calico printing business was transferred, about the
                    year 1760, from London to Lancashire, in consequence of the cheaper
                    accommodation for carrying on the work, and the lower wages of the workmen. A
                    fall in prices thereupon took place, and this cheapness produced an increased
                    demand for calicoes. These goods were at that time made of linen warp and cotton
                    weft, it having been found impracticable, before Sir Richard Arkwright’s
                    discovery, to spin cotton warp of sufficient strength.</p>
                <p>At this period the dealers from Manchester, in place of buying fustians and
                    calicoes from the weaver, as had been the practice before, began to furnish him
                    with materials for the cloth, and to pay him a fixed price per piece for die
                    work when executed. Along with a portion of linen warp, they gave him out a
                    portion of cotton wool, which he was obliged to get spun into the weft he was to
                    use. But so fast was the manufacture by this time outstripping the process of
                    spinning, that it frequently happened that the sum which the master weaver was
                    allowed by his employer was less than what he found himself obliged to pay to
                    those whom he employed to spin it. He durst not, however, complain, much less
                    abate the spinner’s price, lest his looms should be unemployed. In this state of
                    things, the further progress of the manufacture must have been stopped, if a
                    more productive mode of spinning had not been discovered.</p>
                <p>It has been said that the yarn produced at this time in England, by the
                    one-thread wheel, the only spinning machine known, did not exceed in quantity
                    what 50,000 spindles of our present machinery can yield. To have reared and
                    trained hands sufficient to have doubled this quantity, had it been possible,
                    must have been the work of a length of time, and the amount of the manufacture
                    would still have been insignificant. A change in the system, therefore, had
                    become indispensable; and we find that different ingenious individuals had
                    already begun to employ themselves in contriving a better mode of spinning.</p>
                <p>When we contrast the splendid inventions connected with the cotton manufacture,
                    which from this period burst forth in rapid succession, with the passive
                    acquiescence in the use of imperfect machinery' during the long period which
                    preceded, we are apt to ascribe these improvements to the circumstance alone of
                    a number of men of genius having at that moment arisen, and to forget that the
                    ultimate cause exists in the times which called their energies into action.</p>
                <p>Already, about the year 1750, the fly-shuttle had been invented, one of the most
                    important steps in the progress of the art of weaving; and in the year 1760
                    improvements had begun to be made in the carding process.</p>
                <p>James Hargreaves, a weaver at Stanhill, near Church, in Lancashire, an illiterate
                    man, possessed of no great mechanical knowledge, had adapted the stock cards
                    used in the woollen manufacture, to the carding of cotton, and had besides
                    greatly improved them. By his invention a person was able to do double the work,
                    and with more case than by hands carding. In the stock cards, one of the cards
                    is fixed, whilst the other, being suspended by a cord over a pulley, is worked
                    by the carder; and :n this way two or three cards can be applied to the same
                    stock.</p>
                <p>This contrivance was soon succeeded by the cylinder cards, or carding engine. It
                    is not ascertained who was the inventor of this valuable machine, but it is
                    known that the grandfather of the present Sir Robert Peel was among the first
                    persons who used it; and that, so early as 1762, he, with the assistance of
                    Hargreaves, erected a carding engine with cylinders at Blackburn. This machine
                    did not differ materially from that now in use, except that it had no
                    contrivance for detaching the cotton from the cards, an operation which was
                    performed by women with hand cards.</p>
                <p>These successful advances show that the minds of the manufacturing class had been
                    awakened to discovery, and must have encouraged and stimulated the efforts that
                    were then making to effect corresponding improvements in spinning.</p>
                <p>There had been several unsuccessful attempts to improve the mode of spinning
                    before the year 1767, when James Hargreaves, whom we have already mentioned,
                    invented the “<hi rend="italic">Spinning Jenny”</hi> The idea of this machine is
                    said to have been suggested to him by seeing a common spinning wheel which had
                    been accidentally overturned, continue its motion while it layon the ground. If
                    such was the cause, it marks a mind of no common description, which from so
                    casual an occurrence could elicit an invention of so much importance.</p>
                <p>After several unsuccessful attempts to carry into execution the conception he had
                    formed, he succeeded in producing a rudely constructed <hi rend="italic"
                    >jenny</hi> of eight spindles, turned by bands from a horizontal wheel. In it
                    the eight rovings were passed between two pieces of wood laid horizontally the
                    breadth of the machine; and these being grasped in the spinner’s hand, and drawn
                    out by' him, formed the rovings into threads. The structure of this “jenny” was
                    soon afterwards greatly improved, and it was at last brought to work as many as
                    eighty spindles. This machine, although of limited powers when compared with the
                    beautiful<pb break="no" facs="nls:194752472" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2472-0400"/>
                    inventions which succeeded it, must be considered as the first and leading step
                    in that progress of discovery which carried improvement into every branch of the
                    manufacture—which, as it proceeded, changed the nature and character of the
                    means of production, by substituting mechanical operations for human
                    labour—which caused the manufactured article to become more and more a product
                    of capital. The progress of invention after this was rapid; for when it was seen
                    that, with the aid of the few mecha-. nical combinations we have mentioned, the
                    spinner had been enabled to increase his power of production nearly eighty fold,
                    the attention of tboseengaged inother branches of manufacture was awakened to
                    the possibility of introducing changes equally beneficial into their peculiar
                    employments.</p>
                <p>Hargreaves’ invention occasioned great alarm among those who earned their
                    subsistence by the old mode of spinning, and even produced popular commotion. A
                    mob broke into his house and destroyed his machine; and some time after, when a
                    better knowledge of the advantage of his invention had begun to bring his
                    “spinning jenny” into general use, the people rose a second time, and scouring
                    the country, broke to pieces every carding and spinning machine they could find.
                    Hargreaves himself had by this time removed to Nottingham, where he was engaged
                    in erecting a small spinning work, about the same period that Mr Arkwright came
                    to settle there, being also driven from Lancashire by the fear of similar
                    violence.</p>
                <p>The “jenny” in a short time put an end to the spinning of cotton by the common
                    wheel, and the whole wefts used in the manufacture continued to be spun upon
                    that machine, until the invention of the “mule jenny,” by which it was in its
                    turn superseded. Hargreaves died in great poverty a few years after his removal
                    to Nottingham.</p>
                <p>While Hargreaves was producing the common jenny, Mr Arkwright (afterwards Sir
                    Richard Arkwright) was employed in contriving that wonderful piece of mechanism,
                    the spinning frame, which, when put in motion, performs of itself the whole
                    process of spinning, leaving to the workman only the office of supplying the
                    material, and of joining or piecing the thread when it happens to break.</p>
                <p>The extraordinary person to whom we owe this invention was born in the year 1732,
                    at Preston, in Lancashire, of parents in poor circumstances, and was the
                    youngest of thirteen children. He was brought up to the humble occupation of a
                    barber, and up to the time when he made his discovery he continued to derive his
                    subsistence from the exercise of this employment. Living in a manufacturing
                    district, it is probable that his attention was drawn to the mechanical
                    contrivances around him; and that hearing from every one complaints of the
                    deficient supply of cotton yarn, he was stimulated to contrive a plan for
                    increasing the production, by changing the mode of spinning. Even after he had
                    matured the conception of what he proposed to execute, he had great difficulty
                    in giving his ideas a practical form, from his total want of mechanical skill
                    and experience; and his discovery was likely to have been lost to the world,
                    from his not being able to find any person willing to embark the capital that
                    was necessary to give the undertaking a fair trial. None but a person of his
                    ardour and perseverance could have overcome such obstacles.</p>
                <p>It has already been mentioned that Mr Arkwright had removed to Nottingham. Here
                    he prevailed upon the Messrs Wrights, bankers, to advance him the sums of money
                    necessary to enable him to go on with his experiments, it being understood that,
                    if his plan succeeded, they were to share in the profits. These gentlemen,
                    however, finding the amount of their advances swell to a larger sum than they
                    had expected, while there seemed to them little prospect of the discovery being
                    brought into practical operation, informed Mr Arkwright that the transaction
                    being out of the ordinary course of their business, they would be glad if he
                    could get some one else to take their place, and repay them their money; and
                    they mentioned Mr Need of Nottingham as a person likely to do this, from his
                    being already engaged in other patent discoveries, and acquainted with such
                    undertakings. Mr Arkwright in consequence applied to Mr Need, who told him he
                    had no objection to join in the scheme, if he could be satisfied that the
                    discovery was such as he represented it, and desired him to carry the model of
                    his machine to Mr Strutt of Derby, his partner in the stocking patent, by whose
                    report he would be guided. Mr Strutt, a man of great mechanical knowledge,
                    seeing at a glance the merit of the invention, and how little was required to
                    render it complete, told Mr Need that he might with great safety close with Mr
                    Arkwright; the onty thing wanting to his model being an adaptation of some of
                    the wheels to each other, which, from want of science, the inventor, with all
                    his powers of contrivance, had not been able to accomplish.</p>
                <p>In the year 1769, Mr Arkwright obtained his patent for spinning with rollers, and
                    Mr Need and Mr Strutt became his partners in the concerns to be carried on under
                    it. He erected a mill at Nottingham, which he worked by horse power. But this
                    mode of giving motion to the machinery being expensive, he, in the year 1771,
                    built another mill at Cromford, in Derbyshire, to which motion was given by
                    water.</p>
                <p>In 1772, his patent was contested, on the ground that he was not the original
                    inventor of the process for which it was obtained; but a verdict was given in
                    his favour, and his right to the exclusive use of the discovery remained
                    afterwards undisturbed.</p>
                <p>Mr Arkwright, soon after his removal to Cromford, followed up his first great
                    discovery with other inventions and combinations of machinery tor preparing the
                    cotton for spinning, by which perfection was gradually given to the process
                    through all its successive operations. For these additional improvements he took
                    out another patent in the year 1775. But in 1781, his right to this second
                    patent was disputed, on the plea that he was not the inventor of some of the
                    mechanical contrivances comprehended under it; and after different trials of the
                    question before the Courts of King’s Bench and Common Pleas, judgment was
                    finally given against him in November 1785, and the patent cancelled.</p>
                <p>The originality of Mr Arkwright’s mind, as well as the merit of his invention of
                    the spinning frame, appear most striking when we consider the little resemblance
                    between this machine and the common spinning wheel. FIis discovery did not
                    consist in improving an instrument which already existed, but in the invention
                    of an entirely new means for performing the same process in a better manner.
                    When this is kept in view, it seems extraordinary that such a contrivance should
                    have been the production of a person in his circumstances. His after inventions
                    ļ for preparing the cotton, which are sometimes spoken of as the most wonderful
                    parts of the process of cotton spinning, do not appear to us so striking as this
                    first effort of his genius. Besides the advance in mechanical knowledge which he
                    must have made before the time when they were produced, these inventions,
                    although only to have been conceived by an original and fertile mind, are still
                    but improved arrangements of a machine previously in use, or applications of his
                    own spinning machine altered and adapted to the accomplishment of this object.
                    But the power of his mind was perhaps marked by nothing more strongly than the
                    judgment with which, although new to business, he conducted the great concerns
                    to which <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752485" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2485-0401"/>his
                    discovery gave rise, and the systematic order and arrangement which he
                    introduced into every department of his extensive works. His plans of
                    management, which must have been entirely his own, as no establishment of à
                    similar nature then existed, were universally adopted by others; and after long
                    experience they have not yet, in any material point, been altered or
                    improved.</p>
                <p>In 1786, Mr Arkwright, on presenting an address from the county of Derby, of
                    which he was then high sheriff, had the honour of knighthood conferred upon
                    him.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed to give an account of the different machines used in cotton
                    spinning, invented by Sir Richard Arkwright, and of those afterwards invented by
                    others, describing them in the order in which they are employed. In this manner
                    we shall be able to exhibit a view of the present state of the art.</p>
                <p>The cotton wool, after it has been carefully picked, either by the hand or by a
                    machine, is carried to the carding engine. This machine consists of two or more
                    large ’cylinders covered with cards, with teeth like those of hand cards, which
                    revolve in opposite directions, and nearly in contact with each other. These
                    cylinders are either surmounted by other small ones, covered in like manner with
                    cards, by whose revolutions in opposite directions to those of the larger
                    cylinders, and with different velocities, the cotton is carded, and put on the
                    last or finishing cylinder; or, as is now more generally practised, the first
                    cylinder, that is, the one nearest the feeder, is surrounded by a fixed concave
                    framing lined with cards, which coming nearly in contact with the cylinder
                    cards, produce the same effect in the process as the top cylinders, and in a
                    more simple manner. (See Plate CLXXVII. fig. 1, 2, 3, 4.)</p>
                <p>We have noticed, in speaking of the carding engine which Mr Peel erected in 1762,
                    that at that time the cotton was taken off the finishing cylinder by means of
                    hand cards. But by the time Mr Arkwright began his spinning, this operation was
                    performed by the application of a roller with tin plates upon it like the floats
                    of a water wheel, which, revolving with a quick motion, scraped off the cotton
                    from the card. This was a rude contrivance, and in its operation injured both
                    the cotton and the cards. Mr Arkwright substituted for it a plate of metal,
                    toothed at the edge like a comb, which, in place of being made to revolve like
                    the other, was moved rapidly in a perpendicular direction by a crank, and, with
                    slight but reiterated strokes on the teeth of the cards, detached the cotton
                    from them in a uniform fleece. In place also of sheet cards, with which the
                    finishing cylinder had hitherto been covered, he employed narrow fillet cards,
                    wound round it in a spiral form, by which contrivance a continuity of the fleece
                    was produced, which, as it left the card, was gradually contracted in its size
                    by being passed through a kind of funnel, and then flattened or compressed
                    between two rollers, after which it was received into a tin can in the state of
                    a uniform continued carding.</p>
                <p>The taking off the cotton from the cards in this manner is one of the most
                    beautiful and curious operations in the process of cotton spinning; and although
                    the crank, which forms a part' of the apparatus, had perhaps been used in some
                    way or other prior to the date of Mr Arkwright’s second patent, as was urged in
                    the action for having it set aside, the comb for taking off the fleece, and the
                    spiral card which produces its continuity, were inventions indisputably his
                    own.</p>
                <p>The next step in the process after the carding is what is called drawing the
                    cotton. The machine employed for this purpose, called the drawing frame, is
                    constructed upon the same principle as the spinning frame, from which machine
                    the idea of it was taken. To imitate the operation performed by the finger and
                    thumb in hand spinning, two pairs of rollers are employed; the first pair,
                    slowly revolving in contact with each other, are placed at a little distance
                    from the second pair, which revolve with greater velocity. The lower roller of
                    each pair is furrowed or fluted longitudinally, and the upper one is neatly
                    covered with leather, to give the two a proper hold of the cotton. If we’
                    suppose a carding to be passed between the first pair of rollers, it will be
                    drawn forward as they move, but without any change in its form and texture
                    further than a slight compression received from the incumbent roller. But if,
                    from the first pair, it be passed through the second, moving with twice or
                    thrice the velocity of the first, it will be drawn twice or thrice smaller than
                    it was when it entered the first rollers. In the succeeding operation, two,
                    three, or more of these drawings are passed together through the rollers in the
                    same manner, coalescing as they pass, and forming a single new drawing. This
                    doubling and drawing is several times repeated, having the effect to arrange all
                    the fibres of the cotton longitudinally in a unífbrm and parallel direction, and
                    to do away with all inequalities of thickness. In these operations the cotton
                    receives no twist. (See Plate CLXXVII. fig. 5, 6.)</p>
                <p>Roving the cotton, which is the next part of the process of preparation, is an
                    operation similar to that employed for drawing it, only that, to give the rove,
                    in its now reduced thickness, such a degree of tenacity as will make it hold
                    together, a slight twist is given to it, converting it into a soft and loose
                    thread. This is effected by passing it, as it leaves the rollers, into a conical
                    can, which, while receiving it, révolves with considerable velocity. (See Plate
                    CLXXVII. fig. 7, 8, 9.) After this the rove is wound by the hand upon a bobbin
                    by the younger children of the mill, and carried to the spinning frame.</p>
                <p>About the year 1817, the fly frame was introduced for preparing rovings for the
                    middle and coarser numbers of both warp and weft; and this machine having
                    received considerable improvements since, has nearly superseded the use of the
                    roving frame. Instead of the revolving cans of the roving frame, the fly frame
                    has spindles placed at equal distances from each other, with a fly on the top of
                    each, one of the legs of which is made in the form of a tube, for the purpose of
                    receiving the roving and conveying it to the bobbin. The rollers deliver the
                    roving to the top of the fly, where it passes through a small hole immediately
                    above the centre of the spindle, called the eye of the fly, and from which it
                    descends through the tube to the bobbin, which is fitted loosely on the spindle.
                    The fly revolves rapidly round the bobbin, and winds the roving on it as fast as
                    it is delivered by the rollers. (Seö Plate CLXXIX. fig. 1, 2.) The motion of the
                    rollers and spindles are equal and uniform at all times; hence the twist is
                    equally diffused over all parts of the roving. But to adapt the taking up of the
                    roving to the uniform delivery of the rollers, the speed of the bobbin must be
                    variable and unequal; for while it increases in diameter, the velocity of its
                    acting circumference will remain the same. The ratio of its accelerating motion,
                    therefore, must be equal to the ratio of its increasing diameter; that is,
                    supposing the bobbin to follow the fly; but sometimes the fly follows the
                    bobbin, in which case the speed of the bobbin must decrease in the same ratio as
                    above.</p>
                <p>An important improvement in the process of preparation for cotton spinning is the
                    tube frame lately introduced. It is employed as a finishing frame for coarse
                    numbers; but, tvhen used as a slabbing or roving frame, it maybe applied to the
                    preparation of yarns of any number whatever. The construction of this machine
                    differs from that of the roving frame, in having, instead of cans, revolving
                    horizontal cylinders, parallel with the beam rollers, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194752498" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2498-0402"/>placed about twelve inches in
                    front of the beam. Its chief advantage lies in the great quantity of roving it
                    can produce in a given time, its superiority of production to the fly frame
                    being as eighty-four to seventeen; but the rove it produces is inferior in
                    quality, and, having no twist, is extremely soft and tender, and causes a
                    greater quantity of waste than the roves prepared by the fly frame.</p>
                <p>The spinning frame has the double set of rollers which have been described in the
                    account given of the drawing and roving frames, and which, operating in the same
                    manner as in those machines, extend the rove, and reduce it to a thread of the
                    required fineness. The twist is given to the thread by the application of the
                    spindle and fly of the common flax wheel, adopted in the machine for this
                    purpose. (See Plate CLXXVIII∙ fig. 10.)</p>
                <p>The yarn produced by this mode of spinning is called water twist, from the
                    circumstance of the machinery by which it is obtained having been, for a long
                    time after its invention, put in motion by water.</p>
                <p>The only attempt to extend the principle comprehended in Sir Richard Arkwright’s
                    first contrivance, the spinning frame, is to be found in the machine called the
                    throstle, introduced about the year 1810. In this machine the spinning apparatus
                    is in every respect the same as in Sir Richard Arkwright’s frame, but the
                    movement of the parts is different.</p>
                <p>In place of four or six spindles being coupled together, forming what is called a
                    head, with a separate movement by a pulley and drum, as is the case in the
                    frame, the whole rollers and spindles on both sides of the throstle are
                    connected together, and turned by bands from a tin cylinder lying horizontally
                    under the machine. The merit of the invention chiefly lies in the simplification
                    of the moving apparatus just mentioned. The movement is not only rendered
                    lighter, but greater facility is afforded for increasing the speed of the
                    machine, and consequently, when the nature of the spinning admits it, for
                    obtaining a larger production. The throstle can also, with more ease, and at
                    less expense, be altered to spin the different grists of yarn; only a few
                    movements require to be changed in it to produce this end, while in the spinning
                    frame there are a great many. (See Plate CLXXVIII. fig. 11.)</p>
                <p>An improvement on the throstle, which was thought to be very promising, was
                    lately made, by Mr Danforth, an American spiniíer. His object was to obviate the
                    vibration of the spindle (caused by the flyer being placed on the top of it,
                    with nothing to keep it steady), whereby it is prevented from being driven with
                    advantage beyond a certain limited speed. To remedy this, Mr Danforth introduced
                    into his throstle a stationary spindle, on the top of which he fixed an inverted
                    conical cup. In this improved throstle the bobbin revolves on the spindle with
                    great rapidity, and by a transverse motion is raised and lowered so as to be,
                    when at the highest point, entirely within the cup, and when at the lowest
                    entirely below it. The edge of the cup passing thus along the whole length of
                    the bobbin, builds the yarn equally on every part while it is receiving the
                    necessary twist.</p>
                <p>To secure to himself the benefit of this invention, Mr Danforth took out patents
                    in all the different European states. His improvement gives a great increase of
                    quantity, but is accompanied by such an addition of waste as to form, in the
                    opinion of many spinners, an insuperable objection to its use. Mr Robert
                    Montgomery of Loch-winnoch, Renfrewshire, has, however (1832), made additions to
                    this machine, which he expects will make it produce even a larger quantity and
                    better quality of yarn than Mr Danforth’s, without waste.</p>
                <p>Mr Samuel Crompton of Bolton in 1775 completed his invention of the “mule jenny,”
                    in contriving which he had been engaged for several years. But this machine did
                    not come into general use, nor was its value known, until after the expiration
                    of Arkwright’s patent; because till then, the spinner was confined to the rove
                    prepared for common jenny spinning, which was unsuitable to the mule jenny.</p>
                <p>After the spinner was allowed to make use of Mr Arkwright’s fine process of
                    preparation, by his patent being cancelled, the power of this machine became
                    known; and its introduction forms another important era in the history of the
                    cotton manufacture. Being fitted to supply those “grists” and qualities of yarn
                    which the other machines could not produce, the manufacturer was enabled to
                    enter upon fabrics which otherwise it would have been vain to attempt. Warqs of
                    the finest quality are spun upon the mule; while, on the spinning frame, yam of
                    a finer <hi rend="italic">grist</hi> than No. 50 cannot be spun to advantage.
                    The reason is, that the fine thread has not strength to stand the pull of the
                    rollers when winding itself on the bobbin of the spinning frame; a stress which
                    is saved to it in the mule, where the draught takes place only in a slight
                    degree faster than the rove is given out by the rollers. All wefts, from the
                    lowest to the highest numbers, are now spun upon Crompton’s machine, the use of
                    Hargreaves’ jenny having been entirely superseded by it. It was some time,
                    indeed, after the mule came into use, before it was ascertained that the finest
                    yarn required for the manufacture could be produced from it. But in the year
                    1792, Mr Jonathan Pollard of Manchester succeeded in spinning yarn upon the
                    mule, of the fineness of 278 hanks to the pound, from cotton wool grown by Mr
                    Robley, in the island of Tobago. This yarn was sold at twenty guineas per pound
                    to the muslin manufacturers of Glasgow.</p>
                <p>The mule, in its structure and operation, is a compound of the spinning frame and
                    of Hargreaves’ jenny, from which circumstance it has probably received its name.
                    It contains a system of rollers like that belonging to the twist framo; but in
                    place of having every four or six of them in separate heads, as is the case in
                    that machine, the whole arc coupled together; and the rove being drawn through
                    them, is, in its conversion into thread, received on spindles revolving like
                    those of the jenny. The carriage on which these spindles are placed is moveable,
                    and is made to recede from the rollers a degree faster than the thread is given
                    out. After a certain quantity of the roving has been thus delivered by the
                    rollers, they are stopped; but the carriage continues to recede somewhat
                    farther; and the spindles continuing also to revolve, the thread is drawn out to
                    the fineness required, and then receives its proper portion of twist. This last
                    operation resembles that performed by the common jenny, and produces a similar
                    effect. (See Plate CLXXVIII. fig. 12.)</p>
                <p>Mr Crompton took out no patent; but many; ’ ears after he had given this
                    important invention to his country, he received from parliament a grant of
                    L.5000.</p>
                <p>The mule was originally worked by the spinner’s hand; but in 1792, Mr William
                    Kelly of Glasgow, at that time manager of the Lanark Mills, obtained a patent
                    for moving it by machinery. Mr Kelly soon saw, however, that in the extended
                    state of the cotton trade, the exclusive possession of this important
                    improvement was not likely to be quietly acquiesced in; and, unwilling to
                    involve himself in the litigation which would have been necessary to defend his
                    privilege, although the undisputed inventor of the process, he allowed every one
                    freely to avail himself of its advantages.</p>
                <p>Mr Kelly’s machinery was contrived so as to move every part of the mule, even to
                    the returning of the carriage into its place, after the draught was finished.
                    Had his invention come into full operation, the employment of men as <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194752511" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2511-0403"/> spinners would
                    have been thereby rendered unnecessary, and children would have been able to do
                    all the duty required. But, after a short trial, it was discovered that a
                    greater amount of produce could be obtained, and at a cheaper rate, by using the
                    machinery merely to draw out the carriage, and employing the men to return it as
                    formerly. In this way one spinner could serve two mules, the one carriage moving
                    out during the time that he was engaged in returning the other.</p>
                <p>Proceeding in this train of discovery, it was next found unnecessary to confine
                    the mule to a hundred and forty-four spindles, the largest number which it had
                    till then contained; for with the assistance of the above mechanical
                    improvement, the spinner was able to manage two mules of three or four hundred
                    spindles each, and thus to spin on six hundred or eight hundred, instead of on
                    only a hundred and forty-four spindles.</p>
                <p>The process of mule spinning continued to be conducted upon this plan, till
                    several proprietors of large cotton works restored the part of Mr Kelly’s
                    machinery which returns the carriage into its place after the draught is
                    completed. By thus lessening the fatigue to the spinncr, they were enabled to
                    employ women in place of men. All that is to be done by the spinner in this case
                    is, with a slight touch of the hand to shift the band, so as to allow the
                    carriage to be moved back into its resting position, and, as this takes place,
                    to manage the guide for building the cop, and regulate and temper the motion of
                    the carriage as it recedes.</p>
                <p>An extension of the size of the mule employed in spinning very fine numbers was
                    accidentally suggested to a spinner of Manchester in 1830, and enabled him to
                    reduce the wages paid for spinning these numbers sixpence a pound. Being
                    desirous to fill a garret-room of his mill with jennies of five hundred spindles
                    each, of the size of those worked in the rooms below, he found, from the
                    contraction of the space, occasioned by the inclination of the roof, that there
                    was not room for a mule of five hundred spindles to stand across the floor. It
                    then occurred to him, that as in spinning those high numbers of yarn, the
                    movement of the carriage in drawing out so slender a thread was of necessity
                    very slow, it might be practicable to work a thousand spindles in one mule,
                    without increasing the breakage of threads; and that should this be the case, he
                    would then be able to fill his garret by placing these jennies lengthwise. The
                    experiment was tried, and the mule of a thousand spindles found to work so well
                    as to admit of the above reduction of the wages of the spinner.</p>
                <p>There is at present (1832) in a course of trial in different spinning works, a
                    mule, the carriage of which, after having drawn out the thread, is returned by
                    mechanical means, without the aid of the spinner, or the guidance of his hand to
                    secure the uniform building of the cops. The apparatus for accomplishing this
                    can be affixed to the mules now in use without any other alteration. Messrs
                    Sharpe and Robarts took a patent in 1829 for this invention; but the right to
                    the discovery having been disputed, its general adoption was retarded till about
                    six months ago, ŵhen a verdict in their favour was obtained. The machinery for
                    effecting the object being rather complicated, fears have been entertained that
                    it may be liable to get out of order, and cause frequent stoppages of the work,
                    besides occasioning a considerable expense in keeping the machine in repair. The
                    most judicious spinners, however, consider the discovery to be founded upon
                    correct principles; and when such is the case, we may count upon mechanical
                    science being able sooner or later to simplify the movement, and ad-mitofthe
                    improvement being brought into general use. Several mill proprietors in
                    Lancashire are in the course of altering their mules to spin in this manner; and
                    if the plan succeeds they will be able to dispense with the mule spinners,
                    retaining merely the pice’ers (children) to take up and join the broken
                    ends.</p>
                <p>In addition to the process of preparation already described as employed in frame
                    and coarse mule spinning, the cotton intended for fine mule spinning goes
                    through a further operation. It was found that extending the roves at once to a
                    fine thread, was a reduction of texture too rapid to admit of the production of
                    a good article, and that an intermediate operation was necessary. This gave rise
                    to the process of stretching, which is performed on a mule fitted up for the
                    purpose, which draws the rove another degree finer, without communicating to it
                    such an additional twist as might prevent its being extended afterwards into a
                    thread upon the spinning mule.</p>
                <p>We have now finished our account of the different machines employed in cotton
                    spinning, and have endeavoured to describe the succession of improvements which
                    have been made on them up to this time, so as to give some idea of the progress
                    in their power of production. But it will not be possible, from the nature of
                    the subject, to exhibit in a similar manner the not less important advances made
                    from time to time in the construction of the minute parts of these machines, and
                    in the skill and management of the spinner who works them. By these means a
                    progressive acceleration of their movement was rendered practicable, and even
                    after the machine had long been apparently in a very perfect state, the quantity
                    of produce was more than doubled.</p>
                <p>About the year 1790 the average product of the spinner of yarn No. 40 was little
                    more than a hank per spindle per day; but by the year 1812, as appears by Mr
                    Kennedy’s table of the comparative cost of the cotton yarn of India and of this
                    country, it had advanced to two hanks per day, and in 1830 to 2∙75. The effect
                    of this increase of production upon the cost of the article was very great, as
                    will be seen by the following statement of the reduction of the wages of
                    spinning, and of the fall in the sale price of yarn which rapidly succeeded.</p>
                <p>We have already noticed that, until the cancelling of Sir Richard Arkwright’s
                    patent, by which the mule spinner became at liberty to use his improved mode of
                    preparation, the few fine wefts required were spun· on Hargreaves’jenny. In the
                    year 1786 this yarn was sold in Glasgow and Paisley at 31s. per pound for No.
                    90, 7s. per pound being the price of spinning it. The warp was spun upon the
                    twist frame, and was sold at the same time at 47s. 6d. the pound for No. 90.</p>
                <p>We are informed by Mr Crompton, that immediately upon his completing his
                    invention of the mule, in the year 1775, he obtained 14s. per pound for the
                    spinning and preparation of No. 40; that a short time after he got 25s. per
                    pound for the spinning and preparation of No. 60; and that he then span a small
                    quantity of No. 80 to show that it was not impossible to spin yarn of so fine a
                    grist, and for the spinning and preparation of this he got 42s. per pound-For
                    some little time after the mule came into general use, in the year 1786, it was
                    the practice in many places for the spinner to purchase the wool in a prepared
                    state; and separate concerns for preparing cotton were established and carried
                    on. At this time 10s. per pound were paid for spinning No. 100; but soon
                    afterwards the wages for this number were reduced, first to 8s. and then to 6s.
                    8d. In 1790 the price of spinning No. 100 was 4s. per pound. In 1792 it was
                    brought to 3á. ld., and in 1793 to 2s. 6d., at which price it continued till
                    1795; when the mule coming to be worked by machinery, and an increase being made
                    in the number of spindles, the spinner was enabled so to extend the quantity of
                    his produce, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752524" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2524-0404"
                    />as to admit of another considerable reduction in wages. The price of spinning
                    No. 100 was in the course of a few years brought down to 8d. per pound, at which
                    price it continued until 1826, when it was further reduced to 6įd. per pound.
                    Notwithstanding this extraordinary diminution of the price of spinning, such
                    have been the effects of the improvements in the plan and construction of the
                    machinery, in the selection and preparation of the wool, and in the spinner’s
                    skill and tact in the execution of his work, that he is able to earn more money
                    now than he did when the wages were at the highest.</p>

                <p>But the benefit of the improvements we have noticed has not been confined to the
                    reduction of the cost of the yarn. Its quality has been rendered so much
                    superior, that the weaver is enabled, with the same hours of labour, to produce
                    a fourth more cloth than he was able to do forty years ago. ∙</p>
                <p>During the time that the machines for the different processes of cotton spinning
                    were advancing towards perfection, Mr Watt had been employed in maturing and
                    reducing to practice his conceptions for extending the powers of the
                    steam-engine. His inventions for rendering these available to the movements of
                    manufacturing machinery exhibit a beauty of contrivance peculiarly
                    characteristic of his genius, and, more than any of the other discoveries which
                    mark this period, have influenced the circumstances of this country and of
                    mankind.</p>
                <p>If we had no other means of giving motion to our machinery than by placing it on
                    a stream of water, or employing the power of horses, how comparatively expensive
                    must our operations have been, and how limited their progress! By means of Mr
                    Watt’s inventions we are enabled to carry the power at once to the situation
                    where it can be most advantageously used; we can place it in the centre of a
                    population trained to manufacturing habits, and thus bring together the
                    different branches of manufacture, with their numerous subsidiary
                    establishments, all dependent upon or intimately connected with each other,
                    thereby giving facility and effect to their mutual operations.</p>
                <p>Some account of the introduction of the steam-engine, therefore, naturally forms
                    a part of the history of the cotton manufacture. In perusing the following
                    detail, obtained from Mr Watt in 1818, the reader, aware of the present
                    extensive employment of this powerful auxiliary to industry, will be surprised
                    at the slowness with which it came into general use.</p>
                <p>Mr Watt had early turned his thoughts to the application of the steam-engine to
                    rotative motion, and in the year 1781 had devised the means for accomplishing
                    this end. But at the moment he was taking measures for legally securing to
                    himself the exclusive advantages of his invention, a confidential workman
                    betrayed a part of his plan to other persons, who took a patent for it. In the
                    following year, having substituted a most ingenious contrivance to supply the
                    part of the process which had been stolen from him, he obtained for Messrs
                    Bolton and Watt a patent for his mode of applying this power. Their first <hi
                    rend="italic">rotative</hi> engine (for we are obliged to use that term to avoid
                    circumlocution) was erected in the year 1782, at Bradley iron-works, and they
                    erected another in the same year at <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752537"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2537-0405"/>their own manufactory. In 1783 they erected an
                    engine for winding ores out of a mine in Cornwall. In 1784 they erected seven
                    engines, one for an oil mill at Hull, one at Messrs Goodwin and Company’s
                    brewery in London, one at Mr Whitbread’s, with four others, including the first
                    engine for that splendid establishment, the London Albion Mills. Among those
                    erected by them in 1775 was one for Messrs Robinsons, at Papplewick, in
                    Nottinghamshire, for spinning cotton, the first instance of the application of
                    steam to this manufacture. In the following year they erected a number of their
                    engines for various purposes; and in 1787 one for Messrs Peels, at Warrington,
                    for cotton spinning, and three others for the same purpose at Nottingham. No
                    rotative engine had yet been erected at Manchester; and it was seven years after
                    Bolton and Watt had received their patent that they constructed for Mr
                    Drinkwater the first engine used there for spinning cotton. In 1790 they erected
                    one for spinning cotton at Nottingham for Sir Richard Arkwright, and another at
                    Darlington for spinning flax; a cotton spinning engine at Manchester for Mr
                    Simpson, and a second at Papperwicke for Messrs Robinsons. Some time before this
                    Sir Richard Arkwright and others, from an ill-judged economy in the first cost,
                    had introduced into their spinning factory atmospherical or Newcomen’s engines,
                    with rotative motions applied to them. But quickly perceiving their error, they
                    abandoned them, and Bolton and Watt’s engines soon came to be universally used
                    among cotton spinners, and all other manufacturers.</p>
                <p>' In an account of the means which contributed to that fall in the price of
                    spinning which we have mentioned, we must not omit the progressive improvement
                    in the cultivation of the raw material, and in the application of its different
                    qualities to their most profitable uses. Previous to the year 1793, the cotton
                    used in the coarser articles of the manufacture, with the exception of a small
                    quantity imported from India and from the Levant for the fustian trade, was
                    wholly the growth of our own and of the French West India Islands. That for the
                    better kind of goods was raised in Demerara, Surinam, and Berbice. The wool for
                    fine goods was grown in the Brazils, and that for the few very fine muslins then
                    manufactured, in the Isle of Bourbon.</p>
                <p>In 1787 the descriptions of cotton imported into Britain appear to have been as

                <p>Had we continued to derive our sole supply of cotton from these countries, the
                    progress of the manufacture would have been greatly retarded, not only from the
                    difficulty of making the production of the raw material keep pace with the
                    increasing consumption, but from the impossibility of obtaining the qualities of
                    wool suited to the finer descriptions of goods, which the improved machinery
                    enabled us to undertake.</p>
                <p>But fortunately, about the year 1790,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The year 1 <hi rend="italic">790</hi> has always been stated
                    as the period at which the planters of the southern states began to turn their
                    attention to the raising of cotton wool. But we happen to know that in 1/84, the
                    late William Rathbone, an extensive American merchant in Liverpool, received
                    from one of his correspondents in the southern states a consignment of eight
                    bags of cotton· This cotton, on its arrival at Liverpool, was seized by the
                    custom-house officers, on the allegation tnat it could not have been grown in
                    the United States, and that it was liable to seizure under the shipping act, as
                    not being imported in a vessel belonging to the country of its growth. When
                    afterwards released, it lay for many months unsold, in consequence of the
                    spinners doubting whether it could be profitably worked up.</p></note> the
                    planters in the southern states of the American Union began to turn their
                    attention to raising cotton wool; and, besides carrying the cultivation of the
                    article to a great extent, they produced qualities of cotton before unknown. In
                    1792 the quantity of cotton exported from the United States was only 138,328
                    lbs., no manufacture of cotton goods having been attempted in America for many
                    years after that period. Their crop for the present year (1832) will exceed
                    275,000,000 lbs., of which 63,450,000 lbs. is expected to be used in their own
                    manufacture, leaving 211,550,000 lbs. for exportation. In 1831 they exported
                    619,000 bales to Great Britain, 127,000 to France, and 27,000 to other
                    parts.</p>
                <p>The American cotton wool first brought to this country was very ill cleaned, and
                    in consequence was indiscriminately applied to the manufacture of the coarser
                    species of goods. It was soon, however, perceived that the cotton raised upon
                    the coast, termed <hi rend="italic">sea island cotton,</hi> had a finer and
                    longer staple than that grown farther back in the country, and known by the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">upland</hi> cotton. But it was not for several years, and
                    after a succession of trials, that this wool was ascertained to be of a quality
                    in every respect superior to the cotton of the Isle of Bourbon. Indeed, it was
                    only in the year 1796 that the finest description of it was applied to the
                    purposes for which Bourbon wool had till then been used, and which it soon
                    entirely supplanted. The second quality of it about the same time supplanted the
                    Brazil wool in many kinds of goods.</p>
                <p>The upland cotton is a different species from the sea island, and is separated
                    with such difficulty from the seed, that the expense of cleaning the wool must
                    have put a stop to its further cultivation, had not a machine, by which the
                    operation of cleaning is easily and successfully accomplished, been invented in
                    1795 by Mr Eli λVhitney of Massachusetts. There are two qualities of this
                    cotton, the one termed Upland Georgia, grown in the states of Georgia and South
                    Carolina, and the other, of superior quality, raised upon the banks of the
                    Mississippi, and distinguished in the market by the name of New Orleans cotton.
                    A strong prejudice existed for some time against the upland wool, which was
                    thought to be of inferior quality, and not to receive a good colour in dyeing;
                    but being found suitable to different coarse fabrics, its cultivation was so
                    rapidly extended, that, in 1807, 55,018,448 lbs. of upland cotton were exported
                    from the United States.</p>
                <p>The cotton of the finest quality ever brought to the English market, or probably
                    ever grown, was that formerly mentioned as having been raised in the island of
                    Tobago between the years 1789 and 1792, upon the estate of Mr Robley. That
                    gentleman carried the cultivation of this article to some extent; but the price
                    of cotton falling very low, and the cultivation of sugar becoming extremely
                    profitable, in consequence of the destruction of the sugar plantations in the
                    French islands, he was induced to convert his cotton grounds into a sugar
                    plantation. The production of cotton of this very fine description was never
                    attempted by any other person, although it is believed that the price it would
                    yield would amply repay its expense.</p>
                <p>Until about the year 1815, it was thought that the cotton wool of India, from the
                    shortness of its staple, could not be spun with advantage upon our machinery;
                    and in <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752550" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2550-0406"
                    />consequence, the greater part of .the Indian cotton brought to this country
                    was spun upon the common jenny, and used as weft for the coarsest calicoes. It
                    was discovered, however, that by mixing it with the longer stapled wools of
                    other countries, it might be brought into a state fit for the mule and spinning
                    frames.</p>
                <p>It was expected that the opening of the trade in 1814 would have led to more care
                    in the cultivation of the article, and would have given rise to the production
                    of cotton of superior quality to any that had previously been obtained from
                    India. This, however, did not take place. It appears, from the evidence before
                    the parliamentary committees in 1830-31, that up to that period there had been
                    no improvement in the quality of the cotton raised in India; that the dependent
                    state of the cultivator, and the constant fiscal interference to which he was
                    subjected, are insurmountable obstacles to the attainment of this object; and
                    that until European skill and capital come to be employed in the cultivation of
                    the cotton, better qualities are not to be looked for. The influence of the
                    impolitic regulations imposed under the Company’s monopoly to secure the revenue
                    are particularly felt in the presidency of Bombay. Up to a late period, this was
                    the only part of India in whieh any considerable quantity of cotton was grown or
                    exported. In the district of Guzzerat alone 100,000 heavy bales are annually
                    produced.</p>
                <p>The part of the crop which goes to the Company for the rent of the land is
                    delivered by the cultivator to the Company’s collector, immediately after the
                    cotton has been picked, but before it has been separated from the seed. This
                    person fixes annually the rent which the cultivator is to pay, the amount of
                    which is always imposed in a specified sum of money, but payable in cotton,
                    rated at a price named by the collector. Its amount upon an average of years is
                    about one half of the crop. In the payment of this rent, the collector refuses
                    to receive any but the best and cleanest part of the cotton, and to this the
                    farmers dare not object. What remains is purchased principally by the Company’s
                    commercial resident, who formerly fixed the price he was to pay for it; but in
                    the bargains now made by the officer, he gives the average price received by the
                    cultivators in the surrounding districts.</p>
                <p>If the culture of cotton in Guzzerat has been able to exist under this oppressive
                    system, what might not be expected were the rent of the lands, as is now the
                    case in the presidency of Bengal, fixed and paid in money, and were the growers
                    at liberty to sell the product to those who would give the best price for it!
                    The rapid increase of cultivation in Bengal since the introduction of this more
                    enlightened system of management, and the acquisition and diffusion of wealth
                    which have been the consequences, present a striking contrast to the
                    impoverished and wretched state of the cultivators in Bombay, and speak a
                    language in political science not to be misunderstood.</p>
                <p>Since 1814 attempts have been made to introduce the Bourbon seed into Guzzerat.
                    These attempts have failed, but it would be wrong to be discouraged by the ill
                    success of an undertaking carried on under the management which usually belongs
                    to monopoly. A very different result may be looked for when that system and its
                    effects shall have been more completely done away, and improvements come to be
                    conducted by those who are to reap the benefit of them. Were this better system
                    once established throughout the peninsula, it appears not unreasonable to
                    expect, in a country so extensive, and of such various soils, not only that all
                    the qualities of cotton wool known to our manufacturers would be produced, but
                    that new varieties might be obtained, possibly of more useful application than
                    any we yet possess.</p>
                <p>Egyptian cotton was introduced into this country for; the first time in 1823.
                    Among many schemes forcalĭingt into action the capabilities of Egypt, all of
                    which were) selected with admirable sagacity, Mahmoud Pacha, the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> present ruler of that country, thought of cotton wool
                    as a product suited to the soil and climate, and the culture of which, from the
                    great and growing demand, was likely to prove a profitable speculation. His
                    measures for prosecuting this object were carried into execution with the energy
                    which has characterized all his proceedings, and were upon a scale to enable
                    him, so early as 1823, to export 5623 bales to England.</p>
                <p>We have not been able to obtain a statement of the general export of cotton from
                    Egypt for 1823 and 1824; but the following table shows the amount exported

                <p>The wool exported is all long-staple wool, but of two sorts, one called in Egypt
                    makko, and in England common Egyptian; the other the produce of sea island seed,
                    called in Egypt Sennaar, and in England sea island Egyptian. Besides these two
                    descriptions of cotton, Egypt raises from 15,000 to 20,000 bales of short-staple
                    cotton, similar in quality to that of Smyrna, and chiefly consumed in the
                    country itself.</p>
                <p>The cotton received from Egypt is found to be among the most useful that is
                    grown, and that raised from sea island seed ranks in quality next to American
                    sea island.</p>
                <p>Having succeeded in the production of cotton, the pacha thought he might advance
                    another step, and have it spun into yarn and woven into cloth. He accordingly
                    formed establishments for spinning and weaving in Cairo, Bosacco, Rosetta, and
                    other places; and so early as 1826 lie had sixty-one mills at work, moved by the
                    power of buffaloes. The machinery was supplied from France and England, orders
                    in council having been obtained in the latter country to authorize its export.
                    Power-looms were also sent out, but did not succeed.</p>
                <p>Last year the pacha shipped a thousand bales of yarn to Calcutta for sale; but it
                    was not of a quality to enter into competition with the English yarn, and it was
                    found to be unsaleable, except at a most disadvantageous price. He ordered it
                    therefore to be woven into cloth in Calcutta on his own account, and to be
                    re-shipped to Egypt in a manufactured state.</p>
                <p>Clapperton and Landers, on their expeditions to trace the course of the Niger,
                    found the inhabitants everywhere clothed in cotton. They mention that cotton
                    wool is produced in the different districts in the interior, and is spun into
                    cloth on the spot. There exists, therefore, in the heart of Africa an extensive
                    manufacture of cotton cloth. lt is to be regretted that they give no information
                    of the way in which the yarn is spun, and no description of the loom employed
                    toweave it. It would be interesting to know the nature of the instruments used
                    by the natives in these processes, as such knowledge might enable us to trace
                    whence the Africans derive their acquaintance with the art of weaving, and thus
                    perhaps throw some light on African history.</p>

                <p>It appears that the people of Eboe, and of the countries near the coast, are
                    chiefly clothed in Manchester cotton goods; a circumstance which would lead us
                    to expect, should we succeed in obtaining a commercial intercourse with the
                    interior of Africa, that a valuable market for our manufactures may be found in
                    that‘country.</p>
                <p>We have just learned that the American settlers of Liberia have been able to
                    establish a communication across the country to Timbuctoo, and have found there
                    a considerable market for cotton cloths.</p>
                <p>We shall now resume our account of the progress of the manufacture in Great
                    Britain.</p>
                <p>From Sir Richard Arkwright having commenced his operations at Nottingham, the
                    seat of the stocking manufacture, and from his connection with Mr Need, who was
                    largely engaged in it, the whole produce of his spinning was at first devoted to
                    that trade. The cotton yarn for this manufacture requires to be particularly
                    smooth and equal; and to secure these qualities, it is spun by a process
                    differing a little from that employed for ordinary twist; being from two roves
                    in place of one, it is called double spun twist. The introduction of this
                    article produced a great change upon the stocking manufacture. Hand-spun cotton
                    was entirely laid aside; and stockings made of twist were of so superior a
                    quality, that in a short time they wholly supplanted thread stockings.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of cotton stockings in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and
                    Leicestershire, is now of great extent.</p>
                <p>About the year 1773, Mr Need and Mr Strutt made the important discovery, that the
                    yarn produced by the spinning frame had sufficient strength to fit it for warp,
                    although its firmness and hardness rendered it less suitable for weft. The weft,
                    therefore, continued to be spun by Hargreaves’ jenny; and from this time the
                    calicoes, and other articles in imitation of India goods, which had hitherto
                    been manufactured with linen warp, came to be made wholly of cotton; and the
                    progressive increase of these manufactures, particularly of calicoes, after this
                    time, was unexampled.</p>
                <p>After having made a considerable quantity of those goods, Mr Need and Mr Strutt
                    discovered, that, when printed, they were subject to double the duty charged
                    upon calicoes woven with linen warp, and that their sale was even prohibited in
                    the home market. After a long and expensive application to the legislature, they
                    succeeded in procuring the repeal of those impolitic laws. Nearly about the same
                    period, calicoes entirely of cotton were begun to be made at Blackburn; which
                    place soon became the seat of their manufacture, and for a long time the great
                    market to which the printers from all parts of the kingdom resorted for their
                    supplies. This branch <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> went on increasing for many
                    years in a most extraordinary degree. About the year 1805, it was calculated
                    that the number of pieces sold annually in the Blackburn market was not less
                    than a million; and by that time the manufacture of this article was not
                    confined to the country round Blackburn, but had spread into the north-west
                    district of Yorkshire, principally about Colne and Bradford, from which part of
                    the country 20,000 pieces weekly are said to have been sent to Manchester.</p>
                <p>Į The first attempts to make muslins in this country com menced simultaneously in
                    Lancashire and at Glasgow about the year 1780, but without success. There was no
                    yam fitted for the weft of these goods, except that spun upon Hargreaves’jenny;
                    and when made of this, it was found they were not of a marketable quality.
                    Recourse was then had to wefts brought from India; and although a better article
                    than the former was by this means produced, it was still not of a quality to
                    compete successful ly with Indian muslin. As soon, however, as the invention of
                    the mule jenny enabled the spinner to produce yarns suited to such fabrics, the
                    manufacture of the finest cotton articles became an important branch of trade in
                    this country. That machine, as has been mentioned, came into use at the end of
                    the year 1785, upon Sir Richard Arkwright’s patent being cancelled; and it is
                    from that period we ought to date the commencement of this part of the
                    manufacture. So rapid was its progress, that in 1787 it was computed that
                    500,000 pieces of muslin were in that year manufactured in Great Britain.</p>
                <p>Muslin began to be made nearly at the same time at Bolton, at Glasgow, and at
                    Paisley, each place adopting' the peculiar description of fabric which resembled
                    most those goods it had been accustomed to manufacture; and in consequence of
                    this judicious distribution at first, each place has continued to maintain a
                    superiority in the production of its own article.</p>
                <p>Jaconets both coarse and fine, but of a stout fabric, checked and striped
                    muslins, and other articles of the heavier description of this branch, arc
                    manufactured in Bolton, and in its neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>Book, mull, and lino muslins, and jaconets of a lighter fabric than those made in
                    Lancashire, are manufactured in Glasgow. Sewed and tamboured muslins are almost
                    exclusively made there and in Paisley. A machine of most ingenious contrivance
                    for performing the operation of tambouring was in the year 1807 invented by Mr
                    John Duncan of Glasgow, and a patent taken out for the discovery. Each machine
                    contains about forty tambouring needles, and is superintended by a girl, who
                    pieces the thread when it breaks. This beautiful, and, at first, promising piece
                    of mechanism has never come into general use. At present there arc only three or
                    four machines kept at work by the Messrs Mitchells of Glasgow, who at an early
                    period became proprietors of the patent.</p>
                <p>What are called fancy goods, woven in the loom, were first made at Paisley, which
                    had been the chief seat of the silk gauze manufacture of this country. In the
                    silk trade, which was then beginning to fall into decay, a body of most
                    ingenious workmen had been bred. By employing them, the taste and invention
                    which had produced the varieties displayed in that beautiful article were
                    immediately transferred to the production of similar fabrics of muslin. From
                    this circumstance Paisley for a long time retained the exclusive possession of
                    this branch; but being only seven miles distant from Glasgow, the general seat
                    of the cotton manufacture of Scotland, and the mart to which most purchasers of
                    muslin resort, many of its principal manufacturers have been induced to move
                    their establishments to that city, although the weaving of these muslins
                    continues to be executed in Paisley and its neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>There is a curious circumstance to be noticed with regard to the manufacture of
                    the very fine fabrics of muslin in Scotland, that a great part of the yarn used
                    for them is brought from Manchester, in consequence of the Scotch spinners not
                    having yet been able to produce the very fine numbers of yarn of the best
                    quality. This inferiority does not proceed from a less perfect construction of
                    the machinery employed in Scotland, the mechanics and the machine makers of
                    Glasgow being admitted to be excellent workmen; neither does it arise from the
                    want of skill in those who conduct the business, or from any difference in the
                    processes employed in the two countries; but it is to be attributed to the same
                    cause which produces the superior yarn of India, namely, an adroitness and
                    mechanical sleight of hand in the operative spinners of Manchester, acquired by
                    a few out of the great multitude bred there.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of the thicker cotton fabrics was at the same time rapidly rising
                    in importance. The manufacture<pb break="no" facs="nls:194752576"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2576-0408"/> of dimities has been exclusively confined to the
                    north of England, all attempts to make them in Scotland having proved
                    unsuccessful. The finer qualities of this article arc made at Warrington, the
                    coarser in the western parts of Yorkshire.</p>
                <p>Balason handkerchiefs were first manufactured about Preston and Chorley, where
                    they still continue to be made. The manufacture of ginghams was for a long time
                    confined to Lancashire, but for many years it has been extensively introduced at
                    Glasgow, although Lancashire continues to be the chief seat of this branch.</p>
                <p>Pullicat handkerchiefs were first made about the year 1785 at Glasgow, where the
                    manufacture of them has been carried to a great extent. They were not made in
                    Lancashire till some time afterwards, and the manufacture of them there has
                    never been to the same amount; Glasgow, therefore, continues to be the principal
                    mart for this article.</p>
                <p>Blue and white checks and stripes for exportation were at first of a linen
                    fabric, but were afterwards woven with linen warp and cotton weft; and when Sir
                    Richard’Arkwright’s discovery enabled the spinner to produce cotton yarn of
                    sufficient strength to be used for warps, a 'great proportion of these goods
                    came to be made wholly of cotton. This manufacture is carried on in Lancashire
                    and in the county of Fife, and to a small extent at Aberdeen; its chief seat,
                    however, is Carlisle.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of cotton cambric was begun about the same period, and was
                    separated into two branches; into cambric to be used as garments in a white or
                    printed state; and into cambric made in imitation of French linen cambric, to be
                    used for the same purposes as that article. The first is made nearly altogether
                    in Lancashire, where the manufacture of it is carried on to great extent; and
                    the second, of much less amount, wholly at Glasgow. The Scotch manufacturers
                    have never been able to rival the Lancashire in the first, nor the Lancashire
                    manufacturers to rival the Scotch in the last.</p>
                <p>Bandaria handkerchiefs, and Bandana cloths for garments, were first made by Mr
                    Henry Monteith, at Glas- 'gow, about the year 1802, and are now manufactured
                    there to a considerable amount. The cloth is dyed a bright Turkey red, and the
                    colour is discharged from those parts which form the pattern or figure, by
                    passing a chemical mixture through them. Glasgow still continues to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> be the chief seat of this manufacture, where there
                    are several large works for carrying it on. The demand for Bandanas, however,
                    has latterly fallen off, while, in consequence of the repeal of the impolitic
                    duty on printed cloths, the consumption of these has greatly increased, and most
                    of the proprietors of the Turkey red dyeing establishments have therefore been
                    induced to add calico-printing to their former business.</p>
                <p>From the circumstance of Glasgow being the seat of a fine manufacture, it was
                    found difficult, as long as hand weaving continued, to introduce there the
                    weaving of calicoes; the article was made to a limited amount at Perth, but the
                    Scotch calico-printers were obliged to look, for the principal part of their
                    supply of cloth to Lancashire. So long as this was the case, it is evident that
                    the Scotch were not on an equal footing with the English printers; and as a
                    great deal of capital had been embarked in the trade by the former, a
                    considerable anxiety was felt' by them that this defect in their situation
                    should be remedied. The object was at length attained by the introduction into
                    Scotland, in 1801, of the art of weaving by the power of water or of steam, the
                    machinery and subsidiary processes for which had about that time been so
                    improved, that cloth woven in this way was found to come as cheap, if not
                    cheaper, than if produced by manual labour.</p>
                <p>Weaving by power had been attempted fifteen years before its introduction into
                    Scotland, by the Rev. E. Cartwright of Hollander House, Kent, who invented a
                    loom to be worked by mechanical means. The circumstances of this discovery,
                    which have been obligingly communicated to us in a letter from Mr Cartwright,
                    are curious, and, in the history of inventions, we think interesting. Mr C.
                    says, ‘ 1 ” *M.</p>
                <p>“Happening to be at Matlock in the summer of 1784, I fell in company with some
                    gentlemen of Manchester, when the conversation turned on Arkwright’s spinning
                    machinery. One of the company observed, that as soon as Arkwright’s patent
                    expired, so many mills would be erected, and so much cotton spun, that hands
                    never could be found to weave it. To this observation I replied, that Arkwright
                    must then set his wits to work and invent a weaving mill. This brought on a
                    conversation on the sub· ject, in which the Manchester gentlemen unanimously
                    agreed that the thing was impracticable; and, in defence of their opinion, they
                    adduced arguments which I certainly was incompetent to answer, or even to
                    comprehend, being totally ignorant of the subject, having never at that time
                    seen a person weave. I controverted, however, the impracticability of the thing,
                    by remarking, that there had lately been exhibited in London an automaton figure
                    which played at chess. Now, you will not assert, gentlemen, said I, that it is
                    more difficult to construct a machine that shall weave than one which shall make
                    all the variety of moves which are required in that difficult game.</p>
                <p>“Some little time afterwards, a particular circumstance recalling this
                    conversation to my mind, it struck me that, as in plain weaving, according to
                    the conception I then had of the business, there could only be three movements,
                    which were to follow each other in succession, there would be little difficulty
                    in producing and repeating them. Full of these ideas, I immediately employed a
                    carpenter and smith to carry them into effect. As soon as the machine was
                    finished, I got a weaver to put in the warp, which was of such materials as
                    sail-cloth is usually made of. To my great delight, a piece of cloth, such as it
                    was, was the produce. As I had never before turned my thoughts to any thing
                    mechanical, either in theory or practice, nor had ever seen a loom at work, or
                    knew any thing of its construction, you will readily suppose that my first loom
                    must have been a most rude piece of machinery. The warp was placed
                    perpendicularly, the reed fell with a force of at least half a hundredweight,
                    and the springs which threw the shuttle were strong enough to have thrown a
                    Congreve rocket. In short, it required the strength of two powerful men to work
                    the machine at a slow rate, and only for a short time. Conceiving in my great
                    simplicity that I had accomplished all that was required, I then secured what I
                    thought a most valuable property by a patent, 4th April 1785. This being done, I
                    then condescended to see how other people wove; and you will guess my
                    astonishment when I compared their easy mode of operation with mine. Availing
                    myself, however, of what I then saw, I made a loom, in its general principles
                    nearly as tfiey are now made; but it was not till the year 1787 that I completed
                    my invention, when I took out my last weaving patent August 1st of that
                    year.”</p>
                <p>But the idea of weaving by machinery was not new. About the close of the
                    preceding century, a drawing and a description of a similar loom (a circumstance
                    unknown to Mr Cartwright) had been presented to the Royal Society of London. The
                    movements, too, in both are the same with those of the inch-loom, a machine
                    which had long been in use.</p>
                <p>Mr Cartwright, after obtaining his second patent, erected a weaving factory at
                    Doncaster, which he filled with looms. This concern was unsuccessful, and
                    wasatlastaban-doned<pb break="no" facs="nls:194752589"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2589-0409"/>. But still the invention was considered so
                    important to the country, that some years after, upon an application from a
                    number of manufacturers at Manchester, parliament granted Mr Cartwright a sum of
                    money as a remuneration for his ingenuity and trouble.</p>
                <p>About the year 1790 Mr Grimshaw of Manchester, under a license from Mr
                    Cartwright, erected a weaving factory, which was to have contained five hundred
                    looms, for weaving coarse sacking cloth. He intended also to attempt the weaving
                    of fustians. But after a small part of the machinery had been set agoing, the
                    work was destroyed by fire; and as the concern during the short trial that had
                    been made did not promise to be successful, the mill was not rebuilt.</p>
                <p>About the year 1794 Mr Bell of Glasgow invented another loom, for which also a
                    patent was taken; and a factory of these looms was erected at Milton, near
                    Dumbarton. But this concern, although carried on for many years, was not more
                    successful than those which had preceded it.</p>
                <p>• In 1801 Mr John Monteith of Glasgow erected a weaving factory in the village of
                    Pollokshaws, containing two hundred looms. This concern also at first promised
                    ill, but is understood to have afterwards succeeded, and the number of looms was
                    increased to three hundred.</p>
                <p>In 1805 a large weaving factory was erected at Catrine, in Ayrshire, by Messrs
                    James Finlay and Company, to be carried on in conjunction with their extensive
                    spinning work at that place; and in 1808 they built another weaving factory at
                    Doune, connected with the spinning works there, the two containing 462 looms.
                    The quantity of cloth produced in these establishments, in proportion to the
                    number of hands employed in them, is understood to have been greater than had
                    been obtained before in other works, and the undertaking is said to have done
                    well from the outset.</p>
                <p>After this period new weaving factories were erected in Glasgow or in its
                    neighbourhood almost every year.</p>
                <p>In 1817 there were in Glasgow or belonging to it fifteen weaving factories,
                    containing 2275 looms. There are now (1832) sixty-three factories, containing
                    14,127 looms.</p>
                <p>Weaving by power, however, could never have succeeded, but for the discovery of a
                    process for dressing the web before it is put into the loom, which happily was
                    effected by Mr Radcliffe of Stockport. The stoppage of the work from time to
                    time for dressing the web made it impossible to do more than attend to one loom;
                    but by the acquisition of this process, one person, generally a girl, can attend
                    to two looms.</p>
                <p>The contrivances for “dressing” are very ingenious, the machinery employed in it
                    deriving its movement from the power which gives motion to the looms. The yarn
                    is first wound from the cop upon bobbins by a winding machine, in which
                    operation it is passed through water, to increase its tenacity. The bobbins are
                    then put upon the warping mill, and the web warped from them upon a beam
                    belonging to the dressing-frame. From the beam now placed in the dressing-frame,
                    the warp is wound upon the weaving-beam; but in its progress to it, passes
                    through a strong dressing of starch. It is then compressed between two rollers,
                    to free it from the moisture it had imbibed with the dressing, and drawn over a
                    succession of tin cylinders heated by steam, to dry it. During the whole of this
                    last part of its progress, it is lightly brushed as it moves along, and fanned
                    by rapidly revolving fanners.</p>
                <p>Mr Peter Marsland of Stockport, who for many years has had a large factory for
                    weaving cotton cloth of a superior quality, is the inventor of an improvement
                    upon the power-loom, by means of the double crank, for which, about the year
                    1807, he obtained a patent. The operation of the crank is to make the lathe give
                    a quick blow to the cloth on coming in contact with it, and by that means render
                    it more stout and even.</p>
                <p>The weaving of calicoes by power did not succeed in Lancashire so early as it did
                    in Scotland. In 1817, the number of power-looms in Lancashire was estimated to
                    be about two thousand, of which only about one thousand were said to be then in
                    employment. The cause of this was, that the price paid at the time we refer to
                    for weaving by the hand, had been forced down to the very lowest degree by the
                    depressed state of trade, and the pressure of an overgrown population bearing
                    upon the means of employment. Wages had fallen below the rate at which the goods
                    could be produced by machinery. This struggle for existence between the two
                    processes terminated, however, as might have been expected. The hand-weavers
                    finding it impossible to go on with the reduced wages, gradually gave way. Their
                    numbers ceased to increase, and the extraordinary addition to the amount of the
                    manufacture since that time has been the product of the power-loom. The goods of
                    a very low quality are still woven by the hand. The yarn of which they are made
                    is spun from waste, or the lowest-priced wools, and has not sufficient strength
                    to bear the fatigue of the power-loom movement; and it is only by the dexterous
                    management and sleight of the weaver’s hand that it can be at all woven into
                    marketable cloth.</p>
                <p>There are now (1832) 80,000 power-looms in Lancashire. The weekly produce of two
                    power-looms, managed by a girl, is from ten to eleven pieces of cloth, four
                    fourths wide and’ twenty-five yards long, woven in an 11 <hi rend="superscript">
                    00</hi> reed; for this she is paid eightpence per piece.</p>
                <p>The following table gives the numbers, the age, and sex of the persons employed
                    in twenty of the weaving mills belonging to Glasgow, with the maximum and
                    minimum amount of the weekly wages earned in 1832 by the different sexes, at the
                    different ages. From Dr Cleland’s <hi rend="italic">Statistics of

                <p>From the change which took place in the dress of this country about fifteen years
                    ago, when printed cotton cloths were almost entirely supplanted by silks and
                    worsted stuffs, it was expected that the manufacture of calico, and in general
                    of cotton goods, would decline. But any diminution of the sale of calicoes for
                    the home printing trade has been amply compensated by the great and growing
                    demand for exportation. These goods are either printed abroad or used in a white
                    state, and the number of yards of calico produced is double what it was at the
                    period when this decline was apprehended.</p>
                <p>There is a branch of the cotton manufacture yet to be noticed, a branch not
                    derived from the East, like muslin, but one that has had its origin in this
                    country,—we mean the bobbinnet, or Nottingham lace manufacture, which now
                    furnishes employment to a large amount of labour and capital.</p>
                <p>That the stocking-frame should have been transferred into a machine for weaving
                    point-lace, a fabric so different in character, was not to have been expected.
                    About the year 1768, however, a frame-work knitter of Nottingham, looking at the
                    lace on his wife’s cap, thought he could fabricate a similar article by means of
                    his stocking-frame. He tried, and was, on the first attempt, to a certain degree
                    successful. In 1782 some advance was made in carrying his invention farther; but
                    the design was not finally matured till 1809, when Mr Heathcote of Teverton
                    succeeded in bringing the machine to a perfect state, and took a patent for the
                    discovery. In 1815 steam power began to be applied to the movement of the
                    machine, but did not come into extensive use until 1820. In 1823, on the expiry
                    of Mr Heathcote’s patent, the manufacture increased with extraordinary rapidity.
                    The demand for the goods became immense; and the Nottingham lace-frame was
                    found, in 'the fabrication of plain nets, to rival the most finished productions
                    of France and the Netherlands. It is proper however to observe, that without the
                    previous possession of the mule jenny, we could not have made the acquisition of
                    the cotton-lace manufacture. Had Mr Crompton not given us the means of obtaining
                    very fine yarn, of the quality required for the delicate texture of Hammond’s
                    altered stocking-frame, the parent of the machine upon which we now weave
                    fabrics of such beauty must have rested with his first rude conception, for want
                    of a material of sufficient fineness.</p>
                <p>The manufacturers of lace by machinery during the time the contest with
                    hand-labour was still undecided, reaped the same high profits which those who
                    first employed the spinning machinery obtained under like circumstances. Indeed,
                    the progress of machinery, and its effect upon production, are nowhere more
                    strikingly exemplified than in the history of the cotton-lace manufacture.</p>
                <p>Mr Heathcote’s frame, on its introduction, at once took the place of the whole
                    body of pillow-lace workers. After his patent expired, and the trade was thrown
                    open, the eagerness to partake of the great profits produced a most active
                    competition, and new and improved machines were brought forward in rapid
                    succession, each in its turn ren&gt; dering less profitable, and by degrees
                    displacing, the one which had preceded it.</p>
                <p>Again, when latterly the supply of the article came to overtake the demand, and
                    prices were greatly reduced, the frames moved by power began to press hard upon
                    those worked by the hand; and the value of the hand» machines, which, when they
                    were first started, was as high as L.1200, sank to L.60. There are now in the
                    course of being introduced into the manufacture, machines possessing such power
                    of production as must supersede the older ones entirely.</p>
                <p>The number of lace frames was in September 1831 4501. Of these, 3501 were
                    hand-machines; and seven hundred of them were held by workmen, who bore the
                    twofold character of manufacturer and weaver, and to whom every fall in the
                    price of the goods resolved itself into a fall of wages, leading to a reduction
                    of the wages . paid in the trade generally.</p>
                <p>These machines work up annually 1,600,000 pounds of sea island cotton, which are
                    spun into 1,000,000 pounds of yarn, of the value of L.500,000, and give
                    employment to fifty-five spinning factories at Manchester, containing 860,000
                    spindles. It is calculated that 208,000 persons receive wages for the labour
                    performed in the different processes of this manufacture; in spinning the yarn
                    at Manchester, weaving the goods in Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, and in
                    the embroidery of them, executed in different parts of the kingdom. The product
                    is estimated at 23,400,000 yards, and the value as it comes from the frame is
                    L.1,891,875. Of this whole production, about four eighths are exported in an
                    unembroidered state to the Continent; about three eighths are sold unembroidered
                    for home consumption; and the remaining eighth is embroidered in this country.
                    The total value of the goods, and of the work performed upon them in this
                    country, has been estimated at L.3,417,700.</p>
                <p>The trade is at present in a state of great depression, occasioned partly by the
                    decrease in the demand, the article, from its cheapness, having become less an
                    object of fashion and desire, and partly by the constantly increasing amount of
                    production, from the improved machinery, pressing on the market, A great
                    extension of its sale, however, is expected, when the markets of the East come
                    to be more completely opened to us.</p>
                <p>Mr Felton of Nottingham, to whose valuable little treatise on this branch of the
                    cotton manufacture we are indebted for the greater part of the facts we have
                    given, says, “We can export a durable and elegant article in cotton bobbin net,
                    at fourpence per square yard, proper for certain useful and ornamental purposes,
                    as curtains, &amp;c.; and another article, used for many purposes in female
                    dress, at sixpence per square yard.”</p>
                <p>Having now given a sketch of the progress of the cotton manufacture of this
                    country, from its first introduction to the present time (1832), we shall
                    endeavour to give some idea of its progressive increase, by tabular exhibitions
                    of the quantity of cotton wool imported into Britain at different periods.</p>
                <p>From the year 1716 to 1720, the average annual importation of cotton was
                    2,173,287 pounds. We have not been able to obtain any account of the cotton
                    imported from that period to the year 1771; but the increase had not been great;
                    for the average annual importation from 1771 to 1775, which commences two years
                    after Hargreaves’ and Arkwright’s discoveries, and comprehends two years of the
                    time after which calicoes began to be made wholly of cotton, was only 4,764,589
                    pounds. The importa-tion<pb break="no" facs="nls:194752615"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2615-0411"/> from 1776 to 1780 was 6,766,613 pounds; from 1781
                    to 1785,10,941,934 pounds; from 1786 to 1790,25,443,270 ∙∏fn Π∏ti1 -' ∙ I ' "

                    26,000,000 pounds; and from 1796 to 1800, 37,364,077 pounds.</p>
                <p>The following table gives the quantity of cotton of different descriptions
                    imported into Great Britain annually from 1802 to 1831 inclusive. The quantity
                    is stated in packages, each package containing three hundred pounds.</p>

                <p>The value of the present annual production of the cotton manufacture of Great
                    Britain is estimated at L.34,000,000 sterling, of which more than a half is the
                    price of goods and yarn made for exportation. The capital invested in buildings
                    and machinery is double what it was twenty years ago, and the quantity of goods
                    annually produced much more than triple; yet, from the improvement of the
                    processes, and consequent diminution of the expense of production, with the
                    reduction which has taken place at the same time in the price of the raw
                    material, this more than tripled quantity of the manufactured article does not
                    represent more capital than was represented by, and required for bringing to
                    market, the lesser amount during the preceding period. In the year 1812, when Mr
                    Crompton applied to parliament for a remuneration for his invention, he found,
                    by as accurate an investigation as he could make, that the number of mule
                    spindles in this country was between four and five millions; and Mr Kennedy, in
                    his memoir of Mr Crompton, has stated that the number in 1829 had increased to
                    seven millions, It is now, in 1832, rated at eight millions. The quantity of
                    cotton yarn spun in 1832 is 222,000,000 pounds, of which 132,000,000 pounds have
                    been manufactured into cloth, giving employment to 203,373 looms. The cotton
                    manufacture, in its different branches, is,estimated to furnish employment to
                    1,500,000 persons.</p>
                <p>Before concluding our account of the cotton manufacture of this country, we must
                    call the reader’s attention to the peculiar circumstances which opened to this
                    branch of industry a course of such unprecedented success; and having done so,
                    we shall notice the effects produced by it on the condition of the people, and
                    on the general wealth and prosperity of the nation.</p>
                <p>As the successive mechanical inventions which we have described came to be
                    aoplied to the manufacture, they <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752641"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2641-0413"/>changed the principle of·production,
                    and’madewhattill then had been nearly wholly a product of labour, become almost
                    entirely a product of capital.-Tmportant results flowed from this change. It
                    enabled Great Britain, the prin-ėipal holder of these machines, to become
                    thefnrnishef of a commodity, which up tţ&gt; that time had been brought at à
                    great expense from India. <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> It further enabled her
                    to reduce its cost, and render what till then had been accessible only to the
                    rich, and of limited sale, an article of general wear. During the long struggle
                    which took place between machinery and hand-labour, this country continued to be
                    the nearly exclusive possessor of the machines by which the reduction of cost
                    was effected. Having in consequence, in a great measure,’a monopoly of the
                    supply, she was enabled to reap that harvest of prosperity which so unusual a
                    combination of circumstances was calculated to produce. An improvement in the
                    condition of every class of the community followed the advance of the
                    manufacture. The progressive extension of the use of ιpachinery, in place of
                    lessening the demand for labour, as was at first dreaded, had the effect of
                    increasing it to an extraordinary degree. There was a constantly growing want of
                    hands to be employed in aid of the new machinery, and in the new branches of
                    manufacture to which it gave birth. The wages of labour in consequence rose, at
                    first moderately, but afterwards extensively; and the rise, having pervaded
                    every description of employment, not only gave the whole labouring class in this
                    country a command of the comforts of,life, but brought within their reach many
                    little luxuries to which they were formerly unaccustomed. The condition of the
                    higher classes of the community experienced a corresponding advance, the
                    population rapidly increased, and an enlarged consumption of the products of the
                    soil took place, in consequence of the improved circumstances, as well as of the
                    augmented numbers, of the people. More grain, more butcher-meat, were used; and
                    an additional quantity of corn was required for the horses employed in the
                    transport of commodities, in the conveyance of passengers, and in the operations
                    of husbandry. All these causes gave a stimulus to agriculture, and produceda
                    change on that importantbranch of industry, not less remarkable than that which
                    was simultaneously taking place in manufactures.</p>
                <p>j Previous to the year 1766, the industry, population, and consumption of the
                    country had been for. a considerable time stationary. We had;* from the want of
                    demand at home, been enabled during the whole of the preceding part of the
                    century, to export grain annually to a large amount. From 1766, however, we
                    ceased to be exporters of grain. The improvement of the circumstances of the
                    country had enlarged its power of consumption, which from&lt;tbat time'has
                    been-so steadily progressive, and so great, that notwithstanding our having, by
                    our improved agriculture, augmented our products threefold, we not only have
                    never been able to bring our home supply to meet our demand, but have been
                    obliged to import largely every year from other countries. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi></p>
                <p>There can be no such satisfactory evidence of the improving condition of a people
                    as a continued increase in their power of consumption; and the facts we have
                    stated afford proofs of a degree of comfort diffused for a length of time over a
                    great population, which we believe is unexampled.</p>
                <p>~∙~" ’ ^The influence on the commercial prosperity of the country has been
                    scarcely less striking. In 1775 the tonnage of British vessels cleared outwards
                    was 783,226 tons, and of foreign vessels 64,860 tons. In 1831 the tonnage of the

                    population of Liverpool at the commencement of last century to have been 4240
                    persons, and the number of ships belonging to the port in 1710 to have been 84;
                    averaging something less than 70 tons each ship. In 1766 six hundred and forty
                    six British’vessels and fifty-four foreign vessels entered the port of
                    Liverpool, and seven hundred and eight British and sixty-nine foreign vessels
                    cleared out. In 1831 the population of Liverpool amounted to 165,175, and 8644
                    British vessels'and 1078'foreign vessels entered the port, and 7743 British and
                    1040-foreign vessels cleared out.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the number of British vessels which have entered and
                    cleared out of the port of Liverpool, coasters are included.</p></note></p>
                <p>Since the commencement of the cotton manufacture, the population of Lancashire,
                    of Lanarkshire, and of Renfrewshire, the districts in which it is most
                    extensively cart ried on, has increased threefold; and the population oíf
                    Glasgow, which in the year 1763, immediately before the commencement of the
                    cotton manufacture, was 28,300, has, as appears by the government census of
                    1831,' increased to 202,426.</p>
                <p>Such are the great results of the cotton manufacture, and of the stimulus which
                    its rapid increase has given to the other branches of industry.</p>
                <p>But having reached this high state of prosperity, it may be asked, what security
                    have we that we shall bë’able to maintain our pre-eminence in this manufacture,
                    now that other countries, over which we possess no natural advantage, are using
                    efforts to participate in its. benefits? ..</p>
                <p>To this it can only be answered, that the hopes of ouŗ being^able to preserve our
                    vantagċ-gróünd, rest upon our persevering industry, õur economy, our great
                    capital, thd advanced state of our machinery, our attainments in mechanical
                    knowledge, the benefit we derive from having been long in possession of the
                    business, and the better acquaintance with the minutiae of its processes. The
                    lead we ’ have thus taken we think it probable we may for a long time be able to
                    maintain; for invention is progressive, and in a manufacture extended like ours,
                    every discovery that is made has the effect to unfold principles leading to
                    other discoveries, or to suggest analogous applications in other departments.
                    Those who conduct the various pro* cesses of manufacture, and those employed in
                    the opera·; tive part of them, have all their thoughts constantly turned-to the
                    means of enlarging the powers of the machines they are in possession of, or to
                    the discovery of others for executing parts of the work still performed by the
                    hand. Besides the mere progress in machinery, there is a progress also in the
                    use of machinery, of contrivances to supply its defects,'and of little,
                    uńdefinable, subsidiary aids, for the furtherance of the work to be done, which
                    contribute to give a vast superiority to those who have been long habituated to
                    the use of it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When the
                    measures for conciliating the respective commercial interests of parties in the
                    Irish Union were arranging, the opinion of professional men was taken as to the
                    period at which the cotton manufacture of Ireland might be able to go on in
                    competition with that of England without the help of protecting duties; and Mr
                    William Orr of Dublin, who had introduced the manufacture into that country, was
                    asked if he thought it likely that in ten years the Irish manufacturers would
                    overtake the Èngliśli in skill—Mr Orr replied, “Yes! if the English can be
                    persuaded during that time to stand still.”</p></note></p>
                <p>It is not, however, the rivalry of the European states we have to dread in this
                    branch. Over many of them we have natural advantages; and with all of them, from
                    the circumstances<pb break="no" facs="nls:194752654"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2654-0414"/> which have been stated, it is probable we shall
                    be able to maintain pur ground. But perhaps this may not be the case, to the
                    same degree, in the competition which we shall have to encounter with America,
                    after her great tracts of land are occupied, and a fuller population admits of
                    her capital and industry being profitably directed,to manufacturing pursuits.
                    From being the grower of the raw material, she has an advantage over us in this
                    contest which none of our other competitors possess. But even this circumstance,
                    we apprehend, is not of so much moment as may at first sight appear.</p>
                <p>The southern states of the Union, in which the cotton wool, is raised, from their
                    local defects in other requisites, and the description of people of which the
                    lower order is composed, never can become a manufacturing country. The
                    competition, therefore, which we shall have to maintain, will be with the people
                    of the northern states, who must, like ourselves, import the raw material which
                    they are to manufacture. The difference of its cost, to them and to us cannot be
                    great, particularly if we shall have the East Indies and South America open for
                    our supply.</p>
                <p>We believe, then, that in this manufacture we have little to fear from
                    competition; but we are not equally confident that its prosperity may not be
                    exposed to risk from our ill-judged anxiety to secure a monopoly of its
                    advantages. Our practice of excluding from our markets the manufactures of other
                    countries, is not only contrary to sound political principle, but gives rise to
                    a spirit of hostility unfavourable to our interests, and places us in such a
                    state that, when other nations in retaliation exclude our manufactures from
                    their markets, we have no right to complain. But even without any wish to
                    retaliate, are not other nations too apt, as they advance in manufactures, to be
                    led to copy those regulations to which they erroneously ascribe our success?</p>
                <p>That we may not decide this question rashly, let us'examine what is the danger to
                    which we should be exposed if we were to take the opposite system, and open our
                    ports to the manufactures of other countries.</p>
                <p>If we can now export annually to the value of about 20,000,000 sterling of cotton
                    goods, which, burdened with freight, charges, and the exporter’s profit, we are
                    able to sell in competition with foreign manufacture, can we have any thing to
                    fear from a competition with that manufacture in our home market, where the
                    circumstances of the competing parties would be reversed? So far from the
                    introduction of foreign manufacture into our market being an evil, we are
                    inclined to think that it would be advantageous to our interests, and that in
                    the interchange of various fabrics which would be the consequence, the sale of
                    our own manufactures would be increased. Commerce being altogether a matter of
                    barter, it is necessary for every country to purchase in order that she may
                    sell; and, fortunately, even in the same branch of manufacture, there is always
                    room for such changes. There are shades of difference in the fabric of every
                    article, upon which taste, or fashion, or caprice, never fails to fix an
                    arbitrary value, thereby constituting them into separate commodities capable of
                    being exchanged.</p>
                <p>But the view we are taking of this important question does not rest altogether
                    upon theory. Happily we have experience in support of it. No one disputes the
                    advantage resulting from the interchange of commodities between Lancashire and
                    Lanarkshire, or alleges that it would be for the benefit of either to have the
                    manufacture of the other excluded from its market. Yet these two districts have
                    their dependence upon manufactures which in their general features are the
                    same.·</p>
                <p>Those who recollect the commercial treaty with France, in which some approach was
                    made to a free trade between the two countries, will remember, that while it
                    lasted the sale warehouses of London and Manchester were resorted to by
                    purchasers from the different .towns of France, with <hi rend="subscript">;</hi>
                    the same freedom, and in nearly an equal proportion of numbers, as from the
                    towns in England. And although in those warehouses commodities of a similar
                    description of French and English production were to be found, and our
                    shopkeepers were, at the same time daily resorting to France to make purchases,
                    in no period were our manufactures in a state of greater progressive prosperity
                    than during the eight years, from 1786 to 1793, that this treaty existed. .
                    ∙t</p>
                <p>There is no one, we believe, who had an opportunity of knowing the two countries
                    at the time we mention, who will not say that both were benefited, by this
                    treaty, and probably exactly in the degree that the exclusive system in both had
                    been departed from.</p>
                <p>In addition to this, it may be proper to notice, that Switzerland and Saxony have
                    always been open to the reception of cotton goods free of duty; and that in none
                    of the countries on the Continent is the cotton manufacture in a more thriving
                    state. Might it not, therefore, be a measure of wisdom to withdraw our
                    restrictions against the importation of foreign manufactures, the interference
                    of which with our own products in the home market, supposing no interchange of
                    the two to take place, never could be to the amount of the sale we may be
                    deprived of by following the opposite policy, and thus inducing the exclusion of
                    our own goods from the foreign market?</p>
                <p>Fears have been expressed that the lower wages for which, the labourers of other
                    countries, our competitors in the manufacture, can work, and upon which, from
                    the cheapness of their provisions, they can afford to live, may ultimately
                    enable them to take the manufacture out of our hands. In reply to this, it may
                    perhaps be sufficient to recal to our readers the small part of the cost of the
                    commodity which now belongs to the labour of the hand, and the daily diminution
                    which is taking place even of that part, by the introduction of new mechanical
                    substitutes.</p>
                <p>As examples of the progressive transference of production by hand labour to
                    machinery, we may refer to the process employed for the production of cotton
                    yarn before 1767, when each spindle required a person to work it; and compare it
                    with the present state of spinning, when one man, with the aid of a few piecers
                    to take up and join his broken ends, can work a thousand spindles; or we may
                    refer to the circumstance, that in Lancashire in 1818 there were not more than
                    2000 power-looms, and of these not a half in employment; and that in 1832 the
                    number had increased to 80,000,—so extensive had been the change during these
                    fourteen years from hand-weaving to weaving by power.</p>
                <p>In addition to the security thus afforded by the alteration in the mode of
                    production, we possess, in our inexhaustible stores of iron and coal, resources
                    which more than counterbalance any advantages arising to other countries from
                    the lower wages of their labourers. The unlimited command of these elements of
                    power, one of which is the material of which machines are formed, and the other
                    the chief article used in giving them motion, has not only led to extensive
                    changes in the manufactures themselves, but has produced a complete revolution
                    on the coasting trade of the country, and bids fair to give rise to an equally
                    extraordinary change in the mode of internal communication.</p>
                <p>Steam navigation has brought out the full benefit of our insular position. It has
                    brought Bristol, Liverpool, Dublin, Belfast, and Glasgow, into constant and
                    intimate relation; and the celerity and certainty belonging to the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194752667" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2667-0415"/> conveyance render
                    this means of transport for our finer commodities invaluable. A person in
                    Glasgow receives an order for goods to be shipped by the first vessel for New
                    York. There is no vessel to sail immediately from the Clyde, but he knows that
                    one of the packet ships from Liverpool will sail for New York in four days from
                    that time. He puts his goods into the steam-boat from Glasgow to Liverpool, and
                    they are on board of the packet for New York in three days after he had received
                    the order. The steam-boat enables the manufacturer of Glasgow to employ the
                    weavers of Belfast, at no greater expense of carriage or time than he incurs in
                    sending his yarn to be woven in the upper part of his county.</p>
                <p>The railroad, again, between Manchester and Liverpool, with its steam
                    conveyances, has not only reduced the cost of carriage between these places, but
                    has had the effect of bringing almost together these two immense manufacturing
                    and trading communities, overleaping, as it were, space and time, in the
                    rapidity of the communication. A manufacturer in Manchester can leave his house
                    in the morning, purchase a supply of cotton at Liverpool, and have it delivered
                    at his work in Manchester the same day.</p>
                <p>When the system of internal communication, therefore, shall have been extended to
                    the degree that may be anticipated, and the approximation of our populous
                    manufacturing and commercial districts shall by this means have been effected,
                    there will be gained a saving of time and of capital, with a facility of
                    combining on every occasion the powers of the whole manufacturing community in
                    the increase of production, which few of our competitors can look forward to
                    possess, and which, with our other advantages, are calculated to afford us
                    assurance of the continuance of our present pre-eminence.</p>
                <p>It will be proper, in an account of the cotton manufacture, to offer a few
                    observations upon the effect of the extension of the use of machinery on the
                    character and moral condition of the people.</p>
                <p>The more perfect division of labour and separation of employment which takes
                    place as the use of machinery advances, and the consequent limitation of the
                    worker’s attention to a single object, check the expansion of the faculties, and
                    prevent that growth of intelligence in this class, which under a more general
                    employment of their powers might be expected. Another evil of a similar nature,
                    but attended perhaps with more serious consequences, is produced by manufactures
                    when they have arrived at this state, namely, the employment of children in
                    factories, by which these young creatures are withdrawn from their parents and
                    homes before they have received the elements of education, or can have acquired
                    domestic or moral habits.</p>
                <p>In noticing these evils, however, we must recollect that the state of manufacture
                    which gives birth to them is not an optional one, not the production of
                    regulation or institution, but has grown up in the progress of the arts of
                    industry, prosecuted by an intelligent people. Although, therefore, it is our
                    duty, in as far as we can, to correct their effects, we must lay our account
                    with being exposed to them, so long as men are allowed to pursue their
                    individual interest, by whatever fair means they conceive likely to accomplish
                    their object.</p>
                <p>To remedy in as far as possible the interruption to education, schools have been
                    established in many of the factories, in which the children are instructed
                    gratis in reading and writing. An institution of this kind we consider it to be
                    the interest of the proprietor of every work to provide. The expense cannot be
                    great, and will be amply repaid in the superior description of workers it will
                    be the means of rearing. In the mean time, something is done to supply the
                    deficiency of this provision by Sunday schools, which have been generally
                    established in most of the manufacturing towns. In these, the children are not
                    only taught to read, but are also instructed in the principles of religion, and
                    in a knowledge of their moral duties.</p>
                <p>In the year 1800, a course of lectures was given for the first time in Glasgow,
                    in the Andersonian Institution, to the mechanics and working classes, with the
                    view of affording them instruction in the science of their different
                    employments. In the supplement to the former edition of this work in 1818, we
                    thought it important to give an account of these lectures, in order to call
                    public attention generally to the benefit which had been derived from them; but
                    this account we think it unnecessary to repeat, as the “Mechanics’
                    Institutions,” which began soon after to be formed in Glasgow and in Edinburgh
                    on the principles of this course, have since spread into every quarter of the
                    kingdom. These establishments are calculated to counteract in a great degree the
                    effects which we have noticed as arising from the minute division of employment,
                    and confinement of attention to one object, in great manufactories.</p>
                <p>So important does this species of instruction appear to us in the circumstances
                    of this country, where so much depends on our being able to keep the lead which
                    we have got in mechanical invention and discovery, that we think it worthy of
                    consideration in a national point of view, whether, in the appointment of our
                    parochial schoolmasters, it might not be declared indispensable that they should
                    be qualified to teach the first principles of mechanics and chemistry.</p>
                <p>With the stores of the raw material of machinery which we possess, might we not,
                    with a proper training of our people, become machine-makers for all the nations
                    who are less favourably circumstanced? The advantage of being able to occupy
                    such ground would be incalculable.</p>
                <p>We shall now return to the history of the progress of the cotton manufacture,
                    from which our attention has been somewhat diverted by our desire to trace the
                    true sources of its prosperity in Great Britain, and to arrive at a knowledge of
                    the policy to be pursued, to enable us to retain our mercantile superiority.</p>
                <p>In Ireland some attempts to introduce the manufacture of cotton goods were made
                    so early as 1770, but the ma- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> nufacture continued
                    on a very limited scale until the year' 1790. After this period the progress was
                    considerable, although far short of what took place during the same time in this
                    country; indeed its products have never been such as to enter into competition
                    with those of Britain, or to become articles of general foreign sale. This
                    probably arises from the high price of fuel, rendering the concentration of the
                    processes by means of the power of steam, and the consequent saving in labour,
                    in many situations impossible.</p>
                <p>The chief seat of this manufacture in Ireland is Belfast, and the district of
                    country situated within twenty miles of that town. But there are a good many
                    calicoes, fustians, and cotton checks, made in Dublin, Balbriggan, Banden, and
                    Cork. All these goods are consigned to factors in Dublin for sale, except a part
                    of the calicoes, which the manufacturers are sometimes enabled to dispose of to
                    printers on the spot.</p>
                <p>In the article on the cotton manufacture in the Supplement to the former edition
                    of this work, we mentioned that there were then only twenty-five cotton mills in
                    Ireland, containing about 145,000 spindles, partly mule and partly throstle; and
                    that when all these <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> were at Work they were
                    supposed to spin about 36,000 pounds of cotton weekly. From the most'minute
                    inquiry’which wfe <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752680"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2680-0416"/>have been able to make, we do not find that any
                    advance in the manufacture has been made since then.</p>
                <p>Some of the spinners weave the whole of their yarn, while others do not weave
                    any; but in either case, the weaving is carried on by capitalists, who give out
                    the yarn to be woven, and pay the weaver wages for his work. The greater part of
                    this business is carried on in the same district with the linen manufacture, in
                    which the weaver is the sole manufacturer, buying the yarn for his web, and
                    selling the cloth when he has finished it. Perhaps the difference in the manner
                    in which these manufacturing processes are conducted, may proceed from the
                    different way in which the yarns made use of in the two branches are produced.
                    The yarn for the linen manufacture is spun by individuals scattered over the
                    country. This in the infancy of the business, and while little capital had been
                    accumulated, may have led to the manufacturing process being carried on in a
                    like detached manner; the weaver purchasing the yarn from his neighbour the
                    spinner, and, after converting it into cloth, selling the web at the nearest
                    market to the merchant. The cotton manufacture in Ireland did not grow up thus
                    from small beginnings, but was introduced into that country at once from
                    England, and with spinning establishments upon comparatively a large scale. It
                    was in consequence necessary that the weaving should from the first take off the
                    produce of those establishments; and there being no way of effecting this with
                    certainty, but by employing the weavers upon wages to work up the yarn, the
                    manufacture was begun, and has been prosecuted upon this plan ever since, while
                    the linen manufacture carried on in the same district continues to be conducted
                    upon the opposite system.</p>
                <p>There are two power-loom mills in Ireland. One of them is understood to be doing
                    well, the other has only been partly filled with looms, and has been allowed to
                    remain in that state.</p>
                <p>Large quantities of cotton yarn are sent from Britain to Ireland to be woven by
                    the hand weavers in that country; and several Glasgow houses have agents at
                    Belfast for giving out their yarns, to be woven in that neighbourhood, and
                    returned to them in cloth. The manufacture furnishes in this case employment to
                    English capital and Irish labour.</p>
                <p>The annual return of the cotton manufacture of Ireland is estimated at
                    L.700,000.</p>
                <p>The cotton manufacture was introduced into France about sixty-five years ago, and
                    was first established at Arebonas, in the Vivarais; from whence it afterwards
                    made its way to Montpellier, in Lower Languedoe. For some time after its
                    introduction, the greater part of the yarn used in its fabrics was brought from
                    the Levant, a small part only, spun in the mountains of the Vivarais and the
                    Gevanvans, being produced in the country. The Turkey red yarn required for
                    coloured goods was either brought from Adrianople and Smyrna in a dyed state, or
                    the manufacturers sent the yarn of their own spinning to these places, by way of
                    <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> Marseilles, to be dyed and returned to them. But
                    this circuitous mode of obtaining those yarns did not continue long, for the
                    manufacturers soon succeeded in inducing some Greek dyers to settle in France,
                    and the natives having acquired from them a knowledge of these processes, the
                    whole dyeing required for the manufacture came in the course of twenty years to
                    be executed by Frenchmen. From these yarns, spun and dyed in the way we have
                    stated, were produced at Montpellier, at Cholet in La Vendée, and in Bearn,
                    large quantities of pocket handkerchiefs, and of cloths for garments and for
                    furniture. The manufacture of these articles, and the art of dyeing, were
                    established also at Rouen, at</p>
                <p>Amiens, and throughout the surroundinģ country, within ten years after their
                    introduction into the south of France. Before this period, there had been
                    carried on at Rouen a considerable manufacture of linen goods, similar to those
                    afterwards made of cotton. The cotton goods, however, as was the case in England
                    when first introduced, were woven with linen warp and cotton weft, and it was
                    not till after Sir Richard Arkwright’s invention that the French were able to
                    make them wholly of cotton. With all this activity in the introduction of the
                    cotton manufacture, no early attempts were made by the French to avail
                    themselves of the improvements which had been introduced into the process of
                    cotton spinning in England. Their first spinning machine of a construction
                    superior to the one-thread wheel, was a mule which Monsieur de Calonne, minister
                    of France, introduced in the year 1787. This was immediately copied, and these
                    machines adopted wherever the manufacture was carried on. The use of them
                    increased rapidly, particularly at Rouen, at Paris, at Lille, at St Quentin, at
                    Amiens, and at Montpellier.</p>
                <p>About the same period the first attempt to spin water twist was made at Louviers.
                    Hostility to the introduction of these improvements, similar to what had taken
                    place in England, was manifested by the common people in France. But the
                    disposition to disturbance was soon quelled, and the evident advantage which the
                    new mode of spinning possessed over the old put an end in a short time to all
                    idea of opposition.</p>
                <p>It appears from official reports that the quantity of cotton wool used in the
                    French manufacture was in the year</p>

                    nankeens, nankinets, crapes, and other small stuffs; about 1,155,000 pounds into

                    very few in France, that the power of water or of steam was employed, and, even
                    in the greater part of them, the application of power was confined to the
                    machinery used in the preparation of the cotton.</p>
                <p>Nearly the whole of this branch of the manufacture had till then been carried on

                <p>The French manufacturers were in 1817 far behind the English, in the important
                    art of combining mechanical power with manual dexterity, to effect an economy of
                    labour and increase of production. They had been induced to prosecute the
                    manufacture upon the plan we have mentioned, rather than erect establishments
                    upon the extended scale and of the comprehensive nature used in this country, by
                    the high interèst they were obliged to pay for money on the one hand, and the
                    comparatively cheap rate of labour on the other. The operation of these
                    circumstances led them to pursue this system, as seeming the best calculated for
                    producing the goods upon the cheapest terms, and with the smallest advance of
                    capital.</p>
                <p>There is, however, no scarcity of falls of water in France for moving large
                    machinery, although the greater part of them are in situations either of scanty
                    population or of difficult access, and are inconvenient for receiving the raw
                    material, or disposing of the manufactured product. Many of the falls, too, are
                    appropriated, to mills or mines, and are not to be bought but at an expense
                    which the benefit to be derived from them seems not likely to repay.</p>
                <p>The original location of the different fabrics of the manufacture depended on the
                    circumstances in each situation favourable for the production of the article to
                    which the inhabitants betook themselves; these circumstances remaining the same,
                    the distribut ion of the different branches still continues with little change.
                    In Paris there is a good deal of spinning, and they manufacture there the best
                    calicoes and the finest cotton hosiery produced in France. The manufacturers of
                    Paris have also a number of people employed in spinning and weaving at
                    Versailles, Essennes, Melun, Seniis, Royaumont, Liancourt, Chantilly, Gisors,
                    Carlepont, &amp;c. &gt;</p>
                <p>The cotton manufacture is, however, established on a more extensive scale in
                    Rouen than in any other town in France; and it is not confined to the city, for
                    Normandy is peopled with cotton weavers, who carry on the business in their own
                    houses, and send the goods they make to the hall at Rouen for sale. The
                    manufacturers of Rouen have also many workmen employed in the neighbourhood of
                    St Quentin and Cambray, where their finest cloths are woven. - The articles
                    produced in Rouen, and in these dependent districts, are calicoes coarse and
                    fine, and they are made to a great amount; velvets also in great quantity;
                    coloured cotton goods of all descriptions; which last, the Normans, from their
                    superiòr knowledge in the art of dyeing, execute well.</p>
                <p>At Amiens, and in the neighbourhood, there is a great deal of spinning done,
                    partly for hosiery, but chiefly for velvets, of which a large quantity is made
                    in this district. The cotton manufacture has in a great measure supplanted the
                    woollen manufacture formerly carried on there.</p>
                <p>At Troyes they manufacture dimities, fustians, swanskins, and different strong
                    stuffs for furniture and linings. There is also a considerable manufacture of
                    low-priced hosiery.</p>
                <p>At St Quentin, although the spinning is considerable, it does not supply above a
                    fifth of the yarn used in the surrounding district, in which there are, it is
                    said, 12,000 weavers. These are employed upon different qualities of calicoes,
                    upon cambrics for printing, upon dimities, and upon fancy goods, both white and
                    coloured. There is no weaving done in the town. In the linen manufacture
                    formerly carried on there 15,000 weavers were at one time employed in making
                    linens, thread, gauzes, and cambrics; these are now reduced to about 2000.</p>
                <p>At Tarrare they make the finest book muslins; but the yarn they use is all
                    smuggled from England.</p>
                <p>In the ci-devant province of Beaujolois they produce calicoes, low-priced
                    dimities, and stuffs for linings.</p>
                <p>At Nismes the people formerly were wholly employed upon articles of silk; but
                    they now manufacture very fine cotton stockings, and fancy goods of different
                    descriptions, woven with silk warp and cotton weft.</p>
                <p>At Lyons they make fancy articles in cotton, of superior taste and beauty, as
                    they boast, to any thing of the kind ever exhibited before; but they admit that
                    the price of the goods is very high.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of Montpellier is now entirely confined to what are called Madras
                    handkerchiefs, made in imitation of those of India.</p>
                <p>The manufacture carried on in Cholet, Laval, and the surrounding country, was
                    formerly wholly of linen. They now make calicoes, coloured cotton handkerchiefs
                    in great quantities, and coloured handkerchiefs of cotton and linen. They have
                    no spinning in this district.</p>
                <p>The calico printers of Alsace formerly drew their whole supplies of cloth from
                    Paris, Rouen, and St Quentin; but having been enabled to establish spinning
                    works, with the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752706" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2706-0418"
                    />assistance of a few Swiss emigrant workmen, who instructed the Alsacians, they
                    introduced into their country the cotton manufacture, and’ not only supply the
                    goods required for their own printing, but have a surplus to dispose of for the
                    consumption of others.</p>
                <p>Lille, Tourcoing, and Roubaix, with the surrounding country, form a spinning and
                    manufacturing district. Lille and Tourcoing spin not only for their own
                    consumption, but are able to furnish a great deal of yarn for the weaving
                    carried on in the neighbourhood. The yarn produced in Roubaix, on the contrary,
                    does not suffice for its own demands. The goods manufactured in this district
                    are printaniers, thicksets, crapes, and nankinets. Formerly its weavers were
                    employed on woollen stuffs; but this branch is now entirely given up. At Cambray
                    the weaving is considerable, but it is almost wholly carried on for the
                    manufacturers of St Quentin and Rouen.</p>
                <p>The only articles of cotton manufacture in which the French compete with England
                    are their dyed goods and their sewed muslins. The colours of the former are
                    bright and durable, and the embroidery on their muslins is designed with taste,
                    and well executed.</p>
                <p>From 1817 to 1827 the manufacture has continued to ġo on prosperously. Spinning
                    works upon the same principles as those in England, in which the preparation and
                    spinning processes are carried on together, have been established in all the
                    manufacturing districts; and the use of hand-mules is abandoned in every part of
                    France.</p>
                <p>In 1814, on the restoration of the Bourbons to the throne, the ministry which
                    then came into power, entertaining the idea that the prosperity of a nation
                    depended on its being able to produce every thing required for its own
                    consumption, took measures for protecting the French home manufactures, by
                    preventing all competition from abroad; and, without regard to the natural
                    advantages or disadvantages which the country possessed for carrying on any
                    particular branch of industry, thought only of making France a great
                    manufacturing nation, and the fabricator of every commodity.</p>
                <p>In the year 1827, reports were submitted to government by the different chambers
                    of commerce and manufacturing bodies in France, on the causes of the distress
                    which was then generally felt. In these reports it was stated, that the
                    protection which had been afforded to the home manufactures, by shutting out all
                    competition, had produced two results,—the refusal of other countries to receive
                    the manufactures of France,—and a premature and in many cases an unsound growth
                    of the protected manufacture at home. The consequence of fostering branches of
                    industry in this manner, where there are no natural or local advantages for
                    carrying them on, is not experienced so long as the demand for the home
                    consumption of the article keeps the lead of the supply. This was the case for a
                    length of time with the cotton manufacture of France, and the prosperity which
                    it exhibited seemed to justify the minister’s measures, and his confidence in
                    the beneficial operation of his system. But in the year 1827, it was found that
                    the quantity of cotton goods which the manufacture had by that time become
                    enabled to supply, was more than the home market could takeoff; and their cost
                    was too high to allow of their being profitably disposed of in the markéts
                    abroad. The parties who were engaged in the business found themselves thus
                    involved in difficulty and distress, and this continued to the end of 1831,
                    when, the low price to which the goods had been reduced having had the effect of
                    increasing the home consumption, and even of causing an exportation of the
                    surplus stock to the amount of 54,806,000 francs, of which 37,091,000 were for
                    printed cottons, most of the factories were again set to work, and the crisis
                    was considered to be over for the present.</p>
                <p>The manufacturers, in their report, state the high cost of their machinery, and
                    of fuel, as among the principal causes of the distress, and in proof of this
                    give a statement of the comparative expense of erecting and maintaining a
                    spinning mill in France and in England, wrought by a steam-engine of thirty
                    horse power. They calculate the cost in France at 500,000 francs, in England at
                    325,000 francs; and the yearly maintenance of the establishment, including fuel
                    in France, at 98,300 francs, and in England at 51,000 francs. The charge in
                    spinning a kilogram of yarn they thus ascertain to be in the one case
                    seventy-six cents, and in the other thirty-two. M. Martin, an iron founder at
                    Rouen, on being asked by the committee to what he attributed the high price of
                    their machinery, when compared with its price in England, replied, “A ce, que le
                    combustible, et tout le materiel de la fabrication, est trois fois plus cher en
                    France qu’en Angleterre.” 01'393 blast-furnaces at work in 1829 in France, only
                    fourteen were worked with coal; and wood, which constitutes the fuel of the
                    greater part of France, had risen in consequence to three times its former
                    price.</p>
                <p>The dearness of fuel operates no less disadvantageously in preventing the French
                    from availing themselves fully of the powers of the steam-engine, applied by us
                    in economising the cost of almost every process of the manufacture, and in
                    cheapening the commodity to the consumer, by the rapid and-less expensive
                    transportation of the raw material to the place of manufacture, and of the
                    finished pro duct to the place of sale.</p>
                <p>Attempts have been made in France to introduce the power loom; but the cost of
                    fuel and machinery, added to the low price of hand weaving, have formed
                    insurmountable obstacles to the extension of this mode of production. There are
                    not now more than 3000 power-looms at work in France.</p>
                <p>A manufacturing establishment at Rouen has recently obtained a patent for making
                    cotton canvass for shipping, which is understood to be impermeable, and in that
                    case the objection which has hitherto circumscribed the employment of this
                    article will be removed.</p>
                <p>The following statement of the importation of cotton wool into France from 1822
                    to 1831 inclusive, will show the amount of the manufacture during that
                    period.</p>

                <p>The people of free countries apply themselves more early to the pursuits of
                    industry than those who live under despotic governments, probably from the
                    conviction that what their labour produces will be secured to them for their
                    enjoyment. The Swiss boast that they manufactured muslins before the beginning
                    of the last century. If this is correct, these goods certainly cannot have been
                    fitted to compete with the India muslins, with which the markets of Europe
                    continued to be supplied until the invention of the mule-jenny enabled the
                    British muslins to rival them.</p>
                <p>The cotton manufacture of Switzerland, whatever may <pb break="no"

                    commencement, was. not at an early period of much amount. It was even many years
                    after Sir Richard Arkwright’s improvements before it began to make any
                    considerable advance. The Swiss had no spinning by machinery before the year
                    1798, at which time their first mill was erected at St Gall. Until that period
                    all their yarn was spun upon the one-thread wheel, and even in 1817 about a
                    tenth part of it was produced in this manner.</p>
                <p>A considerable proportion of their machinery up to the year 1818 was worked in
                    small systems scattered over the country, as we have stated to have been the
                    case in France at that time. In the manufacture of the goods, the weaver
                    provided himself with the yarn, and sold the cloth at the jearest weekly market,
                    or exchanged it for a new supply of yam. There were, however, some manufacturing
                    capitalists who employed a number of weavers, furnishing them with materials for
                    the cloth, and paying them wages. But only a small part of the manufacture was
                    carried on in this way. . -</p>
                <p>Although the manner in which the Swiss conducted the business at this time was
                    not so well calculated for producing quantity, or bringing the article cheap to
                    market, as the mode pursued by us, it left, to the mechanic a higher moral rank
                    and character, and a greater possibility of worldly enjoyment, than belongs to
                    the working people of our more systematised establishments. Under the one, the
                    workman appears to exercise independent labour, and his employment seems to be
                    subservient to his own use and benefit. In the other, we see him only as an
                    accessory to some piece of machinery for supplying.the elements of commerce;
                    and, losing sight of the object of man’s labour, the extension of his comforts
                    and enjoyments, we are led to consider a nation as a great manufacturing
                    concern, and increase of production as what is to be desired, at whatever
                    expense of individual privation it may be obtained. .</p>
                <p>• The cotton manufacture of Switzerland, unprotected against foreign competition
                    in the home market, and ex- <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> eluded from the
                    markets of France, Austria, and Piedmont, continued nevertheless steadily and
                    uniformly to advance,furnishing a striking proof of the safetyand advantage of
                    free trade. Its progress since 1818 has been great. Additional spinning works
                    have continued yearly to be established in the different cantons, at Winterthur
                    and its neighbourhood, in the town and canton of Zurich, in the cantons of St
                    Gall and Appenzell, of Argovia, of Thuringia, of Geneva, and at St Blaye near
                    Basle.</p>
                <p>At the present time, all the water power to be obtained without much expense, and
                    situated in populous parts of the country, has been fully occupied. In some
                    places, such as Zurich, it has been bought at as high a price as L.200 for each
                    horse power.</p>
                <p>The quantity of cotton manufactured in Switzerland in 1832 is 56,000 bales, and
                    the expense of bringing the raw material there is Id. per lb. on that brought
                    from Trieste, and lįd. on that from Havre.</p>
                <p>There are at present (1832) above 9000 persons employed in the spinning
                    processes, and the whole number of workers in the different branches of the
                    manufacture, including those engaged in the dyeing and printing, exceeds 28,000.
                    The wages paid in the spinning works are as follows: To carders (all men) <hi
                    rend="italic">∙-5s.</hi> per week·; to drawers and slabbers (girls) 3s. per
                    week; to stretchers (men) from 4s. to 6s. per week; to spinners From 8s. to 10s.
                    per week. The working hours are generally fourteen hours per day, and eighty
                    hours per week may be taken as the average. The weavers earn from 4s. to 4s. 6d.
                    per week, and are paid 2s. per piece for calicoes. The workers in the differ*
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ent departments are considered to be well off,
                    and are contented and happy. Power-looms have been tried, but the low wages of
                    hand weaving, and scarcity of water power for moving the machinery, have
                    prevented their coming into use. ·«· r&lt;p(&gt; . i,</p>
                <p>The goods manufactured are nearly of the same description as those made in
                    Britain. The canton of Appenzell produces fine plain muslins and the finest
                    embroideries. The canton of St Gall, muslins, coloured pocket handkerchiefs,
                    cottonets, and the finest cotton cloths. The canton of Zurich, on both banks of
                    the lake, produces about a thousand pieces of calico weekly. The cantons of
                    Thur-govia and Argovia produce mostly coloured goods;,and in these and the
                    cantons of Zurich and Glaris the printing of cotton cloths is carried on to a
                    considerable extent. <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi></p>
                <p>Switzerland has been an exporting country for many years; and the Swiss goods,
                    particularly fine tweels, and the better description of prints, have
                    successfully competed with similar British goods in the Mediterranean markets,
                    and latterly in South America. Foreign yarns, cloth, &amp;c. are admitted into
                    Switzerland free of duty, t</p>
                <p>Before 1822, all the numbers of water and mule twist, and manufactured articles
                    of every description, were sent from this country to Switzerland. Now“, fustians
                    only are sen’t to that market, and hardly any yarn below No. 60. Indeed, so fast
                    are the Swiss advancing in spinning, that they expect to be able immediately to
                    supply themselves with all the yarns they use under No. 120.</p>
                <p>The cotton manufacture is prosecuted to a considerable extent in different parts
                    of Germany. In Austria it is carried on principally around Vienna, in the
                    neighbourhood of which city there are a number of large spinning works, all of
                    them moved by water. They do not spin higher numbers than No. 60. All the fine
                    yarn they manufacture, and even a very considerable part of the coarse, is
                    smuggled from this country. The importation of yarn under No. 60 is prohibited,
                    but all higher numbers are admitted on paying a considerable duty. To facilitate
                    the contraband-introduction of these yarns, small spinning works have been
                    established at Reichenberg, and other places upon the Bohemian frontier. The
                    owners of these mills bring English yarns from Elberfeldt or Manchester, make up
                    the bundles anew, and sell the twist as Austrian. The business of spinning and
                    manufacturing are carried on separately.</p>
                <p>In Vienna and the surrounding country there are above 10,000 weavers employed.
                    The weaving is also very considerable at Prague, Kuttenberg, Lettowitz, and
                    Ebresch-dorf, and is spread through Bohemia and Moravia. It is also carried on
                    extensively at Gratz in Styria. Of late years a few works have" been established
                    in the Tyrol, in consequence of the abundance of water power, the low rate of
                    wages, and the heavy duties on the importation of yarn. The cotton goods
                    manufactured in the Austrian dominions are of a stout fabric, and well executed.
                    Nankeens form a principal article.</p>
                <p>Austria, under her present form of government, cannot, we apprehend, be made a
                    great manufacturing country. Commerce does not spring vigorously under the
                    uncertainty which belongs to despotic rule, and, if successful, the diffusion of
                    wealth, which is its consequence, produces a spirit incompatible with the
                    exercise of arbitrary power. Supposing, therefore, the manufactures of Austria,
                    by factitious encouragement, brought to supply a part of her own consumption,
                    she cannot continue to advance in these pursuits, without involving a change of
                    her political institutions.</p>
                <p>In Saxony, the cotton manufacture, although perhaps ι≠of of greater amount than
                    in Austria, is more generally diffused over the country, and exists under
                    circumstances which offer a greater probability of future advance. The <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194752732" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2732-0420"/> habits and moral
                    condition of the Saxon people are favourable to the successful prosecution of
                    manufactures. They are sober, industrious, well educated, and frugal. The
                    administration of their government is liberal, and their rulers do not
                    capriciously interfere with private pursuits. They have been long trained to
                    manufacturing habits, having very early had an extensive linen business; and in
                    order to introduce the cotton manufacture, nothing more was necessary than to
                    transfer to the latter a part of the industry which had been employed in the
                    former.</p>
                <p>In 1799, after many unsuccessful attempts, Messrs Barnard and Brothers, with the
                    aid of an English mechanic, erected at Chemnitz the first work which was
                    established for spinning cotton in Saxony. Their example was quickly followed by
                    others; but from the imperfect knowledge which the Saxons then possessed of the
                    mode of erecting these works, and from the reduction of the profits of spinning,
                    which took place in consequence of the increased competition upon the Continent
                    and in England, these undertakings proved unsuccessful. Those who engaged in
                    them became loaded with large stocks of unsaleable yarn, which they were not
                    able to get quit of, until the blockade of the Elbe in 1804, and the subsequent
                    occupation of Hanover by the French, which excluded for a time the competition
                    of England.</p>
                <p>The Berlin decree in 1806, and the enforcement of Bonaparte’s continental system,
                    gave great vigour to the spinning trade in Germany. By the year 1808, the German
                    spinners had more than indemnified themselves for the loss which they had
                    previously sustained; and they continued to prosper and to extend their
                    business, till the success of the allies in the year 1813 put an end to the
                    French yoke, and opened the country to the competition of foreigners.</p>
                <p>Their machinery, however, had been greatly improved during this period; and the
                    price of labour in Saxony being uniformly low, the Saxons allege that they would
                    have been able to compete successfully with us, had it not been for our greater
                    capital, and the advantage which our geographical situation gave us in the
                    purchase of the raw material. Since 1818, the manufactures of Saxony have
                    continued yearly to advance.</p>
                <p>They spin mule yarn of a low quality from Smyrna cotton of numbers from No. 16 to
                    No. 40, which they weave into thicksets, cotton velvets, and coloured pocket
                    handkerchiefs. They spin likewise a second quality of mule yarn, of numbers from
                    No. 36 to No. 54, from bowed or New Orleans cotton, mixed with Pernambuco or
                    Smyrna cotton, according as they wish the quality to be better or worse. This
                    yarn, which they work into cloths for garments, is unequal in the thread, but is
                    preferred by the Saxon weavers to the English second quality of mule yarn, the
                    cloth produced from it having, they think, more body. They import, however, a
                    considerable quantity of the second quality of yarn from England. There is very
                    little mule yarn of the first quality spun in Saxony. All the finer yarns, and
                    nearly the whole of the water twist required in their manufacture, are imported
                    from England. The yarn, whether spun at home or imported, is sold to the
                    weavers, who are scattered over the country, and by them is converted into
                    cloth, and disposed of at the weekly market of the nearest town.</p>
                <p>The cotton -manufacture of Prussia and the Rhenish provinces is rapidly
                    increasing, not only in the weaving of British yarns, but in spinning for
                    themselves. Works for this end are daily established. The use of the handmule is
                    now confined to Gladbach, Rhegdt, and Kussen, (left bank of the Rhine), where a
                    few mules are retained for spinning yarns from No. 8 to No. 12. The number of
                    persons now employed in spinning by power, including children, js estimated at
                    from six to seven thousand. The; work fifteen, or even sixteen hours a day.
                    Water power is scarce, and steam-engines have lately been obtained, both from
                    England and from Charenton. Wages in the Rhenish provinces are high; power-looms
                    have, in consequence, been introduced, and their number is daily increasing. The
                    cotton worked up in 1830 exceeded 35,000 bales.</p>
                <p>The great manufacture of Prussia, however, and one which is growing yearly, is
                    the weaving and dyeing ol British yarns, supplied chiefly through Elberfeldt.
                    Some of these goods have even been sent back to England foi shipment to the East
                    Indies. The quantity of English yarn imported into Prussia in 1831 to be thus
                    manufactured, was 15,600,000 pounds.</p>
                <p>Attempts have been made to introduce the cotton manufacture into Russia. A
                    spinning work was erected at St Petersburg more than twenty years ago; but being
                    a royal work, it is carried on at great expense. There has, we believe, been one
                    other mill built since in Russia; but the whole cotton spun in these works and
                    on the distaff, the only other mode of spinning they possess, is under 3000
                    bales. Russia is becoming, however, yearly a better customer for British yarns.
                    The quantity sent to that market in 1832 exceeded 19,000,000 pounds.</p>
                <p>Weaving is carried on in Moscow and its neighbourhood, and latterly along that
                    line of country stretching towards the Caspian Sea, particularly about Sarepta,
                    where a colony of Moravians is established. The goods produced are used chiefly
                    for the garments of the peasantry.</p>
                <p>There are eleven spinning factories in Lombardy; but some of them are mere cloaks
                    for facilitating smuggling. The hand-mules are fast disappearing; a few only
                    remaining in the neighbourhood of Como and the Lago Maggiore. The mills work
                    twelve hours per day. About 12,000 bales of cotton are used annually in the
                    manufacture. The wages are lower than in Switzerland; but a good spinner can
                    earn eight shillings per week, while a good labourer gets scarcely five.</p>
                <p>An enterprising manufacturer attempted to establish power-loom weaving near
                    Milan; but the want of mechanical skill occasioned a complete failure, and his
                    work is now standing still.</p>
                <p>A great deal of British yarn finds its way into the country, and is manufactured
                    into stockings and other articles. Their own yarns are woven into heavy tweels
                    (fus-tagne), and common cotton cloth. All other descriptions of cotton goods are
                    imported at a heavy duty, or smuggled, from Switzerland, England, and
                    France.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the encouragement given by the Piedmontese government to the
                    introduction of the cotton manufacture into that country, it is as yet of very
                    limited extent. There are a considerable number of hand-mules, but only four
                    spinning mills. There is a good deal of weaving done, particularly of mixed
                    linen and cotton goods. The wages are lower than in Switzerland.</p>
                <p>Cotton Wool grows in the Neapolitan dominions, and! water power for the movement
                    of machinery abounds; yet the cotton manufacture, although protected by heavy
                    import duties, is chiefly confined to the weaving of foreign yarns. Of these,
                    upwards of 2,000.000 pounds are worked up annually. Within these few years
                    spinning mills have begun to be introduced, and five spinning works have been
                    established. The rate of wages paid at one of these (at Salerno), said to be a
                    very profitable concern, is matter of interest: carders, 4s. to 4s. 6d. per
                    week; rovers and drawers, 3s. 2d.; and spinners, 6s. Weavers earn from 2s. to
                    2s. 6d. per week. With these aids to cheap production, there can be little doubt
                    that, if the government of Naples had been in a state to ensure the
                    capitalist<pb break="no" facs="nls:194752745" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2745-0421"/> the
                    enjoyment of the fruits of his undertaking, the country ought to have been able
                    to supply at least the cotton goods required for its own consumption.</p>
                <p>The government of the United States has evinced great anxiety to promote the
                    establishment of the cotton manufacture in the northern part of the union, but
                    without considering that manufactures are only valuable to a country in so far
                    as by their means the people can be supplied with the article cheaper than they
                    are able to procure it elsewhere. When a manufacturer requires the support of
                    bounties, or of laws prohibiting the importation of similar articles, it is a
                    consumption of the national wealth to foster a branch of industry incapable of
                    maintaining itself. There is no greater error in policy than this; and yet we
                    see it every day committed by young nations, when they endeavour to force
                    manufactures, before the circumstances of the country admit of such
                    undertakings; and by old nations, when they persist in the manufacture of
                    articles which, from natural disadvantages, they cannot produce at so low a
                    price as that at which they might purchase them from others.</p>
                <p>A manufacture, to attain a permanently profitable establishment in a country,
                    must grow up in it naturally. It must to a certain degree be indigenous, or
                    there must exist circumstances affording special advantages and facilities for
                    carrying it on. Manufacture may indeed be forced, in the same manner that grain
                    may be made to grow on soils ungenial to its culture; but in both cases the
                    application of capital will be unprofitable. Where industry is left to follow
                    its natural course, every country will betake itself to the production of those
                    articles which circumstances enable it most advantageously to supply; and the
                    consumers, in consequence, will be furnished with the articles they require at
                    the lowest possible cost. Every man’s means of consumption will, to the degree
                    in which the cost is reduced, be enlarged, and his command of the comforts and
                    enjoyments of life be extended.</p>
                <p>The favourite system of a country supplying every thing within itself, is alike
                    adverse to individual advantage and to the increase of national riches. A
                    division of employment among nations, founded upon existing local or accidental
                    circumstances, is as much in unison with the principles of sound political
                    science, and as much calculated to promote the general benefit, as is the
                    division of labour and of employments among individuals. It is not by
                    manufacturing every thing it consumes that a nation becomes rich, but by its
                    people being profitably employed.</p>
                <p>lf these principles be just, it must be a misapplication of American capital and
                    industry, to withdraw them from the cultivation of the soil and the circulation
                    of its products,—undertakings found to be highly profitable, and of boundless
                    extent,—and to force them into manufactures supported by monopolies and
                    bounties.</p>
                <p>There cannot be a doubt, that sooner or later the American legislators will be
                    compelled to relinquish the system they are pursuing. Even were they to continue
                    to shut their eyes to its injurious operation, they would find it impracticable,
                    in a community composed of federated states, with different local interests, to
                    prosecute branches of industry which require to be protected against foreign
                    competition. A federal compact, like a mercantile copartnery of individuals,
                    presumes a perfect equality and community of interests among all the parties
                    concerned; and, as in the case of a mercantile company, if any attempt were made
                    to render the interests of certain of the partners subservient to those of the
                    others, the concern would be immediately broken up, we may presume that, under
                    like circumstances, the result will be similar with the federal compact of the
                    United States. It would not be in the ordinary course of human affairs were the
                    people of the southern states to continue to purchase articles required for
                    their consumption at an advanced price, merely for the purpose of enabling the
                    people of the northern states to manufacture them. Free trade then, we conceive,
                    must accompany federated communities, wherever they are established; and we hail
                    with satisfaction the prospect now opening of the attainment of this object in
                    the western world, in every quarter of which the people appear to be resolving
                    themselves into federal governments. The benefits of unrestricted intercourse
                    between man and man, and between nation and nation, likely to be exhibited by
                    these countries on so extended a scale, will open men’s eyes everywhere to its
                    advantages; and the period, we think, is not distant, when we shall look back
                    with astonishment upon the wars we have carried on, the blood and treasure we
                    have wasted, and the heavy burdens with which we have saddled ourselves, to
                    acquire or retain colonial or commercial monopolies.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Since this article was written, accounts have
                    been received from America, that the state of South Carolina had issued a
                    declaration of its separation from the union, if the tariff laws are not
                    immediately repealed; that the government at Washington had published a counter
                    declaration asserting the supremacy of congress; and that both parties had
                    proceeded to make military preparations for maintaining the ground they had
                    respectively taken. It is, however, so clearly the interest of both to
                    accommodate matters by mutual concessions, that there can be little doubt that
                    the differ ’ ence will for the present be settled by a reduction of the tariff,
                    and probably a promise that it will be further progressively reduced. If the
                    union, however, is maintained, we cannot doubt that this law will ultimately be
                    wholly repealed.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the account we are to give of the rise of the American cotton manufacture, we
                    shall chiefly refer to the public documents, in which its growth is studiously
                    detailed, and the difficulties it has had to struggle with anxiously dwelt
                    upon.</p>
                <p>Before the year 1791, America possessed no manufacture except for domestic
                    production and family use. But in that year a cotton mill was erected in the
                    state of Rhode Island, as appears from a report of the secretary to the American
                    treasury, drawn up in 1810.</p>
                <p>This report further informs us, that another mill was erected in the same state
                    in 1795, and two more in the state of Massachusetts in 1803 and 1804; that
                    during the three succeeding years ten more were erected in Rhode Island, and one
                    in Connecticut, making together fifteen mills, working about 8000 spindles, and
                    producing about 300,000 pounds of yarn a year; that by a return which was made
                    at the date of the report, eighty-seven additional mills had been erected in the
                    end of the year 1809, sixty-two of which (forty-eight water and fourteen house
                    mills) were then in operation, and worked 31,000 spindles; and that the other
                    twenty-five mills were expected to be in operation in the course of the year
                    1810, and, together with the former ones (all of which are increasing their
                    machinery), would, by the estimate received, work more than 80,000 spindles at
                    the commencement of the year 1811.</p>
                <p>The capital required to carry on the manufacture on the best terms is estimated
                    at the rate of a hundred dollars per spindle; but it is believed that not more
                    than at the rate of sixty dollars is generally employed. Each spindle produces
                    annually about thirty-six pounds of yarn from forty-five pounds of cotton, and
                    the value of the yarn may be averaged as worth one dollar twelve and a half
                    cents per pound. Eight hundred spindles employ forty persons, viz. five men and
                    thirty-five women and children.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752758" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2758-0422"/>
                <p>The increase of carding and spinning cotton by machinery in establishments for
                    that purpose, exclusively of that done in private families, has been fourfold
                    during the last two years, (previous to 1810), and tenfold in three years.
                    Thirty-six of these mills, working 20,406 spindles, are situated within thirty
                    miles of Providence. The remainder are scattered all over the country.</p>
                <p>Morse, in the last edition of his <hi rend="italic">Geography,</hi> gives the
                    same account of the state of the cotton manufacture of America at the end of the
                    year 1810, as that contained in the public document above referred to; and adds,
                    that the cloths manufactured were bed-ticking, stripes and checks, ginghams,
                    cloths for shirts and sheetings, counterpanes, webbing and coach laçes, diapers,
                    jeans, vestings, cotton kerseymeres, fustians, cords, and velvets. From the
                    enumeration given in his work of the manufactures carried on in the separate
                    states of the union, it appears that the cotton manufacture is confined to the
                    states of ,Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York.</p>
                <p>We learn the farther progress of this manufacture from a report of the house of
                    representatives, presented in the spring session of 1816. The report states,</p>
                <p>“That the quantity of cotton manufactured in the year 1815 was 90,000 bales, a
                    quantity nearly equal to that used in the cotton manufacture of France: That the
                    quantity used in 1810 was 10,000 bales; in 1805, 1000 bales; and in 1800, 500
                    bales.” This statement, the committee say, they have no reason to doubt, nor
                    have they any to question the truth of the following succinct statement of the
                    capital which is employed, of the labour which it commands, and of the products
                    of that labour.</p>

                <p>The report proceeds to say, “that the manufacturers of cotton, in making
                    application to the national government for encouragement, have been induced to
                    do so for many reasons. They know that their establishments are new, and in
                    their infancy; and that they have to encounter a competition with foreign
                    establishments that have arrived at maturity, which are supported by a large
                    capital, and have from the government every protection that can be
                    required.”</p>
                <p>“The committee, from the views they have taken, consider the situation of the
                    manufacturing establishments to be perilous. Some have decreased, and others
                    have suspended business. A liberal encouragement will put them again into
                    operation with increased powers; but should it be withheld, they will be
                    prostrated. A capital of near thirty millions of dollars will become inactive,
                    the greater part of which will be a dead loss to the manufacturers. The
                    committee, from all the consideration they have given to this subject, are
                    deeply impressed with <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> conviction that the manufacturing
                    establishments of cotton wool are of real utility to the agricultural interest,
                    and that they contribute much to the prosperity of the union. Under the
                    influence of this conviction, the committee beg leave to tender respectfully,
                    with this report, the following resolution:</p>
                <p>“That from and after the 30th day of June next, in lien of the duties now
                    authorized by law, there be laid, levied, and collected, on cotton goods
                    imported into the United States and territories thereof, from any foreign
                    country whatever, <hi rend="italic">per centum ad valorem,</hi> being not less
                    than cents per square yard.”</p>
                <p>At the date of this report the duty upon cotton goods imported into the United
                    States was 15 per cent.; but before charging it, ten per cent, was added to the
                    invoice, and the duty thus raised to 16⅜ per cent. Upon the recommendation of
                    the committee, 10 per cent, more was imposed; and the whole being charged upon
                    L.110 for every L.100 of net value, brought it up to 27∣ per cent.</p>
                <p>Besides this, all cotton goods belovy 13⅜d. per yard were ordered to be rated at
                    13^d., and the difference added to the amount of the invoice before calculating
                    the duty.</p>
                <p>This regulation was meant as a particular encouragement to the home manufacture
                    of the coarser articles.</p>
                <p>New tariff acts were successively passed ⅛ 1824, 1828, and 1832, in each of which
                    the duty upon cotton goods imported was declared to be 25 per cent, <hi
                    rend="italic">ad valorem,</hi> rating the coarser fabrics in the same manner as
                    in 1816.</p>
                <p>The manufacture, under this protection against foreign competition, rapidly
                    increased. Power-loom works were erected; the most approved processes both in
                    spinning and weaving were adopted; and the business was generally successful.
                    The manufacture, however, is still almost wholly confined to the states of New
                    York, Rhode Island, and to the New England states. In the former of these it is
                    very extensive; and in the neighbourhood of the city of New York nine new mills
                    have been erected in the course of the last twelve months. Within the same
                    period, 500,000 spindles are supposed to have been added to the cotton
                    manufacture of the states. In both the spinning and weaving departments, the
                    processes are conducted on the most approved principles, and there seems only to
                    be wanting that skill and sleight of hand in the execution of the operations,
                    which are indispensable to securing either excellence of quality in the article,
                    or largeness of quantity in the product. These are not to be obtained until the
                    manufacturer acquires such a command of labourers as will enable him to enforce
                    a long and attentive early training of the workers.</p>
                <p>The Americans have skilful mechanics, and have in different departments of
                    industry introduced new machines, displaying much ingenuity and mechanical
                    contrivance. In cotton spinning they have introduced a new throstle, called
                    Danforth’s throstle, noticed in our account of spinning-machinery, in the early
                    part of this article.</p>
                <p>If the protecting duties can be maintained, the prosperity of the American cotton
                    manufacture will continue until its product exceeds the demand for the home
                    consumption. If the surplus cannot then be disposed of in foreign markets, the
                    manufacturers must experience similar distress to that of the cotton
                    manufacturers of France from the year 1827 to 1832. The circumstances, however,
                    giving rise to this state of things in the two countries are different. In
                    America they are of a temporary character, and will quickly pass away. Possessed
                    of the natural advantages for a successful prosecution of this description of
                    employment, the northern states of the union only require population to become
                    the seat of extensive manufactures.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>I .</p>
                <p>We have now conduded our account of the cotton manufacture; a branch of industry
                    which, next to the cultivation of the soil, furnishes a more extensive
                    employment to labour and capital than any of the other occupations of man. Its
                    history during the short period it has existed in this country furnishes matter
                    of varied interest. We see in it the necessities and energies of a free people
                    calling into active operation the dormant ingenuity of the artisan, and giving
                    birth to a succession of the most striking, inventions and discoveries for
                    abridging or superseding human labour. As an immediate result of this change, we
                    see a manufacture transplanted from India, where it had existed for ages, to
                    become the staple of our country, the source of extraordinary and unexampled
                    wealth. We see the effects of this achievement of art give animation to our
                    commerce and agriculture,' and contribute to the general amelioration and
                    condition of every class of the community. We trust that we are not deceiving
                    ourselves when we add, that we are also able to discover, in our present
                    circumstances, elements of that moral improvement of our population, without
                    which we shall look in vain for any permanent addition to the prosperity and
                    happiness of the nation.</p>
                <p>But the effects of the altered mode of production which our mechanical inventions
                    have occasioned are not confined to Great Britain. The relative situation of
                    different countries has been changed. While some of them remain in their former
                    state, in others the power of production has been increased in an enormous
                    ratio. This, however, will not be injurious to the progress of the whole. In
                    each country, industry, if left to itself, will take that direction which the
                    peculiar circumstances render most beneficial. New fields of employment will be
                    explored and appropriated, and increasing commercial intercourse will diffuse
                    the blessings to each people, in proportion to their peculiar wants, and their
                    peculiar means of purchasing their gratification. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. h.
