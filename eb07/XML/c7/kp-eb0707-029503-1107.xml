                    descended from Sir Thomas Cook, lord mayor of London, was born in 1506, and is
                    supposed to have been educated at Cambridge. He was so eminent for his learning,
                    piety, and prudence, that the guardians of King Edward VÌ. appointed him chief
                    instructor in learning to that prince, whose manners it was also his business to
                    form. He had four daughters; and being resolved to have sons by education, in
                    case he should have none by birth, he taught his daughters those lessons by
                    night which he had instilled into the prince by day; nor were his endeavours
                    fruitless, as they proved learned in Greek and Latin, and were equally
                    distinguished for virtue, piety, and good fortune. Mildred was married to the
                    great Lord Burghley; Anna to Sir Nicholas Bacon, lord keeper of the great seal;
                    Elizabeth to Sir John Russell, son and heir of Francis earl of Bedford; and
                    Catharine to Sir Henry Killigrew. Sir Anthony lived in exile during the
                    persecution under Mary; but having returned on the accession of Queen Elizabeth,
                    he spent the rest of his days in peace and honour, dying in 1576.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cook,</hi><hi rend="italic">Captain James,</hi> one of the
                    ablest and most celebrated of navigators, was the son of James Cook, a labourer
                    or servant in husbandry, and supposed to have been a native of the county of
                    Northumberland, was born on the 27th of Oetober 1728, at the village of Marton,
                    in the north riding of Yorkshire. He was one of nine children, and he received
                    the rudiments of his education from the schooloustress of the village; but
                    afterwards, on his father’s removal to Great Ayton, he was, at the expense of Mr
                    Skottow, his father’s employer, put to a day-school. where he was instructèd in
                    writing and in a few of the elementary rules of arithmetic. Before the age of
                    thirteen he was bound as apprentice to Mr W. Sanderson, haberdasher or
                    shopkeeper at Straiths, about ten miles from Whitby; but some disagreement
                    having taken place between him and his master, he indulged his own inclination
                    in binding himself as apprentice to Messrs Walkers of Whitby, who had several
                    vessels in the coal trade; and after serving a few years in the situation of a
                    common sailor, he was at length appointed mate of one of Mr Walker’s ships.
                    During this period it is not recollected that he exhibited any thing peculiar
                    either in ability or in conduct.</p>
                <p>Early in the year 1755, when hostilities broke out between France and England,
                    Cook entered on board the Eagle of sixty guns, to which vessel Sir Hugh Palliser
                    was soon afterwards appointed, and distinguished himself as an active and
                    diligent seaman; and his promotion was forwarded by a letter of recommendation,
                    which, at the request of several neighbours, was written by Mr Osbaldeston,
                    member for Scarborough, in Mr Cook’s favour. On the 15th of May 1759 he was
                    appointed master of the Mercury, which soon afterwards sailed for America, and
                    joined the fleet under Sir Charles Saunders at the memorable siege of Quebce.
                    His interest with the admiralty appears even then to have been strong; for, on
                    Mr Osbaldeston’s letter, he was appointed master of the Grampus sloop; but the
                    proper master having unexpectedly returned to her, the appointment did not take
                    place. Four days afterwards he was appointed master of the Garland; but upon
                    inquiry it was found that he could not join her, as the vessel had already
                    sailed; and the next day, 15th May 1759, he was appointed master of the Mereury.
                    On this occasion he was recommended by Captain Palliser to a difficult and
                    dangerous service, namely, to take the soundings of the river St Lawrence,
                    between the island of Orleans and the north shore, which he performed in the
                    most complete manner; and soon afterwards he was employed to survey the most
                    dangerous parts of the river below Quebec. These were his first efforts with the
                    peneil. After this expedition he was, on the 22d of September, appointed master
                    of the Northumberland, stationed at Halifax, where he first read Euclid, and
                    applied himself to astronomy and other branches of science. In the year 1762, he
                    was on board the Northumberland, assisting at the recapture of Newfoundland; and
                    towards the latter end of the same year he returned to England, and married, at
                    Barking in Essex, Miss Elizabeth Batts. Early in 1763, when Admiral, then
                    Captain, Greaves was appointed governor of Newfoundland, Cook <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194751120" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1120-0296"/>went out with him to survey
                    the coasts of that’island. At the end of the season he returned to England; but,
                    in the beginning of 1764, Sir Hugh Palliser being appointed governor of
                    Newfoundland and Labrador, Cook accompanied him in the capacity of surveyor, and
                    had the Granville schooner to attend him “while employed on that station. In
                    this situation he continued till 1767.</p>
                <p>While Cook remained on this station, he had an opportunity of exhibiting publicly
                    a specimen of his progress in the study of astronomy, in a short paper printed
                    in the 57th volume of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi>
                    entitled “An Observation of an Eelipse of the Sun at the Island of Newfoundland,
                    5th August 1766, with the longitude of the place of observation deduced from
                    it.” His observation was made at one of the Burgeo islands, near Cape Ray, in
                    north latitude 47° 56' 19"; and by comparing it with an observation of Dr
                    Hornsby at Oxford, it appeared to have been accurately done; so that Cook
                    obtained the character of an able astronomer.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, a spirit for geographical discovery, which had gradually
                    declined since the beginning of the seventeenth century, began to revive. Two
                    voyages of this kind had been performed in the reign of George IL, the one under
                    Captain Middleton, the other by Captains Moore and Smyth, with a view to
                    discover a north-west passage through Hudson’s Bay to the East Indies. Two
                    others, under Captains Byron, Wallis, and Carteret, bad been undertaken by order
                    of his majesty George III., soon after the conclusion of the peace in 1763; but
                    before the return of these navigators, who were ordered to sail round the world,
                    another voyage was resolved upon for astronomical purposes. As it had been
                    calculated that a transit of Venus over the sun’s disk would happen in 1767, a
                    long memorial to his majesty was presented by the Royal Society, in which they
                    set forth the great importance of making proper observations on this phenomenon,
                    and the regard which had been paid to it by the different courts of Europe; and
                    entreated, among other things, that a vessel might be fitted out at the expense
                    of government, for conveying proper persons to some of the Friendly Islands, in
                    order to make the necessary observations. This request being complied with on
                    the part of his majesty, Alexander Dalrymple, Esq. an eminent member of the
                    Royal Society, was appointed to take the command of the bark appropriated for
                    the purpose. In the execution of the project, however, an unexpected difficulty
                    occurred. Mr Dalrymple, sensible of the impossibility of guiding a vessel
                    through unknown and dangerous seas without any proper command over the crew,
                    demanded a brevet commission as captain of the vessel, in the same manner as had
                    formerly been granted to Dr Halley in a voyage of discovery made by him. But
                    this commission Sir Edward Hawke absolutely refused to sign, declaring, when
                    pressed upon the subject, that he would rather suffer his right hand to be cut
                    off, than trust any of his majesty’s ships to a person who had not been properly
                    bred to the service; and in this proceeding lie was justified by the mutinous
                    and disorderly behaviour of Dr Halley’s crew, who, denying the legality of his
                    authority over them, had involved him in a very disagreeable dispute, which was
                    attended with pernicious consequences. Mr Dalrymple, on the other hand, being
                    equally determined in his refusal to proceed without the authority in question,
                    there was a necessity for finding some person of science who might also be free
                    from the objection urged by Sir Edward Hawke. Mr Cook, therefore, was proposed
                    by Mr Stephens, and this recommendation being seconded by Sir Hugh Palliscr, he
                    was immediately appointed to direct the expedition; and on this occasion lie was
                    promoted to the rank of lieutenant in his majesty’s service.</p>
                <p>Mr Cook’s commission as lieutenant was dated the 25th of May 1768, and a vessel
                    of 370 tons, named the Endeavour, was provided for him; but whilst the necessary
                    preparations were making for the voyage, Captain Wallis returned. As it had been
                    recommended to this gentleman to fix upon a proper place for making the
                    astronomical observations, he accordingly fixed upon the island named by him
                    George’s Island, and since known by the name of Otaheite or Tahiti; judging also
                    that Port Royal harbour would afford an eligible situation. This proposal being
                    accepted, directions were accordingly given to Cook, with whom Mr Charles Green
                    was joined in the astronomical part; the latter having been assistant to Dr
                    Bradley in the royal observatory at Grcenwich, and thus considered as every way
                    qualified for the office. The lieutenant was likewise accompanied by Mr
                    (afterwards Sir Joseph) Banks, Dr Solander, and others. The principal design of
                    the voyage, as has already been hinted, was to make observations on the transit
                    of Venus; but this being executed, Mr Cook was directed to make further
                    discoveries in the Pacific Ocean. On the 30th of July 1768 he set sail on this
                    expedition; and it is sufficient to observe here, that throughout the whole Mr
                    Cook approved himself an able seaman, and, from his behaviour both to his own
                    people and to the savage nations whom he occasionally visited, he showed a
                    strict regard to the rules of justice and humanity. On his first arrival at
                    Otaheite, regulations were drawn up for the guidance of his people, which he
                    took care to cause to be punctually obeyed. On erecing the observatory in order
                    to perform the astronomical operations, an accident happened which had nearly
                    disconcerted the whole scheme. This was the loss of the quadrant, which had been
                    stolen by some of the natives; but it was recovered, chiefly through the
                    exertions of Mr Banks, and the observations were accordingly made. Searcely had
                    this been accomplished, however, when another theft of the natives demanded the
                    most serious consideration of the command-cr. Some of them taking advantage of
                    the attention of the officers being otherwise engaged, seized the opportunity of
                    breaking into one of the store-rooms, and stole therefrom a bag of spike-nails
                    of no less than a hundredweight. This was a most important affair; for as these
                    nails were of great estimation among the natives, the possession of such a
                    quantity must undoubtedly have greatly lessened their value, and thus rendered
                    provisions of every kind much dearer on the island than before. One of the
                    thieves therefore being discovered, was punished with two hundred lashes;
                    notwithstanding which he obstinatelyre-fused to discover any of his accomplices.
                    Repeated thefts were committed afterwards, and it required all the wisdom and
                    resolution of Mr Cook to conduct himself in a proper manner. At last, after a
                    stay of three months, when preparing to take his leave, the most disagreeable
                    occurrence which he had hitherto met with took place. This was the desertion of
                    two of his people, who, having married young women of the country, determined to
                    take up their residence therein. Mr Cook was now obliged to seize some of the
                    chiefs, and to inform them that they could not obtain their liberty unless the
                    deserters were recovered. This at last produced the desired effect; the
                    deserters were given up, and Cook set sail, along with Tupia, who had formerly
                    been prime minister to Oberea, a princess of the island, and a boy of thirteen
                    years of age, both of whom were desirous of accompanying him to England.</p>
                <p>Whilst Cook proceeded to visit some other of the South Sea islands, Tupia
                    occasionally served as an interpreter. On his arrival in New Zealand, Mr Cook
                    found the people extremely hostile and insolent. On the first meeting, one of
                    the natives having threatened to dart his lance into the boat, was shot dead;
                    another having carried off Mr <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751133"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1133-0297"/>Green’s hanger, was fired at with small shot; and
                    upon his still refusing to restore it, was fired at with ball and killed. This,
                    however, produced very little effect upon the rest, who attempted to make an
                    attack upon them, till several muskets were fired with small shot, which wounded
                    three or four more. Next day the commander having determined to force some of
                    the natives on board, in order to conciliate their affections by kind treatment,
                    directed his men to follow two canoes which he perceived under way before him.
                    One made her escape, but the other not observing the boats in pursuit, was
                    overtaken, upon which the savages plied their oars so briskly, that the ship’s
                    boats were not able to keep up with them. Tupia, whose language the New
                    Zealanders understood, called to them to return, with assurances that no harm
                    should be done them; but they continued their flight without regarding him. A
                    musket was then fired over their heads with a view to intimidate them; but upon
                    this they prepared to fight, and on the approach of the' boats began the attack
                    with so much vigour, that the lieutenant’s people were obliged to fire upon them
                    with ball, by which four out of seven who were in the boat were killed, and the
                    other three jumped into the water, and were taken on board.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the disaster just mentioned, to which the three New Zealanders
                    who were taken on board had been witnesses, they were toon conciliated, and
                    began to sing with a degree of taste that surprised the English gentlemen. They
                    were boys, the oldest about nineteen and the youngest about eleven; but no
                    kindness which could be shown them proved in any degree effectual in bringing
                    about a reconciliation with the rest. On the contrary, having perceived the ship
                    in some distress, they instantly showed a disposition to make an attack; and
                    from this they were only prevented by the firing of a four-pounder charged with
                    grape-shot. But even this did not produce any permanent effect; another attack
                    was determined upon, and would undoubtedly have been made, had not Tupia
                    informed them, that if they persisted in their attempt, the arms of their
                    adversaries, like thunder, would destroy every one of them. This was enforced by
                    the fire of another four-pounder with grape-shot, which, spreading wide in the
                    water, terrified them to such a degree that they began to paddle away as fast as
                    possible. Notwithstanding this, however, some intercourse began to take place;
                    but in every instance the New Zealanders manifested their hostility and
                    treachery in such a manner as showed that they were not to be gained by fair
                    means. At last an attempt to carry off Tayeto, Tupia’s boy, rendered it
                    absolutely necessary to fire upon them, in order to rescue him from certain
                    destruction, some of the savages having got him into a canoe, where they held
                    him down by violence. In consequence of this one of the savages was killed on
                    the spot, and several more wounded, by the discharge of muskets from the boats;
                    but Tayeto recovered his liberty, jumped into the water, and swam to the ship.
                    Some partial intercourse again took place; but still it appeared that the innate
                    rancour of these savages was not to be subdued by any fair means; and it was
                    only by the powerful arguments of cannon and musketry that they could be kept
                    from attempting to do mischief.</p>
                <p>From the account of this voyage published by Dr Hawkesworth, it appears that a
                    considerable number of savages perished in a similar manner; and they seem to
                    have manifested a more hostile behaviour than afterwards. On these melancholy
                    occasions, however, it must be observed to the honour of Cook, that his humanity
                    was eminently conspicuous beyond that of the common people, who all along showed
                    as much inclination to destroy the natives as a sportsman does to kill the game
                    he pursues.</p>
                <p>Whilst Mr Cook coasted the islands of New Zealand, he was sometimes in the most
                    imminent danger of being shipwrecked. In the latitude of 35° south, and in the
                    midst of summer in that climate, he met with such a gale of wind as he scarcely
                    ever experienced before; so that he was no less than three weeks in getting ten
                    leagues to the westward, and two more before he could get thirty leagues
                    farther. Fortunately, however, they were all this time, a considerable way from
                    land, otherwise it is probable that the storm must have proved fatal.</p>
                <p>Having spent six months in circumnavigating and fully exploring the islands of
                    New Zealand, he sailed thence on the 31st of March 1770. It must be observed,
                    however, that the extreme hostility manifested by the inhabitants in that part
                    of the island where he first arrived was not universally diffused; on the
                    contrary, a friendly intercourse was for a long time maintained with those abput
                    Queen Charlotte’s Sound. From New Zealand he proceeded to New Holland, and on
                    the 2tìth of April came in sight of Botany Bay. Here all their endeavours to
                    induce the natives to have any intercourse with the ship’s company proved
                    ineffectual, though happily there was no blood spilt in any quarrel.</p>
                <p>During their navigation round New Holland, the coasts of which are full of
                    dangerous rocks and shoals, our navigators were brought into a more perilous
                    situation than ever. This happened on the 10th of June 1770, as they pursued
                    their course from Trinity Bay, and nearly in the latitude assigned to the
                    islands discovered by Quiros. At that time they had the advantage of a fine
                    breeze and a clear moonlight; and in standing off from six till near nine
                    o'clock, the ship had deepened her water from fourteen to twenty-one fathoms;
                    but whilst the navigators were at supper, it shoaled to twelve, ten, and eight
                    fathoms in the space of a few minutes. Every thing was then ready for putting
                    the ship about, when they suddenly got into deep water again, and continued in
                    twenty and twenty-one fathoms for some time, so that the gentlemen went to bed
                    in perfect security. A little before eleven, however, the water shoaled at once
                    from twenty to seventeen fathoms; and before the lead could be heaved again, the
                    ship struek, and remained immoveable, excepting in as far as she was heaved up
                    and down, and dashed against the rocks, by the surge. The alarm was now
                    universal, and not indeed without the greatest reason. It appeared that the
                    vessel had been lifted over the ledge of a rock, and lay in a hollow within it,
                    where there were in some places from three to four fathoms water, and in others
                    scarcely as many feet. The sheathing boards were disjoined, and floating round
                    the ship in great numbers; and at last the false keel was also destroyed, while
                    the rock kept grating her bottom with such force as to be heard in the fore
                    store-room. It was now necessary to lighten the ship as much as possible, and
                    this was done with all expedition to the amount of more than fifty tons. In the
                    morning of the 11th of June they discovered the land at about eight leagues
                    distance, without any island between on which they could have been sent ashore
                    in the event of the ship going to pieces. To add to their distress, the ship
                    drew so much water that it was with difficulty kept under with three pumps.
                    Lastly, it appeared that even the rising of the tide, on which they had
                    ultimately depended for relief, was insufficient to answer the purpose, as the
                    day-tidefell considerably short of that in the night-time. Having therefore
                    lightened the ship still further, by throwing out every thing that could
                    possibly be spared, they waited with patience for the next tide; when, after
                    incredible exertion, the ship righted, and they got her over the ledge of the
                    rock into deep water. By continual labour, however, the men were at last so much
                    exhausted that they could not stand to the pumps <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194751146" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1146-0298"/>more than five or six minutes
                    at a time; after which they threw themselves flat on the deck, though a stream
                    of water between three and four inches deep ran over it; and in this situation
                    they lay till others, exhausted as well as themselves, took their places, on
                    which they started, up again, and renewed their exertions. In this dreadful
                    extremity Mr Monkhouse, a midshipman, proposed the expedient of“ſotliering” the
                    ship, as it is called, by which means he said that he had seen a merchant vessel
                    brought from Virginia to London after she had sprung a leak which admitted more
                    than four feet water in an hour. The expedient being approved of, it was put in
                    execution in the following manner. He took a lower studding-sail, and having
                    mixed a large quantity of oakum and wool together, stitched them down by
                    handfuls as lightly as possible, the whole being afterwards spread over with the
                    dung of the sheep and other filth. The sail was then hauled under the ship’s
                    bottom by means of ropes, which kept it extended. When it came under the leak,
                    the wool and oakum, with part of the sail, were forced inwards by the pressure
                    of the water, which thus prevented its own ingress in so effectual a manner,
                    that one pump instead of three was now sufficient to keep it under. Thus they
                    got the ship into a convenient port on the coast of New Holland, where they had
                    an opportunity of repairing the injury. But here they discovered that their
                    preservation had not been owing entirely to the expedient above mentioned; for
                    one of the holes was in a great measure filled up by a piece of rock which had
                    broken off and stuck in it; and this hole was so large,’ that had it not been
                    filled up in the manner just mentioned, they must undoubtedly have perished
                    notwithstanding all the assistance that could have been derived from the
                    pumps.</p>
                <p>The dangers they sustained in navigating this coast were innumerable, insomuch
                    that for nearly three months they were obliged to have a man constantly in the
                    chains heaving the lead. They were always entangled among rocks and shoals,
                    which could not have failed to destroy a less experienced navigator; and even Mr
                    Cook, with all his sagacity, could not sometimes have extricated himself, had it
                    not been for the favourable interposition of natural events, which no human
                    penetration could foresee, nor have the least dependence upon.</p>
                <p>From the time they quitted the coast of New Holland till their arrival at
                    Batavia, in the island of Java, our navigators met with no other danger than
                    what is common in sea voyages. They were obliged to stay for some time at this
                    place to repair their damages; and, on viewing the condition of the ship, they
                    found they had more reason than ever to admire the manner in which they had been
                    preserved. Both the false keel and main keel were greatly injured; great part of
                    the sheathing was torn off; several of the planks were much damaged, and among
                    these there were two, and half of a third, which, for six feet in length, were
                    not above the eighth part of an inch in thickness, besides being penetrated with
                    worms quite to the timbers. Here the crew were excessively annoyed by sickness,
                    which obliged them to remain much longer than they would otherwise have done;
                    and it is worthy of notice that every one of the crew was ill excepting the
                    sail-maker, an old man between seventy and eighty years of age, who contrived to
                    get drunk every night. Poor Tupia, with his boy Tayeto, fell sacrifiées to the
                    unhealthiness of the climate, as well as the surgeon, three seamen, and Mr
                    Green’s servant. Nor did the evil stop here; for on their setting out from
                    Batavia, the seeds of disease which had been received there broke out in the
                    most violent and fatal manner, insomuch that in the course of about six weeks
                    there died one of Mr Banks’s assistants, Mr Sporing, Air Parkinson, natural
                    history painter, Mr Green the astronomer, the boatswain, carpenter, and mate, Mr
                    Monkhouse the midshipman, the corporal of the marines, two of the carpenter’s
                    crew, and nine seamen. Even the jolly old sail-maker could now hold out no
                    longer; but whether his death might not in some measure be attributed to his
                    being less plentifully supplied with liquors than formerly, would have deserved
                    inquiry. These unfortunate events made a considerable impression upon Mr Cook’s
                    mind, and perhaps induced him to direct his attention to those methods of
                    preserving the health of seamen, which he afterwards put into execution with so
                    much success. After touching at St Helena, they continued their voyage for
                    England, where they arrived on the 11th of June 1771; and on the 29th of August
                    the same year his majesty testified his approbation of Mr Cook’s conduct, by
                    appointing him a captain in the navy. On this occasion Mr Cook wished to have
                    been advanced to the rank of post-captain, which, though not more profitable
                    than the other, is more honourable; but this being inconsistent with the rules
                    of preferment in the navy, the Earl of Sandwich, at that time at the head of the
                    admiralty, could not agree to it.</p>
                <p>Captain Cook was not allowed to remain long inactive. The idea of a southern
                    continent had long been entertained, and Mr Dalrymple had re-directed the
                    attention of the public towards the question, by his historical collection of
                    voyages to the Paeifie Ocean, published in two quarto volumes, one in 1770, and
                    the other in 1771. To determine the matter finally, Captain Cook was again sent
                    out; the object of this voyage being not merely to settle the question just
                    mentioned, but to extend the geography of the globe to its utmost limits. That
                    the undertaking might be carried on with the greater advantage, it was
                    determined to employ two ships, upon the choice and equipment of which the
                    utmost attention was bestowed. The successful voyage which had already been made
                    in the Endeavour suggested the idea of that ship being a proper model for the
                    two which were to be sent out; and the opinion of Lord Sandwich concurring with
                    the general idea, two vessels, constructed by the same person who had built the
                    Endeavour, were purchased for the voyage. These were about fourteen or sixteen
                    months old at the time they were purchased; and, in the opinion of Captain Cook,
                    they were as fit for the purpose as if they had been but newly built. The larger
                    of the two, of 462 tons burden, was named the Resolution, and the smaller, of
                    336 tons, had the name of the Adventure; the complement of men on board the
                    former, of which Captain Cook was commander, being a hundred and twelve, and on
                    board the latter, commanded by Mr Tobias Furneaux, eighty-one. In their
                    equipment, every article which could be supposed necessary was procured, and
                    every circumstance likely to contribute to the success of the voyage was
                    attended to in the most scrupulous manner. Mr Hodges, an excellent landscape
                    painter, was engaged to make drawingsand paintings of such objects as required
                    them; Mr John Reinhold Forster, with his son, were both engaged, in order to
                    explore and collect the natural history of the countries through which they
                    passed; and, lastly, Air William Wales and Mr William Bayley were engaged by the
                    board of longitude to make celestial observations. The latter were furnished
                    with the best instruments of every kind, and among these with four time-pieces,
                    three constructed by Air Arnold, and one by Air Kendal upon Mr Harrison’s
                    principles.</p>
                <p>At Plymouth Captain Cook received his instructions, which were not only to sail
                    round the globe, but to sail round it in high southern latitudes, and to make
                    such traverses as might finally resolve the question concerning the southern
                    continent. In pursuance of these instructions he set sail on the 13th of July
                    1772, and on the 29th of the same month arrived at Madeira. He reached the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194751159" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1159-0299"/> Cape of Good Hope
                    without having a single man sick; but having left it and kept on his course to
                    the southward, he soon began to meet with cold and stormy weather, by which he
                    lost almost the whole of his live stock of sheep, hogs, and geese. The bad
                    effects of this stormy weather upon the men were guarded against by an addition
                    to their clothing, and by giving them a dram on particular occasions. On the 6th
                    of December, being in the latitude of 50° 40', he fell in with islands of ice,
                    and continued among them in various latitudes till the 17th of January 1773,
                    when he set sail for New Zealand, which he reached on the 27th.</p>
                <p>The reception of our navigator by the New Zealanders was now much more friendly
                    than in the former voyage, and there were no contests with the natives; nor did
                    Captain Cook observe any of those whom he had seen before, neither was there the
                    smallest remembrance of former hostilities. Having remained here until the 7th
                    of June, the navigators set sail for Otaheite; but during the voyage the crews
                    of both ships were attacked by the scurvy. Those of the Adventure were in a very
                    sickly state; the cook died, and twenty-eight of her best men were rendered
                    incapable of duty. On board the Resolution matters were much better; and the
                    only reason that could be conjectured for the difference was, that the people of
                    the Adventure had been in a habit of body more inclined to the scurvy than those
                    of the Resolution, and had eaten fewer vegetables. Whilst he remained at New
                    Zealand the captain had discovered a tree which greatly resembled the American
                    black spruce; and being persuaded that it would be attended with effects equally
                    salutary on the health of the people, he employed them in brewing beer from it.
                    This was done whilst they continued at Dusky Bay, in order to supply the want of
                    vegetables, which were not to be procured there; but on removing to Queen
                    Charlotte’s Sound they were more fortunate. Captain Cook himself went to look
                    out for antiscorbutic vegetables, and in a very short time returned with a
                    boat-load of scurvy-grass, celery, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> These were
                    boiled with the peas and wheat; and though some of the people disliked them at
                    first, they soon became so sensible of their good effects that they cheerfully
                    followed the example of the rest; and the freedom of the crew from the scurvy
                    and other distempers was by every one attributed to the New Zealand spruce beer
                    and vegetables.</p>
                <p>During this voyage Captain Cook had another narrow escape from shipwreck. Having
                    been becalmed at the distance of half a league from a reef of rocks near
                    Osnaburg island, it was found necessary to send out the boats in order to tow
                    off’the ships; but this was found impossible. The calm continuing, and the
                    situation of the navigators becoming every moment more dangerous, the captain
                    attempted to get through an opening in the reef which he had judged practicable;
                    but on approaching it, he found that there was not sufficient depth of water, at
                    the same time that the draught of the tide through it forced the ship thither in
                    a manner scarcely to be resisted. One of the warping machines, with about four
                    hundred fathoms of rope, was then ordered out, but did not produce any effect.
                    They were within two cables length of the breakers, and yet no bottom could be
                    found for casting anchor. Having no other resource, however, they did drop an
                    anchor; but before it took hold, the Resolution was in less than three fathoms
                    water, and struck at every fall of the sea, which broke with violence close
                    under her stern, threatening destruction to every one on board. At last the tide
                    ceasing to act in the same direction, the boats were ordered to try to tow off
                    the vessel; and in this, being assisted by the land breeze, which fortunately
                    sprung up at that instant, they with much labour succeeded.</p>
                <p>Having employed a considerable time in the South Sea islands, Captain Cook
                    returned to New Zealand, and thence set sail-for the southern part of the
                    continent of America; and having explored all the islands in the neighbourhood,
                    he returned to England, where he arrived in safety on the 30th of July 1774,
                    having been absent three years and eighteen days, and in all that time lost only
                    one man, who died of a consumption, probably begun before he set out on the
                    voyage.</p>
                <p>The reception which our navigator now met with was in all respects suited to his
                    merit. He was immediately raised to the rank of post captain, and soon
                    afterwards unanimously elected a member of the Royal Society; from which he
                    received the prize of the gold medal for the best experimental paper which had
                    appeared throughout the year.</p>
                <p>The third voyage of this celebrated navigator was not undertaken by any express
                    command of his majesty. Captain Cook had already done so much, that it was
                    thought reasonable he should now spend the remainder of his life in
                    tranquillity; and in order to enable him to do so in a comfortable manner,
                    besides his rank of post-captain in the navy, he was also, made a captain in
                    Greenwich. Still, however, there were some points in the science of geography
                    which had very much engaged the attention of the public, and which were indeed
                    of such importance as to become a national concern. These were to discover the
                    connection between Asia and America, and to determine whether there was not a
                    possibility of shortening the passage to the East Indies by sailing round the
                    northern parts of the continents of Europe and Asia. Many attempts, indeed, had
                    already been made to explore a passage, by various navigators of different
                    nations; but all of them had failed, and had left the point still undetermined.
                    An act of parliament had been passed in 1745, by which a reward of L.20,000 was
                    held out to the ships of any of his majesty’s subjects which should accomplish
                    this important voyage, but without mentioning any thing of those belonging to
                    his majesty; and this reward was further confined to the discovery of a
                    north-west passage to the East Indies through Hudson’s Bay. In the year 1776,
                    however, both the errors just mentioned were corrected. It was now enacted,
                    “That if any ship belonging to any of his majesty’s subjects, or to his majesty,
                    shall find out, and sail through, any passage by sea between the Atlantic and
                    Pacific Oceans, in any direction or parallel of the northern hemisphere, to the
                    northward of the 52d degree of northern latitude, the owners of such ships if
                    belonging to any of his majesty’s subjects, or the commanders, officers, and
                    seamen, of such ships belonging to his majesty, shall receive, as a reward for
                    such discovery, the sum of L.20,000.”</p>
                <p>It was not, as has already been hinted, deemed proper to solicit Captain Cook to
                    undergo fresh dangers by undertaking a voyage of this kind; nevertheless, as he
                    was universally looked upon as the fittest person in the kingdom for the
                    purpose, the eyes of all were tacitly fixed upon him; he was consulted on every
                    thing relating to it, and solicited to name the person whom he judged most
                    proper to conduct it. To determine this point, Captain Cook, Sir Hugh Palliser,
                    and Mr Stephens, were invited to dinner at the house of Lord Sandwich; where,
                    besides the consideration of the proper officer for conducting the expedition,
                    many things were said concerning the nature of the design. They enlarged upon
                    its grandeur and dignity, its consequences to navigation and science, and the
                    completeness it would give to the whole system of discoveries; until at last
                    Captain Cook became so much inflamed by the representations of the importance of
                    the voyage, that he started up, and declared that he would <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194751172" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1172-0300"/>conduct it himself. This was
                    what tĩìe parties present had desired, and probably expected; his offer was
                    therefore instantly laid before the king, and Captain Cook was appointed
                    commander of the expedition on the 10th of February 1776. At the same time it
                    was agreed, that upon his return from the voyage, he should be rest.ored to his
                    place at Greenwich; and if no vacancy occurred during the interval, that the
                    officer who succeeded him should resign in his favour. The instructions lie now
                    received were, that he should attempt the high latitudes between the continents
                    of Asia and America, and if possible return to England along the northern coasts
                    of Asia and Europe. This was most probably the result of the captain’s own
                    deliberations, and what had been suggested by him to Lord Sandwich and other
                    people in power. He was particularly desired to sail first into the Pacific
                    Ocean through the chain of newly-discovered islands which lie had lately
                    visited. After having crossed the equator, and passed into the northern parts of
                    the ocean just mentioned, he was then to hold such a course as might tend to
                    settle many interesting points of geography, and produce some intermediate
                    discoveries, before he arrived at the main scene of operations. With regard to
                    this principal object, he was ordered, immediately on his arrival on the coast
                    of New Albion, to proceed northward as far as the latitude of sixty-five
                    degrees, without losing any time in exploring creeks or rivers previously to his
                    arrival in that latitude; and for his further encouragement, the act of 1745,
                    offering a premium for the discovery of the passage in question, was amended in
                    the manner above mentioned. That nothing might be wanting which could promote
                    the success of the expedition, Lieutenant Pickersgill was sent out, in 1776,
                    with directions to explore the coasts of Baffin’s Bay; and the next year
                    Lieutenant Young was commissioned not only to examine the western parts of that
                    bay, but to endeavour to find a passage on that side from the Atlantic to the
                    Pacific Ocean. Nothing, however, was performed by either of these gentlemen
                    which could in the least promote Captain Cook’s success. Two vessels were
                    provided, as in the former voyage, namely, the Resolution and the Discovery; the
                    command of the former being given to Captain Cook, and of the latter to Captain
                    Charles Clerke. The only thing in which the appointment of the Discovery
                    differed from that of the Resolution was, that the former had no marine officer
                    on board. Every degree of attention was bestowed, as in the former voyage, upon
                    the proper victualling and other necessaries for the two ships; and that the
                    inhabitants of those countries which our navigator intended to visit might
                    derive some permanent benefit from intercourse with the navigators, it was
                    determined to send abroad a breed of domestic animals, and likewise a quantity
                    of useful seeds, to be left in proper places. With this view, a bull, two cows
                    with their calves, and several sheep, together with hay and corn for their
                    subsistence, were put on board; and it was likewise proposed to take in others
                    at the Cape of Good Hope. A large assortment of iron tools and trinkets was also
                    sent out; and, in short, every thing that was judged proper either to conciliate
                    the good will of the natives, or to prove ser- -viceable to them, was provided
                    for the voyage, as well as every convenience for the ships’ companies. In the
                    former voyage Captain Cook had brought along with him a native of one of the
                    South Sea islands, named Ornai, who resided in England during the interval
                    between the second and third voyages, and was now happy at getting an
                    opportunity of returning to his own country. Though he could by no means
                    complain of the entertainment he had received in England, the idea of returning
                    home loaded with treasure, which might enable him to make a figure among his
                    countrymen, soon overcame all uneasy sensations which the leaving of his English
                    friends was calculated to excite. His majesty had taken care to furnish him with
                    every thing that could possibly be of use when he returned to his native
                    country; and he had besides received several valuable presents from Lord
                    Sandwich, Sir Joseph Banks, as well as from ladies and gentlemen of bis
                    acquaintance; so that nothing was omitted which could possibly be done to
                    convey, by his means, to the inhabitants of the South Sea islands, an idea of
                    the British power and greatness.</p>
                <p>Every thing being prepared for the voyage, our navigator set sail from the Nore
                    on the 25th of June 1776; but by reason of some delay in receiving his
                    instructions, they did not leave Plymouth till the 12th of July. He had not been
                    long at sea before he began his operations for preserving the health of his
                    people, operations which were found equally efficacious in this as in the former
                    voyage. Finding his stock of provender for the animals on board likely to run
                    short, he touched at Teneriffe in order to procure a supply, having judged that
                    to be a more proper place for the purpose than Madeira, which was usually
                    resorted to. On sailing thence he ran a great risk of running upon some sunken
                    rocks on the island of Bonavista; but on this, as well as on other occasions of
                    danger, he behaved with the same judgment, coolness, and presence of mind, which
                    distinguished him throughout the whole course of his life. On the 12th of August
                    he arrived before Port Praya, in one of the Cape de Verd islands named St Jago;
                    but not finding it necessary to run in there, he continued his voyage to the
                    southward. The weather now becoming gloomy and rainy, it required a continuance
                    of the methods he had already practised for preserving the health of his people;
                    but, as formerly, they were attended with the greatest success. On the 1st of
                    September our navigators crossed the equator, and on the 18th of October
                    anchored in Table Bay at the Cape of Good Hope. Here they met with a violent
                    tempest, the effects of which were felt both on sea and land. It lasted three
                    days, and the Resolution was the only ship in the bay that·rode out the storm
                    without dragging her anchors. On shore the tents and observatory were destroyed,
                    and the astronomical quadrant narrowly escaped irreparable damage. The
                    Discovery, which had been some time later in sailing from England, was driven
                    off the coast, and did not arrive till the 10th of November.</p>
                <p>V⅛ hilst they remained in this place, a disaster happened which threatened the
                    loss of most of their live stock. The bull and two cows had been put ashore to
                    graze among other cattle; but Captain Cook had been advised to keep the sheep,
                    sixteen in number, near the tents, where they were penned in every night. But
                    some dogs having got in amongst them in the night-time, killed four, and
                    dispersed the rest. Six of them were recovered the next day, but the two rams
                    and two of the finest ewes in the flock were missing. The captain applied to
                    Baron Plettenberg, the governor; but all his endeavours were unsuccessful, until
                    lie employed some of the meanest and lowest of the people; fellows who for a
                    ducatoon would have cut their master’s throat, burned the house over his head,
                    and buried him and his whole family in ashes. After all, two of the finest ewes
                    in the flock were missing, and never could be recovered. The captain, therefore,
                    in order to repair this loss, and to make an addition to his original stock,
                    purchased two young bulls, two entire horses, two mares, two heifers, two rams,
                    several ewes and goats, with some rabbits and poultry; when, having finished all
                    hfs business, he set sail on the 30th of November, though it was not ’ till the
                    third of December that he got clear of land.</p>
                <p>Having explored some desolate islands in the southern seas, Captain Cook set sail
                    for New Zealand. During this <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751185"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1185-0301"/>part of the voyage, our navigators were involved
                    in so thick a fog, that, according to the authors of Captain Cook’s life, “they
                    sailed three hundred leagues in the ] dark.” The first land they afterwards
                    reached was New 1 Holland, where they remained till the 30th of January 1 1777,
                    when they set sail for New Zealand, and on the 12th of February anchored in
                    Queen Charlotte’s Sound. Here; the people w ere shy and timorous, on account of
                    their having formerly destroyed ten of Captain Furneaux’s people, 1 who had been
                    sent ashore to gather vegetables. The cause ∣ of the quarrel could not be known,
                    as none of the party were left alive to tell the news. Lieutenant Burney, who
                    went ashore in quest of them, found only some fragments of their bodies; from
                    which it appeared that they had been killed and devoured by the savages. It was
                    not the intention of Captain Cook, at this distance of time, to resent the
                    injury; he even refused to put to death a chief named Kahoora, who, as he was
                    informed by the natives themselves, had killed Mr Rowe, the commander of the
                    party. He was, however, particularly careful that no opportunity should now be
                    given the savages of committing such an action with impunity; and with this view
                    a boat was never sent on shore without being well armed, and the men under the
                    command of such officers as could be depended upon. The New Zealanders were no
                    sooner assured of Captain Cook’s pacific disposition, than they threw aside
                    their fears and suspicions, and entered into a commercial intercourse with the
                    people. It would have been the less excusable in Captain Cook to have revenged
                    at this time the massacre of Mr Rowe’s party, as he was assured that the quarrel
                    originated from some petty thefts of the savages, which were too hastily
                    resented on the part of the British; and that, had it not been for this, no
                    mischief would have happened.</p>
                <p>On the 25th of February our navigator left New Zealand, taking with him, at the
                    request of Ornai, two boys, the eldest about eighteen, and the youngest about
                    ten. So much time had now been spent in sailing up and dow n in the Pacific
                    Ocean, where several new islands were discovered, that Captain Cook judged it
                    impossible to accomplish any thing this year in the high northern latitudes; for
                    which reason he determined to bear away for the Friendly Islands, in order to
                    supply himself with those necessaries which he had found it impossible to
                    procure at any of the islands which he had just discovered. In his run thither,
                    several new islands were visited; and in prosecuting these discoveries our
                    navigator once more narrowly escaped being shipwrecked. The danger at this time
                    arose from a low sandy island, which the Resolution was very near running upon,
                    and from which she was only saved by the circumstance of all the men having been
                    accidentally called upon deck to put the vessel about. Soon after this both
                    ships struck upon some sunk coral rocks, but happily got off without material
                    damage.</p>
                <p>After a stay of between two and three months, Captain Cook took leave of the
                    Friendly Islands on the 13th of July 1777, and on the 12th of August reached
                    Otaheite, where he introduced Oinai to his countrymen. Here the captain found
                    the people of Otaheite ready to engage in a war with those of Eimeo; but though
                    strongly solicited by the former to assist them in an expedition against their
                    enemies, he refused to take any concern in the affair, alleging, by way of
                    excuse, that the people of Eimeo had never offended him. This seemed to satisfy
                    most of the chiefs; but one, named Towha, was so much displeased .that Captain
                    Cook could never regain his favour.</p>
                <p>From Otaheite Captain Cook next proceeded to Eimeo, where, on account of some
                    thefts committed by the natives, he was obliged to commence hostilities, by
                    burning a number of their war canoes, and even some houses.</p>
                <p>These transactions gave him much concern; and the more that he had been so much
                    solicited to make war on these people by his friends at Otaheite, to whose
                    entreaties he had refused to listen. From Eimeo he proceeded to Hua-heine, where
                    he saw 0mai finally settled, and left with him the two New Zealand youths
                    already mentioned. The youngest of these was so much attached to the English
                    that it was necessary to carry him out of the ship and put him ashore by force.
                    During his stay on this island, the captain was obliged to punish a thief with
                    greater severity than he had ever done before, by causing his head and beard to
                    be shaved, and his ears cut off. Some other disagreeable transactions took
                    place, particularly the desertion of two of his people, who were not recovered
                    without the greatest difficulty. In the course of his exertions for their
                    recovery, he found it necessary to detain the son, daughter, and son-in-law of
                    the chief of an island named Otaha. This had almost produced very serious
                    consequences, the natives having formed a plot for carrying off Captain Cook
                    himself, as well as Captain Clerke and Mr Gore. As to the commander, they were
                    disappointed, by his own caution and vigilance; but Messrs Clerke and Gore were
                    in particular danger; and it was only owing to the circumstance of one of them
                    having a pistol in his hand as they walked together on shore, that they were not
                    seized.</p>
                <p>Having left the Society Islands, and discovered a new group, which, in honour of
                    his patron the Earl of Sandwich, our commander named the Sandwich Isles, he set
                    out on the 2d of January 1778 on his voyage northward. In this he was very
                    successful, ascertaining the vicinity of the continents of Asia and America,
                    which had never been done, or but very imperfectly, before. From these desolate
                    regions he returned to the island of Oonalashka, whence, having refitted and
                    taken in provisions, he returned to the southward, and on the 26th of November
                    reached the Sandwich Islands, where he discovered a new one named Mowee, and on
                    the 30th of the same month another of much larger extent, named Owhyhee. Seven
                    weeks were spent in exploring the coasts of this island; and during all this
                    time he continued to have the most friendly intercourse with the people; who,
                    however, appeared to be much more numerous and powerful than those of any island
                    our navigators had yet touched at. Several of the chiefs and principal persons
                    had attached themselves greatly to the commander, and in general the people
                    appeared to be much more honest in their dispositions than any whom he had ever
                    visited. But by the time he had finished his circumnavigation of the island, and
                    cast anchor in a bay called Karakakooa, matters were greatly altered. An
                    universal disposition to theft and plunder had now evinced itself; and in this
                    it was evident, that the common people were encouraged and abetted by their
                    chiefs, who shared the booty with them. Still, however, no hostilities were
                    commenced; the greatest honours were paid to .the commander; and on his going
                    ashore he was received with ceremonies little short of adoration. A vast
                    quantity of hogs and other provisions w ere procured for the ships; and on the
                    4th of February 1779 they left the island, not without most magnificent presents
                    from the chiefs, such as they had never before received in any part of the
                    world. Unluckily they met with a storm on the sixth and seventh of the same
                    month, during which the Resolution sprung the head of her foremast in such a
                    manner that they were obliged to return to Karakakooa bay to get it
                    repaired.</p>
                <p>The same friendly intercourse which had formerly subsisted with the natives now
                    commenced, and Captain Cook was treated with the usual honours; but on the.13th
                    of this month it was unhappily broken off. One of the natives<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194751198" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1198-0302"/> being detected in stealing
                    the tongs from the armourer’s forge in the Discovery, was dismissed with a
                    pretty severe flogging; but this example was so far from being attended with any
                    good effect, that in the afternoon another, having snatched up the tongs and a
                    chisel, jumped overboard with them and swam for the shore. The master and
                    midshipman were instantly dispatched in pursuit of him; but he escaped on board
                    a canoe, which paddled away so quickly that the cutter could not overtake it. A
                    chief named Pareah, who was at this time on board the Resolution, understanding
                    what had happened, promised to go ashore and recover the stolen goods; but
                    before this could be effected the thief had made his escape into the country.
                    Captain Cook, who was at that time ashore, had endeavoured to intercept the
                    canoe when it landed, but was led out of the way by some of the natives who
                    pretended to be his guides. The tongs and chisel, however, were brought back to
                    the master as he advanced to the landing place; but he being now joined by some
                    of the rest of the people in the pinnace, and not satisfied with the recovery of
                    the stolen goods, insisted upon having the thief, or the canoe which carried
                    him, by way of reprisal. On his preparing to launch this last into the water he
                    was interrupted by Pareah, who insisted that it was his property, and that he
                    should not take it away. As the officer paid no regard to his remonstrances,
                    Pareah, who appears to have been a very strong man, seized him, pinioned his
                    arms behind, and held him fast by the hair of the head. Upon this one of the
                    sailors struck the chief with an oar, on which, quitting the officer, he
                    instantly snatched the oar out of the man’s hand, and broke it in two across his
                    knee. The natives then attacked the sailors with stones, and soon drove them to
                    their boats, to which they were forced to swim, as they lay at some distance
                    from the shore. The officers who could not swim retired to a small rock, where
                    they were closely pursued by the Indians; and here the master narrowly escaped
                    with his life, till Pareah returned and obliged the natives to give over their
                    attacks. The gentlemen, sensible that Pareah’s presence alone could protect
                    them, entreated him to remain with them till they could be brought off in boats.
                    On his refusal, the master set out to the place where the observatories had been
                    erected, for further assistance; but Pareah, who met him, and suspected his
                    errand, obliged him to return. In the mean time the multitude had begun to break
                    in pieces the pinnace, after having taken every thing out of her that was loose.
                    On the return of Pareah, however, they were again dispersed, and some of the
                    oars restored, after which the gentlemen were glad to get off in safety. But
                    before they reached the ship, Pareah overtook them in a canoe, and delivered the
                    midshipman’s cap, which had been taken from him in the scuffle; he also joined
                    noses with them in token of friendship, and desired to know whether Captain Cook
                    would kill him on account of what had happened. They assured him that he would
                    not, and made signs of reconciliation on their part. On this he left them and
                    paddled over to the town of Kavaroah; and this was the last time that he was
                    seen by the English. In the night-time the sentinels were much alarmed by shrill
                    and melancholy sounds from the adjacent villages, which they took to be the
                    lamentations of the women. Next day it was found that the large cutter of the
                    Discovery had been carried off in the night-time; on which Captain Cook ordered
                    the launch and small cutter to go under the command of the second lieutenant,
                    and to lie off the east point of the bay, in order to intercept all the canoes
                    that might attempt to get out, and if necessary to fire upon them. The third
                    lieutenant of the Resolution was dispatched to the western part of the bay on
                    the same service, whilst the master was sent in pursuit of a large double canoe
                    already under sail, and making the best of her way out of the harbour. He soon
                    came up with her, and by firing a few shots, obliged her to run on shore, and
                    the Indians to leave her. This was the canoe belonging to a chief named Omea,
                    whose person was reckoned equally sacred with that of the king; and to the
                    neglect of securing him may be attributed the succeeding disaster. Captain Cook
                    now formed the resolution of going in person to seize the king himself in his
                    capital of Kavaroah; and as there was reason to suppose that he had fled, he
                    intended to secure the large canoes, which on that account he had caused to be
                    hauled up on the beach. With this view he left the ship about seven o’clock in
                    the morning of Sunday the 14th of February, attended by the lieutenant of
                    marines, a serjeant, corporal, and seven private men. The crew of the pinnace,
                    under the command of Mr Roberts, were also armed; and as they rowed towards the
                    shore, the captain ordered the launch to leave her station at the opposite point
                    of the bay, in order to assist his own boat. Having landed with the marines at
                    the upper end of the town, the natives flocked round him, and prostrated
                    themselves before him. No sign of hostility, nor even alarm, appeared; the
                    king’s sons waited upon the commander as soon as he sent for them, and by their
                    means he was introduced to the king, who readily consented to go on board; but
                    in a little time the natives began to arm themselves with long spears, clubs,
                    and daggers, and to put on thick mats, which they use as defensive armour. This
                    hostile appearance was greatly augmented by an unlucky piece of news which was
                    just now brought by a canoe, that one of the Indian chiefs had been killed by
                    the people in the Discovery’s boats. On this the women, who had hitherto sat on
                    the beach conversing familiarly and taking their breakfasts, removed, and a
                    confused murmur ran through the crowd. An old priest now appeared with a
                    cocoa-nut in his hand, which lie held out as a present to Captain Cook, singing
                    all the while, and studiously making a noise, as if he meant to divert the
                    attention of the captain and his people from observing the motions of the
                    Indians, who were everywhere putting on their armour. Captain Cook, thinking his
                    situation dangerous, ordered the lieutenant of the marines to march towards the
                    shore, as he himself did, having all the while hold of the king’s hand, who very
                    readily accompanied him, attended by his wife, two sons, and several chiefs. The
                    natives made a lane for them to pass; and as the distance they had to proceed
                    was only about fifty or sixty yards, and the boats lay at no more than five or
                    six yards distance from land, there was not the least apprehension of the
                    catastrophe which ensued. The king’s youngest son Keowa went on board the
                    pinnace without the least hesitation, and the king was about to follow, when his
                    wife threw her arms about his neck, and, with the assistance of two chiefs,
                    forced him to sit down. The captain might now have safely got aboard, but did
                    not immediately relinquish the design of taking the king along with him. Finding
                    at last, however, that this could not be accomplished without a great deal of
                    bloodshed, he was on the point of giving orders for the people to re-embark,
                    when one of the Indians threw a stone at him. This insult was returned by the
                    captain, who had a double barrelled piece, by a discharge of small shot from one
                    of the barrels. This had little effect, as the man had a thick mat before him;
                    and as he now brandished his spear, the captain knocked him down with his
                    musket. The king’s son, Keowa, still remaining in the pinnace, the detaining him
                    would have been a great check upon the natives; but unluckily Mr Roberts, who
                    commanded the pinnace, set him ashore at his own request soon after the first
                    fire. In the mean time another native was observed in the act of brandishing his
                    spear at the commander, who was obliged to <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751211"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1211-0303"/>fire upon him in his own defence. Missing his aim,
                    how- ’ ever, he killed one close by his side, upon which the Serjeant, observing
                    that he had missed the man he aimed at, received orders to fire also, which he
                    did, and killed him on the spot. This repressed the foremost of the Indians, and
                    made them fall back in a body; but they were urged on again by those behind, and
                    discharged a volley of stones among the marines, who immediately returned it by
                    a general discharge of their muskets; and this was instantly followed by a fire
                    from the boats. Captain Cook expressed his astonishment at their firing, waved
                    his hand to them to cease, and called to the people in the boats to come nearer
                    to receive the marines. This order was obeyed by Mr Roberts; but the lieutenant
                    who commanded the launch, instead of coming nearer, put off to a greater
                    distance; and by this preposterous conduct deprived the unfortunate commander of
                    the only chance which he had for his life; for the natives, exasperated by the
                    fire of the marines, now rushed in upon and drove them into the water, leaving
                    the captain alone upon the rock. A fire, indeed, was kept up from both boats;
                    but the one was too far off, and the other was crowded with the marines, so that
                    they could not direct their fire with proper effect. Captain Cook was then
                    observed making for the pinnace, carrying his musket under his arm, and holding
                    his other hand on the back part of his head to guard it from the stones. A
                    native was seen following him, but with marks of fear, as he stopped once or
                    twice, seemingly undetermined to proceed. At last he struck the captain on the
                    back of the head with a club, and then precipitately retreated. The latter
                    staggered a few paces, and then fell on his hand and one knee, and dropped his
                    musket. Before he could recover himself, another native stabbed him with a
                    dagger in the neck, though still without putting an end to his life. He then
                    fell into a pool of water knee-deep, where others crowded upon him; but still he
                    struggled violently with them, got up his head, and looked towards the pinnace
                    as if soliciting assistance. The boat was not above five or six yards distant;
                    but such was the confused and crowded state of the crew, that no assistance
                    could be given him. The natives then got him under again, but in deeper water,
                    though he still continued to struggle, and once more got his head up; but being
                    quite spent, he turned towards the rock as if to support himself by it, when a
                    savage struck him with a club, which probably put an end to his life, as he was
                    never seen to struggle more. The savages hauled his lifeless body upon the
                    rocks, and used it in the most barbarous manner, snatching the daggers out of
                    one another’s hands, in order to have the pleasure of mangling it. If any thing
                    could add to the misfortune of this celebrated ļ navigator’s death, it was, that
                    even his mangled remains were not rescued from the hands of the barbarians. The
                    lieutenant already mentioned, who, by his removing to a distance when he ought
                    to have come on shore, seemed to have been the occasion of his death, returned
                    on board without making any attempt to recover his body; although it appeared
                    from the testimonies of four or five midshipmen who arrived soon afterwards at
                    the fatal spot, that the beach was almost deserted by the natives, who had at
                    last yielded to the continual fire from the boats. The officer alleged in excuse
                    for removing at first from the shore, that he mistook the signals; but be this
                    as it will, the complaints against him were so many and so great, that Captain
                    Clerke was obliged publicly to take notice of them, and to take the depositions
                    of his accusers in writing. These papers, however, were not found, and it is
                    supposed that the captain’s bad state of health had induced him to destroy them.
                    After all, we are informed that, in the opinion of Captain Philips, who
                    commanded the marines, it is very doubtful whether any effectual relief could
                    have been given to the commander, even if no mistake had been committed on the
                    part of the lieutenant. The author of all the mischief was Pareah, the chief
                    already mentioned, who had employed people to steal the boat in the night-time.
                    The king was entirely innocent both of the theft and the murder of Captain Cook;
                    but the latter was perpetrated by some chiefs who were his near relations. The
                    chief who first struck him with a club was named Karimans Raha, and he who
                    stabbed him with the dagger was called Nooah.</p>
                <p>By reason of the barbarous disposition of the natives it was found impossible to
                    recover Captain Cook’s body after the first opportunity had been lost. By dint
                    of threats and negotiations, however, some of the principal parts were proćured
                    with great difficulty; by which means the navigators were enabled to perform the
                    last offices to their much respected commander. These remains being put into a
                    coffin, and the service read over them, were committed to the deep with the
                    usual honours, on the 21st of February 1779.</p>
                <p>Captain Cook was a man of plain address and appearance, but looked well, and was
                    upwards of six feet in height. His head was small, and he wore his hair, which
                    was brown, tied behind. His face was full of expression; his nose exceedingly
                    well shaped; his eyes, which were small and of a brown cast, quick and piercing;
                    and his eyebrows prominent, which gave his countenance altogether an air of
                    austerity. But notwithstanding his appearance, it was impossible for any one to
                    excel him in humanity; as is evident from the whole tenor of his behaviour, both
                    to his own people and the many savage nations with whom he had occasion to
                    interfere. This amiable quality discovered itself even in the fatal catastrophe
                    above described; for his utmost care was directed to the preservation of his
                    people, and the procuring them a safe retreat to their boats. And it cannot be
                    sufficiently lamented, that he who was so careful of others, should himself have
                    perished in such a miserable manner for want of proper support. The constancy
                    with which he pursued every object was unequalled. Nothing could divert him from
                    what lie had once undertaken; and he persevered in the midst of dangers and
                    difficulties which would have disheartened persons of inferior strength and
                    firmness of mind. For this he was adapted by nature, having a strong
                    constitution, inured to labour, and capable of undergoing the greatest
                    hardships; to which he united an invincible fortitude of mind. He was master of
                    himself on every trying occasion; and the greater the emergency, the greater
                    appeared his calmness and self-possession. That he possessed genius in an
                    eminent degree cannot possibly be questioned: his invention was ready, and
                    capable not only of suggesting the most proper objects of pursuit, but the best
                    methods of attaining them. His knowledge of his own profession was unequalled;
                    and to this he added very considerable proficiency in other sciences. In
                    astronomy he became so eminent, that he was at length enabled to take the lead
                    in making the astronomical observations during the course of his voyages. In
                    general learning he likewise attained to such a proficiency as to be able to
                    express himself with clearness and propriety. He was an excellent husband and
                    father, sincere and steady in his friendships, and possessed of general sobriety
                    and virtue of character. In conversation he was unaffected and unassuming;
                    rather backward in pushing discourse, but obliging and communicative to those
                    who wished for information: and he was distinguished by a simplicity of manners
                    almost universally the accompaniment of great merit. With all these amiable
                    qualities, however, he was subject to a hastiness of temper, which sometimes
                    degenerated into harshness and severity; but still, when taking a general view
                    of his character, we must <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751224"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1224-0304"/>acknowledge that he was undoubtedly one of the
                    most remarkable men of his time. »</p>
                <p>Captain Cook is distinguished as an author by an account of his second voyage
                    written by himself. His first voyage, as well as that of several other
                    navigators, had been recorded by Dr Hawkesworth; but on this occasion it was not
                    judged necessary to have recourse to any other pen than that of the navigator
                    himself; and his journal, with a few occasional alterations, was sufficient for
                    the purpose. The style is clear, natural, and manly; and it is not improbable,
                    that even a pen of more studied elegance could not have made it appear to so
                    much advantage.</p>
                <p>Distinguished honours were paid to Captain Cook after his death, both by his own
                    countrymen and by other nations. Michael Angelo Gianetti read, in the Florentine
                    Academy, on the 9th of June 1785, an eulogy on our celebrated navigator, which
                    was published at Florence during the same year. One of the French literary
                    academies also proposed a prize for the best eulogiuιn on Captain Cook; and many
                    poetical testimonies to his merit appeared in our own language. The Royal
                    Society of London resolved to testify their respect to him by a medal, for which
                    purpose a voluntary subscription was opened. One of the gold medals struck on
                    this occasion was presented to the king, another to the queen, a third to the
                    prince of Wales; a fourth was sent to the French king, on account of the
                    protection he had granted to the ships; and a fifth to the empress of Russia, in
                    whose dominions they had been treated with every expression of friendship and
                    kindness. Both the king of France and the czarina of Russia condescended to
                    accept of the gifts with marks of satisfaction. The French king wrote a handsome
                    letter to the society, signed by himself, and undersigned by the Marquis de
                    Vergennes; and the empress of Russia commissioned Count Osterman to signify to
                    Mr Fitzherbcrt the sense she entertained of the value of the present, which she
                    had caused to be deposited in the museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences.
                    After the general assignment of the medals, which took place in 1781, a surplus
                    of money still remained; upon which it was resolved by the president and council
                    that an additional number of medals should be struck off, to be disposed of in
                    presents to Mrs Cook, the Earl of Sandwich, Dr Benjamin Franklin, Dr Cook,
                    provost of King’s College, Cambridge, and Mr Planta.</p>
                <p>During the two, visits of the ships at Kamtschatka, Major Behm, the commandant of
                    that province, had in the most liberal manner afforded every kind of assistance
                    which it was in his power to bestow; and such was the sense entertained by the
                    lords of the admiralty of the kindness he had evinced, that they determined to
                    make him a present of a magnificent piece of plate, with an inscription
                    expressive of his humane and generous conduct. Sir Hugh Palliser, who had all
                    along showed an uncommon respect and kindness for Captain Cook, likewise evinced
                    his regard for his memory in a conspicuous manner. On his estate in
                    Buckinghamshire, he constructed a small building, with a pillar, containing
                    inscribed on it the character of Captain Cook which is given at the end of the
                    introduction to the account of the last voyage.</p>
                <p>Amidst all these expressions of unavailing praise, the widow and family of our
                    celebrated navigator were not forgotten. A memorial for a pension of L.200 per
                    annum having been presented to the king by the commissioners of the admiralty,
                    and signed by the Earl of Sandwich, Mr Butler, the Earl of Lisburne, Mr Penton,
                    Lord Mulgrave, and Mr Mann, his majesty complied with the request, and the grant
                    was passed through the usual forms with all possible speed. By this grant L.200
                    per annum was settled on the widow during life, and L.25 a year on each of her
                    three sons; and after her death the L.200 was to be divided among her children.
                    The last honour paid to the memory of Captain Cook was granting a coat of arms
                    to the family, which was done by patent on the 3d of Sep- <hi rend="subscript">
