                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    under the second, its charactersand combinations, as it occurs in nature.</p>
                <p>Copper got the name of Venus among the alchymists, on account of the facility
                    with which it unites with other metallic bodies,</p>
                <p>Gold, silver, and brass are the metals which are first mentioned in history,
                    being those which occur frequently in a native or pure state; and although the
                    quantity thus produced may bear but a small proportion to the whole, yet the
                    advancement of science requisite to separate the metal from its ore sufficiently
                    accounts for the precedence which these have taken over all others.</p>
                <p>The metal called brass, in sacred and profane history, and which was employed for
                    the purpose of money, was, in fact, the copper of modern times; whilst the brass
                    of the present day is an alloy of copper, mixed according to the purpose for
                    which the alloy may be required. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Brass.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751315" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1315-0311"/>
                <p>The ancients, at a very early period, discovered the benefit derivable from the
                    mixture of copper with other metals, as the alloy constantly produced a harder
                    and a more durable substance, and at the same time was no disadvantage to the
                    material in melting or casting. It was employed in many of the illustrious works
                    which the ancients left for the admiration of succeeding times. The enormous
                    statue of the Sun, known by the name of the Colossus of Rhodes, erected by
                    Chares of Lyndus, an elève of Lysippus, was composed entirely of this metal: and
                    many others are m ntioned, which prove that the ancients were at least as well
                    acquainted with the difficult art of working in brass as we are at the present
                    time.</p>
                <p>In a pure state, copper is a very brilliant metal, and susceptible of a high
                    polish. It is of a fine red colour, differing from every other metal except
                    titanium. Its specific gravity varies according to its density, from 8 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 58-I to 8*9. According to Brard, the cubic foot of
                    melted copper weighs 54∙5 lbs.</p>
                <p>Of native metal 600 lbs.</p>
                <p>Of copper medals 620 lbs.</p>
                <p>In a native state, it is not an uncommon mineral. It occurs in arborescent
                    groups, very beautifully crystallized, in Siberia, imbedded in limestone, and in
                    very considerable masses. In the cabinet of Ajuda, near Lisbon, a mass of native
                    copper is said to be preserved, of the enormous weight of 2617 pounds (Brand).
                    In Cornwall it occurs in many of the mines, and also in the island of Anglesea;
                    and in the island of Nalsoc, one of the Faroe group, it occurs very beautifully
                    crystallized, along with zeolite, imbedded in amygdaloidal trap.</p>
                <p>Great as the use to which copper was applied by the ancients, it was very limited
                    compared with the uses it has been put to in modern times.</p>
                <p>Metallic copper is used for culinary vessels in many parts of Europe; but for
                    this purpose the inner surface of the vessel should be tinned. Large vessels for
                    distilling, brewing, dyeing, and the like processes, are made of copper. The
                    making of these vessels constitutes the ordinary business of the
                    coppersmith.</p>
                <p>Copper rolled into sheets is employed for covering the wooden work of the roofs
                    of churches and large edifices in Germany, Sweden, and other countries. It is a
                    costly covering, and does not possess any notable advantage over lead.</p>
                <p>A modern, and now a very extensive use of sheet-copper, is for the sheathing of
                    ships. That part of the hull of the ship that is in the water is covered with
                    sheet-copper. This'covering preserves the wood from the attacks of the worm, and
                    thereby gives the ship the advantage of passing more rapidly through the water,
                    as the copper bottom remains always smooth; for sea-weed and shells will not
                    take root and attach themselves to copper, as they do to the bare planks, owing
                    to the galvanic effect produced by the action of the sea water. As this action,
                    however, produces a rapid decay of copper, it was proposed by Sir Humphry Davy
                    to neutralize it by applying metallic protectors, an object which he
                    accomplished; but as this also deprived the copper of the effect it was intended
                    to produce, and allowed the molluscous tribes to attach themselves, the
                    protecting process was abandoned.</p>
                <p>Its malleability and ductility are very considerable. A wireofOO78 of an inch
                    diameter will support 302 pounds avoirdupois.</p>
                <p>Copper bolts are used for fastening the planks and timbers of ships. This is a
                    modern improvement in ship-building. A copper-fastened ship or boat is
                    preferable to one with iron fastenings, because the copper baits remain
                    unaltered by rust, and endure longer than the wood which they hold together,
                    particularly when used in the state of alloy, which preserves it from waste by
                    neutralizing the galvanic action.</p>
                <p>For the frames of delicate dipping needles and magnetic compasses, copper is
                    employed; as it has been found that the brass generally used in philosophical
                    instruments sometimes contains iron, which of course might affect the magnetic
                    needle.</p>
                <p>Copper is drawn into wire, used for the communication with the bells in houses,
                    and for other purposes.</p>
                <p>Small pipes for conveying the pit-coal gas from the level of the street to the
                    aperture by which the gas issues, were made of copper or of brass till
                    superseded by tin. These pipes were fitted· on an iron cylindrical mandril, and
                    a cylindrical ring is drawn over the outside. By this means copper and brass
                    tubes are drawn out. The brass tubes for telescopes are drawn out in the same
                    manner.</p>
                <p>The mixture, consisting of a large proportion of copper and a small proportion of
                    silver, called billon in France, is used for coins of small value in that
                    country, in Germany, and in other parts of Europe. In Britain this alloy is not
                    now used; all coins being made either of standard gold, of standard silver, or
                    of copper. The use of billon is objectionable, as it renders the value of the
                    coins uncertain.</p>
                <p>Copper may be plated; that is, its surface may be covered with a layer of silver,
                    by rubbing the surface with a mixture of nitrate of silver, muriate of soda, and
                    acidulous tartrate of potass (cream of tartar). But the method practised at
                    Birmingham is the most peemanent and effectual. A plate of copper, with a plate
                    of silver applied to it, and borax placed in the interstice, is heated to a
                    particular degree, which it requires the skill of the workman to know; a degree
                    of heat, in short, near that at which copper and silver melt. The two metals
                    thus heated, and in contact, are then taken out of the furnace and passed
                    through rollers. There is a fusion and combination of the adjacent surfaces; and
                    their adhesion is perfected by the pressure of the rollers. Copper thus plated
                    is manufactured at Birmingham into candlesticks, teapots, buttons, buckles, and
                    a variety of other articles.</p>
                <p>Standard silver coins contain a small proportion of copper, for the purpose of
                    giving them hardness. This proportion is regulated by each government in Europe,
                    and varies a little in different countries. The combination of gold and copper
                    in various proportions is used for making rings and other trinkets.</p>
                <p>Copper is gilded by applying on its surface an amalgam of gold with mercury.
                    Bronze ornaments are gilded in the same way.</p>
                <p>Copper united with tin forms bronze. This combination is hard and brittle if the
                    proportion of tin be great; but when the proportion of tin is small, the bronze
                    is soft, and possesses tenacity so as not to be easily broken. The ancients
                    employed hard bronze, containing much tin, in making sword blades, spear heads,
                    hatchets, and cutting instruments. Bronze cramps are found in ancient buildings
                    in Egypt. Statues and bas-reliefs, various culinary vessels, and different kinds
                    of instruments of soft bronze, are seen in the collections of antiquities. In
                    modern times soft bronze is used for easting cannon and statues.</p>
                <p>Copper melted with a large proportion of tin constitutes bell metal, which is
                    hard and brittle. The metal of which the Chinese gongs are made is composed of
                    the same ingredients; and it has the property of being in some degree malleable
                    at a certain stage of its cooling, for the gongs are covered with marks of the
                    hammer.</p>
                <p>To obtain copper from the yellow sulphuret or copper pyrites, which is the most
                    common copper ore, it is necessary to smelt the ore several times before the
                    metallic copper is obtained free from sulphur. The slag or scoriae <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194751328" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1328-0312"/> produced in these
                    smeltings is formed into large bricks, used in building and coping walls in
                    Wales and some other parts of Britain, in the vicinity of which the smelting of
                    copper is carried on.</p>
                <p>The chief use made of the native combinations of copper found in the earth is to
                    extract the metallic copper from them. Sulphur is sometimes manufactured in
                    treating the copper pyrites.</p>
                <p>Oxide of copper obtained from the annealing that copper and brass wire undergoes,
                    is used in dyeing.</p>
                <p>In enamel colouring, oxide of copper, at a low degree of oxidation, produces an
                    opaque-red or brownish-red enamel, called porporino. When the copper∙is more
                    oxidated, it gives a green colour in enamelling upon earthenware and porcelain,
                    and in stained glass.</p>
                <p>Sulphate of copper, when concentrated or crystallized, is transparent and blue.
                    It is manufactured for the use of the dyer and calico-printer.</p>
                <p>Nitrate of copper is also blue. If fragments of soft wood, such as poplar or fir,
                    be impregnated with a solution of this salt, these sticks, when dried, burn
                    gradually to the end, and may serve as quick-match for firing cannon.</p>
                <p>Muriate of copper is green; that which is formed by direct solution of copper in
                    muriatic acid is transparent, and soluble in water; but the native muriate of
                    copper, with excess of oxide, is insoluble. This is found in Peru in the form of
                    green sand, and has got the name of atacamite, from the district of country in
                    which it occurs. Being opaque, it is used in painting.</p>
                <p>Verdigris <hi rend="italic">(Verdlt-gris)</hi> is an acetate of copper with
                    excess of oxide. It is prepared in the wine districts of the south of France, by
                    laying copper plates in strata alternately with the grape stalksand husks from
                    which the juice has been pressed. The fermentation of the husks produces
                    vinegar, which acts upon the copper. Verdigris is used in painting, because it
                    possesses, on account of its excess of oxide, the opacity necessary for making a
                    coloured paste with oil; it is also used in dyeing. Crystallized acetate of
                    copper is the acetate without excess of oxide: it is in green crystals, and is
                    also used in dyeing.</p>
                <p>Scheele’s green is an opaque precipitate, of a grass-green colour, composed of
                    copper and arsenic. It is used in oil-painting.</p>
                <p>Prussiate of copper is an opaque-brown precipitate, formed by adding prussiate of
                    potash to a solution of sulphate of copper, and may be used in painting. The
                    colour, however, wants durability.</p>
