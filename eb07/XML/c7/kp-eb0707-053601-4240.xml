                <p><label type="entry">CUMBERLAND</label>, a county in England, at its northwest
                    extremity, situated between 54° 6' and 55° 7∣ ’ north latitude, and 2° 13' and
                    3° 30' west longitude, is bounded on the north by Scotland and the Solway Frith;
                    on the east by Northumberland and Durham; on the south by Westmoreland and
                    Lancashire; and on the west, for about sixty-seven miles, by the Irish Sca. It
                    is, at a medium, about fifty miles long and thirty broad, within a bounding line
                    of 224 miles, and contains 1516 square miles, or 970,240 acres, of which the
                    mountainous district comprises more than a third, the old inclosures about a
                    half, and the lakes and waters 8000 acres; the remainder being either commons
                    capable of improvement, or lands recently inclosed. The principal divisions are
                    called wards, a term synonymous with hundreds in other counties: of these there
                    are five, namely, Cumberland, Eskdale, Leath, Allerdale above Derwent, and
                    Allerdale below Derwent. The ward of Allerdale above Derwent is in the diocese
                    of Chester, and all the others are in that of Carlisle. The county contains one
                    city, Carlisle, seventeen market-towns, and 112 parishes. Carlisle and
                    Cockcrmouth are its only boroughs. Cumberland presents every variety of surface.
                    The south-western district is generally mountainous, rugged, and sterile, yet
                    contains several rich though narrow valleys, with many fine lakes, islands,
                    rivers, cascades, and woodlands, which, combined or contrasted in the view with
                    the gigantic rocky masses around them, exhibit many remarkable scenes of
                    grandeur, desolation, and beauty. Skiddaw, Saddleback, Helvellin, rising to the
                    height of more than 3000 feet, belong to this quarter. The highest part of that
                    immense ridge, termed the British Appennines, which, commencing in Derbyshire,
                    extends in a continued chain into the Lothians, forms the eastern boundary; in
                    which Crossfell, about 3100 feet high, surrounded with other lofty and barren
                    eminences, retains the snow upon its summit nearly three fourths of the year.
                    The northern part of the county, or what has been called the Vale of Carlisle,
                    is in general flat; and a tract of low land, from two to four or five miles in
                    breadth, winds along the western shore. The climate necessarily corresponds with
                    this variety of surface: here, as in the other western counties, rains are
                    frequent and copious, particularly in summer, and often also in autumn. Black
                    peat earth is the most prevalent soil in the mountainous districts, and is
                    found, too, in the moors and commons of the low grounds. About half the
                    cultivated land consists of dry loams, excellently adapted for the growth of
                    turnips, herbage, and all sorts of grain. Fertile clays occupy but a small
                    portion, but clay, wet and sterile, forms the subsoil in many parts. The
                    principal rivers are the Eden, the Derwent, the Caldew, and the Esk. The Eden
                    has its source in Westmoreland, near the borders of Yorkshire, and, pursuing a
                    northwesterly course in its progress through Cumberland, passes Kirkoswald and
                    Carlisle, and falls into the Solway Frith near Rockcliffe Marsh, where it forms
                    a fine estuary. The vale land on its banks is for the most part very narrow; and
                    in some places the high grounds approach to the water’s edge. There are several
                    salmon-fisheries on this river belonging to different proprietors. The Derwent
                    rises among the frightful crags at the head of Borrowdale, in the southwest
                    range of mountains, whence it is dashed from rock to rock, till it reaches
                    Derwent Lake, from which it flows onward through Bassenthwaite water, and alter
                    being joined by the Cocker near Cockcrmouth, falls into the sea a little from
                    Workington. The scenery along the whole of its course is singularly varied and
                    interesting. The Caldew issues from the south-east side of Skiddaw, and joins
                    the Eden near Carlisle, after a course of twenty-four miles, in which it gives
                    motion to a number of cotton and corn mills. The vale through which it flows is
                    very beautiful, and its banks arc well wooded. The Esk enters Cumberland from
                    Scotland at a place called the <hi rend="italic">Moat,</hi> and, flowing in a
                    westerly direction by Longtown, falls into the Solway Frith; the Liddel, another
                    Scottish river, which, in part of its course, separates Cumberland from
                    Scotland, joins the Esk after it has passed into England.</p>
                <p>Landed property is much divided in this county, and the small estates are
                    commonly occupied by their owners. Most of them are held under the lords of
                    manors, by what is called <hi rend="italic">customary tenure,</hi> which
                    subjects them to the payment of fines and heriots on alienation, and on the
                    death of the lord or tenant, besides certain annual rents, and the performance
                    of a variety of degrading and vexatious services. According to the authors of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ayricul-tural Survey,</hi> printed in 1794, about two
                    thirds of the county were held by this tenure, in parcels worth from L.15 to
                    L.30 of yearly rent. On large estates, also, the farms were in general rather
                    small, few then reaching L.200 a year, possessed on verbal contracts or very
                    short leases, and burdened, like the small estates, with payments or services,
                    over and above a money rent; but leases for fourteen or twenty-one years are now
                    not uncommon. The live stock consists of horses of rather a small size; cattle
                    of the long-horned breed, with a few Galloways, to which, of late, the improved
                    short horns have been added by a few great proprietors; and sheep chiefly of the
                    blackfaced heath variety. In a mountainous district, at the head of the Duddon
                    and Esk rivers, there is a breed of sheep of a somewhat peculiar character, the
                    ewes and wethers, and many of the rams, being polled, their faces and legs
                    speckled, and the wool finer than that of the heath breed. They belong to the
                    proprietor of the lands, and have been farmed out with them from time immemorial
                    to <hi rend="italic">herds</hi> at a yearly rent; and from this circumstance, it
                    is said, have obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">Iierdwichs.</hi> There are
                    a number of small dairies, at which butter and skimmedmilk cheese are made; the
                    produce of each cow in butter is about two firkins of fifty-six pounds; and the
                    quantity sent out of the county was computed, in 1794, to bring in upwards of
                    L.30,000. All the common species of grain are cultivated, though in many
                    instances with little attention to system, corn crops being often taken for
                    several years in succession. Turnips and clovers do not yet enter into the
                    rotation in many parts of the county. Potatoes are extensively cultivated. That
                    excellent variety of oats called the potato oat is said to have been first
                    discovered in Cumberland in 1788, and whence it has now spread over every part
                    of the united kingdom. Among the farm implements the single-horse cart deserves
                    to be noticed, as being almost exclusively employed, and with great advantage,
                    as it is not only by far the most convenient and economical carriage for the
                    farmer, but is much less injurious to the public roads than the waggons and
                    heavily-loaded carts in other counties. The agriculture of this county has been
                    greatly indebted to Mr Curwen of Workington, both for the example he has given
                    on his own farms, and for the spirit of inquiry and experiment which has been
                    diffused by means of the Workington Society, of which he was the founder. His
                    yearly <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> meetings at Workington Hall were resorted
                    to by agriculturists from most <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754253"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4253-0537"/>parts of the kingdom. The conduct of his large
                    dairy near Workington, and the object of it, were alike deserving of
                    commendation.</p>
                <p>The principal manufactures of Cumberland are calicoes, corduroys, and other
                    cotton fabrics, established at Dalston, Carlisle, Warwick Bridge, and a few
                    other places. Cotton printing is carried on to some extent in Carlisle; the
                    manufacture of sail-cloth and cordage at Workington and Whitehaven; and checks
                    and coarse linens in several of the market towns. In this, as in other thinly
                    peopled and mountainous districts, domestic manufactures, such as woollen cloth,
                    stockings, &amp;c. supply a great part of the wants of the peasantry. The Seaton
                    iron-works, on the banks of the Derwent, above Workington, a manufactory of
                    coarse earthen-ware near Dearham, and paper mills in various parts of the
                    county, with breweries, and a soapwork at Carlisle, comprise all the other
                    manufacturing establishments of any note in this county.</p>
                <p>Cumberland abounds in minerals and fossils, from which a great part of its wealth
                    is drawn. The most valuable are coal, black lead, lead, copper, iron, slate, and
                    limestone.</p>
                <p>Coal is found at different places in the eastern mountains, and also near
                    Brampton in the northern part of the county, but in greatest abundance on the
                    west side of the river Caldew, and thence to Maryport, Workington, and
                    Whitehaven. A number of mines are constantly at work in this district,
                    particularly near Whitehaven and Workington. The principal entrance to the
                    coal-mines at Whitehaven is by an opening at the bottom of a hill, through a
                    long passage hewn in the rock, which, by a steep descent, leads down to the
                    lowest vein of coal. The greater part of this descent is through spacious
                    galleries, intersecting each other; all the coal being dug away, except large
                    pillars, which in deep parts of the mine are three yards high, and twelve yards
                    square at the base. The mines are sunk to the depth of a hundred and thirty
                    fathoms, one of them, the <hi rend="italic">King Pit,</hi> a hundred and sixty
                    fathoms, and extended under the sea to places where, above them, the water is of
                    sufficient depth for ships of great burthen. Four engines, when all working
                    together, discharge 1228 gallons of water every minute; another raises 9225
                    hogsheads every twenty-four hours. The seams all dip to the west about one yard
                    in ten. Mr Spedding, the engineer of these works, observing that the fire-damp
                    was not liable to be ignited by the sparks produced by the collision of flint
                    and steel, many years ago invented a machine, in which, while a steel wheel was
                    turned round with a very rapid motion, flints were applied to it, and, by the
                    abundance of sparks emitted, the miners were enabled to carry on their work,
                    where the flame of a lamp or candle would have occasioned explosions. But this
                    contrivance was found not to be an effectual preservative, and this gentleman
                    himself lost his life by one of those explosions which he had so sedulously
                    attempted to prevent. The well-known safety-lamps, now in general use, have been
                    more successful. About 90,000 chaldrons are said to be raised annually. There
                    are railways from the pits to the quay, over which large flues or <hi
                    rend="italic">hurries</hi> are placed, through which the contents of the waggons
                    are speedily discharged into the holds of the ships. The coals are exported to
                    Ireland and the west of Scotland. The coal-pits at Workington are from forty to
                    ninety fathoms deep. The uppermost seam is generally three feet thick, the
                    second four, and the third or lowest that has been hitherto worked from ten to
                    twelve feet.</p>
                <p>The famous black-lead mines are situated at the head of Borrowdale, in the
                    south-west range of mountains. The mineral is found in irregular masses,
                    generally imbedded in a blue rock, with a stratum of granite above it; and it is
                    only wrought occasionally, as the demand for it may require. At other times the
                    mines are protected from pilferers by a temporary wall within, and the house of
                    the steward is built over the entrance.</p>
                <p>The principal lead-mines are in Aidstone Moor, on the south-east borders of the
                    county. The ore is found in fissures nearly perpendicular, and not unfrequently
                    contains a considerable proportion of silver. The most considerable copper mines
                    are near Caldbeck, at Hesket New Market, in Borrowdale, and at Newlands in the
                    vicinity of Keswick; but they are not now wrought to a great extent. The ore is
                    commonly combined with sulphur, and usually contains both iron and arsenic. In
                    the parish of Egremont, at a place called Crowgarth, is the most singular mine
                    of iron ore supposed to be in Britain. It lies at the depth of twelve fathoms,
                    and the thickness of the band of ore is from twenty-four to twenty-five feet. In
                    1791 and 1792, the annual exportation from it to the Carron foundery in
                    Scotland, and others, was upwards of 20,000 tons. Very good slate is found in
                    the south-western mountains, and limestone in various parts of the county. Of
                    the latter, when calcined, the exportation to the west of Scotland used to be
                    very considerable. Among the mineral or fossil productions may be mentioned
                    marble, spar of various colours and forms, gypsum, steatites, and porcelain clay
                    or kaolin.</p>
                <p>Cumberland contains a number of towns, few of them large or populous. Carlisle,
                    Penrith, Wigton, Maryport, Cocker mouth, Workington, Whitehaven, Egremont, and
                    Keswick, are the most considerable. The exports, chiefly from Whitehaven,
                    Maryport, Workington, and Harrington, are coals, lime, butter, bacon, cured cod
                    for the Liverpool market, and salmon and potted char for London. Since the East
                    India trade was thrown open, Whitehaven has been among the first ports to embark
                    in it; and it has long possessed a share of the trade with America.</p>
                <p>The lakes and mountains of Cumberland have long attracted the admirers of the
                    wild and beautiful in natural scenery. The lakes, including smaller pieces of
                    water, called <hi rend="italic">tarns,</hi> are fifteen in number; the finest
                    are Ullswater, and Derwentwater or Keswick Lake. Unswater is partly situated in
                    Cumberland and partly in Westmoreland; it is about nine miles in length, and
                    from a quarter of a mile to one mile in breadth. Winding round the base of vast
                    rocky mountains, it is seen only in successive portions; the scenery on its
                    margin presenting new and striking objects at every stretch. The rocks in its
                    vicinity are celebrated for reverberating sounds. The report of a cannon
                    rebounds six or seven times, with pauses between, in which the sound of the
                    distant waterfall is for a moment heard. This lake contains fish of various
                    kinds, particularly trout, perch, and eels, and also char and gwinniard, the
                    last in considerable numbers. Derwent-water or Keswick Lake is of an irregular
                    figure, approaching to an oval, about three miles in length and one and a half
                    in breadth. It is seen at one view, expanding within an amphitheatre of
                    mountains, rocky but not vast; broken into many fantastic shapes; opening by
                    narrow valleys the view of rocks which rise immediately beyond, and are again
                    overlooked by others. Masses of wood frequently appear among the cliffs,
                    feathering them to their summits; and a white cottage sometimes peeps from out
                    their skirts, seated on the smooth knoll of a piece of pasture projecting
                    towards the lake. Its bosom is spotted by small islands, of which those called
                    Lord’s and St Herbert’s are well wooded. The celebrated Fall of Lowdore, on the
                    southern side of the lake, consists of a series of cascades, which rush over an
                    enormous pile of protruding crags, from the height of nearly 200 feet. What is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">floating island</hi> of Keswick is said to appear
                    occasionally on the side of the lake opposite to this fall, but only when the
                    water in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754266" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4266-0538"
                    />lake is high, and then scarcely a foot above the surface. No satisfactory
                    explanation has been given of this phenomenon. The size of the island seems,
                    according to different accounts, to vary; and its existence has not been
                    unfrequently denied altogether. The waters of this lake are sometimes agitated
                    in an extraordinary manner, without any apparent cause; and in a perfectly calm
                    day they are seen to swell in high waves, which have a progressive motion from
                    west to cast. This is ascribed to what, is called <hi rend="italic">bottom
                    wind.</hi> The swell sometimes continues for an hour or two only, at others
                    almost a whole day. Gilsland Spa, in the middle of a wild romantic valley,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Vale of Irthing,</hi> about eight miles south-east
                    of Bewcastle, has long been a place of considerable resort; and, independently
                    of the medicinal qualities of its springs, presents attractions to visitors,
                    particularly the painter and geologist, in the variety of its landscape and the
                    disposition of the strata, exposed in the banks of the river in its
                    vicinity.</p>
                <p>From the tops of the mountains in Cumberland, the views are alike extensive and
                    varied. The summit of Skiddaw brings under the eye the Irish Sea and the German
                    Ocean; a chaos of dark mountains at a distance, with lakes seen dimly at the
                    feet of the nearest, and a vast expanse of champaign country, bounded by the
                    Irish Channel, and traversed by silvery thread-like streams in every direction.
                    Upon the summits of the Cross-fell ridge there frequently hangs a vast volume of
                    clouds, reaching half way down towards the base of the fells. At some distance
                    from this <hi rend="italic">helm,</hi> as it is called, and opposite to it,
                    another cloud, called the <hi rend="italic">helm-bar,</hi> is seen in continual
                    agitation, whilst the helm itself remains motionless. When the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bar</hi> is dispersed, the wind rushes from the helm, often with great fury,
                    and sometimes on both sides of the mountains.</p>
                <p>The early history of this county is involved in obscurity. In the tenth century
                    it appears to have been in the possession of the Scots, but whether by a grant
                    from the crown of England or by conquest, has been matter of dispute. It was
                    long made the scene of plunder and bloodshed, by the savage incursions of both
                    kingdoms alternately. At a conference held at York, Henry III., in full
                    satisfaction of the claims of the Scots, agreed to assign lands to them of the
                    yearly value of L.200, within the counties of Northumberland and Cumberland, if
                    lands of that value could be found therein, without the limits of the towns
                    where castles were erected. But after this arrangement there still remained a
                    tract between the two kingdoms, called the <hi rend="italic">debateable
                    ground,</hi> the resort of the worst characters of both, who continued to
                    disturb the borders down to the union of the two crowns. Of the Druidical
                    antiquities of Cumberland the most remarkable is a circle of stones, about three
                    miles from Kirkoswald, called <hi rend="italic">Long Meg and her Daughters.</hi>
                    The Roman wall may still be traced from the neighbourhood of Carlisle, both to
                    the east and west, for some miles; where it enters Northumberland on the east,
                    it is in some places five, and in others eight feet in height. A great many
                    coins, altars, and other vestiges of antiquity, have been discovered at the
                    Roman stations on its line. In the mountainous parts, which have little
                    intercourse with towns, the manners of the people are somewhat peculiar; and in
                    the solitary dales, surrounded by the least accessible mountains, they have
                    perhaps undergone little alteration for centuries.</p>

                    post-town, and capital of Alleghany county, Maryland, on the Potowmac, at the
                    junction of Will’s Creek, seventy miles west of Hagerstown, 130 eastsouth-east
                    of Wheeling, and 150 west by north of Baltimore. It is a considerable town, and
                    contains a courthouse, a jail, a market-house, a bank, and several houses of
                    public worship. The mountains in the vicinity abound in stone and coal, great
                    quantities of which are transported down the Potowmac in flat and keel boats.
                    The Cumberland or great western road extends from this town to the banks of the
                    Ohio at Wheeling. It was made by the government of the United States, and a
                    survey has since been executed from thence to the Mississippi, 600 miles

                    near 200 miles, and for boats of fifteen tons 300 miles farther. At certain
                    seasons vessels of 400 tons may descend 400 miles to the Ohio.</p>

                    the parish of St Ann, near Aldersgate, in the year 1632. Having laid a proper
                    foundation of classical learning at St Paul’s school, he was removed to Magdalen
                    College, Cambridge, where in due time he took his degrees in arts, and obtained
                    a fellowship. He took the degree of A. B. in 1653; and having proceeded A. Μ. in
                    1656, he was next year incorporated to the same degree in the university of
                    Oxford.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Biograpliia
                    Britannica, vol. iv∙ p. 558.</p></note> For some time he applied himself <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194754279" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4279-0539"/> to the study of
                    physic; and although he did not adhere to this profession, he retained his
                    knowledge of anatomy and medicine. Mr Payne informs us that “lie distinguished
                    himself, whilst he was a fellow of the college, by the performance of his
                    academical exercises. He went out batchelor of divinity at a publick
                    commencement; and tho' it was hardly known that the same person performed those
                    great exercises twice, yet such was the expectation he had raised, that he was
                    afterwards sollicited to keep the act at another publick commencement for his
                    doctor’s degree.” He took the degree of B. D. in 1663, and that of D. D. in
                    1680.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cantabrigienses
                    Graduati, p. 113. Cantab. 1800, 4to.</p></note> Two of his contemporaries and
                    intimate friends were Dr Hezekiah Burton, a worthy clergyman, “who was early
                    lost to his family, his acquaintance, and the world,” and Dr Hollings, who
                    settled as a physician at Shrewsbury, and was there held in universal esteem.
                    There were other members of the same college with whom he likewise cultivated a
                    particular acquaintance; and among these were Sir Samuel Moreland, who was
                    distinguished by his knowledge of mathematics, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, who became
                    keeper of the great seal, and Mr Pepys, who for many years was secretary to the
                    admiralty, and who is well known by his posthumous Memoirs.</p>
                <p>To this academical connexion he appears to have been in a great measure indebted
                    for his subsequent advancement in the church. When Bridgeman was appointed lord
                    keeper, he nominated Cumberland and Burton as his chaplains, nor did he
                    afterwards neglect the interest of either. Cumberland’s first preferment was the
                    rectory of Brampton in Northamptonshire, which was bestowed upon him in 1658 by
                    Sir John Norwich. He then quitted the university, and went to reside on his
                    benefice, where he zealously devoted himself to the duties of his sacred office,
                    and to the prosecution of those abstruse studies to which he had long been
                    addicted. His chief relaxation consisted in occasional excursions to Cambridge,
                    for the purpose of maintaining those lettered friendships which he had formed in
                    early life, and probably for the purpose of consulting such books as his own
                    library could not supply. In 1661 he was appointed one of the twelve preachers
                    of the university. His character was very remote from that of a
                    preferment-hunter; and in this unambitious retirement he might have spent the
                    remainder of his life, if the lord keeper, who obtained his office in 1667, had
                    not invited him to London, and soon afterwards bestowed upon him the rectory of
                    Allhallows at Stamford. In this new situation, he acquired new credit by the
                    fidelity with which he discharged his important functions. In addition to his
                    ordinary duties, he undertook the weekly lecture, and thus was obliged to preach
                    thrice every week in the same church. This labour he constantly and assiduously
                    performed, and in the mean time found sufficient leisure, as well as
                    inclination, to prosecute his scientific and philological studies.</p>
                <p>At’ the mature age of forty, he published his earliest work, entitled “De Legibus
                    Naturae Disquisitio philosophica, in qua carum Forma, summa Capita, Ordo,
                    Promulgatio, et Obligatio e Rerum Natura investigantur; quin etiam Elementa
                    Philosophiae Hobbianae, cum moralis tum civilis, considerantur et refutantur.”
                    Lond. 1672, 4to. It is dedicated to Sir Orlando Bridgeman, and is prefaced by an
                    “Alloquium ad Lectorem,” contributed by the author’s friend Dr Burton.
                    Cumberland’s treatise is evidently the production of an acute and philosophical
                    mind, and entitles him to a very respectable place among writers on the
                    principles of natural law; but his speculations arc not entirely free from that
                    indistinctness which is too prevalent among those who have undertaken similar
                    enquiries. His arguments are chiefly directed against the Epicurean laxity of
                    Hobbes, whose writings on the elements of morality and politics, though of a
                    very debasing tendency, made a strong impression on his contemporaries. His
                    system was now opposed by another, which comprehends a more pleasing view of man
                    in his moral and social relations. “The most universal love, or most diffusive
                    benevolence, of all rational beings towards each other, constitutes the happiest
                    state they can be capable of; so that their endeavour of the common good, by
                    this benevolence, is the sum of all the laws of nature, and in which they are
                    all contained.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Cumberland was the only professed answerer of Hobbes. Some of this philosopher’s
                    notions on the principles of natural law were discussed by George Lawson, rector
                    of More in the county of Salop, who published “An Examination of the Political
                    Part of Mr Hobbs his Leviathan” Lond. 1657, 8vo. His speculations were formally
                    opposed by Roger Coke, in a volume which bears the following title: “Justice

                    suffrage must have had the effect of making it known on the continent. The book
                    was reprinted at Lübeck in 1683, and again in 1694. It was likewise reprinted at
                    Dublin. The style of the learned author has no particular recommendations; and
                    as his work was printed in London while he was residing at Stamford, the first
                    edition contains many typographical errors; nor are they removed in the
                    subsequent editions. Dr Bentley afterwards undertook to revise the entire text,
                    and, according to his grandson’s account, he most effectually performed this
                    task; but Barbeyrac, who had the use of the corrected copy, and who was a more
                    competent judge of its value, entertained a less favourable opinion. This copy
                    is now in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. The author’s family

                    executed by the learned Barbeyrac, who likewise enriched his native language by
                    transfusing into it the great works of Grotius and Pufendorf. “Traité

                <p>Having thus established a solid reputation, Dr Cumberland next prepared a work on
                    a very different subject; “An Essay towards the Recovery of the Jewish Measures

                    opinions were controverted without any mention of his name, in a work published
                    two years afterwards by Dr Bernard, professor of astronomy at Oxford, a man of
                    extensive and various erudition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    “writ some sheets to justify his calculations; but his averseness to anything
                    like wrangling made him lay them by, and leave his book to shift for it
                    self.”</p>
                <p>About this period, he was greatly depressed, like many other good men, by
                    apprehensions respecting the growth of popery; but his apprehensions were at
                    length dispelled by the Revolution, which likewise brought along with it another
                    material change in his circumstances. In the course of the year 1691, he went,
                    according to his custom on a post-day, to read the newspaper at a coffee-house
                    in Stamford, and there, to his great surprise, he read that the king had
                    nominated Dr Cumberland to the bishopric of Peterborough. This mode of bestowing
                    high preferment upon eminent and unobtrusive merit, must appear not a little
                    singular to those who are chiefly acquainted with ecclesiastical proceedings in
                    more recent times. The face of the bishop elect was scarcely known at court, and
                    he had resorted to none of the usual methods of advancing his temporal interest.
                    It is stated by his biographer that if the clergy had retained their ancient
                    privilege of electing their bishop, they would have made no other choice. “Being
                    then sixty years old,” says his great-grandson, ·“he was with difficulty
                    persuaded to accept the offer, when it came to him from authority. The
                    persuasion of his friends, particularly Sir Orlando Bridgeman, at length
                    overcame his repugnance; and to that see, though very moderately endowed, he for
                    ever after devoted himself, and resisted every offer of translation, though
                    repeatedly made and earnestly recommended. To such of his friends as pressed an
                    exchange upon him he was accustomed to reply, that Peterborough was his first
                    espoused, and should be his only one; and, in fact, according to his principles,
                    no church revenue could enrich him; für I have heard my father say, that, at the
                    end of every year, whatever overplus he found upon a minute inspection of his
                    accounts ’ was by him distributed to the poor, reserving only one small deposit
                    of twenty-five pounds in cash, found at his death in his bureau, with directions
                    to employ it for the discharge of his funeral expences; a sum, in his modest
                    calculation, fully sufficient to commit his body to the earth.”<note

                    of his new station he applied himself with great assiduity. He was a person of
                    studious and retiring habits, nor did the natural calmness of his temper
                    peculiarly fit him for the task of governing others; but if he erred in
                    practising too much lenity towards those who were placed under his jurisdiction,
                    he shewed no disposition to consult his own ease in the discharge of his various
                    functions. His charges to the clergy are described as plain and unambitious, the
                    earnest breathings of a pious mind. His old age was fresh and vigorous, nor did
                    he discontinue his episcopal visitations till after he attained his eightieth
                    year. When Dr Wilkins published the New Testament in Coptic, he presented a copy
                    to the bishop, who began to study the language after he had completed the age of
                    eighty-three. “At this age,” says his chaplain, “he master’d the language, and
                    went thro’ great part of this version, and would often give me excellent hints
                    and remarks, as he proceeded in reading of it.” He died in 1718, in the
                    eighty-seventh year of his age: he was found sitting in his library, in the
                    attitude of one asleep, and with a book in his hand.</p>
                <p>Bishop Cumberland was eminently distinguished by his gentleness and humility. He
                    was of a temper so cool and sedate, that it could not be roused to anger; and
                    through the whole course of his life, his soul is represented as having been in
                    a constant state of calmness and serenity, hardly ever ruffled by any passion.
                    The theory which lie maintains in his principal work, is founded on benevolence,
                    and it naturally flowed from the habitual temperament of the author’s mind. He
                    was a man of a sound understanding, improved by extensive learning, and has left
                    behind him several monuments of his talents and industry.</p>
                <p>The care of his posthumous publications devolved upon his domestic chaplain Mr
                    Payne, who soon after the bishop’s death edited “Sanchoniatho’s Phoenician
                    History, translated from the first book of Eusebius <hi rend="italic">De

                    remarks, proving them to contain a Scries of Phoenician and Egyptian Chronology,
                    from the first man to the first Olympiad, agreeable to the Scripture Accounts.”

                    writings of the author, which was likewise published in a separate form, and
                    exhibits a pleasing picture of his happy old age. The work itself is learned and
                    elaborate, and the researches of such a man could not be entirely fruitless; but
                    there is a material defect in the general design, inasmuch as it takes for
                    granted the genuineness of a book which has very frequently been considered as
                    spurious. It was treated as a fabrication by several of Cumberland’s
                    contemporaries, and, among others, by Dodwell and Van Dale;<note anchored="true"

                    Porphyry as a composition of great antiquity. “I cannot but think,” says
                    Dodwell, that “this author counterfeited purposely with a design of confronting
                    the antiquity of the Scripture. But who was the impostor, whether Philo Byblius

                    chaplain, S. Payne, A. Μ. rector of Barnack, and afterwards an archdeacon. The
                    bishop’s son, who inherited an estate which descended from his grandfather, had
                    two sons and a daughter. The latter was married to Waring Ashby, Esq. of Quenby
                    Hall in the county of Leicester. Richard, the elder son, died unmarried at the
                    age of twenty-nine. The younger, named Denison from his mother, married Joanna
                    the daughter of Dr Bentley, and became successively bishop of Clonfert and
                    Kilmore. He was the father of the late Richard Cumberland. (x.)</p>

                    and miscellaneous writer, was born at Cambridge on the 29th February 1722. He
                    was the great-grandson of the Bishop of Peterborough, and he first saw the light
                    under the roof of his maternal grandfather, Dr Bentley, in the master’s lodge,
                    Trinity College. When he had completed his sixth year, he was sent to the school
                    at Bury St Edmunds, but for some time he made little progress in his learning,
                    and it cost the master some trouble to awaken in him a proper spirit of
                    emulation. This, however, was at length accomplished by publicly reproving him
                    for his negligence; and, being thus roused to exertion, he soon found his tasks
                    a pleasure rather than a burden. Whilst he remained at this school his
                    grandfather Bentley died, and he was thereby deprived of the advantage which he
                    might otherwise have reaped from the guidance and direction of the ablest
                    scholar of the age. In his school exercises young Cumberland describes himself
                    as aiming at something like fancy and invention; but this tendency seems to have
                    betrayed him into grammatical inaccuracies which did him little credit with his
                    master, and indeed exposed him to comments which he felt most acutely. He was
                    not, however, very greatly discouraged by these strictures; for having made an
                    excursion with his family, during the summer holidays, to visit a relation in
                    Hampshire, he wrote a poem on the subject, in which he introduced a description
                    of the docks at Portsmouth, and of the races at Winchester. This being his first
                    regular attempt in English verse, he exhibited it to his father, who received it
                    with unreserved commendation, and persisted, with pardonable partiality, in
                    reciting it to his friends long after the author had gained experience enough to
                    wish it consigned to oblivion. From the school of Bury St Edmunds young
                    Cumberland was transferred to Westminster, where he remained about a year and a
                    half, and profited much, particularly in point of composition. He was then sent
                    to Cambridge, where he was admitted of Trinity College when he was only in his
                    fourteenth year. At first he had two tutors, who paid little attention to his
                    studies; but this inconvenience being soon felt, the head master, Dr Smith, in
                    the last year of his under-graduate condition, recommended him to lose no time
                    in preparing for his degree, and to apply closely to his studies during the
                    remainder of the year. He did so, and worked with such indefatigable
                    perseverance, that, though his health suffered severely in consequence, a high
                    station was adjudged him among the wranglers of his year, and he obtained his
                    bachelor’s degree. This was in the year 1750. With the return of health he
                    resumed his studies, and, without neglecting those in which he had recently been
                    engaged, recurred to the authors who had lain untouched during his course of
                    academical preparation.</p>
                <p>Cumberland had early accustomed himself to read upon system, and now began to
                    form collections on the various subjects of his pursuits. With this view he got
                    together the different tracts relative to the celebrated controversy between
                    Boyle and Bentley respecting the epistles of Phalaris, omitting none of the
                    authorities and passages referred to, and compressed the reasonings on both
                    sides into a sort of digest or report upon the question in dispute. But he was
                    perhaps more agreeably employed in reading the Greek tragedians; and when Mason
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Elfrida,</hi> he planned and wrote, in imitation
                    of that drama, a production of which Caractacus was the hero, with a chorus
                    consisting of bards and druids. About this time, his health being still
                    indifferent, he accompanied his family in an excursion to York, where he passed
                    half a year in the society and amusements of the place; hunting in the mornings,
                    dancing in the evenings, and devoting but little time to study. Having got hold
                    of the Faery Queen, however, he began at intervals to write stanzas in the
                    Spenserian measure; and he also composed short elegies in the same manner; but
                    his mother having disapproved of these occupations, he relinquished them, and
                    prepared to devote himself to more serious pursuits.</p>
                <p>On his return to college young Cumberland was invited to the master’s lodge by Dr
                    Smith, who informed him of a new arrangement which had been determined on for
                    annulling as much of the existing statutes as restricted all bachelors except
                    those of the third year’s standing, from becoming candidates for fellowships;
                    and recommended him to present himself for examination, as, at the next
                    election, he would be in the second year of his degree. Grateful for this
                    friendly advice, he was preparing to resume his studies with increased alacrity,
                    when he received an invitation from Lord Halifax to become private and
                    confidential secretary to that nobleman. He accordingly proceeded to town, where
                    he remained some time, and afterwards <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754318"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4318-0542"/>returned to Cambridge, where, after a severe
                    examination, he was elected fellow, along with Mr Orde, afterwards a master in
                    Chancery, to the exclusion of two candidates of the year above them. On his
                    return to town he lived as retired as if he had been still resident in his
                    college. His first offering to the press, which appeared about this time, was a
                    churchyard elegy in imitation of Gray’s, but, as might be expected, greatly
                    inferior in poetical merit. It seems to have made almost no impression. “The
                    public,” he observes, “were very little interested with it, and Dodsley as
                    little profited.” Whilst he was with Lord Halifax he met with Mr Charles
                    Townshend, then one of the lords of trade, to whom he first recommended himself
                    by the solution of some enigma or puzzle, and afterwards by revising and writing
                    remarks on a report drawn up by Mr Townshend, which had been put into his hands
                    for that purpose. About this time also lie employed himself in collecting
                    materials for a poem in heroic verse on the subject of India; but the design he
                    afterwards abandoned as unsuitable; a circumstance which, judging from the
                    specimen preserved. in his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> respecting the
                    discoveries of the Portuguese, can excite but little regret.</p>
                <p>About this time he contracted an intimacy with Mr Bubb Dodington, and became a
                    frequent guest at La Trappe, the residence of that eccentric personage, whom lie
                    also visited in London. This was perfectly agreeable to Lord Halifax, who not
                    only lived upon intimate terms with Mr Dodington, but was then forming some
                    opposition connections, having resigned his office as first lord of trade and
                    plantations, and detached himself from the Duke of Newcastle’s administration.
                    Cumberland also accompanied Mr Dodington to his seat of Eastbury, in
                    Dorsetshire, where he remained some time, and enjoyed ample opportunities of
                    observing the character of his host, of which he has given a very interesting
                    and graphic description in his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs.</hi> On bis return
                    from Dorsetshire, he offered himself for a lay fellowship, then vacant, in
                    Trinity College, Cambridge, and succeeded in attaining the object of his
                    ambition; but he did not hold it long, owing to the condition of celibacy
                    annexed to it. About this time he produced his first legitimate drama, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Banishment of Cicero,</hi> a performance of some merit, but
                    wholly unfit for representation. It was accordingly rejected by Garrick, and
                    published by the author as a dramatic poem in 1761, 4to. In the beginning of
                    1759, he married Elizabeth, the only daughter of George Ridge, Esq. of
                    Kilouston, to whom he had paid his addresses on receiving through Lord Halifax
                    an appointment as crown agent for Nova Scotia. On the accession of George III.
                    Cumberland addressed a poem in blank verse to the young sovereign; and when Lord
                    Halifax was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, he accompanied that nobleman
                    as Ulster secretary, while his father was made one of the vice-regal chaplains.
                    This brought him in contact with the celebrated William Gerard Hamilton, better
                    known by the name of Single-speech Hamilton, who, having neither received his
                    appointment from Lord Halifax, nor been in the first instance altogether
                    acceptable to that nobleman, rendered Cumberland’s situation exceedingly
                    unpleasant. But the latter, notwithstanding, acquitted himself so well that,
                    towards the close of the session, the lord-lieutenant expressed his satisfaction
                    with Cumberland’s services, and offered him a baronetcy, which, however, he
                    judiciously declined; a circumstance which, he thinks, contributed to weaken his
                    interest with Lord Halifax. Why such an honour should have been offered to a
                    young man just commencing the career of public life, and wholly unprovided for,
                    it is not easy to conjecture. It appears, however, that when his patron
                    afterwards became secretary of state, he applied in vain for the situation of
                    under secretary, and only obtained the clerkship of reports in the office of
                    trade and plantations under Lord Hillsborough.</p>
                <p>The success with which Bickerstaff had brought forward his operas of <hi
                    rend="italic">Love in a Village</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Maid of the
                    Mill,</hi> induced Cumberland to attempta drama of the same description, under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">The Summers Tale;</hi> but although the music had
                    been composed by Bach, Arne, Arnold, and Simpson, it was performed, with little
                    applause, only for nine or ten nights. Subsequently, however, the author cut it
                    down to an afterpiece in two acts, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amelia,</hi> in which form it met with tolerable success. The drama was
                    published in 1765 and the afterpiece in 1768. His next production was the comedy
                    of <hi rend="italic">The Brothers,</hi> which was brought out at Covent-Garden,
                    well received by the audience, and published in 1769. He now began to plan and
                    compose <hi rend="italic">The West Indian,</hi> which he completed before
                    leaving Ireland; and on his return to London he entered into an engagement with
                    Garrick to bring it out at his theatre, but he at the same time availed himself
                    of the manager’s suggestions, by adding a new scene, and introducing other
                    improvements. This piece, which appeared in 1771, proved eminently successful,
                    although the moral of the plot is far from being unexceptionable. Cumberland
                    next entered the lists of controversy, by publishing a pamphlet containing
                    animadversions upon a character of Dr Bentley, which had been drawn by Bishop
                    Lowth, in a letter addressed to the author of the Divine Legation of Moses
                    demonstrated. This pamphlet passed through two editions, but elicited no
                    reply.</p>
                <p>About the same time he was admitted into a literary society, the members of which
                    used to dine together upon stated days at the British coffee-house; and at one
                    of these meetings it was suggested to him to delineate the character of a North
                    Briton, as he had already done those of an Irishman and of a West Indian. He
                    availed himself of the hint, and in consequence drew the character of Colin
                    Macleod in his comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Fashionable Lover</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but the attempt, as might have been expected, proved a
                    total failure, owing, no doubt, to the author’s entire ignorance of the
                    distinctive peculiarities of the people of whom Colin Macleod was intended to be
                    the representative. This comedy, though in point of composition superior to the
                    <hi rend="italic">West Indian,</hi> did not meet with equal success; and the
                    author resented the criticisms made upon it with that sensitive jealousy which
                    latterly induced Garrick to call him “the man without a skin.” Throughout his
                    whole life, indeed, he evinced a soreness to criticism, which necessarily
                    exposed him to the very infliction which he dreaded so much and felt so acutely.
                    His comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Choleric Man</hi> proved more successful,
                    but exposed him to the charge of venting illiberal and contemptuous sarcasms
                    against his contemporaries; a charge which he endeavoured to rebut by prefixing
                    to the play, when he published it, a “dedication to Detraction, directed chiefly
                    against an Essay on the Theatre,” in which a comparison was drawn between
                    laughing and sentimental comedy, and under the latter description some severe
                    observations were pointed against <hi rend="italic">The Fashionable Lover.</hi>
                    Cumberland’s next dramatic production was <hi rend="italic">Timon</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of Athens,</hi> altered from Shakspeare, in which the parts of
                    Evanthe and Alcibiades were, the former nearly, and the latter altogether, new,
                    and which, although it has now fallen into neglect, was favourably received at
                    the time. The entertainment called <hi rend="italic">The Note of Hand, or Trip
                    to Newmarket,</hi> was the last of his pieces produced by Garrick, before
                    disposing of his property in Drury-Lane. It is only remarkable as containing
                    another sketch of Hibernian character, though on a smaller scale than the former
                    one. The tragedy entitled <hi rend="italic">The Battle of Hastings</hi> was
                    brought out under the direction of Mr Sheridan, and published in 1778.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754331" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4331-0543"/>
                <p>Cumberland’s prospects now began to brighten. On Lord George Germaine’s accession
                    to office, he was appointed secretary to the board of trade, with an income
                    which could not but be acceptable to the father of six children; and he was
                    particularly noticed by his lordship, who continued his friend and patron till
                    death. He afterwards resided at Tetworth, in Bedfordshire, in the vicinity of
                    Lady Frances Burgoyne, sister of Lord Halifax, and during one of the summer
                    recesses he passed there he wrote bis opera of <hi rend="italic">Calypso,</hi>
                    which was brought out at Covent-Garden with indifferent success. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Widow of Delphi,</hi> which he wrote the following season, has
                    never been printed, although the author considered it as one of his very best
                    productions. <hi rend="italic">The Bondsman,</hi> a tragi-comedy, and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Duke of Milan,</hi> altered, also remain in manuscript,
                    probably without any great detriment to literature.</p>
                <p>In 1780, Cumberland was sent on a confidential mission to the courts of Madrid
                    and Lisbon; but this appointment, however honourable in itself, seems to have
                    been the source of all his future troubles, and to have embittered the remainder
                    of his long life. The direct object of his mission was to induce the court of
                    Spain to enter into a separate treaty with this country; but, although his
                    conduct gave satisfaction to the Spanish court, and procured him the confidence
                    and favour of the Spanish king, yet, owing to the disturbances which at this
                    time broke out in London, and other untoward circumstances, he failed in
                    accomplishing the object of his mission, and was recalled, in 1781, after having
                    contracted, in the public service, a debt of nearly L.5000, which Lord North’s
                    ministry meanly refused, or at least neglected to pay, and which ultimately
                    absorbed the whole of his hereditary property. It has been asserted indeed that
                    he exceeded his powers, and compromised the ministry which had employed him; but
                    of this no evidence whatever has been produced, and the losses to which he was
                    subjected certainly amounted to a punishment much too severe for a mere error in
                    judgment. It appears, in fact, that on his journey homewards his bills were
                    stopped, and his credit rendered so utterly bankrupt, that he would have been
                    thrown into prison at Bayonne, had not a fellow traveller advanced him a sum
                    sufficient to enable him to pursue his journey through France. Nor did his
                    misfortunes end even here. Mr Burke’s economical bill having annihilated the
                    board of trade, Mr Cumberland lost his situation, and was forced toretire with a
                    compensation allowance, which, as is usual in such cases, was far from being
                    adequate to the emoluments of the office of which he had been deprived.
                    Resolved, however, to accommodate himself to circumstances which he could not
                    control, he now fixed his residence at Tunbridge Wells, and made reductions in
                    his establishment proportioned to his diminished income.</p>
                <p>His first publication, after his return from Spain, was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anecdotes of eminent Painters in Spain,</hi> a curious and interesting work,
                    which he afterwards rendered more complete by the publication of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Catalogue of the King of Spain’s Paintings.</hi> The Anecdotes
                    were published in 1782, in two vols. 12mo; the Catalogue appeared in 1787. His
                    comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Walloons,</hi> which he had written before
                    settling at Tunbridge Wells, was brought out at Covent Garden Theatre, and
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">The Mysterious Husband</hi> in 1783, as well as by
                    a tragedy entitled <hi rend="italic">The Arab,</hi> which was acted once only,
                    for the benefit of an actor. In 1783 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Letter to
                    the Bishop of Llandaff,</hi> on his lordship’s proposal for equalizing the
                    revenues of the established church; and in 1785 were brought out his tragedy of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Carmelite</hi> and his comedy of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Natural Son.</hi> The collection of essays under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Observer,</hi> were also first printed experimentally in 1785, in two vols.
                    I2mo; but a new edition, considerably augmented, appeared in five volumes the
                    following year; and when this was exhausted he made another arrangement of the
                    essays, and, having incorporated therewith his translation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Clouds</hi> of Aristophanes, published the whole in six volumes. These
                    papers have since been included in the collection of the British Essayists. His
                    other productions of this period are a <hi rend="italic">Character</hi> of his
                    patron Lord Sackville, and a trashy pamphlet, published anonymously, entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Curtius</hi><hi rend="italic">rescued from the Gulf,</hi>
                    being an attempt at defending some one against an attack made on him by Dr Parr.

                    >Arundel,</hi> a novel in two vols. 12mo, appeared in 1789; in 1792 he published
                    <hi rend="italic">Calvary, or the Death of Christ,</hi> a poem in eight books,
                    4to; and, in 1795, he produced another novel, in four volumes 12mo, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Henry,</hi> a production on which he bestowed more
                    care and attention than on <hi rend="italic">Arundel,</hi> the hasty effusion of
                    a few weeks of leisure at Brighton. Cumberland is also the author of some works
                    of a serious cast, particularly a version of fifty of the Psalms of David, <hi
                    rend="italic">A few plain Reasons why we should believe in Christ,</hi> a
                    considerable number of sermons, numerous prayers, and metrical versions of
                    passages selected from the Old Testament.</p>
                <p>But the drama was the field which had the greatest attraction for “the Terence of
                    England.” In 1793 he brought out a comic opera in three acts, founded on the
                    story of Wat Tyler; but the lord chamberlain having objected to it, he was
                    obliged to recast and produce it under the title of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Armourer.</hi> His comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Country Attorney</hi> was
                    produced in the same year, at the summer theatre, when under the direction of
                    the elder Colman; and here also, in 1794, were brought out his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Box Lobby Challenge,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Don Pedro.</hi> At the opening
                    of the new theatre in Drury Lane was represented his comedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Jew,</hi> which he wrote with great rapidity, but which had for its object
                    to disabuse the public mind of unjust prejudices against the character of a
                    people who have so long been without a country, and who have either been
                    persecuted or reviled in almost every country where they have sojourned. His
                    celebrated comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Wheel of Fortune Cŭrne</hi> out in
                    the preceding season, and was closely followed by another called <hi
                    rend="italic">First Love.</hi> In 1796, <hi rend="italic">Days of Yore,</hi> a
                    drama, was produced at Covent Garden; and, in 1795, <hi rend="italic">The Last
                    of the Family,</hi> a comedy, was brought out at Drury Lane. Five other comedies
                    were also produced successively by this prolific writer, namely, <hi
                    rend="italic">False Impressions, The Word of Nature, The Dependant, The
                    Eccentric Lover,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Sailor s Daughter</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> of which the first was represented at Covent Garden, and
                    the last at Drury-Lane. In the year 1806 he brought out <hi rend="italic">Hints
                    for Husbands,</hi> a comedy, which was performed at Covent Garden, but had a run
                    of five nights only; and in the same year he published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mernoirs of his own Life,</hi> to which he afterwards added a supplement. He
                    was also concerned in <hi rend="italic">The Ex-odiad,</hi> an epic poem, now
                    forgotten; <hi rend="italic">John de Lancaster,</hi> a novel, in 3 volumes; and
                    <hi rend="italic">Joanna of Montfaucon,</hi> a dramatic romance, neither of them
                    productions of any merit. He was likewise the conductor of <hi rend="italic">The
                    London Review,</hi> a critical journal established on the French plan of
                    affixing to each article the name of the writer; but the attempt did not
                    succeed.</p>
                <p>From the time when Mr Cumberland retired from public life and fixed his residence
                    at Tunbridge Wells, he devoted himself entirely to literary pursuits, and
                    produced the various works we have enumerated. Here also he lost his wife, who
                    had so long been the partner of his joys and sorrows; but he bore the
                    bereavement with the resignation of a man of sense, convinced that patience is
                    no mark of insensibility, nor the parade of lamentation any evidence of the
                    sincerity or permanence of grief. During the alarm <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194754344" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4344-0544"/>of invasion he caught the
                    patriotic infection of the time, and having headed two companies of volunteer
                    infantry, received the commission of major-commandant. His latter days were
                    spent chiefly in London, where, on the 7th of May 1811, he expired after a short
                    illness, at the house of a friend in Bedford Place, being then in the
                    eighty-ninth year of his age. The last act of his life was the publication of a
                    poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Retrospection,</hi> embracing opinions of men
                    and things which are much more fully and satisfactorily treated in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs.</hi><hi rend="italic">Of</hi> the personal character of
                    Cumberland a pretty accurate judgment may be formed from his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs.</hi> His self-esteem was great, and his vanity overweening, but,
                    although extremely sensitive to criticism, and intolerant of censure, he had no
                    real malignity in his composition, and, like most excitable persons, seems to
                    have been as placable as he was irritable. His temperament was of a kind which,
                    if easily disturbed, as quickly recovered its balance; and there is every reason
                    to believe that the predominant tone of his feelings was alike generous and
                    liberal. On the only occasion of his life where his moral principles were put to
                    the test they appeared to the very greatest advantage. His conduct respecting
                    the bequest of Mr Reynolds, who had devised to Mr Cumberland his estate, to the
                    exclusion of the natural heir, evinced the greatest disinterestedness, and the
                    highest sense of honour and probity. It was his misfortune to have been bred a
                    courtier, and never to have taken his degrees in that school. He evidently
                    wanted the suppleness and versatility necessary to ensure success in such a
                    career. In a subordinate station, which merely required attention to formal and
                    technical duties, he acquitted himself indifferently well; but, in venturing to
                    act as minister, he found himself wofully deficient in those qualities without
                    the possession of which genius and talents are of little avail. At the same
                    time, having associated with most of the eminent men of his time, the sketches
                    and anecdotes which he has introduced into his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>
                    are in the highest degree interesting; whilst his habits of observing and
                    discriminating character give to his delineations an authority, and consequently
                    a value, which it is difficult to over-estimate. In society his chief aim was to
                    plcase; and, by the admission of his contemporaries, few men appeared to more
                    advantage in conversation, or evinced a more perfect mastery, when he chose to
                    exercise it, of the art of pleasing. The great faults of his character were a
                    tendency to lavish hollow compliments on those who were present, and a
                    propensity, without provocation or necessity, to indulge in bitter sarcasms
                    against individuals after they had taken their departure. That this was the
                    result of mere recklessness, or of a desire to provoke or minister to mirth, may
                    be readily believed; but, by giving way to so unfortunate a bias, he lost more
                    than he gained; and, although his address was studied, polite, and courtly, his
                    character for sincerity became depreciated beyond all recovery. As a writer, he
                    is more remarkable for the number than for the excellence of his works; but many
                    of them, it should be remembered, were hastily produced in order to better his
                    income, and some of them are marked by no ordinary degree of intellectual power.
                    In every variety of fortune the drama was his favourite pursuit; and if he has
                    produced much that is perishable or forgotten, he has also evolved creations
                    which have been enregistered as among the finest efforts of genius. The
                    character of Penruddock in <hi rend="italic">The Wheel of Fortune, for</hi>
                    example, is a masterpiece, which received a double consecration from the
                    histrionic talents of John Kemble, by whom it was so often and so nobly
                    personated. As a poet he cannot by any means rank high; for, while he had a play
                    of imagination, which unfitted him for the concerns ßf actual life and business,
                    his warmest admirers can only claim for him the praise of correct versification
                    and elegant sentiment, which, however, has secured for some of his poetical
                    works a considerable share of popularity. With regard to his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observer,</hi> now that he has acknowledged how much he borrowed from the
                    manuscripts of his grandfather Bentley, we need scarcely say that it no longer
                    supports his pretensions as a Greek critic. His learning was shallow, and, like
                    his wit, it was often taken at second hand. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
