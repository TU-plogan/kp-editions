                <p><label type="entry">COPERNICUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Nicolas</hi></label>, was
                    born at Thorn, in Prussia, on the 19th February 1473. Zernecke, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle of Thorn,</hi> affirms that he was the son of a peasant
                    serf, and that his name was Zopernick; but the commonly received opinion is,
                    that he was descended from a family of distinction in that part of the Prussian
                    territory; and, indeed, the circumstances of his education are incompatible with
                    the supposition of his having been of servile origin. The first elements of
                    learning he acquired in his paternal mansion, where he seems to have been
                    initiated in the rudiments of Greek and Latin; and he then went to prosecute his
                    studies at Cracow, where he applied himself to philosophy and medicine, and
                    ultimately took the degree of doctor in the latter department of science. But
                    having, from his earliest years, evinced a strong passion for the mathematics,
                    he followed with avidity the lessons which he received, and soon signalized
                    himself by uncommon proficiency therein. He also studied astronomy, and
                    familiarized himself with the use of the instruments then employed in
                    astronomical observations. At that time, Regiomontanus enjoyed the highest
                    reputation as an astronomer; and so much was Copernicus dazzled with the lustre
                    which this celebrated man had shed upon the science of which he was accounted so
                    great a master, that the young enthusiast resolved to undertake a journey
                    into</p>
                <p>Italy for the purpose of visiting him; and, in order that he might profit to the
                    utmost by his tour, he applied himself to painting and design, in which he made
                    considerable progress. At the age of twenty-three he set out for Italy, and
                    passed some time at Bologna, whore he attended the prelections of the astronomer
                    Dominico Maria, and also made some astronomical observations. He then proceeded
                    to Rome, where he was kindly received by Regiomontanus, and honoured with his
                    friendship, as he had previously been with that of Professor Maria at Bologna.
                    Here he was appointed to a chair of mathematics, which he filled with much
                    distinction, continuing at the same time to extend both his knowledge and his
                    reputation. But after some years he·returned to his native country, where he was
                    most favourably received on account of his great acquirements, combined with the
                    simplicity and amenity of his manners. At length he took up his residence at
                    Frauenburg, where his uucle, Bishop of Warmia, procured him a canonry. But owing
                    to the conflicting claims and unjust pretensions of others, this situation did
                    not immediately afford him the leisure and tranquillity which it promised, and
                    he was for some time involved in ungrateful disputes and vexatious contentions.
                    His clear right, however, aided by his firmness and constancy, soon carried him
                    through all his difficulties; and he afterwards enjoyed that peaceful calm alike
                    congenial to his disposition, and favourable to the pursuit in which he had so
                    zealously embarked. Having accomplished this object, he then divided his time
                    into three portions, one of which he employed in assisting in the divine
                    offices, another in dispensing medical advice gratuitously to the poor, and a
                    third in the prosecution of his favourite studies. The house which he then
                    occupied is still to be seen at Allenstein, with the perforations which he had
                    made in the walls of his chamber in order to observe the passage of the stars
                    across the meridian; and there are also shown the remains of a hydraulic
                    machine, similar to that at Marly, which he had constructed for the purpose of
                    raising the water of a rivulet for the supply of Frauenburg. But although he
                    lived in a state of retirement and seclusion, devoted to his clerical duties and
                    the pursuits of science, this did not prevent him from undertaking the
                    administration of the temporalities of the bishopric, which was several times
                    confided to him during vacancies of the see; a trust which required both probity
                    and courage, and which he executed in a manner highly honourable to his
                    character. He had, in fact, to defend the rights and privileges of the bishopric
                    against the encroachments of the Teutonic knights, who were then very powerful;
                    and this duty he discharged without being either dazzled by their authority or
                    intimidated by their threats. We mention this, foreign as it may seem to the
                    object of a notice like the present, in order to show that the spirit of study
                    and contemplation was, in his character, united with firmness and constancy;
                    qualities which are not less necessary than genius for attacking and subverting
                    prejudices, hallowed, as it were, by the belief or the credulity of ages. <hi

                <p>Copernicus had seen and conversed with the most celebrated astronomers of his own
                    time. He knew the labours of the ancients, and he was also astonished at the
                    complication of their systems, no less than the discordance and want of symmetry
                    which these supposed in the arrangement of the universe. He therefore determined
                    to reexamine all these systems, to study them comparatively, to distinguish in
                    each whatever might seem most probable as well as natural, and to try whether it
                    might not be possible to combine the whole in a single system, at once more
                    symmetrical and more simple. Amidst the variety of hypotheses which thus engaged
                    his attention, two forcibly struck his mind, and therefore deserve particular<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194751289?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1289-0309"/>
                    attention ;—that of the Egyptians, who made Mercury and Venus revolve round the
                    sun, but who nevertheless carried Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Sun himself,
                    round the earth ;—and that of Apollonius Pergaeus, who chose the sun as the
                    common centre of all the planetary movements, but who made that luminary revolve
                    round the earth like the moon; an arrangement which afterwards became the basis
                    of the system of Tycho Brahe. The circumstance which particularly fixed the
                    attention of Copernicus on these hypotheses was, that they represented admirably
                    the limited excursions of Mars and Venus around the sun, and explained their
                    movements, direct, stationary, and retrograde; an advantage, indeed, which the
                    hypothesis of Apollonius extended even to the superior planets. Thus the
                    astronomical systems were already to him only playthings of fancy. He had tried
                    them by the test of cxpe-rimentand observation; he had found the conditions
                    which it was necessary they should satisfy; and as he knew the means by which
                    alone they were to be judged of, the most difficult part of his discovery was
                    already made. On the other hand, he saw that the Pythagoreans had removed the
                    earth from the centre of the world, and had there placed the sun; and hence it
                    appeared to him that the system of Apollonius would become more simple and
                    symmetrical by only changing this circumstance; namely, rendering the sun fixed
                    in the centre, and making the earth to revolve around him. He had also perceived
                    that Nicetas, Heraclides, and other philosophers, in placing the earth in the
                    centre of the world, had ventured to give it a movement of rotation round its
                    axis, in order to produce the phenomena of the rising and setting of the stars,
                    and the alternations of day and night; nor could he fail to be even more
                    forcibly struck with the bold conception of Philolaus, who, removing the earth
                    from the centre of the world, had not only given it a movement of rotation round
                    an axis, but also a movement of annual circulation or revolution round the sun;
                    and although it might then appear difficult, and even absurd, to displace the
                    earth from the centre, in order to make it a simple planet, nevertheless, as he
                    observed that the astronomers had hitherto conceived themselves at liberty to
                    imagine circles in the heavens to represent the celestial phenomena, he thought
                    that he might in like manner be permitted to try if he could invent some other
                    arrangement which would establish a more simple order in the movement of the
                    heavenly bodies. And thus, taking in each system whatever was true, and
                    rejecting whatever was false and complicated, he at length composed that
                    admirable whole, which is now called, after him, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Copernican System,</hi> and which is, in reality, the true arrangement of the
                    planetary movements, such as it has been established by evidence which can never
                    be shaken.</p>
                <p>About the year 1507 Copernicus began to digest the ideas of which we have here
                    traced the gradual formation, and to write down his discoveries; but, as has
                    been already observed, he did not confine himself to general appearances, nor
                    remain satisfied with their accordance or conformity to the great law which he
                    had thus detected. He felt that, to prove his system, it was necessary to enter
                    into detail, and even to calculate particular phenomena, in order to deduce
                    therefrom tables of all the celestial notions; and thus to afford the means of
                    predicting them with all the simplicity and precision which the grandness of the
                    conception itself, and the first trials which it had undergone, seemed equally
                    to promise. This was the labour of his whole life. He set himself to make
                    observations;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In 1540,
                    Tycho Brahe sent Olaus, one of his pupils, to measure at Frauenburg the height
                    of the pole on the tower where Copernicus had made his observations. He also
                    preserved with religious care the parallactic instrument, composed of two wooden
                    rules, divided each into 1414 parts, which Copernicus had himself constructed
                    for his own use.</p></note> he collected and combined those which had been made
                    by others; and, in particular, he studied to deduce from his theory those
                    phenomena of the system of the world which had hitherto appeared the most
                    complicated, such as the stations and retrogressions of the planets, and the
                    precession of the equinoxes. Lastly, when he conceived that he had-accumulated
                    sufficient observations and proofs, he undertook to expound the whole of his
                    discoveries, in a work divided into six books, and entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Orbium</hi><hi rend="italic">Calestium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Revolutionibus,</hi> in which he unfolds his ideas nearly in the
                    order in which we have here endeavoured topresent them, and subjects the whole
                    of astronomy to the dominion of a single principle or law. It appears that this
                    work was completed about the year 1530, when Copernicus had attained the age of
                    fiftyseven; and it certainly forms one of the proudest monuments of genius and
                    sagacity, happily united with patient thinking and persevering research, which
                    any age or country has produced. '</p>
                <p>The fame <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his discoveries had already been bruited
                    abroad; the most celebrated astronomers became impatient to see them fully
                    developed, and he was pressed to publish them to the world; but, resisting all
                    importunities, he still deferred, correcting daily the data with which more
                    exact observations furnished him, and adding whatever further reflection
                    supplied: perhaps, also, he was afraid to endanger his peace, by submitting
                    himself to the judgment of his contemporaries; and this apprehension was
                    unhappily but too well founded. There is nothing so confident in itself, or so
                    intolerant, as ignorance. Show the truth to men, and if the object interest them
                    but little, they will perhaps pardon your doing so; but if you wish to root from
                    their minds an opinion which they have long admitted without question, and
                    believed without inquiry, be it a prejudice ever so groundless and untenable,
                    the fact of their having constantly admitted it is of itself sufficient to
                    offend their pride, perhaps even to arm their hostility, against him who may
                    have proved himself more cautious or more sceptical than themselves. Of this <hi
                    rend="italic">we</hi> have a striking example in the case of Copernicus. Whilst
                    the most distinguished men of learning and science, the only proper judges in
                    sueh matters, ranged themselves on the side of the new discoveries, the common
                    herd were discomposed by them, and attempted either to denounce them as
                    extravagant, or to represent them as absurd and chimerical. Copernicus, in fact,
                    was about to be publicly ridiculed in a comedy, as Socrates had been by
                    Aristophanes; but the respectable character of this great man, perhaps also the
                    silence which he had hitherto observed, preserved him from this insult, and he
                    who had so unworthily attacked him became an object of general contempt. After
                    this need we be astonished that Galileo and Descartes were persecuted, and that
                    even Newton should have hesitated to give his great discoveries to the world?
                    Nevertheless, Copernicus seems to have felt that, in delaying longer the
                    publication of his researches, he would be leaving the field open to ignorance;
                    and that the exposition of truths so evident, accompanied with proofs so
                    numerous and palpable, would be the best means of refuting the charges which
                    presumptuous ignorance had by anticipation brought against his opinions.
                    Accordingly, he permitted his friends to publish his book, which he dedicated to
                    Pope Paul III.; in order, as he says, that he might not be accused of seeking to
                    shun the judgment of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751302?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1302-0310"/> enlightened men, and that the authority of his
                    holiness, if he approved of the work, might proteet him from the baleful tooth
                    of calumny.</p>
                <p>The work was printed at Nuremberg, under the superintendence of Rhetieus, one of
                    the diseiples of Copernicus. The impression had just been completed, and the
                    first eopy transmitted by Rhetieus to his great master and friend, when
                    Copernicus, who had all his life enjoyed the most perfect health, was attacked
                    with dysentery, followed almost immediately by a paralysis of the right side,
                    which again was accompanied with loss of memory and an obscuration of the
                    understanding. In this melancholy state he lingered for several days. On that of
                    his death, and only a few hours before lie expired, the eopy of his work sent by
                    Rhetieus arrived, and was plaeed in his hands. He saw it, touehed it, and seemed
                    conscious what it was; but, after regarding it for an instant, relapsed into a
                    state of insensibility, whieh soon terminated in death. He died on the 24th May
                    1543, at the age of seventy. His tomb, which is not distinguished from that of
                    the other eanons, was, in 1581, adorned with a Latin epitaph by Bishop Cromer,
                    the Titus Livius of Poland; and in 1800 a small monument was erected in honour
                    of the illustrious discoverer of the true system of the heavens. The first work
                    in whieh the labours of Copernicus were formally announced, in contradistinction
                    to the notions which had hitherto prevailed, was a letter published by Rheticus,
