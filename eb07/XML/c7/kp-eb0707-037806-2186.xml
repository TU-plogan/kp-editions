                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    of Mexico was bornât Medellin, a small town of Estremadura, in 1485. He was
                    descended from a noble family of decayed fortune, who destined him for the bar,
                    and sent him at an early age to the university of Salamanca. But being soon
                    disgusted with a species of study ill suited to his ardent genius, he embraced
                    the military profession, in hopes of signalizing himself, under the celebrated
                    Gonsalvo de Cordova. A dangerous malady, however, having prevented his embarking
                    for Naples, his hopes were baffled; but when his health was re-established he
                    turned his attention towards the West Indies, which were then a source of riches
                    and glory to the Spaniards. In 1504 Cortes set out for St Domingo, where he was
                    kindly received by Ovando, the governor. He was then only nineteen, and
                    remarkable for a graceful physiognomy and amiable manners, as well as for skill
                    and address in all military exercises. He remained in St Domingo, where Ovando
                    had successively conferred upon him several lucrative and honourable
                    employments, until 1511, when he accompanied Diego Velasquez in his expedition
                    to the island of Cuba, where he became alcalde of St Iago, and displayed great
                    talents on several trying occasions. To the fire and impetuosity of youth had
                    now succeeded an indefatigable activity, united with the coolness and
                    self-command which are so necessary for the execution of great designs.
                    Grijalva, lieutenant of Velasquez, had just discovered Mexico but without
                    attempting to effect a settlement. This displeased the governor of Cuba, who
                    superseded Grijalva, and intrusted the conquest of the newly-discovered country
                    to Cortes. The latter hastened his preparations, and, on the 18th of November
                    1518, he set out from St Iago, with ten vessels, six or seven hundred Spaniards,
                    eighteen horsemen, and some pieces of cannon. Scarcely had he set sail, however,
                    when Velasquez, repenting his choice, and apprehensive that his lieutenant would
                    carry off all the glory as well as profit of the enterprise, recalled the
                    commission which he had granted to Cortes, and even ordered him to be put under
                    arrest; but the attachment of the troops, by whom he was greatly beloved,
                    enabled him to disconcert all the designs of the governor; and on the 4th of
                    March 1519 he landed on the coast of Mexico Advancing along the gulf, sometimes
                    caressing the natives, and sometimes spreading terror by his arms, he took
                    possession of the town of Tabasco. The noise of the artillery, the appearance of
                    the floating fortresses which had transported the ∙ Spaniards over the ocean,
                    and the horses on which they fought, all new objects to the natives, inspired
                    them with astonishment mingled with terror and admiration; they regarded the
                    Spaniards as gods, and sent them ambassadors with presents. Cortes here learned
                    that the native sovereign was called Montezuma; that he reigned over an
                    extensive empire, which had lasted for three centuries,∙∣ that thirty vassals,
                    called caciques, obeyed him; that his riches were immense and his power
                    absolute. No more was necessary to inflame the ambition of Cortes, who hesitated
                    not to undertake the conquest of this great empire, which could only be effected
                    by combining stratagem and address with force and courage. He laid the
                    foundation of the town of Vera Cruz, caused himself to be elected
                    captain-general of the new colony, and, like Agathocles, burned his vessels, to
                    cut off the possibility of retreat, and <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi><pb

                    that they must either conquer or perish. He then penetrated into the interior of
                    the country, drew to his camp several caciques hostile to Montezuma, and induced
                    these native princes to facilitate his progress. The republic of Elascala alone
                    opposed him; but he routed its army, which had resisted all the forces of the
                    Mexican empire, dictated peace on moderate terms, converted the people into
                    powerful auxiliaries, and, surmounting all obstacles, arrived, with six thousand
                    natives and a handful of Spaniards, in sight of the immense lake on which was
                    built the city of Mexieo, the capital of the empire. Montezuma received him with
                    great pomp, and his subjects, believing Cortes to be a descendant of the sun,
                    prostrated themselves before him. The first care of Cortes was to fortify
                    himself in one of the beautiful palaces of the prince; and he was only thinking
                    how to get hold of the riches of so opulent an empire, when intelligence reached
                    him that a general of the emperor, who had received secret orders, had just
                    attacked the garrison of Vera Cruz and killed several of his soldiers. This
                    event undeceived the Mexicans, who had hitherto believed the Spaniards to be
                    immortal, and overturned the whole policy of Cortes. Struck with the greatness
                    of the danger, surrounded by enemies, and having only a handful of soldiers, he
                    conceived and instantly executed a most daring project. Having repaired with his
                    officers to the palace of the emperor, he announced to Montezuma that he must
                    either accompany him or perish. Being thus master of the person of the monarch,
                    he then demanded that the Mexican general and his officers who had attacked the
                    Spaniards should be delivered into his hands; and when this had been done he
                    caused these unfortunate men, who had only obeyed the orders of their sovereign,
                    to be burned alive before the gates of the imperial palace. During this cruel
                    execution Cortes entered the apartment of Montezuma, and caused him to be loaded
                    with irons, in order to force him to acknowledge himself a vassal of Charles V.
                    The unhappy prince yielded, and was restored to a semblance of liberty on
                    presenting the fierce conqueror with six hundred thousand marks of pure gold,
                    and a prodigious quantity of precious stones. Scarcely had he reaped the fruits
                    of his audacity, however, when he was informed of the landing of a Spanish army,
                    under Narvaez, which had been sent by Velasquez to compel him to renounce his
                    command. In this emergency Cortes acted with his usual decision and courage.
                    Leaving two hundred men at Mexico under the orders of his lieutenant, he marched
                    against Narvaez, whom he defeated and made prisoner, and then enlisted under his
                    standard the Spanish soldiers who had been sent to attack him. On his return to
                    the capital, however, he found that the Mexicans had revolted against the
                    emperor and the Spaniards, and that dangers thickened around him. Montezuma
                    perished in attempting toaddress his revolted subjects; upon which the latter,
                    having chosen a new emperor, attacked the headquarters of Cortes with the utmost
                    fury, and, in spite of the advantage of fire-arms, forced the Spaniards to
                    retire, which alone saved them from destruction. Their rearguard, however, was
                    cut in pieces, and they suffered severely during the retreat, which was
                    continued during six days. Elated with their spccess, the Mexicans offered
                    battle in the plain of Otumba. This was what Cortes desired, and it proved their
                    destruction. Cortes gave the signal for battle, and, on the 7th of July 1520,
                    gained a victory which decided the fate of Mexico Immediately afterwards, he
                    proceeded to Elascala, assembled an auxiliary army of natives, subjected the
                    neighbouring provinces, and then marched a second time against Mexico which,
                    after a gallant defence of several months, was retaken on the 13th of August
                    1521. These successes were entirely owing to the genius, valour, and profound
                    but unscrupulous policy of Cortes; and the account of them, which he transmitted
                    to Spain, excited the admiration of his countrymen. The extent of his conquests,
                    and the ability he had displayed, effaced the censure which he had incurred by
                    the irregularity of his operations; and public opinion having declared in his
                    favour, Charles V., disregarding the pretensions of Velasquez, appointed him
                    governor and captain-general of Mexico at the same time conferring on him the
                    valley of Guaxaca, which was erected into a marquisats, with a considerable
                    revenue. But although his power was thusçonfirméd by royal authority, and
                    although he exerted himself to consolidate Spanish domination throughout all
                    Mexico the means he employed were such that the natives, reduced to despair,
                    took arms against the Spaniards. This revolt, however, was speedily subdued, and
                    the Mexicans were everywhere forced to yield to the ascendency of European
                    discipline and valour. Guatimozin, who had been recognised as emperor, and a
                    great number of caciques, accused of having conspired against the conquerors,
                    were publicly' executed, with circumstances of great cruelty, by order of
                    Cortes. Meanwhile the court of Madrid, dreading the ambition and popularity' of
                    the victorious chief, sent commissioners to watch his conduct and thwart his
                    proceedings; and whilst he was completing the conquest of New Spain, his goods
                    were seized by the fiscal of the Council of the Indies, and his retainers
                    imprisoned and put into irons. Indignant at the ingratitude of his sovereign,
                    Cortes returned in person to Spain, to appeal to the justice of the emperor, and
                    appeared there with great splendour. The emperor received him with every mark of
                    distinction, and decorated him with the order of St Iago. Cortes returned to
                    Mexicowith new titles but diminished authority, a viceroy having been intrusted
                    with the administration of civil affairs, whilst the military department, with
                    permission to push his conquests, was all that remained to Cortes. This division
                    of powers became a source of continual dissension, and caused the failure of the
                    last enterprises in which he engaged. Nevertheless, in 1536, he discovered the
                    peninsula of California, and surveyed a part of the gulf which separates it from
                    Mexico At length, tired of struggling with adversaries unworthy of him, whom the
                    court took care to multiply, he returned to Europe, hoping to confound his
                    enemies. But Charles V. received him coldly'. Cortes dissembled, redoubled the
                    assiduity of his attendance on the emperor; accompanied him in the disastrous
                    expedition to Algiers in 1541, served as a volunteer, and had a horse killed
                    under him. This was his last appearance in the field, and if his advice had been
                    followed, the Spanish arms would have been saved from disgrace, and Europe
                    delivered nearly three centuries earlier from the scourge of organised piracy.
                    Soon afterwards he fell into neglect, and could scarcely obtain an audience. One
                    day, however, having forced his way through the crowd which surrounded the
                    emperor’s carriage, and mounted on the door-step, Charles, astonished at an act
                    of such audacity, demanded to know who he was. “I am a man,” replied the
                    conqueror of Mexico proudly, “who has given you more provinces than your
                    ancestors left you cities.” This haughty declaration of important services
                    ili-requited could scarcely fail to offend a monarch on whom fortune had
                    lavished her choicest favours; and Cortes, overwhelmed with disgust, withdrew'
                    from court, passed the remainder of his days in solitude, and died, near
                    Seville, on the 2d of December 1554, being then in the sixty-third year of his
                    age. The only writings of Cortes are four letters, on the subject of his
                    conquests, which he addressed to Charles V., and which have fortunately been
                    given to the world. The best edition of them is that of Don Francisco Antonio<pb
