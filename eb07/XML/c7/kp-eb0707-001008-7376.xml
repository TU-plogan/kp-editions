                <p><label type="entry">COCHIN</label>, a small province of Hindustan, on the coast
                    of Malabar, intersected by the I0th degree of north latitude. It has the Malabar
                    province on the north, Travancore on the south, Dindigul on the east, and the
                    sea on the west. A portion of this territory, equal to about 745 square miles,
                    is attached to the district of Malabar, and is subject to British laws and
                    regulations; but the remainder is under the independent jurisdiction of the
                    rajah. This country is beautiful in the northern parts, about Purgunuru and
                    Shilacary. It consists of low hills, intersected by narrow fertile valleys,
                    finely wooded, well peopled, and extremely well watered by small perennial
                    streams, which enable the cultivators to raise two crops of rice annually. The
                    high grounds arc in general rocky, but the soil is good, though the cultivation
                    of these hills is everywhere exceedingly neglected. Groves of palms, mangoes,
                    jacks, and lapintains skirt the bottom of the little hills, and shade the houses
                    of the natives. The pasture is excellent, and the cattle, though remarkably
                    small, are in good condition. Above these are woods of forest-trees, which,
                    though not equal in size to those in Chittagong, are very fine, and free from
                    rattans and other climbers. In these forests the same sort of trees grow as in
                    Malabar, namely, the jack wood, which is in general demand for cabinet work, and
                    is small; the erambo, or iron wood, which is too heavy for general use, and is
                    seldom felled; the black wood, which is large and of fine dimensions, but which
                    is rendered unsaleable by the practice of dividing it into short logs, which are
                    dragged by elephants to the nearest river, and are frequently much bruised and
                    splintered in the passage; the teak, which is inferior in essential oil, the
                    grand preservative of iron from corrosion, to that produced in Malabar. The
                    viti, a black wood, also abounds in these forests; but most of the trees have
                    been cut, and no care is bestowed to increase their reproduction, or to check
                    the growth of useless timber. There are extensive forests of teak in the rajah’s
                    territories; but before the wood reaches the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194747389"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-7389-0011"/>sea it must be floated through the British
                    territories to the sea-port town of Paniany, in South Malabar; and the Company’s
                    government hesitated long whether they would admit the rajah’s subjects to the
                    free navigation of this river. They were only determined to this wise and
                    liberal policy by the earnest remonstrances of Major Munro, the resident at
                    Cochin.</p>
                <p>In this province are many Nazarene or Christian villages, which, for Indian
                    towns, are well built and cleanly; and the inhabitants are a very orderly and
                    industrious people, who live chiefly by trade or agriculture. The Jews are
                    numerous in the vicinity of Cochin; and Mattachery, about a mile distant from
                    that town, is almost wholly inhabited by them. They are divided into two
                    classes, namely, the Jerusalem or white Jews, and the ancient or black Jews.</p>
                <p>The Cochin rajah maintained his independence to a much later period than most of
                    the other Hindu chiefs. When Hyder invaded his country, he quietly submitted to
                    pay tribute, which was continued to his son Tippoo, and which is now paid to the
                    Company. In May 1809 a treaty offensive and defensive was concluded by Colonel
                    Macaulay, between the rajah and the East India Company, by the conditions of
                    which the friends and enemies of either of the contracting parties were declared
                    the friends and enemies of both. The rajah at the same time agreed to pay an
                    additional tribute.</p>

                    and principal town of the above province. The city is of a semicircular form,
                    and is about a mile and a half in circumference. It has three gates, and the
                    streets are wide and commodious. The chief public buildings are the church, the
                    governor’s house, the barracks, and a public hotel. A fort was built at this
                    place by Albuquerque in 1503, and it was the first possessed by the Portuguese
                    in India. Cochin continued to increase and to flourish under their rule till the
                    year 1663, when it was taken by the Dutch. During the period of their rule it
                    was a place of very extensive commerce, and was inhabited not only by all sects
                    of Christians, but by Hindus, Mahommedans, and Jews, who are all equally
                    tolerated, and who traded with Arabia, Persia, Bengal, and the whole seacoast of
                    India. The trade carried on with Surat, Bombay, the coasts of Malabar and
                    Canara, and also with Arabia, Canara, and the islands in the Eastern Seas, is
                    still extensive. The imports consist chiefly of dates, almonds, pearls,
                    gum-arabic, piece goods, cotton, opium, shawls, benzoin, camphor, cinnamon and
                    spices, sugar-candy, tea, china, and silks. The exports are pepper, cardamums,
                    teak wood, sandal wood, cocoa-nuts, coir, cordage, cassia, and fish-maws. The
                    harbour is on the north side of the town, which stands on an island at the mouth
                    of the Cali Caytang river. At this fort also ship-building is carried on to a
                    considerable extent, and vessels are constructed both on European and Asiatic
                    models. The ports in the Arabian and Persian Gulfs are also supplied from Cochin
                    with the timber which they require for repairing their different craft. Cochin
                    was taken possession of by the British in 1795, when war commenced with Holland,
                    and it was finally ceded to the British by the treaty of 1814. It is 170 miles
                    north-west from Cape Comorin. Long. 76. 8. E. Lat. 9. 57. N.</p>
