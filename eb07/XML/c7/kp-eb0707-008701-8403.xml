                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">COLLINSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Peter</hi></label>, an
                    eminent naturalist and antiquary, descended of an ancient family, was born on
                    the paternal estate called <hi rend="italic">Hugal Hall,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Height of Hagai,</hi> near Windermere lake, in the parish of
                    Stavely, about ten miles from Kendal, in Westmoreland. Whilst a youth, he
                    discovered an attachment to natural history. He began early to make a collection
                    of dried specimens of plants, and had access to the best gardens at that time in
                    the neighbourhood of London. He became early acquainted with the most eminent
                    naturalists of his time, and Drs Derham, Woodward, Hale, Lloyd, and Sloane, were
                    amongst his friends. Amongst the great variety of articles which form that
                    superb collection, now, by the wise disposition of Sir Hans and the munificence
                    of parliament, the British Museum, small was the number of those with whose
                    history Mr Collinson was not well acquainted; he being one of the few who
                    visited Sir Hans at all times familiarly. Their inclinations and pursuits in
                    respect of natural history being the same, a firm friendship had early been
                    established between them. Peter Collinson was elected a fellow of the Royal
                    Society on the 12th of December 1728, and perhaps was one of the most diligent
                    and useful members, not only in supplying them with many curious observations
                    himself, but in promoting and preserving a most extensive correspondence with
                    learned and ingenious foreigners in all countries, and on every useful subject.
                    Besides his attention to natural history, he minuted every striking hint that
                    occurred either in reading or conversation; and from this source he derived much
                    information, as there were very few men of learning and ingenuity who were not
                    of his acquaintance at home; and most foreigners of eminence in natural history,
                    or in arts and sciences, were recommended to his notice and friendship. His
                    diligence and economy of time were such, that though he never appeared to be in
                    a hurry, he maintained an extensive correspondence with great punctuality;
                    acquainting the learned and ingenious in dis <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> ant
                    parts of the globe with the discoveries and improvements in natural history in
                    this country, and receiving the like information from the most eminent persons
                    in almost every other. His correspondence with the ingenious Cadwallader Golden,
                    Esq. of New York, and the celebrated Dr Franklin of Philadelphia, furnish
                    instances of the benefit resulting from his attention to all improvements. The
                    latter of these gentlemen communicated his first essays on electricity to Mr
                    Collinson, in a series of letters, which were then published, and have since
                    been reprinted in an edition of the doctor’s discoveries and improvements.
                    Perhaps, at some future period, the account of the management of sheep in Spain,
                    published in the Gentleman’s Magazine for May and June 1764, may not be
                    considered as among the least of the benefits accruing from his extensive and
                    inquisitive correspondence. His conversation, which was cheerful and
                    entertaining, rendered his acquaintance much desired by those who had a relish
                    for natural history, or w erc studious in cultivating rural improvements; and it
                    secured him the intimate friendship of some of the most eminent personages in
                    this kingdom, distinguished for their taste in planting and horticulture, as
                    well as for their rank and dignity. He was the first who introduced the great
                    variety of seeds and shrubs which are now the principal ornaments of every
                    garden; and it was owing to his indefatigable industry that groves transplanted
                    from the western continent may be seen flourishing as luxuriantly in their
                    several domains as if they had already become indigenous to Britain. He had
                    correspondents in almost every nation in Europe, and some in Asia, nay even at
                    Pekin; who all transmitted to him the most valuable seeds they could collect, in
                    return for the treasures of America. The great Lin-nεeus, during his residence
                    in England, contracted an intimate<pb break="no" facs="nls:194748416"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-8416-0088"/> friendship with Mr Collinson, which was
                    strength-ed by a multitude of reciprocal good offices, and continued to the
                    last. Besides his attachment to natural history, he was very conversant with the
                    antiquities of our own country, on account of which he was elected a member of
                    the Society of Antiquaries in April 1737; and he supplied them often with many
                    curious articles of intelligence and observation respecting both our own and
                    other countries. He died in 1768, leaving behind him many materials for the
                    improvement of natural history.</p>
