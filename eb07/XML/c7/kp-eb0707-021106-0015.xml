                <p><label type="entry">CONFLAGRATION</label>, the general burning of a city or çther
                    considerable place.</p>
                <p>The word is commonly applied to that grand period or catastrophe of our world
                    when the face of nature is to be changed by fire, as it formerly was by water.
                    The ancient Pythagoreans, Platonists, Epicureans, and Stoics appear to have had
                    a notion of the conflagration, though whence they derived it, unless from the
                    sacred books, it is difficult to conceive, except perhaps it were from the
                    Phoenicians, who themselves had it from the Jews. Seneca says expressly, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tempus advenerit</hi><hi rend="italic">quo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sidera sideribus</hi><hi rend="italic">incurrent,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">omni flagrante materia uno igne, quicquid nunc
                    ex</hi><hi rend="italic">deposito lucet,</hi><hi rend="italic">ardebit.</hi>
                    This general dissolution the Stoics call £x¢rugwd’/¢. Mention of the
                    conflagration is also made in the books of the Sibyls, in Sophocles, Hystaspes,
                    Ovid, Lucan, and others. Dr Burnet, after Tachard and others, relates that the
                    Siamese believe that the earth will at last be parched up with heat, the
                    mountains melted down, and the earth’s whole surface reduced to a level, and
                    then consumed with fire; and the Brahmins of Siam not only hold that the world
                    shall be destroyed by fire, but also that a new earth shall be made out of the
                    cinders of the old.</p>
                <p>Various are the sentiments of authors on the subject of the conflagration, the
                    cause whence it is to arise, and the effects which it is to produce. Divines
                    ordinarily account for it metaphysically, and will have it take its rise from a
                    miracle, as fire from heaven. Philosophers contend for its being produced from
                    natural causes, and will have it effected according to the laws of mechanics.
                    Some think an eruption of the central fire sufficient for the purpose, and add,
                    that this may be occasioned in several ways, either by having its intensity
                    increased, which again may be effected by its being driven into less space by
                    the encroachments of the superficial cold, or by an increase of the
                    inflammability of the fuel by which it is fed, or by having the resistance of
                    the imprisoning earth weakened, which may happen either from the diminution of
                    its matter, by the consumption of its central parts, or by weakening the
                    cohesion of the constituent part of the mass by excess or defect of moisture.
                    Others look for the cause of the conflagration in the atmosphere, and suppose
                    that some of the meteors there engendered in unusual quantities, and exploded
                    with unusual vehemence, from the concurrence of various circumstances, may
                    effect it, without seeking any further. The astrologers account for it from a
                    conjunction of all the planets in the sign Cancer, as the deluge, according to
                    them, was occasioned by their conjunction in Capricon. Lastly, others have
                    recourse to a still more effectual and flaming machine, and conclude that the
                    world is to undergo conflagration from the near approach of a comet in its
                    return from the sun.</p>
