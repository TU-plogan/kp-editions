                <p><label type="entry">COPENHAGEN</label>, the capital of the Danish dominions. It
                    is situated on the Baltic Sea, on both sides of the narrow strait which
                    separates the island of Arnack from Zealand. It contains a population of 103,166
                    individuals, including 2442 Jews, and the military, amounting to 4000. It is
                    probably an ancient city, but there arc no notices of it earlier than 1043, when
                    it came into the hands of a bishop, whose successors, in 1168, formed the haven
                    and fortified it.</p>
                <p>Copenhagen is chiefly built upon land which has been recovered from the sea, and
                    is consequently a flat place, and has canals navigable for large vessels, which
                    extend to the centre of the city. The trade is considerable with most .parts of
                    the world; and it is the naval arsenal where ships of war are built and
                    repaired, and where the national military and marine stores are kept. It is a
                    beautiful city, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751276" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1276-0308"
                    />with large squares, broad streets, and respectable buildings, both public and
                    private. Being situated in a fertile and highly cultivated district, the markets
                    are well and cheaply supplied with every necessary of domestic produce. It is
                    well supplied with fresh water, which is conveyed by pipes from two reservoirs
                    near the city, and another about two miles distant. The institutions for the
                    poor, for education, for medical instruction, and for quarantine, are well
                    planned; and the police is well regulated. The university of Copenhagen numbers
                    upwards of thirty professors, and from seven to eight hundred students. It is
                    well endowed with estates, as well as with funded property, from which stipends
                    are paid, and money issued to pay the expenses of travellers in distant
                    countries.</p>
                <p>It has a botanical garden, an astronomical observatory, a surgical and veterinary
                    school, an academy for the fine arts, and a large and valuable library. There
                    are, too, different societies for the promotion of different branches of
                    knowledge. The collections of various kinds are very respectable; and the royal
                    library consists of nearly 400,000 volumes. The museums of natural history, of
                    anatomy, of geography, of mineralogy, of antiquities, and of ancient coins, are
                    rich in their respective kinds of treasures. There are several collections of
                    paintings, among which those in the palace are by the first foreign, and some
                    excellent ones by Danish artists. The collection of copperplates in the royal
                    library consists of 2G7 volumes, containing more than 81,000 impressions.</p>
                <p>The royal palace in the centre of the city, begun after the fire in 1794, is not
                    yet quite completed. It is a magnificent pile, being a square of 370 feet, 114
                    feet in height, built on a foundation of 10,000 piles. The church within it is a
                    most beautiful place of worship. Many of the churches, and most of the official
                    buildings, display much taste and knowledge of architecture. If it were not for
                    the climate, which is variable in an uncommon degree, few of the capital cities
                    of Europe would form a more desirable place of residence. The winter is
                    sometimes ‘excessively cold. Long. 12. 30. 54. E. Lat. 55. 51. 4. N.</p>
