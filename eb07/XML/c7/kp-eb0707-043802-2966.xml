                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">COX, <hi rend="smallcaps">Richard</hi></label>, a learned
                    prelate, and principal pillar of the Reformation, was born at Whaddon in
                    Buckinghamshire, in the year 1499. From Eton school he went to Cambridge, where
                    he obtained a scholarship in King’s College, of which he became a fellow in
                    1519. He was thence invited to Oxford by Cardinal Wolsey, and was there made one
                    of the junior canons of Cardinal College. In 1525 he was incorporated bachelor,
                    and the following year he took the degree of master of arts in the same
                    university. In this situation he became remarkable for his learning and poetical
                    abilities; but his attachment to the opinions of Luther rendered him hateful to
                    his superiors, who stripped him of his preferment, and threw him into prison on
                    a suspicion of heresy. Being, however, soon released, he was chosen master
                    ofEton school, which flourished remarkably under his care. In 1537 he commenced
                    doctor of divinity at Cambridge; in 1540 was made archdeacon of Ely; and in the
                    following year be became prebendary of that cathedral, on its being founded of
                    new by King Henry VIII. In 1546 he was made dean of Christ Church, Oxford. By
                    the recommendation of Archbishop Cranmer and Bishop Goodrich, to the latter of
                    whom he had been chaplain, he not only obtained the above preferments, but was
                    also chosen preceptor to Prince Edward,, on whose accession to the throne he
                    became a favourite at court, was sworn of the privy council, and made king’s
                    almoner. In 1547 he was elected chancellor of Oxford, in 1548 canon of Windsor,
                    and the next year dean of Westminster. About this time he was appointed one of
                    the commissioners to visit the university of Oxford; in which office his zeal
                    for reformation was so excessive that he destroyed a number of curious and
                    valuable books, for no better reason than because they were written by Roman
                    Catholics. On the accession of Queen Mary he was stripped of all his
                    preferments, and committed to the Marshalsea. He was, however, soon released,
                    and immediately left the kingdom. Having resided some time at Strasburg with his
                    intimate friend Peter Martyr, he returned to England on the death of Queen Mary,
                    and, with other divines, he was appointed to revise the liturgy. He often
                    preached before the queen; and in 1559 he was preferred to the see of Ely, which
                    he continued to enjoy upwards of twenty-one years. He was, however, no favourite
                    with the queen; the reason assigned for which was, his zealous opposition to her
                    retaining the crucifix and wax candles on the altar of the royal chapel, and his
                    strenuous defence of the marriage of the clergy, which her majesty always
                    disapproved. He died on the 22d of July 1581, aged eighty-one. He was a man of
                    considerable learning, a zealous and rigid bulwark of the church of England, and
                    an implacable enemy of both Papists and Puritans. In a letter to Archbishop
                    Parker, he advises him to proceed vigorously in reclaiming or punishing the
                    Puritans, and not to be discouraged by the frown of the court favourites who
                    protected them; assuring him that he might expect the blessing of God on his
                    pious labours to free the church from their dangerous attempts, and to establish
                    uniformity. This zealous reformer we find had not totally lost sight of the
                    text, “Compel them to come in but a stronger proof of his implacability and
                    self-importance appears in his letter to the lord treasurer Burghley, in which
                    he warmly expostulates with the council for interposing in behalf of the
                    Puritans, or meddling in affairs of the church, admonishing them to keep to
                    their own sphere. ∙ Such language from a bishop would probably make a modem
                    privy council stare. His works are, 1. Two Latin Orations on the Dispute between
                    Dr Tresham and Peter Martyr, Lond. 1549, 4to; 2. Liturgy of the Church of
                    England, in compiling, and afterwards correcting which, he was principally
                    concerned; 3. The Lord’s Prayer in Verse, commonly printed at the end of David’s
                    Psalms by Sternhold and Hopkins; 4. Translation of the Four Gospels, the Acts of
                    the Apostles, and the Epistle to the Romans, in the new translation of the Bible
                    in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; 5. Resolutions of some Questions concerning the
                    Sacrament in the Collection of Records at the end of Burnet’s History of the
                    Reformation; 6. Several Letters to the Queen and others, published in Strype’s
                    Annals of the Reformation. He is also said to have been concerned in framing the
                    declaration concerning the divine institution of bishops, and to have assisted
                    Lyle in his Grammar.</p>
