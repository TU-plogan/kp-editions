                    Marquis of Segnelay, one of the greatest statesmen whom France ever produced,
                    was born at Paris in 1619, and descended from a respectable family which lived
                    at Rheims in Champagne. His grandfather is said to have been a wine merchant,
                    and his father at first followed the same occupation, but afterwards became
                    clerk to a notary. In 1648, his relation John Baptiste Colbert, lord of St
                    Pouange, preferred him to the service of Le Tellier, secretary of state, whose
                    sister he had married; and here he discovered such diligence and exactness in
                    executing all the commissions which were intrusted to his care, that he quickly
                    became distinguished. One day his master sent him to Cardinal Mazarin, who was
                    then at Sedan, with a letter written by the queen mother, and ordered him to
                    bring it back after that minister had seen it. Colbert carried the letter, and
                    refused to return without it, though the cardinal treated him roughly, used
                    several arts to deceive him, and obliged him to wait for it several days. Some
                    time afterwards, when the cardinal returned to court, and found himself in want
                    of a secretary or amanuensis, he desired Le Tellier to furnish him with a fit
                    person for that employment; and Colbert having been presented to him, the
                    cardinal, who had some remembrance of the young man, desired to know where he
                    had seen him. Colbert was afraid of putting his eminence in mind of Sedan, lest
                    the recollection of his importunacy, in demanding the queen’s letter, should
                    renew the cardinal’s anger; but the cardinal, who divined character better than
                    any man of his time, was so far from disliking him for his fidelity to his
                    former master, that he received him on condition that he should serve him with
                    equal zeal and devotion.</p>
                <p>Colbert applied himself wholly to the advancement of his master’s interests, and
                    gave so many marks of his diligence and skill, that the cardinal afterwards made
                    him his intendant. And he accommodated himself so dexterously to the
                    inclinations of the minister, by retrenching his superfluous expenses and
                    otherwise, that he was intrusted with the management of the gainful trade of
                    selling benefices and governments. It was by Colbert’s counsel that the cardinal
                    obliged the governors of frontier places to maintain their garrisons out of the
                    contributions they had exacted; a suggestion with which his eminence was
                    extremely pleased. He was sent to Rome to negotiate the reconciliation of
                    Cardinal de Retz, for which the pope had showed some concern; and to persuade
                    his holiness to consent to the disincameration of Casto, according to the treaty
                    concluded with his predecessor Urban VIII. Upon the whole, Mazarin had so high
                    an opinion of Colbert’s abilities, and withal so strong a sense of his faithful
                    services, that at his death, which happened in 1661, he earnestly recommended
                    his protege to Louis XIV. as the most proper person to regulate the finances,
                    which at that time stood in great need of reformation. Louis accepted the
                    recommendation, and made Colbert intendant of the finances. The latter applied
                    himself to their regulation, and succeeded in his object, although it procured
                    him many enemies, and exposed him to some affronts. France is also indebted to
                    this minister for establishing her trade with the East and West Indies; a
                    project from which she derived innumerable advantages.</p>
                <p>In 1664 Colbert became superintendent of buildings, and from that time applied
                    himself to the enlarging and adorning of the royal edifices, which became
                    masterpieces of architecture in their peculiar style; witness the palace of the
                    Thuilleries, the Louvre, St Germain, Fontainbleau, and Chambord. In the same
                    year he founded the Academy of Inscriptions, and in 1666 the still more
                    celebrated Academy of Sciences. France also owes to Colbert all the advantages
                    she has derived from the union of the two seas; a work begun in 1666, and
                    finished in 1680.</p>
                <p>In 1669 Colbert was made secretary of state, and intrusted with the management of
                    naval affairs; and his services in this department were answerable to the
                    confidence his majesty reposed in him. He suppressed several offices, which were
                    chargeable, but useless; and perceiving the king’s zeal for the extirpation of
                    heresy, he shut up the chamber instituted by the edicts of Paris and Rouen. He
                    proposed several new regulations concerning criminal courts, and was extremely
                    severe to the parliament of Thoulouse for obstructing the measures he took to
                    carry these improvements into execution. His main design in reforming the
                    tedious methods of proceeding at law, was to give the people more leisure to
                    apply themselves to trade; for the advancement of which he procured an edict,
                    erecting a general insurance office at Paris for merchants and others» In 1672
                    he was appointed minister of state; but how busied soever he might be in the
                    regulation of public affairs, he never neglected his own or his family’s
                    interest and grandeur, nor missed any opportunity of advancing either. He had
                    been married many years, and had sons and daughters grown up, all of whom, as
                    occasion served, he took care to marry to great persons; for though he had no
                    reason to doubt of his master’s favour, yet he wisely secured his fortune by
                    powerful alliances.</p>
                <p>This great minister died of the stone, on the 6th September 1683, in his
                    sixty-fourth year, leaving behind him six sons and three daughters. In his last
                    moments he was attended by Bourdaloue; and when his wife attempted to talk to
                    him of public affairs, he repulsed her, saying, “Vous ne me laisserez done pas
                    même le temps de mourir.” He was of a middle stature, his mien was low and
                    dejected, his air gioomy, and his aspect stern. He slept little, and was very
                    sober. He was of slow conception, but spoke judiciously of every thing after he
                    had once comprehended it. He filled the most important offices with high
                    reputation and credit; and his influence diffused itself throughout every
                    department of the government. Upon the whole, he was a wise, active,
                    public-spirited minister, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194748013"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-8013-0057"/>attentive to the interests of his master, the
                    happiness of the people, the progress of arts and manufactures, and, in short,
                    to every thing that could advance the credit and interest of his country. Though
                    an enlightened patron of science and literature, Colbert was not himself an
                    author. The work entitled <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Testament
                    Politique de Colbert,</hi> published in 1694, is a compilation by another hand,
