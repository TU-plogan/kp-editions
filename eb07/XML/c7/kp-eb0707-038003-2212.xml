                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p>This mineral was long known in Europe under the name of adamantine spar. It was
                    imported from India, where it was used in cutting and polishing gems; but its
                    history was wholly unknown until the late Right Honourable Charles Greville, to
                    whom the science of mineralogy is so deeply indebted, obtained a clue by which
                    he arrived at one locality at least of this interesting mineral.</p>
                <p>In the year 1767, Mr Berry, a very eminent seal-engraver in Edinburgh, received
                    from Dr Anderson of Madras a box of crystals of adamantine spar, with
                    information that it was with this substance all stones except diamond were cut
                    and polished in India. Mr Greville obtained from his friend Colonel Catheart
                    some crystals, which that gentleman had also got from Dr Anderson twenty years
                    afterwards, and <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> to which the native name of
                    corundum was attached. By this means Mr Greville was enabled to put the
                    exertions of others in requisition, and after various fruitless attempts,
                    through the assistance of Mr Edward Garrow, then (1792) residing at
                    Trichinopoly, he at length obtained a minute account of the stone, as known in
                    that part of Hindustan. It seems that the searching for and working with this
                    substance is consigned, like most other branches of trade, to one particular
                    caste; hence all others are wholly ignorant of it, and those who belong to it
                    are communicative or otherwise, just as they may consider their interest
                    affected. By dint of perseverance he at last discovered that the corundum was
                    found in the neighbourhood of Condrastra, a village about fourteen miles from
                    Permetty, which, according to Rennell’s map, is situated on the south side of
                    the Cavery, not far from Caranel. Hither Mr Garrow repaired; and being, as he
                    says, the first European whom the natives had seen, was as great a curiosity
                    among them as Landers proved to the Ashantees. Condrastra he found to be a very
                    small hamlet, occupied by five families, whose race had obtained a prescriptive
                    right as miners to work in the pits. The implements by which their operations
                    were carried on were of a very rude nature; a broad pointed heavy iron crow with
                    a wooden handle is the only one mentioned. With this they formed their
                    excavation, in a soil composed of gritty granite, masses of which, several
                    pounds weight, on being brought to the surface, were crushed, and the crystals
                    collected.</p>
                <p>The receipt of this collection afforded Mr Greville the means of writing the
                    interesting account of the corundum stone, which we find in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of London,</hi> read 7th June
                    1798, in which its identity with the sapphire, previously pointed out by
                    Pelletier and De Lametherie in 1787, was finally confirmed. It is singular, that
                    during that year other philosophers were occupied with the investigation of this
                    mineral, namely, Werner in Germany, and Rome de Lisle in France; the former
                    having sent to the latter two wooden models, which he pronounced to be the shape
                    of the oriental ruby, and similar in form to the crystal of adamantine stone
                    dissected by Pelletier and his colaborateur, and confirming the hint originally
                    thrown out by Rome de Lisle, of a connection between the adamantine stone and
                    the gems distinguished by the appellation of oriental.</p>
                <p>Thus the name of corundum was given to the genus, and was generally adopted by
                    mineralogists.</p>
                <p>Bournon, in his paper on this stone, read before the Royal Society in 1802,
                    divides it simply into perfect and imperfect; and had he added a third
                    sub-species, under the name of granular or compact, his genus would have been
                    sufficiently comprehensive.</p>
                <p>Mohs has described this mineral as the third species of his genus corundum, under
                    the name of rhombohedral corundum, which comprehends the sapphire and ruby, with
                    the other different-coloured telesies of Haüy, included in Bournon’s perfect
                    corundum. The brown and greenish-grey coloured varieties, and the emery stone
                    from Madras, Naxos, &amp;c. are also comprehended under the same head by
                    Mohs.</p>
                <p>The first of these, the perfect corundum, presents an infinite variety of
                    colours. Red and blue are the most common; and the former, when perfect in
                    transparency and colour, and of considerable size, vies with the diamond itself
                    in value; but it is seldom known to exceed half an inch in length, with a
                    proportionate breadth. The very perfect crystals of dark blue are next in value,
                    and then the yellow; but the resemblance of the last to topaz when cut
                    depreciates it considerably <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>. These varieties are
                    principally the produce of Pegu and Ceylon, but are found in several other
                    localities in Europe, especially in Auvergne and St Gothard, but in small or
                    foul stones.</p>
                <p>Of the imperfect corundum we have abundance of the greenish-grey colour from the
                    Mysore and the Malabar coast, whilst the Carnatic and China afford the
                    brown-coloured variety in rude imperfect crystals. In the Mysore it was
                    originally found among the vegetable soil, evidently derived from the
                    decomposition of the granite on which the soil rests, as noticed in the account
                    by Mr Garrow.</p>
                <p>The corundum occurs always imbedded in its matrix, not in drusy cavities. It is
                    very hard, and difficultly frangible; but the natural joints are so perfect in
                    the specimens of the greenish-grey coloured variety, that it is very easily
                    cleavable into the primitive rhomb. In the granular variety from Naxos the
                    sapphire occurs in distinct concretions of considerable size, and of a good
                    colour. The compact variety is used by the natives of India for grinding and
                    polishing all the different-coloured gems, which is done by friction in the
                    simplest manner. Use soon indents grooves on the surface of the stone; and it is
                    from these grooves that the polished stones from India obtain such a constantly
                    similar form, convex, oval, or circular. Pounded corundum, moistened with a
                    little water, expedites the operation of grinding and polishing, and is also
                    used in cutting and slicing stones. A bit of twisted wire stretched on a bow of
                    bamboo of about three feet long, forms, with the grinding-stone, the whole
                    necessary implements of an Indian lapidary. At Gellivara, in Sweden, it occurs
                    in greenish-grey particles, dispersed in iron ore. For other particulars, see
