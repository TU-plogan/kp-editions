                <p><label type="entry">CRYOPHORUS</label>, a name given by Dr Wollaston to an
                    instrument of his invention, which serves to illustrate the theory of heat. It
                    is described by him in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi>
                    1813, p. 71. The form of this instrument may be readily conceived without a
                    figure. It is a glass tube, bent into the form of the Greek letter ∏, with a
                    ball of glass, D and E, at the end of each leg; the horizontal part of the tube
                    is one or two feet long, the legs are two inches in length each, and the
                    diameter of each of the hollow glass balls is one inch. The ball D is half
                    filled with water; if it contained more, the water in freezing would burst it. A
                    vacuum is produced in the tube and ball E, by boiling the water in the ball D,
                    whilst the capillary aperture in the ball E, through which the steam is issuing,
                    is held in the flame of a lamp till the steam becomes weak enough to allow the
                    melted glass to collapse and seal up the capillary aperture. The apparatus is
                    now allowed to cool, when the ball D will be half full of water, and the ball E,
                    and the rest of the cavity of the apparatus, will contain transparent watery
                    vapour. In this state of things, if the ball E be placed in a freezing mixture
                    of salt and snow, the water in the ball D will be speedily frozen, although
                    distant from the freezing mixture all the length of the horizontal glass tube.
                    The cold of the freezing mixture produces this effect by condensing the aqueous
                    vapour in the ball E, and thereby producing a vacuum in the part not occupied by
                    the water; thus taking off the pressure from the water in D, so as to allow
                    another portion of that water to assume the state of vapour, a change of form
                    attended with a reduction of heat, or a production of cold. That sensible cold
                    accompanies the passage of a liquid to the state of vapour, may be seen by
                    swinging a thermometer at the end of a string, the bulb having been previously
                    wetted with sulphuric ether; the rapid evaporation of the ether, accelerated by
                    the renewal of air, causes the mercury in the thermometer to contract
                    considerably, and to sink to the volume which it has at the freezing of water,
                    or even lower.</p>
                <p>The phenomenon exhibited by the cryophorus is of the same nature as that produced
                    by means of the air-pump in Professor Leslie’s experiment, where concentrated
                    sulphuric acid, dry basaltic porphyry in a state of powder, or some other body
                    that has a similar faculty of absorbing vapour, is placed under the receiver of
                    an air-pump. A saucer of water is placed under the same receiver. When water
                    alone is relieved from the pressure of the atmosphere by pumping out the air
                    from the receiver, a portion of the water becomes vapour, but this vapour
                    presses on the water, and prevents the disengagement of more vapour, so that,
                    although cold is produced, it is not sufficient to freeze the water; but when
                    water and an absorbent substance are placed in the receiver, the absorbent
                    substance serves the purpose of taking up the vapour <pb break="no"

                    the pressure from the water, so as to allow another portion of water to be
                    changed into vapour, and consequently more cold to be produced; so that at last,
                    after the pump has been wrought for some time, the water in the saucer
                    freezes.</p>
                <p>The same effect of freezing a small portion of water would be produced if the
                    water could be placed in a vacuum of a great extent, so that the vapour from the
                    water, having room to expand, a sufficient quantity of water would be changed
                    into vapour, and a sufficient quantity of heat thereby absorbed to change the
                    water into ice. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. b.)</hi></p>
