                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    generally formed before the bastions, in order to cover the opposite flanks from
                    being seen from the covert way, and then they consist of two faces making a

                    lead or red chalk through the press, after having moistened with a sponge both
