                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable

                <p><label type="entry">CURRENT, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Currant</hi></label>, a term
                    used to express the present time. With regard to commerce, the price current of
                    any merchandise is the known and ordinary price which is given for it. The term
                    is also used for any thing which has course, or is received in commerce; in
                    which sense we say, <hi rend="italic">current coin, current wages,</hi> and the
                    like.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Current,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Navigation,</hi> a
                    certain progressive movement of the water of the sea, by which all bodies
                    floating therein are compelled to alter their course or velocity, or both, and
                    submit to the laws imposed on them by the current.</p>
                <p>In the sea, currents are either natural and general, arising from the diurnal
                    rotation of the earth about its axis, or accidental and particular, caused by
                    the waters being driven against promontories, or into gulfsand straits, where,
                    wanting room to spread, they are driven back, and thus disturb the ordinary flux
                    of the sea. Currents arc various, and directed towards different parts of the
                    ocean; and some are constant, while others are periodical. The most
                    extraordinary current of the sea is that by which part of the Atlantic or
                    African Ocean moves about Guinea from Cape Verd towards the curvature or Bay of
                    Africa, which is called Fernando Po, namely, from west to east, contrary to the
                    general motion; and such is the force of this current, that when ships approach
                    too near the shore, it carries them violently towards the bay, and deceives the
                    mariners in their reckoning. There are a great variety of shifting currents,
                    which do not last, but return at certain periods; most of these, however, depend
                    upon and follow the anniversary winds or monsoons, which, by blowing in one
                    place, may cause a current in another. Varenius informs us, that at Java, in the
                    Straits of Sunda, when the monsoons blow from the west, that is, in the month of
                    May, the currents set to the eastward, contrary to the general motion. Between
                    the islands of Celebes and Madura, when the western monsoons set in, that is, in
                    December, January, and February, or when the winds blow from the north-west, or
                    between the north and west, the currents set to the south-east, or between the
                    south and east. At Ceylon,from the middle of March till October, the currents
                    set to the southward, and in the other parts of the year to the northward,
                    because at this time the southern monsoons blow, and at the other times the
                    northern. Between Cochin-China and Malacca, when the western monsoons blow, that
                    is, from April to August, the currents set eastward against the general motion;
                    but the rest of the year they set westward, the monsoon conspiring with the
                    general motion. They run so strongly in these seas, that unexperienced sailors
                    mistake them for waves which beat upon the rocks, and are usually known by the
                    name of breakers. In like manner, for some months after the middle of February,
                    the currents set from the Maldives towards India on the east, against the
                    general motion of the sea. On the shore of China and Cambodia, in the months of
                    October, November, and December, the currents set to the north-west, and from
                    January to the south-west, when they run with such rapidity about the shoals of
                    Parcel, that they seem swifter than an arrow. At Pulo Condore, upon the coast of
                    Cambodia, though the monsoons are shifting, yet the currents set strongly
                    towards the east, even when they blow to a contrary point. Along the coasts of
                    the Bay of Bengal, as far as Cape Romania, at∣ the extreme point of Malacca, the
                    current runs southward in November and December. When the monsoons blow from
                    China to Malacca, the sea runs swiftly from Pulo Cambi to Pulo Condore, on the
                    coast of Cambodia. In the Bay of Sans Bras, not far from the Cape of Good Hope,
                    there is a remarkable current, where the sea runs from east to west to the
                    landward; and the more vehemently that it is opposed by winds from a contrary
                    direction. The cause is undoubtedly owing to some adjacent shore which is higher
                    than this. In the Straits of Gibraltar the currents almost constantly drive to
                    the eastward, and carry ships into the Mediterranean ,∙ they are also found to
                    drive the same way into St George’s Channel.</p>
                <p>The setting or progressive motion of the current may be either quite down to the
                    bottom, or to a certain determinate depth. As the knowledge of the direction and
                    velocity of currents is a very material point in navigation, it is highly
                    necessary to discover both, in order to ascertain the ship’s situation and
                    course with as much accuracy as possible. The most successful method which has
                    been hitherto practised by mariners for this purpose, is the following:—A common
                    iron pot, containing four or five gallons, is suspended by a small rope,
                    fastened to its ear or handles, so as to hang directly upright, as when placed
                    upon the fire. This rope, which may be from seventy to a hundred fathoms in
                    length, being prepared for the experiment, is coiled in the boat, which is
                    hoisted out of the ship at a proper opportunity, when there is little or no wind
                    to ruffle the surface of the sea. The pot being then thrown overboard into the
                    water, and immediately sinking, the line is slackened till about seventy or
                    eighty fathoms are run out; after which it is fastened to the boat’s stem, by
                    which she is accordingly restrained and rides at an anchor. The velocity of the
                    current is then easily tried by the log and half-minute glass, the usual method
                    of discovering the rate of a ship’s sailing at sea. The course of the stream is
                    next obtained by the compass provided for this operation. And having thus found
                    the setting and drift of the current, it next remains to apply this experiment
                    to nautical purposes; for which sec the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Navigation.</hi><hi rend="italic">Under-Cυr</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    i</hi><hi rend="italic">RF.Nτs</hi> are distinct from the upper or apparent
                    currents, and in different places set or drive a contrary way.</p>
