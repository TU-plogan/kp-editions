                <p><label type="entry">COUNCIL</label>, in a general sense, an assembly of various
                    considerable persons, to concert measures relative to the state.</p>
                <p>In Britain, the law, in order to assist the king in the discharge of his duties,
                    the maintenance of his dignity, and the exertion of his prerogative, has
                    assigned him a diversity of councils to advise withal.</p>
                <p>The first of these is the high court of parliament.</p>
                <p>The peers of the realm are by their birth hereditary counsellors of the crown,
                    and may be called together by the king, to impart their advice in all matters of
                    importance to the realm, either in time of parliament, or, which has been their
                    principal use, when there is no parliament in being. Accordingly, Bracton,
                    speaking of the nobility of his time, says, they might properly be called <hi
                    rend="italic">consules</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >consulendo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">reges enim
                    sibi</hi><hi rend="italic">associant ad</hi><hi rend="italic">consulendum.</hi>
                    And in the law books it is laid down, that the peers arc created for two
                    reasons; first, <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">consulendum,</hi>
                    and, secondly, <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">defendendum,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">regem</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for which reasons the law gives
                    them certain great and high privileges, such as freedom from arrest, even when
                    no parliament is sitting, because the law holds that they are always assisting
                    the king with their counsel for the commonwealth, or keeping the realm in safety
                    by their prowess and valour.</p>
                <p>Instances of conventions of the peers to advise the king were frequent in former
                    times, though they have now fallen into disusê by reason of the more regular
                    meetings of parliament. Sir Edward Coke gives us an extract of a record, 5 Henry
                    IV. concerning an exchange of lands between the king and the Earl of
                    Northumberland, in which the value of each was agreed to be settled by advice of
                    parliament, if any should be called before the feast of St Lucia, or otherwise
                    by advice of the grand council of peers, which the king promised to assemble
                    before the said feast in case no parliament should be called. Many-other
                    instances of this kind of meeting are to be found under our ancient kings;
                    though the formal method of convoking them had been so long left off, that when
                    King Charles 1. in 1640 issued writs under the great seal, calling a council of
                    all the peers of England to meet and attend his majesty at York, previously to
                    the meeting of the long parliament, the Earl of Clarendon mentions it as a new
                    invention not before heard of; that is, as he explains, so old, that it had not
                    been practised during some hundreds of years. But though there had not for a
                    long time before been an instance, nor has there been any since, of assembling
                    them in so solemn a manner, yet in cases of emergency our princes have at
                    several times thought proper to call for and consult as many of the nobility as
                    could easily be brought together. This was done by King James II. after the
                    landing of the Prince of Orange, and by the Prince of Orange himself before he
                    summoned the convention parliament which afterwards called him to the
                    throne.</p>
                <p>Besides this general meeting, it is usually looked upon as the right of each
                    particular peer of the realm to demand an audience of the king, and to lay
                    before him, with decency and respect, such matters as he shall judge of
                    importance to the public weal. And therefore, in the reign of Edward II. it was
                    made an article of impeachment in parliament against the Hugh Spencers, father
                    and son, for which they were banished the kingdom, “that they by their evil
                    covin would not suffer the great men of the realm, the king’s good counsellors,
                    to speak with the king, or to come near him; but only in presence and hearing of
                    said Hugh the father and Hugh the son, or one of them, and at their will, and
                    according to such things as pleased them.”</p>
                <p>A third council belonging to the king is, according to Sir Edward Coke, composed
                    of his judges of the courts of law, for law matters. And this appears frequently
                    in the English statutes, particularly 14 Edward III. c. 5, and in other books of
                    law. So that when the king’s council is mentioned generally, it must be
                    defined,particularized, and understood <hi rend="italic">secundum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">subjectam materiem,</hi> according to the subject matter; and if
                    the subject be of a legal nature, then by the king’s council is understood his
                    council for matters of law, namely', his judges. Therefore, when by statute 16
                    Richard II. c. 5, it was declared a high offence to import into England any
                    papal bulls, or other processes, from Rome, and when it was enacted that the
                    offenders should be attached by their bodies, and brought before the king and
                    his council to answer for such offence. By the expression of king’s <hi
                    rend="italic">council,</hi> here made use of, was understood the king’s judges
                    of his courts of justice, the subject-matter being legal, and this being the
                    general way of interpreting the word <hi rend="italic">council.</hi></p>
                <p>But the principal council belonging to the king is his Privy Council, which is
                    generally, by way of eminence, called The Council. For an account of its
                    constitution and powers, sec <hi rend="smallcaps">Privy Council.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Council</hi><hi rend="italic">of War (</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    officers of an army or fleet, called by the general or admiral who commands, to
                    concert measures for their conduct. It has been remarked that councils of war
                    never fight.</p>

                    rend="italic smallcaps"> Council</hi> is an assembly which represents the body
                    of the universal church. The Romanists reckon eighteen of these; Bullinger, in
                    his Treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Conciliis,</hi> six; and
                    Dr Prideaux, seven: but Bishop Beveridge has increased the number to eight,
                    which, he says, includes all the general councils that have ever been held since
                    the time of the first Christian emperor. They are as follow: The council of
                    Nice, held in the reign of Constantine the Great, on account of the heresy of
                    Arius; the council of Constantinople, called under the reign and by the command
                    of Theodosius the Great, for nearly the same purpose as the former; the council
                    of Ephesus, convened by Theodosius the younger at the suit of Nestorius; the
                    council of Chalcedon, held in the reign of Martimis, which approved of the
                    Eutychian heresy; the second council of Constantinople, assembled by the Emperor
                    Justinian, which condemned the three chapters taken out of the book of Theodorus
                    of Mopsuestia (having first decided that it was lawful to anathematise the
                    dead), and also, according to some, the errors of Origen concerning the Trinity,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752862" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2862-0430"/>a plurality of
                    worlds, and the pre-existence of souls; the third council of Constantinople,
                    held by command of Constantius Pogonatus, the emperor, in which were received
                    the definitions of the five first general councils, and particularly that
                    against Origen and Theodorus of Mopsuestia; the second Nicene council; and the
                    fourth council of Constantinople, assembled when Louis II. was emperor of the
                    West. There arc several collections of the canons or decrees of councils. The
