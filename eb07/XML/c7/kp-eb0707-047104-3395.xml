                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    anciently the <hi rend="italic">Chersonesus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Taurica,</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> peninsula situated directly to the south
                    of St Petersburg, between the 44th and 46 th degrees of north latitude, and in
                    34 degrees of east longitude. Its southern and western coasts are on the Euxine,
                    its northern and eastern on the Putrid Sea and the Sea of Azof. It is joined to
                    the continent on the north by a small neck of land not more than six miles in
                    breadth. This peninsula has been known for more than three thousand years, since
                    the first naval expedition of the Argonauts; a story which, though mixed with
                    fable, is yet well founded in its principal facts. The mountainous parts were
                    inhabited by the Tauri, probably a colony of Scythians; while its coasts on the
                    west, the east, and the south, were occupied by Greeks. The Scythians were
                    driven out by Mithridates; the Greeks by the Sarmatians; and these again by the
                    Alani and Goths, a northern horde of Scythians. The Hungarians, the Cossacks,
                    and Tartars, succeeded in their turn; and the Genoese, in the twelfth century,
                    held a temporary and precarious possession of the sea-ports, which they were
                    obliged to yield to the Turks in 1475. At the peace of 1774, the Tartars of the
                    Crimea were declared independent; and in 1783, this peninsula was definitively
                    united to the Russian empire. ,</p>
                <p>From the isthmus, on which is built the fortress of Or-kapi or Pcrecop, to the
                    first elevation of the hill at Karasubasar, the country is one continued flat;
                    then it rises by an easy gradation to the summit of the hill, which forms the
                    southern side of the peninsula and the shore of the Euxine Sea. The surface of
                    the soil is almost all of one kind, namely, a reddish-gray loam; on digging, it
                    is found more or less mixed with a black earth, and the hills abound with marl.
                    The whole flat country from Perecop to the river Salgir, an extent of about
                    eighty miles, is full of saline marshes and lakes, whence the neighbóuring
                    Russian governments, as well as the Crimea itself, Anatolia, and Bessarabia, are
                    supplied with salt. The most remarkable of these lakes are five in number;
                    Koslof and Caffa, both very large, and so called after the towns near which they
                    lie; the Tusla, about fifteen versts<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The verst, a Kussian measure of length, is equal to 3520
                    English feet; consequently three versts are equal to two English
                    miles.</p></note> from Perecop, on the road from Caffa; the Red Lake, not far
                    from that last mentioned; and the Black Lake. Besides these, there are many
                    other swamps and lakes, whence the inhabitants obtain salt for their own
                    consumption.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the peninsula is so level that a man may travel over the half
                    of it without meeting with a river, or even the smallest brook; the inhabitants
                    of the villages, therefore, make a pit in the yard of every house, for receiving
                    and containing the rain water. The whole tract is destitute of every kind of
                    tree. Not a bush or a bramble is to be seen, and the herbage is extremely
                    scanty. This, however, does not proceed so much from the unfruitfulness of the
                    soil, as from the vast herds of cattle which rove from place to place, during
                    the whole year, by which means the grass in spring, summer, or autumn, no sooner
                    appears through the long drought which succeeds the rainy season, than it is
                    immediately devoured or trodden down. The universal prevalence of this custom of
                    keeping cattle to wander up and down, joined to the slothfulness of the Tartars,
                    together with their inaptitude and aversion to agriculture, is the reason of the
                    total neglect of cultivation in the Crimea. Were the land divided into portions
                    and properly managed, there would be a sufficiency for the cattle, and the rest
                    would be fruitful in corn and grain.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753408" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3408-0472"/>
                <p>This peninsula is indeed but a little district, yet from the many advantages
                    conferred upon it by nature it may be considered as peculiarly rich. It is
                    divided into the hill country and the flat. The latter, which extends from
                    Perecop to Koslof and the river Bulganap, to Karasubasar, Caffa, and Yenicali,
                    is diversified here and there with little Tartar villages, maintained by cattle
                    and the produce of the salt lakes. The highlands or hill country forms the
                    southern part of the Crimea, along the straight coast of the Black Sea, and
                    stretching westward in a right line from Cafla to the vicinity of Belbek. These
                    hills are composed of layers of chalk, which, in the headlands and promontories,
                    are soft, but more inland quite hard. The strata of the high hills are like
                    those of the promontories, and take a direction from north to south. These
                    qualities of the strata prevail not throughout the whole hills, but only in the
                    large and lofty ones; such as the two which rise near Karasubasar, and a very
                    high one near Akmetchet, which bears the name of Aktau. The other smaller hills
                    lie scattered and dispersed, but take the names of the greater ones, to which
                    they seem to belong, and are called <hi rend="italic">Palkans.</hi></p>
                <p>Nature has favoured these highland countries with great advantages, and blessed
                    them with abundance of all things. A number of springs which flow from the
                    mountains form the two considerable rivers Salgir and Karasu, which run into the
                    Putrid Sea. The former, which takes its rise from a cavern in a high hill near
                    Akmctchet, falls straight into the plain below, and waters a great part of the
                    Crimea; the other, commencing behind Karasubasar, falls likewise into the plain,
                    and mingles with the Salgir. There are many other little rivers and streams
                    which run eastward, and either join the two above mentioned or fall immediately
                    into the Putrid Sea. All the streams which begin at Cafla flow to the north or
                    the north-east, excepting the one behind Akmetchet, which falls on the other
                    side. This river, rising on the northern side of the mountain, flows, as was
                    before observed, towards the northeast, to the Salgir and the Putrid Sca; and
                    those which spring on the western side also take their course westward to the
                    Bulganak, and thence straight to the Black Sca, which receives all the other
                    little rivers which rise from these hills, as the Amma, the Katscha, the Belbek,
                    the Kasulkioi, and some others.</p>
                <p>The mountains arc covered with wood fit for the purpose of ship-building, and
                    abound in wild beasts. The valleys consist of fine arable land; whilst on the
                    sides of the hills grow corn and vines in great abundance, and the earth is rich
                    in mines. But the mountaineers are as careless and negligent as the inhabitants
                    of the deserts they slight all the advantages we have mentioned, and, like their
                    brethren of the lowlands, think themselves sufficiently happy if they are in
                    possession of a fat sheep and a small portion of bread.</p>
                <p>The houses in the towns as well as the villages are for the most part built of
                    square timbers, having the interstices filled with brick work, if the possessor
                    can afford it, and those of the poorer sort with turf. The chinks and crannies
                    are made tight with clay, and then plastered both within and without. The
                    covering commonly consists either of bricks or of turfs. Only the medscheds,
                    minarets, and baths are of stone, and a few, extremely handsome, of marble. They
                    have chimneys in the chambers, at which they likewise dress their victuals, but
                    no stoves in the Russian manner. In extreme frosts a great iron pan of charcoal
                    is brought into the room. Their custom is to sit upon low sofas, with Turkish
                    coverings and cushions, or upon a clay seat, somewhat raised above the ground
                    and covered with a carpet. In these rooms arc cupboards and chests, often
                    covered with cushions to serve as scats, and in these they keep their gold,
                    silver, and valuables. Such are the inner apartments or harams in which the
                    women generally live; the others are not so fine, and contain only a sofa, or a
                    bank of clay covered with a carpet, as in the chimney rooms.</p>
                <p>The rich Tartars, and their nobility or murzas, commonly reside all the year
                    round in the country, coming only to town when they have business there. There
                    are but few towns in the Crimea, at least in comparison of its former
                    population. The Krimskoi Tartars have no tribunals of justice, controversies and
                    quarrels being seldom heard of amongst them; and, if a dispute should arise, it
                    is immediately settled by an appeal to the Koran. Little differences which occur
                    in the villages about property, or other matters not taken notice of in that
                    code, are amicably adjusted by the eldermen and abeses; but in the towns all
                    weighty concerns, excepting the single case of murder or homicide, arc brought
                    before the kaimakan, or commandant, who settles them absolutely without
                    appeal.</p>
                <p>The residence of the khans of the Crimea was formerly Baktchi-serai, in which
                    city they held their seat for upwards of two centuries. They went thither from
                    Eski-Crim, or Old Crim, the capital city of the Genoese, upon Bengli Ghirei
                    Khan’s plundering the sea-ports, and expelling all the Genoese from their
                    stations. Before Eski-Crim became the capital, and indeed upon the Tartars first
                    coming into this peninsula, the sovereign residence was at Koslof; but here it
                    did not long continue. Under the khan Shagin Ghirei it was held at Caffa, the
                    ancient Theodosia, which is ten miles distant from Eski-Crim, said to be the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cimmerium</hi> of the ancients.</p>
                <p>The principal cities or towns of the Crimea shall now be enumerated. Perccop is a
                    fortified place, consisting only of three houses. The suburbs arc three versts
                    or two English miles distant, peopled by a thousand individuals, who carry on a
                    trade in salt; but they are very ill built. The towns arc chiefly situated in
                    the district watered by the Salgir. That part of the country in which Akmetchet,
                    or the capital, stands, is unfruitful, and ill provided with water, and the
                    inhabitants are exposed to endemi-cal fevers. This town has been called
                    Sympheropol by the Russians, since they became masters of the peninsula; but it
                    is only known in the country by the name which it received from the Tartars. The
                    population is not less than 20,000 souls. The inhabitants are indolent, and the
                    place is without commerce. The distance from Akmetchet to Baktchi-serai is not
                    more than thirty versts, or twenty English miles. It was once the residence of
                    the khan, and the Tartar capital of the Crimea. It is built on the craggy side
                    of a large natural moat or ravine between two mountains, and surrounded with
                    fountains, streams, terraces, hanging vineyards, and groves of black poplars
                    near rocks and precipices. The vast palace of the khans still remains, but many
                    other edifices have been destroyed by the victorious Russians. The number of
                    inhabitants is now reduced to seven or eight thousand; their principal trade
                    consists in cutlery and morocco leather. Tchufut-Kali, an ancient fortress
                    erected by the Genoese on a lofty precipice, is not more than five versts from
                    the last-mentioned town. It is now a place of refuge for 1200 Jews, of the sect
                    Karai. The character of the Karaites is very different from that of their
                    brethren in other countries; they live without reproach, their honesty is
                    proverbial in the Crimea, and the word of a Karaite is said to be as good as
                    another man’s bond. They still adhere to the law of Moses; they have rejected
                    the Talmud, every Rabbinical doctrine, and all interpolations of scriptural
                    texts. Koslof, which was for a short time distinguished by the name of
                    Eupatoria, is situated on the western coast; its port is the most commercial of
                    any in the peninsula, and its population amounts to 12,000 inhabitants, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194753421" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3421-0473"/> many of whom are
                    brewers of <hi rend="italic">bouza,</hi> the Mussulman ale, which is drunk on
                    the banks of the Sennaar. Akhtiar or Sebastopol, a large naval arsenal, and a
                    temporary station of the Russian Black Sea flcct, from which it can sail in
                    twenty-four hours to the Bosphorus, is built on the southern extremity of the
                    same coast. This was one of the chief mercantile towns of the ancient kingdom of
                    Colchis: it now contains about 3000 inhabitants. The harbour is excellent; the
                    principal bay, which runs up between four and five miles into the land, is from
                    six to eight hundred fathoms in width, and from ten to eleven fathoms deep, is
                    perfectly sheltered, and without a single shoal. After having doubled the capes
                    of the Chersonesus and St George, the voyager observes the narrow entrance of
                    the port Balaklava, where two thousand Greeks gain a subsistence by trade and
                    the produce of their mackarel fisheries'. All the rocky and steep coast from
                    Cape Aia to Cape Aitodoro is probably theŷrowí <hi rend="italic">of the
                    ram,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Criou-Metopon,</hi> of the ancients.
                    Travellers remark at the base of the mountains, or the Byzantine Klimata, the
                    romantic towns of Nikita, Aloutchti, Sou-dak, with its small harbour, and
                    Ioursof, with a castle belonging to the governors of Taurida. Caffa or the
                    ancient Theodosia is situated at the extremity of the mountains on the bay of
                    Caffa. It covers the southern side of the gulf, and rises like a vast theatre of
                    mosques and minarets near the hills which inclose that part of the bay. It
                    merited and obtained in past times the appellation of the Lesser Constantinople.
                    It contained 36,000 houses within its walls, and not fewer than 8000 in the
                    suburbs. It must be confessed, however, that the ruins do not indicate a space
                    proportionate to so great a number. Mahommed II. having made himself master of
                    the Bosphorus, took the town in 1475. It continued to flourish under the
                    Tartars; but its inhabitants, like those throughout the Crimea, abandoned their
                    possessions at the approach of the Russians, and the Genoese and Tartar
                    monuments were destroyed by the barbarous troops of the czar. ∖The present
                    population is less than 400. Kertsh, once t’ņe residence of Mithridates, and the
                    capital of the Bosplmrian kings, and Yenikali, a small fortress which
                    commands?Rıe strait, are situated on the eastern peninsula. Near the former is
                    the tomb of Mithridates; and a magnificent sarcophagus at Yenikali is now
                    converted into a reservoir. The Altyn Obo, or highest hill in that part of the
                    Crimea, is about four versts distant from Kertsh.</p>
                <p>The neck of land which joins the peninsula with the continent is at least six
                    miles broad, and is intersected by a wide and deep ditch lined with stone, which
                    reaches from the Black Sea to the Putrid Sea. This was formerly kept without
                    water, but it is now filled from both seas. On the Crimean side a high wall of
                    earth runs across from one sea to the other. The people pass over the ditch by
                    means of a drawbridge, and through the wall by a gateway. The walls of the
                    fortress are some fathoms from the road side, but the ruins are only now
                    discernible, namely, large brick houses, with a number of bomb-shells and
                    cannon-balls lying about them, which were formerly kept in the fortress. About
                    two miles from this is a pretty populous but miserable place, being probably the
                    town to which this fort belonged. Near the gate is a customhouse, where all
                    imports and exports pay duty.</p>
                <p>The Crimea was heretofore divided into twenty-four ka-duliks or districts,
                    namely, Yenikali, Kertsh, Arabat, Eski-Crim, Caffa, Karasubasar, Sudak,
                    Akmetchet, Yalof, Baktchi-serai, Balaklava, Mangup, Inkerman, Koslof, Or,
                    Mansur, Tarkan, Sivasch, Tischongar, Sarubulat, Barun, Argun, Sidschugut, and
                    Schirin. Several of these districts are named after the town or village in which
                    the governor resides.</p>
