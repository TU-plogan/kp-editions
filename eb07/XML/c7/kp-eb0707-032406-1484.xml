                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CORELLI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Arcangelo</hi></label>, the
                    celebrated musician and composer, was born at Fusignano, near Imola, in the
                    territory of Bologna, in February 1653. He received his first instructions in
                    counterpart from Matteo Simonelli of the Papal chapel; and, entertaining an
                    early inclination for the violin, he was put under Bassani, a master of that
                    instrument, at Bologna. Having completed his musical studies, in which he
                    rapidly acquired uncommon proficiency, Corelli visited Germany, and was retained
                    in the service of the Duke of Bavaria. He returned to Italy about the year <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194751497" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1497-0325"/> 1680, and settled
                    at Rome, where he composed his first twelve sonatas, and became leader of the
                    band of the opera, then in a very flourishing condition in that city.</p>
                <p>The fame of Corelli as a composer and performer began now to spread throughout
                    all Europe, and many persons went to Rome to study under the greatest master on
                    the violin who had then been heard of. In 1685 he published his second set of
                    sonatas, which he entitled <hi rend="italic">Balletti di Camera.</hi> In 1690,
                    his third, and in 1694 his fourth operas appeared. Of these four sets of
                    sonatas, which are written as trios for two violins and violoncello, with an
                    additional part for the organ, the third is generally accounted the best, but
                    all of them are remarkable for ingenious contrivance. Corelli subsequently gave
                    to the world his <hi rend="italic">Concerti</hi><hi rend="italic">grossi,</hi>
                    and other well known and highly esteemed works; but the most celebrated of all
                    his productions, and that by which he acquired the greatest reputation during
                    his lifetime, was his <hi rend="italic">Solos,</hi> composed in 1700, which have
                    been long and justly regarded as the foundation of all good schools for the
                    violin, and are said to have cost him three years to revise and correct
                    them.</p>
                <p>During his residence at Rome, Corelli enjoyed the favour and patronage of
                    Cardinal Ottoboni, the general encourager of polite arts and learning, at whose
                    house he became acquainted with the celebrated Handel. Cres-cembini informs us,
                    that he led an <hi rend="italic">academia</hi> or concert given by the cardinal
                    every Monday evening; and having been appointed permanent director of music, he
                    continued to reside in the palace of his patron till the day of his death, which
                    happened on the 18th of January 1713. He was buried in the church of the Rotunda
                    or Pantheon, in the first chapel on the left hand of the entrance of that
                    beautiful temple, where a monument, with a marble bust on it, was erected near
                    that of the great painter Raffaelle, by Philip William, count palatine of the
                    Rhine, under the care of Cardinal Ottoboni. For many years after his decease he
                    was commemorated by a solemn service, consisting of pieces selected from his own
                    works, on the anniversary of his death; a solemnity which continued as long as
                    his immediate scholars survived to conduct and perform in it. A bust was also
                    erected to his memory, in the Vatican, with this inscription: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corelli</hi><hi rend="italic">princeps Musicoum.</hi></p>
                <p>Corelli was a passionate admirer of pictures, and lived in an uninterrupted
                    friendship with Carlo Cignani and Carlo Marati, who were rivals for his favour,
                    and for a series of years presented him at times with pictures, as well of their
                    own as of other masters. He thus became possessed of a large and valuable
                    collection of original paintings, which, together with about L.6000 in money, be
                    bequeathed to his friend and patron Cardinal Ottoboni, who, reserving the
                    pictures to himself, generously distributed the rest of his effects among the
                    relations of the testator.</p>
                <p>Of the private life and moral character of the composer little information has
                    been preserved; “but,” as Dr Burney remarks, “if we may judge of his equanimity
                    and natural disposition, by the mildness, sweetness, and even tenor of his
                    musical ideas, his temper must have endeared him to all his acquaintance, as
                    much as his talents.” He was not, however, insensible of his acquirements, as we
                    are told that on one occasion, while playing a solo at Cardinal Ottoboni’s,
                    having remarked the cardinal and another person engaged in discourse, he
                    immediately laid down his instrument; and being asked the reason, replied, that
                    he feared the music interrupted their conversation.</p>
                <p>The compositions of Corelli are distinguished no less for elegance and purity of
                    melody, than for the harmony which results from the music of the several parts.
                    His talents were displayed to advantage in the most solemn, as well as in the
                    most lively style. Several of his movements are referred to by musicians as
                    quite perfect in their kind. His <hi rend="italic">allemands</hi> are remarkable
                    for spirit, force, and delicacy; his <hi rend="italic">gigas</hi> are gay and
                    sprightly; and his <hi rend="italic">adagios</hi> are expressive and imposing.
                    Some difference exists among modern musicians as to the manner of executing the
                    compositions of Corelli, particularly when they admit of extempore ornament from
                    the performer. On this point, however, we have the authority of an English
                    musical gentleman, who heard them performed at Rome by the scholars of the
                    master, for asserting that his works ought to be played in a slow, firm, and
                    distinct manner, just as they are written, and without changing the passages in
                    the way of embellishment.</p>
                <p>Geminiani’s estimate of the character of Corelli as a composer is upon the whole
                    a just one. “His merit,” says he, “was not depth of learning, like that of
                    Scarlatti; nor great fancy, or rich invention in melody or harmony; but a nice
                    ear and most delicate taste, which led him to select the most pleasing harmonies
                    and melodies, and to construct the parts so as to produce the most delightful
                    effect upon the ear.” It is indeed, we may add, in their peculiarly beautiful
                    construction, that the charm of Corelli’s compositions chiefly consists. Taken
                    as a whole, they do not display great inventive power; and all the varieties in
                    harmony, modulation, and melody they contain, might be comprised in a narrow
                    compass; but by an inimitable combination, or, as we may term it, dovetailing of
                    the parts, the composer has succeeded in producing effects which, while they
                    give a character of inexpressible fascination to his music, have rendered it
                    impregnable against the attacks of time and fashion. Notwithstanding the
                    striking changes that have been wrought upon musical art during the last
                    century, the tasteful musician looks with reverence and respect on the
                    time-honoured compositions of Corelli. Unfaded in worth, they are still
                    continually resorted to as the primitive but pure and copious emanations of a
                    refined and skilful genius, which has exercised no mean influence over the
                    progress of musical science to its present highly cultivated state. (z. z.)</p>
