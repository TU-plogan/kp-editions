                <p><label type="entry">CZAR</label>, a title of honour assumed by the grand dukes,
                    or, as they are now styled, emperors of Russia.</p>
                <p>The natives pronounce it <hi rend="italic">tzar, tsar,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >zaar</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this, it has been supposed, by corruption
                    from <hi rend="italic">Caesar.</hi> But this etymology does not seem correct.
                    When the Czar Peter formerly required of the European courts an acknowledgment
                    of his imperial titles, and that the appellation of Emperor should never be
                    omitted, there was great difficulty made about it, especially at the court of
                    Vienna; a circumstance which led him to produce the famous letter, written in
                    German, from Maximilian I. emperor of Germany, to Vassili Ivanovitch, confirming
                    a treaty of alliance offensive and defensive against Sigismund, king of Poland.
                    In this dispatch, which is dated the 4th of August 1514, and is ratified with
                    the seal of the golden bull, Maximilian addresses Vassili by the titles <hi
                    rend="italic">Kayser</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Herrscher aller</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Russen,</hi> emperor and ruler of all the Russias. But
                    independently of this document, there could be no doubt that the foreign courts,
                    in their intercourse with that of Moscow, styled the sovereigns indiscriminately
                    <hi rend="italic">Great Duke, Czar,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Emperor.</hi>
                    With respect to England, in particular, it is certain that, in Chancellor’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Account of Russia,</hi> published as early as the middle of the
                    sixteenth century, Ivan Vas-silievitch II. is called <hi rend="italic">Lord and
                    Emperor of all Russia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in the English
                    dispatches, from the reign of Elizabeth to that of Anne, he is generally
                    addressed under the same appellation. When the European powers, however, styled
                    the czar <hi rend="italic">Emperor of Muscovy,</hi> they by no means intended to
                    give him a title similar to that which was peculiar to the emperor of Germany;
                    but they bestowed upon him that appellation as upon an Asiatic sovereign, in the
                    same manner as we now speak of the emperors of China and Japan. When Peter,
                    therefore, determined to assume the title of emperor, he found no difficulty in
                    proving that it had been conferred upon his predecessors by most of the European
                    powers; yet when he was desirous of affixing to the term the European sense, it
                    was considered as an innovation, and was productive of more negotiations than
                    would have been requisite for the termination of the most important state
                    affair. At the same time it occasioned a curious controversy among the learned
                    concerning the rise and progress of the titles by <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    which the monarchs of the country in question have been distinguished. From
                    their researches it appeared that the early sovereigns of Russia were called
                    great dukes; that Vassili Ivanovitch was probably the first who styled himself
                    <hi rend="italic">tzar,</hi> an expression which in the Sclavonian language
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">king</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that his
                    successors continued to bear, within their own dominions, that title as the most
                    honourable appellation, until· Peter the Great first assumed that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Povelitel,</hi> or emperor. After many delays and objections, the
                    principal courts of' Europe consented, about the year 1722, to address the
                    sovereign of Russia by the title of Emperor, without prejudice, nevertheless, to
                    the other crowned heads of Europe.</p>
