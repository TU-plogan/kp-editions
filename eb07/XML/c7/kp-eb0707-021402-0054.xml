                <p><label type="entry">CONGO</label>, a country of considerable extent in the
                    southwest of Africa. It is bounded on the north by the river Congo or Zaire,
                    which separates it from Loango, and on the west by the Atlantic. The interior
                    boundaries are very uncertain, but it is conjectured that the country extends
                    several hundred miles in every direction. To the south are situated the
                    countries of Angola and Benguela; while the eastern frontier is said to be
                    composed of high and rugged mountains, inhabited by the savage tribe of the
                    Giagas, whose predatory inroads into the territory of Congo are frequent and
                    destructive.</p>
                <p>Congo was discovered, in 1487, by the Portuguese, who sent over successive bodies
                    of troops and missionaries to subjugate and Christianize the inhabitants. Their
                    writers have transmitted to us exaggerated accounts of the vast numbers of the
                    natives, of the great victories which were obtained over them, and also of their
                    having been finally brought under the yoke. The missionaries, likewise, with
                    equal disregard for truth, extolled the splendour and civilization of the
                    country. One of them states that the king could muster an army of 900,000 men,
                    and that he actually opposed the Portuguese with 80,000, who were completely
                    overthrown by 400 Europeans and 2000 negroes. These accounts go a great way
                    beyond even probability. Of its former population and splendour neither trace
                    nor tradition remains; and of the benefits which resulted to the inhabitants
                    from their intercourse with Christians, the evidences which existed when Captain
                    Tuckey visited the place, were a few' forts and factories for carrying on the
                    slave trade, and some crucifixes, which were not however held in equal
                    veneration with their own Pagan fetiches. Until the expedition sent out by the
                    British government, under the above-named officer, to explore the river Congo to
                    its source, we had no information respecting the country which could at all be
                    depended upon. It is to him, therefore, and to his scientific companions, that
                    we are indebted for the facts contained in the following account of this region
                    of the globe; and it only relates to that portion of Congo which is contiguous
                    to the Zaire.</p>
                <p>In the general appearance of its surface, in its natural products, and in the
                    state of society and the condition of the native inhabitants, this country is by
                    no means so interesting as many other parts of Africa. Along the sides of the
                    river the mountains are numerous, but not high; the most elevated probably do
                    not exceed two thousand feet. 3Ιιesc arc destitute of vegetation, with the
                    exception of a few rank grasses; and the lesser ranges of hills are without
                    those gigantic and wide-spreading forests which we might expect to find in such
                    a climate; only a few large trees are scattered upon their sides and summits.
                    Between the bases of these hills, however, and the margins of the river, the
                    alluvial banks, which extend from the mouth to a considerable distance upwards,
                    are clothed with exuberant vegetation, presenting to the eye one continuous
                    forest of majestic trees, covered with ever-green foliage. The river is studded
                    with numerous islands, which are mantled with the thick mangrove, intermingled
                    with the tall and elegant palm, whilst others are covered with the Egyptian
                    papyrus. The alluvial flats are succeeded by naked and precipitous mountains,
                    resting on micaceous slate, which forms the two banks of the river for at least
                    fifty miles; the only interruption to this range of heights being a few narrow
                    ravines, in which the villages of the natives are situated. Many of the hills
                    are also crowned with small villages, and the soil is sufficient for the
                    cultivation of the ordinary articles of food, but it is of an indifferent
                    description. Beyond these masses of micaslate the geological character of the
                    country changes. The granite hills give way to those of limestone, and numerous
                    promontories of marble project into the river, with fertile vales between them.
                    The whole country, according to Captain Tuckey, wore a more inviting aspect as
                    they penetrated into the interior, and towns and villages followed each other in
                    rapid succession far beyond the Congo territory. But the sickly state of the
                    party put a stop to the expedition, just as the improved condition of the
                    country held out a prospect of its complete success.</p>
                <p>In none of the journals kept by these enterprising individuals is the climate
                    complained of; on the contrary, they speak of the atmosphere as being cool, dry,
                    and refreshing. A westerly breeze sets in from the Atlantica few hours after
                    sunset, and continues till midnight, thus materially <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi> cooling and purifying the air. Of course much depends upon locality, and
                    accordingly at different situations, and these not very far apart, the range of
                    the thermometer in the shade at noon showed a difference sometimes of thirty
                    degrees. The winter in Congo is compared to the mild spring or autumn of Italy;
                    it is not subject to heavy <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> rains, but every
                    morning the earth is fertilized by falls of dew.</p>
                <p>The vegetable productions of this country are various, for the most valuable of
                    which the natives are indebted to the Portuguese. The staple products are manioc
                    or cassava, y <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> ams, and maize. To these maybe
                    added, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, millet of two or three species, cala-vanscs,
                    cabbages, spinach, pepper, capsicum, the sugarcane, and tobacco. Of fruits they
                    have the plantain, pa-paw, oranges, limes, and pine apples. The only beverage
                    used by the inhabitants, except when they fall in with European spirits, of
                    which they are extremely fond, is the juice of the palm tree, which goes by the
                    name of palm wine. It is of three different kinds, and was found by the party to
                    be a very refreshing and wholesome liquor.</p>
                <p>There is a sufficiency <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> of domestic animals for
                    food, but very little care appears to be bestowed upon them. They consist
                    chiefly <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> of goats, hogs, fowls, the common and
                    Muscovy duck, and pigeons. There are also a few sheep, which have a coat of hair
                    instead of wool. No beasts of burden of any description were found in the
                    country. Of wild animals there is a great variety, but from the indolent habits
                    of the natives they have never been converted to any useful purpose. Elephants,
                    leopards, buffaloes, monkeys, and numerous species of antelopes, abound. There
                    are also various other kinds of quadrupeds in abundance, and a plentiful supply
                    of wild fowl. The country appears to be remarkably <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi> free from those noxious insects which swarm almost universally in
                    tropical climates; fleas, bugs, and black ants must, however, be excepted. The
                    lower part of the river abounds in excellent fish, of which bream, mullet, and
                    cat-fish are the most abundant. Numbers of the natives gain a livelihood by
                    fishing for these, and also in dragging for a shell-fish which bears a
                    resemblance to the clam. The river swarms with hippopotami, and alligators, or
                    rather crocodiles: the flesh of the former is excellent food, though but little
                    used.</p>
                <p>The principal articles of subsistence, at least in the dry season, appear to be
                    manioc, ground nuts, and palm wines. Yams and Indian corn arc also used; of the
                    latter they have regularly two crops a year. Animal food is not in very general
                    use, although sold in the daily market held at Embamma. The negroes are
                    exceedingly filthy in their preparation and eating of animal food. The fowls are
                    broiled with the feathers unplucked, and pieces of goat, without the skin or
                    even the hair being removed; and they are devoured voraciously when scarcely
                    warm. Cannibalism, however, appears to be totally unknown in Congo.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194750067" xml:id="kp-eb0707-0067-0215"/>
                <p>None of the villages seen by the party were of great extent, the largest
                    apparently not exceeding one hundred huts. Embamma, Cooloo, and Juga, are each
                    the residence of a Chenoo, a sort of petty sovereign of a district: the first
                    consisted of about sixty huts, exclusively of the Chenoo’s residence, and about
                    five hundred inhabitants; the second of one hundred huts, and from five to six
                    hundred inhabitants; and the third of seventy huts, and about three hundred
                    inhabitants. Their huts are formed of mats woven from a reedy grass, or the
                    fibres of plants, six pieces of which, being put together, compose the house.
                    That of the Chenoo, however, is formed more skilfully of palm leaves, and
                    encompassed with a fence of reeds. The villages are usually embosomed in the
                    midst of palms and other lofty trees. The household furniture and utensils, in
                    simplicity and rudeness, are on a par with the domestic inclosures. Baskets are
                    made of the fibres of the palm tree; bowls and bottles of gourds and other
                    vegetables, for holding provisions and water; earthen vessels of home
                    manufacture, for boiling their victuals, with wooden spoons to eat them; while a
                    mat of grass thrown on a raised platform constitutes their only bedding. The
                    articles of dress are equally primitive, the common people being satisfied with
                    a small apron tied round their loins, and ornamented caps made of grass. Rings
                    of brass or iron enclasp the arms and ancles, and sometimes bracelets of lions’
                    teeth are used. The women in general adorn their necks, arms, and legs with
                    strings of beads.</p>
                <p>For agricultural purposes, a rude hoe is the principal or only implement in use;
                    but a slight scratch on the surface of the ground is sufficient for securing a
                    good crop in that propitious climate. The natives make no provision for future
                    contingencies, such as a year of scarcity; they only raise what will exactly
                    meet their wants until the usual harvest time comes round. This, it would
                    appear, arises principally from indolence, and not from a distrust in the right
                    and security of property. This is so well understood by them, that almost all
                    their disputes arise from their tenacity in the division of property, whether in
                    land or stock, which is frequently so minute, that it is not uncommon to see a
                    fowl or a pig partitioned amongst three or four proprietors.</p>
                <p>The paramount sovereign of Congo resides at a place of the same name, situated at
                    about six days’ journey into the interior. This place is supposed to be the St
                    Salvador of the Portuguese, but it was not visited by Captain Tuckey; and he
                    thinks that the existence of the sovereign is somewhat apocryphal. Keeping out
                    of view this regal personage, society in Congo appears to consist, first, of the
                    Chenoo; secondly, of the members of his family; thirdly, of the Mafooks;
                    fourthly, of the Foomoos; fifthly, of the fishermen, coolies, and labouring
                    people; and, sixthly, of the domestic slaves. The title and authority of the
                    Chenoo are hereditary in the female line; none of his sons can inherit unless
                    the mother be of royal blood. The Chenoo is little distinguished from his
                    subjects by dress or accommodation, and his ensign of office consists of a rod
                    of black wood inlaid with lead or copper. The daughter of the Chenoo chooses her
                    own husband, over whom she has sovereign control, and can sell into slavery if
                    she pleases. The members of the royal family are the Chenoo’s councillors, by
                    whose advice he acts in all matters of consequence. The Mafooks are the
                    collectors of the revenue, who begin their career as interpreters, and having
                    realized what is there considered a competency, are entitled to pass into the
                    higher grade of tax-gatherers. The Foomoos are those who possess houses and
                    lands of their own, with two or three wives, and perhaps a few slaves to work
                    for them. They would appear to be the yeomanry of the country. The fishermen and
                    labourers have no fixed property of their own, and are therefore much at the
                    disposal of the Chenoo. The domestic slaves are not numerous, and arc not
                    considered as transferable property, unless they are found guilty of some
                    serious crime.</p>
                <p>The natives of Congo are about the middle size, and they have in a somewhat less
                    degree both the black colour and the characteristic features of the race. '
                    Their physiognomy is pleasing, and said to bear the stamp of simplicity and
                    innocence. They are lively, good-humoured, and hospitable to strangers. In
                    energy and reflection they appear to be below the other African tribes, and
                    their habits of indolence are inveterate. This forms the chief bar to the
                    progress of improvement throughout the continent. As is generally the case
                    amongst an uncivilized people, the most laborious offices are here performed by
                    the weaker sex. Every man has wives in proportion to his rank; the Chenoo has
                    sometimes fifty. But the most scandalous part of their conduct consists in the
                    traffic made with the virtue of their females, whose moral impressions are also
                    very weak, and they thus offer no resistance, but rather glory in the
                    disgraceful practice. A glass of rum or a few beads is sufficient to secure the
                    favours of the first women in the country. A case of thieving came under the
                    notice of Captain Tuckey, but he is in favour of their general honesty. The
                    atrocious crime of poisoning, however, evidently prevails amongst them.</p>
                <p>With respect to religion, the Congoese are Pagans of the lowest description. A
                    <hi rend="italic">fetiche</hi> (from the Portuguese <hi rend="italic"
                    >fetico</hi> signifying a charm, witchcraft, magic) is a sort of tutelary deity,
                    and seems to be the Alpha and Omega of their veneration. Any thing serves for a
                    fetiche; the guardian genius is not fastidious about the symbol which recognises
                    his existence; the beak of a bird, the fin of a fish, or the hoof of a
                    quadruped, answers the purpose perfectly well. The making of these fetiches is
                    carried on as a trade by a certain class of men, who may be styled the
                    priesthood of the country. These ridiculous appendages are considered as
                    absolutely necessary for guaranteeing the safety of the houses and persons of
                    the negroes, and they are looked upon as talismans of infallible efficacy in
                    preventing every evil to which human nature is liable. The fetiche is employed
                    in the discovery of theft. For this purpose it is exposed in some public place,
                    when the people of the village dance round it, and with hideous yells call upon
                    it either to reveal the thief, or to oblige him to deposit in some fixed place
                    the article stolen, under the penalty of destruction to himself and his
                    relations. The restoration of the stolen article seldom fails to ensue after
                    this public exhibition. The Congoese have but a very vague idea of a good and
                    evil principle, or a future state; and the fetiche system seems to constitute
                    the religion of the country. With respect to the number of the inhabitants, it
                    is impossible to form even a conjecture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Congo,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Zaire,</hi> a large
                    river of Africa, which falls into the Atlantic Ocean in about the thirteenth
                    degree of south latitude. From the volume of water which it discharges into the
                    ocean, the length of its course, the greater part of which is still unknown, or
                    the rapidity of its current, it must be ranked amongst the first class of
                    rivers. It was for a length of time surmised that the Niger and the Congo were
                    identically the same river. This opinion, however, has been exploded by the
                    discovery of the termination of the former river by the Messrs Lander. But the
                    source of the latter still remains as a problem to be solved by the enterprise
                    of travellers. The breadth of the Congo at its mquth is about ten or twelve
                    miles; and its depth is extraordinary, no bottom having been found by Captain
                    Tuckey, who sounded it with a line of 113 fathoms. Its breadth at 140 miles from
                    its mouth continues to be from two to three miles. At this point the narrows
                    commence, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194750080" xml:id="kp-eb0707-0080-0216"/>when
                    the river contracts to from three to five hundred yards in breadth, and this
                    continues for a very considerable distance upwards. The banks are lined with
                    bristling rocks, which in several places shoot in ledges across the bed of the
                    river, and form rapids or cataracts. It is only, however, during the periodical
                    floods that the lowest and most formidable of these deserves the name of
                    cataract. Beyond these mountainous regions the Congo again expands to the
                    breadth of two, three, or even four miles, and flows with a current of from two
                    to three miles an hour. At the place where Captain Tuckey relinquished his
                    journey, which was about 280 miles from Cape Pedron, on the sea-coast, the banks
                    were clothed with luxuriant vegetation. Beyond this limit nothing certain is
                    known of its course; but the natives stated that there was no obstacle,to its
                    continued navigation, with the exception of a rapid, which, however, was
                    passable by canoes.</p>
