                    very eminent bookseller and publisher, whose name, in the latter capacity, is
                    connected with some of the most important and memorable productions of the
                    Scottish Press, and is, besides, particularly deserving of notice in the present
                    work, was born on the 24th February 1774, at Kellie, in the parish of Carnbee,
                    in Fifeshire. He was the son of Thomas Constable, a person of considerable
                    sagacity in rural affairs, who officiated as overseer or land-steward on the
                    estate of the Earl of Kellie. The first thirteen or fourteen years of his life
                    were passed under his father’s Voof; and his education was such as the school of
                    Carnbee then afforded, consisting of a course of reading in the vernacular
                    tongue, writing, arithmetic, and some lessons in trigonometry. Beyond this
                    humble curriculum we rather think that his subsequent acquisitions of the
                    elements of knowledge did not much extend. After taking up his residence in
                    Edinburgh, he may, however, have procured, though we do not know that he did so,
                    some private instruction in other branches; but he never attained to any
                    proficiency in academical learning—a defect which his native talents and address
                    enabled him both to surmount and to conceal; for he was never very fond of
                    avowing the want of that scholarship which, it must be allowed, was but seldom
                    discernible either in his conversation or his correspondence.</p>
                <p>In 1788, Mr Constable became an apprentice to Mr Peter Hill, bookseller in
                    Edinburgh, and he seems to have devoted himself, during the period of his
                    apprenticeship, to the acquisition of that knowledge of the early and rare
                    productions of the Scottish press, and generally of all publications relating to
                    the history, antiquities, and literature of Scotland, for which he continued to
                    retain a strong relish throughout his subsequent career. About the period of the
                    expiration of his apprenticeship, he married the daughter of Mr Willison, a
                    respectable printer; and having established himself as a bookseller in a small
                    shop in the High Street, afterwards rendered conspicuous by his celebrity as a
                    publisher, he issued, in November 1795, the first of those Sale Catalogues of
                    curious and rare books, which he continued for a few years to publish at
                    intervals, and which drew to his shop all the bibliographers and lovers of
                    learning in this city. <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> His congenial curiosity,
                    his quick intelligence, and the blandness of his manners, made it the' favourite
                    haunt, as well of those who had already earned a name· in letters, as of those
                    younger aspirants after distinction who were then only commencing their literary
                    career. We have known more than one instance where his obliging and prompt
                    endeavours to aid them in procuring books not easily found, laid the foundation
                    of literary connections which ended only with his life.</p>
                <p>From his first outset in business, Mr Constable had engaged in some small
                    publications; afterwards succeeded by others which he thought, at the time, by
                    no means inconsiderable—such as Campbell’s “History of Scottish Poetry,”
                    Dalzell’s “Fragments of Scottish History,” and Leyden’s edition of the
                    “Complaint of Scotland.” In the year 1801 be became the proprietor of two
                    periodical works, one of which, the “Farmer’s Magazine,” then of recent origin,
                    acquired under his management, and for some time maintained, a considerable
                    circulation; the other, the “Scots Magazine,” a miscellany which commenced in
                    1739, and was still esteemed as a curious repository of information regarding
                    the history, antiquities, and traditions of Scotland. This congenial publication
                    engaged at first a considerable share of his attention and solicitude; and the
                    genius and erudition of Dr John Leyden, and the Reverend Dr Alexander Murray,
                    whom he employed successively as its editors, contributed not a little to
                    enhance its reputation, and to raise it into some importance as a critical
                    journal, in that comparatively easy period of periodical literature.</p>
                <p>But a brighter day was soon to dawn; and its genial influences were not lost on a
                    mind that ever had been disposed to exercise its powers in the formation and
                    encouragement of literary projects. The first number of the Edinburgh Review was
                    published by Mr Constable in October 1802; and from that moment his fame as a
                    publisher commenced, and continued to increase, till it surpassed that of even
                    the most distinguished publishers of the metropolis. He was not, however, as has
                    sometimes been supposed, the projector of this celebrated journal. It owed its
                    origin to those whose genius and talents raised it to that pitch of glory,
                    hitherto unprecedented, which it almost at once attained; and we believe he was
                    at first rather startled by the mention of the design, and not in the least
                    prepared, any more than its projectors themselves were, to anticipate the
                    splendid success which awaited it. Without a publisher, in this place, of his
                    cast of mind, the work, however, might have encountered some difficulties; and
                    he was not slow to perceive, nor backward to follow, that line of conduct
                    towards its conductors, without the observance of which, the new relations
                    between them could not long have been harmoniously maintained. The present
                    highly respectable proprietors of the work became, some years after its
                    commencement, sharers of the property; but the publishing department remained,
                    we believe, under his direction. In 1805, he added to the list of his periodical
                    publications the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal; a work projected in
                    concert with the late Dr Andrew Duncan, and which still maintains its pristine
                    respectability.</p>
                <p>Sir Walter Scott, whilst yet “unknown to fame,” had been a frequenter of Mr
                    Constable’s shop; and from it was published, in the year just mentioned, the
                    “Lay of the Last Minstrel,”—the first of that series of romantic poems in which
                    the plastic genius of their author imparted so new, so rich, and so glowing an
                    interest to the legendary lore, and to the very hills and dales, of his native
                    land. Mr Constable’s reputation and business as a publisher were greatly
                    enhanced and extended by means of these brilliant and popular productions. He
                    “pursued the triumph, and partook the gale ;” but stih more after he had the
                    good <pb break="no" facs="nls:194750756" xml:id="kp-eb0707-0756-0268"/>fortune,
                    by publishing “Waverley,” to make the .world acquainted with those powers for
                    the composition of historical and romantic novels and tales with which its
                    author continued for so many years to astonish and delight the whole of Europe.
                    Mr Constable had the merit of suggesting subjects, and of. finding titles, for
                    more than one of those memorable works. Such, for example, was the case, as the
                    author himself has told us, with regard to “Rob Roy.” In the same year that
                    “Waverley” appeared,namely, 1814, he also published Sir Walter Scott’s edition
                    of “Swift’s Works.”</p>
                <p>We do not think it necessary to specify all the numerous works which Mr Constable
                    undertook, or in which he was professionally concerned; but it would be
                    unpardonable not to mention particularly, that in 1812 he was enabled to gratify
                    a wish he had long entertained, by the purchase of the copyright and stock of
                    this Encyclopaedia. The acquisition proved equally beneficial to his business
                    and to the cause of knowledge. It is, indeed, but common justice to say, that
                    his ambition to possess what he considered as a national work, was fully
                    justified by the measures he took, and the means he liberally provided, to
                    elevate its character and to extend its usefulness. Of the Supplement to its
                    later editions, which he projected, we shall only observe, that its success
                    equalled his own expectations, and far exceeded those of many others not so
                    capable of forming extensive views as to the best means of insuring success in
                    such undertakings.</p>
                <p>Having brought this little narrative to a period which, if we add the writings of
                    Mr Dugald Stewart, has enabled us to allude to Mr Constable’s principal
                    publications, we shall now hasten to close it. We must not, however, omit to
                    mention his own contributions, though not very important, to the stock of
                    Scottish historical literature. In 1810 he published, from an original
                    manuscript, a quarto volume, edited by himself, entitled the “Chronicle of Fife,
                    being the Diary of John Lamont of Newton, from 1649 to 1672;” and in 1822 he
                    drew up and published a “Memoir of George Heriot, Jeweller to King James,
                    containing an Account of the Hospital founded by him at Edinburgh.” This small
                    volume was suggested by the honourable mention of Heriot, and his noble
                    endowment, in the “Fortunes of Nigel,” published during the spring of that
                    year.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of the preceding year, Mr Constable had gone to reside in the
                    neighbourhood of London, having been advised, owing to a severe attack of
                    illness, to pass the winter in a milder climate. This absence, and its cause,
                    are alluded to by Sir Walter Scott, in terms of regret, in the Introductory
                    Epistle to the “Fortunes of Nigel.” Here, speaking in the person of Captain
                    Clutterbuck, he says, “I entered the shop at the Cross to inquire after the
                    health of my worthy friend, and learned with satisfaction that his residence in
                    the south had abated the rigour of the symptoms of his disorder.” Here also
                    there is an encomium on Mr Constable, which it would be unfair alike to the
                    generous spirit of its illustrious author, and the merits of its object, not to
                    recall in this sketch. He is commended as one “whose vigorous intellect and
                    liberal ideas had not only rendered his native country the mart of her own
                    literature, but established there a court of letters, which commanded respect
                    even from those most inclined to dissent from many of its canons. The effect of
                    these changes,” it is added, “operated in a great measure by the strong sense
                    and sagacious calculations of an individual, who knew how to avail himself, to
                    an unhoped for extent, of the various kinds of talent which his country
                    produced, will probably appear more clearly to the generation .which shall
                    follow the present.”</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1822, Mr Constable returned from</p>
                <p>England; and in the following year he removed his establishment from the premises
                    at the Cross, so graphically and correctly described in the above Epistle, and
                    where all his fame had been acquired, to more spacious and splendid
                    accommodations in the modern part of the city. In no long time after this
                    change, namely, about the commencement of 1826, the· world was surprised by the
                    unwelcome and lamentable announcement of the bankruptcy of his house. Such a
                    close to a career as a publisher so splendid, and apparently so prosperous, was
                    not a little calculated to Create doubts both as to his hitherto unquestioned
                    skill in his profession, and the success of even his most noted undertakings.
                    Many were inclined to think, in the words of the proverb, that there had been
                    “more cry than wool.” But though it would be too much to say that all his
                    schemes were wise, or all his actions prudent, there can be no doubt either of
                    his eminent skill or of his success. His failure, we believe, was mainly owing
                    to his original want of capital, and to his having early settled with a retiring
                    partner, upon a principle of adjustment dictated by a too overweening view of
                    his own prosperity. The progressively augment ing contractions, and the wasteful
                    sacrifices, resulting from these causes, absorbed the profits of his best
                    enterprises, and led too certainly to an issue which yet to many appeared
                    unaccountable. His misfortunes overtook him busied as usual with literary
                    projects, particularly with that of the “Miscellany,” afterwards published under
                    his name; —the precursor of that multitude of devices for cheapening knowledge
                    which form so remarkable a feature of the current literature of these times.
                    This was his last project. The disease that formerly afflicted him returned,
                    with increased severity, in 1827, and at length proved fatal on Saturday the
                    21st of July in that year.</p>
                <p>We shall here insert, though at the cost of some repetition, the greater part of
                    a tribute to his memory, which appeared in the newspapers of this city two days
                    after his death, and which was written, by one who had been intimately
                    acquainted with him in his publishing capacity.</p>
                <p>“We are concerned to learn that Mr Constable, our late eminent publisher, who had
                    for some time suffered severely under a dropsical complaint, expired suddenly,
                    at his house in Park Place, on the afternoon of Saturday. This event has, we
                    confess, excited in our minds a train of melancholy recollections and regrets;
                    and we cannot refrain from thus publicly expressing our respect for the memory
                    of a man, who, notwithstanding the disastrous termination of his professional
                    career, must long be remembered as a liberal friend of literary merit, and
                    active promoter of those literary enterprises which, during the last twenty-five
                    years, have redounded so much to the advantage and fame of this city. We do not
                    scruple to say, that we have nationality enough to have derived a lively
                    satisfaction from seeing it become an object of desire among the literati of the
                    south to contribute to its literary undertakings, and to resort to it as an
                    advantageous mart of publication; and, convinced as we are, that this was in no
                    small degree owing to the liberal views, the professional talents, activity, and
                    address of Mr Constable—convinced, moreover, that the opinion of the public of
                    this place is, in this respect, in unison with our own—we feel assured that, in
                    offering to his memory this mournful tribute of our private regard and respect,
                    we at the same time give utterance to feelings strongly felt by the community at
                    large. It is now somewhat more than thirty years since Mr Constable began to
                    attract the notice of the learned of this city by his knowledge of rare books,
                    particularly of those connected with the early literature of Scotland; and
                    several years before his name became <pb break="no" facs="nls:194750769"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-0769-0269"/>known to the world as a considerable publisher, he
                    had succeeded, as well by the amenity of his manners as by his professional
                    intelligence and activity, in rendering his shop the favourite resort of all the
                    more curious and aspiring spirits of the place. His views, however, were never
                    limited to the collection of literary rarities, or to a merchandise confined to
                    the existing materials of literature. He had always longed to become
                    instrumental in adding something of importance to the stock of knowledge, and to
                    enrol his name in the list of the more liberal and enterprising publishers of
                    the day. Edinburgh fortunately possessed the means of gratifying this laudable
                    ambition; and he as fortunately appeared at a period when, without such a man,
                    her native genius might have been hampered in its flights, or damped and
                    circumscribed in the ardour and range of its aspiring exertions. His fame as a
                    publisher commenced with the appearance of the Edinburgh Review, which he had
                    the honour of ushering into the world; and he long ministered to its success and
                    its glory by a deportment towards its conductors and authors as discreet and
                    respectful as it was manly and liberal. Some years after the first appearance of
                    this celebrated journal, he became the proprietor of the Encyclopaedia
                    Britannica, for which he paid a price that excited the surprise of some of the
                    more timid of his brethren, but which was amply warranted by the measures and
                    results his superior intelligence and sagacity had enabled him to plan and
                    foresee. When that work became the property of his house, the printing of its
                    fifth edition was too far advanced to admit of any material improvements; but Mr
                    Constable saw very clearly that these were largely required in order to place it
                    on a level with the knowledge, the wants, and the spirit of the age; and he
                    accordingly devised the project of that Supplement which has added so much to
                    the value and celebrity of the work to which it was appended, and to the public
                    stock of useful knowledge and varied learning. Many doubts as to the expediency
                    of a supplemental publication upon so extensive a scale, were, we believe,
                    expressed by those who pretended to experience and skill in such undertakings;
                    but Mr Constable’s anticipations were fully realised by the signal success of
                    this favourite design; and we have always understood that those highly liberal
                    arrangements by which he endeavoured to provide for its usefulness and
                    reputation, and without which the success attending it never could have been
                    achieved, were entirely the result of his own suggestions, and the dictation of
                    his own understanding. During the progress of those works, his house was still
                    farther aggrandised by the publication of the writings of Mr Dugald Stewart and
                    Sir Walter Scott; the one bearing the most illustrious name in the serious, the
                    other in the lighter, branches of our national literature. His intercourse with
                    the latter was much more intimate, varied, and extensive, and in many respects
                    more remarkable, than was ever before exemplified between author and publisher.
                    The publication, first of the highly popular poems, and latterly of the still
                    more popular novels, of that extraordinary genius, raised his house to the acme
                    of its fame; and contributed still more largely, perhaps, than any other of the
                    connections that have been mentioned, to that celebrity as a publishing
                    establishment which it so long enjoyed.”</p>
                <p>“We have here only detailed a few particulars, calculated to justify the
                    sentiments of grateful respect which we entertain for the memory of Mr
                    Constable, as by far the most eminent publisher that Scotland ever produced. In
                    that line we certainly do not expect soon again to see a man joining such
                    professional abilities to such liberal and extensive views; so capable of
                    appreciating literary merit, and so anxious to find for it employment and
                    reward; so largely endowed with the discernment, tact, and manners necessary to
                    maintain a useful, honourable, and harmonious intercourse with literary
                    men."</p>
                <p>We have but little to add to the foregoing details. Mr Constable was twice
                    married, and left several children by both his marriages. His frame was bulky
                    and corpulent; but his countenance was rernatkably pleasing and intelligent. The
                    late Sir Henry Raeburn’s portrait of him is one of the most successful
                    likenesses and best pictures of that excellent artist. His manner and
                    conversation were by no means those of an ordinary man; and his general conduct
                    was affable, good humoured, and friendly. It must, however, be allowed, that he
                    was liable to passionate impulses, which sometimes mastered his better powers,
                    and vented themselves in expressions neither decorous nor justifiable. But his
                    strong sense and kindly feelings seldom failed to restore him quickly to
                    propriety. It may, in a word, be truly said of him as Dr Johnson said of Cave,
                    the publisher of the Gentleman’s Magazine^ “that such he was as they who best
                    knew him have most lamented.”</p>
