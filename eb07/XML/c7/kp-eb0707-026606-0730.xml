                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CONSISTORY</label>, a term commonly used to denote a
                    council-house of ecclesiastical persons, or place of justice in the spiritual
                    court, and also a session or assembly of prelates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Consistory,</hi> at Rome, denotes the college of cardinals,
                    or the pope’s senate and council, before which causes are pleaded., Du Cange
                    derives the word from <hi rend="italic">consistorium,</hi> that is, <hi
                    rend="italic">locus</hi><hi rend="italic">ubi consistitur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> a vestibule, gallery, or antichamber, where the courtiers wait for
                    admission, and so called <hi rend="italic">a consistente multitudine.</hi></p>
                <p>The consistory is the first court, or tribunal of Rome, and never meets, except
                    when the pope chuses to convoke it. The pope presides in it in person, mounted
                    on a magnificent throne, and habited in his pontifical robes; whilst on the
                    right are the cardinal-bishops and priests, and on the left the
                    cardinal-deacons. The place where it is held is a large hall in the apostolical
                    palace, where princes and ambassadors of kings are received. The rest of the
                    prelates, the prothonotaries, auditors of the rota, and other officers, are
                    seated on the steps of the throne; whilst the courtiers sit on the ground,
                    ambassadors on the right, and consistorial and fiscal advocates behind the
                    cardinals.</p>
                <p>Besides the public, there is also a private consistory, held in a retired
                    chamber, and called the <hi rend="italic">chamber of popegay,</hi> where the
                    pope’s throne is only raised two steps high. Nobody is admitted except the
                    cardinals, whose opinions are collected, and called <hi rend="italic"
                    >sentences.</hi> Here are first proposed and passed all bulls for bishoprics,
                    abbeys, and the like; and hence bishoprics and abbeys are said to be
                    consistorial benefices, because they must be proposed in the consistory, the
                    annates paid to the pope, and his bulls taken. Anciently they were elective; but
                    by the concordat, which abolishes elections, they are appointed to be collated
                    by the pope alone, on the nomination of the prince.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Consistory</hi> is also used in the reformed church to
                    signify a council or assembly of ministers and elders, convened in order to
                    regulate matters of discipline, and other church affairs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Consistory,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Court Christian,</hi>
                    in the English law, is a council of ecclesiastical persons, or the place of
                    justice in an ecclesiastical or spiritual court. Every archbishop and bishop has
                    a consistorial court, which is held before his chancellor or commissary, either
                    in his cathedral, or in some chapel, aisle, or portico belonging thereto, or in
                    some other convenient place of his diocese, for the trial of ecclesiastical
                    causes.</p>
