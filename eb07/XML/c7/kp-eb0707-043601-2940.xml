                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">COWPER, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished English poet, was born at Bdrkhamstead, in Hertfordshire, on the
                    26th of-November 1731. His father, who was rector of the parish, was nephew to
                    Lord Chancellor Cowper, and chaplain to George II. At six years of age Cowper
                    was taken from under the care of a mother whose amiable qualities were
                    afterwards commemorated in one of his loveliest poems, and placed at a school in
                    Bedfordshire. The poet had received from nature a mind so remarkably sensitive
                    as to render him incapable ofbearing up under the common hardships of life. The
                    arrows of affliction, which are shared by all, were poisoned to him, and the
                    lightest of them cankered where it fell. It was his misfortune to be early tried
                    at school, and the sufferings he endured, particularly from a school-fcllow, an
                    embryo tyrant of fifteen, embittered his opinion of public education ever
                    afterwards. The impression which these wrongs made upon him survived the
                    vicissitudes of half a century, and were embodied in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tirocinium.</hi></p>
                <p>From the age of eight to nine he'was boarded with an oculist, on account of a
                    complaint in his eyes. He was then sent to Westminster, where he continued until
                    lie was eighteen, when he removed to the office of a London solicitor.</p>
                <p>By his own account his time was there spent in extreme idleness. After serving
                    three years in the house of the solicitor, he went into chambers in the Temple;
                    but his hours were devoted to other pursuits than those connected with his
                    profession, which he had rather attached himself to from a sense of duty than
                    adopted from choice. At this period he translated some pieces from Horace, and
                    assisted Lloyd and Colman with some prose effusions for their periodical works.
                    Without charging Cowper with intemperance at this time, it may be said that he
                    lived as a man of the world. He formed a segment of a gay and convivial circle,
                    composed of men distinguished for their wit and talent; and for these qualities
                    he was himself by them highly admired and esteemed in return.</p>
                <p>His circumstances, however, soon compelled him to cast about for a situation, and
                    by the influence of a powerful friend and relation he was appointed to the
                    lucrative.office of clerk to the committees of the House of Lords; but his
                    natural antipathy to serve in any thing like a public capacity caused the
                    appointment to be changed to that of clerk of the journals in the same house.
                    But the prospect of easy competency thus opened up to him was completely
                    darkened by the approaches of that dreadful calamity which afterwards entirely
                    eclipsed his reason. During several months he attended at the house and examined
                    the books, in order to gain the knowledge necessary to qualify for the
                    clerkship. The progress he made will be best learned from his own words. “The
                    journal books,” says he, “were indeed thrown open tome, a thing which could not
                    be refused, and from which perhaps a man in health, and with a head turned to
                    business, might have gained all the information he wanted; but it was not so
                    with me. I read without perception, and was so distressed, that had every clerk
                    in the office been my friend it could have availed me little; for I was not in a
                    condition to receive instruction, much less to elicit it out of the manuscripts
                    without direction.” A strong opposition to his friend’s right of nomination had
                    begun to show itself; and as every advantage was sought for to disconcert him,
                    Cowper expected to be examined at the bar of the house. To pass with eclat
                    through this, to him, terrible ordeal, he was preparing himself, as we have
                    seen. As the day of trial drew nigh his agonies increased, till they at last
                    fairly unsettled his brain. On the day appointed for his examination his friend
                    called upon him, and found his protégé in a state too deplorable to be dwelt
                    upon. He had attempted suicide, and the fearful insignia of self-destruction lay
                    scattered about his apartment. These, were, a garter, which had been broken, and
                    an iron rod across his bed, which had been bent in the effort to accomplish his
                    purpose by strangulation.</p>
                <p>In this dreadful state of mind he was removed to the house of Dr Cotton of St
                    Albans, with whom he continued for nineteen months. His faculties, however, had
                    begun to return within less than the half of that time; and his religious
                    despondency, which added a fearful contribution to his malady, had begun to give
                    way before more consolatory views of faith and piety. In his own fine language,
                    the arrows with which his “panting side was charged” with “gentle force” had
                    been extracted from the “stricken deer.” In June 1765 he repaired to Huntingdon,
                    where he settled in lodgings, attended by a man servant who had followed him
                    from his last residence out of pure attachment. For four months he continued
                    alone among strangers; for although he was occasionally visited by a <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194752953" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2953-0437"/> few neighbours,
                    he rather declined than .sought society; ' and the consequence was, that his
                    spirits began again to sink. He found himself, he says, “like a traveller in the
                    midst of an inhospitable desert, without affriend to comfort or a guide to
                    direct him.” Both of these, however, were soon supplied to him-in the, person of
                    Mr Unwin,, the son of the clergyman of the place, who, struck with Cowper’s
                    interesting appearance at church, introduced himself to his acquaintance, and
                    finally brought him as a boarder into the bosom of his own,amiable family. This
                    was the most fortunate event which could have happened to the poet. ,The
                    religious sentiments of the Unwins were peculiarly in unison with his own; and
                    their routine of life was in every respect calculated to gratify his religious
                    .zeal, to restore to his feeble nerves their wonted tension, and to his mind
                    that serenity and repose which, if not perfect calm, was as near an approach to
                    it as could well be expected in one so singularly constituted. After the death
                    of Mľ Unwin, senior, in 1767, he accompanied Mrs Unwin and her daughter to a new
                    residence which they bad chosen at Olney, in Buckinghamshire. Here he formed an
                    intimate friendship with the Rev. John Newton, then curate of the parish,
                    to∣whose collection of hymns he added several compositions of a very superior
                    character, and which were published long before he was publicly known as a
                    votary of the muses.</p>
                <p>In 1770, Cowper’s fraternal feelings received a seyere shock by the death of his
                    brother John, whom he tenderly loved. Three years afterwards his awful malady
                    returned, accompanied with violent paroxysms of religious despondency, and his
                    faculties were again doomed to suffer an eclipse, which lasted for about five
                    years. During this melancholy period Mrs Unwin ministered to him with maternal
                    patience, and tenderness. Upon his second recovery he busied himself with taming
                    hares and making bird-cages, and, other similar amusements. Landscapedrawing
                    also engaged his attention; and, what was of far more importance to the world,
                    he began seriously and with assiduity to cultivate his poetic powers. The winter
                    of 1780—81 was spent in preparing a volume for the press, consisting of Table
                    Talk, Hope, The Progress of Error, Charity, &amp;c. which was published in 1782.
                    Its reception was far below its merits, but the expectations of the author were
                    modest, and he can scarcely be said to have been disappointed when it is known
                    that he ranked Dr Johnson and Benjamin Franklin among his zealous admirers.
                    Their authority was certainly a sufficient balanceweight against that of the
                    sapient critic who, in reviewing the volume, remarked, that Cowper was a good
                    pious man, but destitute of one spark of poetic fire. When we take into
                    consideration the character of that school of poetry which was almost
                    universally cultivated and read from the time of Pope to the advent of Cowper,
                    it is not at all surprising that the latter should have failed to make an
                    immediate general impression. His poems displayed <hi rend="italic">a</hi> wide
                    departure from the dogmas of that school. The versification was deficient in
                    that polish and harmony where sound is too often introduced as a substitute for
                    vigour and strength. There was a familiarity of diction, a colloquial style of
                    expression, which was quite original, and little likely to obtain quarter with
                    those who had been so long habituated, to consider sonorous grandiloquence as an
                    indispensable requisite in poetry. There can be no doubt, however, that although
                    Ċowper’s verses wanted “the long resounding march,” they had no lack of the
                    “energy divine.” The rind was rough and unpromising, but it inclosed the genuine
                    fruit of the Hesperides.</p>
                <p>In the,same year in which Cowper published his first volume, an addition was made
                    to the. family circle of Olney, by the arrival of an elegant and accomplished
                    lady, the widow of Sir Robert Austin. This acquaintance proved very delightful
                    to the poet. She had wit, gaiety, agreeable manners, and elegant taste. At her
                    suggestion Cowper began his great original poem the Task, and also the
                    translation of Homer. Mrs Unwin, however, grew jealous of the influence which
                    Lady Austin had obtained over the mind of the poet, and it became necessary for
                    him at last to sacrifice her society. In 1784 the Task appeared, and completely
                    established his fame. The occasion which gave rise to it was exceedingly
                    trivial. Lady Austin bad requested him to write a piece in blank verse, and gave
                    him for its subject a thing next to her, namely, <hi rend="italic">the
                    sofa.</hi> This he expanded into one of the finest moral poems our language has
                    produced. It is written in blank verse as desired; and though in that respect it
                    resembles Milton’s, it is nevertheless original and highly characteristic. It is
                    not too stately for familiar description, nor too depressed for sublime and
                    elevated imagery. If it has any fault, it is that of being too much laden with
                    idiomatic expression; a fault which the author, in the rapidity with which his
                    ideas and his utterance seem to have flowed, very naturally incurred. In this
                    poem his fancy disported with the most excursive freedom. The poet enlarges upon
                    his topics, and confirms his argument by every variety of illustration. But he
                    never dwells upon them too long, and leaves off in such a manner, that it seems
                    it was in his power to have said more. The arguments of the poem are various.
                    The works of nature, the associations with which they exhibit themselves, the
                    designs of Providence, and the passions of men. Of one advantage the writer has
                    amply availed himself. The work not being rigidly confined to any precise
                    subject, he has indulged himself in all the laxity and freedom of a
                    miscellaneous poem; yet he has still adhered so faithfully to the general laws
                    of congruity, that whether he inspires the softer affections into his reader, or
                    delights him with keen and playful raillery, or discourses on the ordinary
                    manners of human nature, or holds up the bright pictures of religious
                    consolation to his mind, he adopts, at pleasure, a diction just and appropriate,
                    equal in elevation to the sacred effusions of pious rapture, and sufficiently
                    easy and familiar for descriptions of domestic life; skilful alike in soaring
                    without effort, and in descending without meanness. He who desires to put into
                    the hands of youth a poem which, not destitute of poetical embellishment, is yet
                    free from all matter of a licentious tendency, will find in the Task a book
                    adapted to bis purpose. It would be absurd and extravagant austerity to condemn
                    those poetical productions in which love constitutes the leading feature. That
                    passion has in every age been the concernment of life, the theme of the poet,
                    and the plot of the stage. Yet there is a kind of amorous sensibility, bordering
                    on morbid enthusiasm, which the youthful mind too often imbibes from the glowing
                    sentiments of the poets. Their genius describes, in the most splendid colours,
                    the operations of a passion which requires rebuke rather than incentive, and
                    lends to the most grovelling sensuality the enchantments of a rich and creative
                    imagination. But in the Task of Cowper there is no licentiousness of
                    description. All is grave, majestic, and moral. A vein of sober thinking
                    pervades every page, and, in finished poetry, he describes the insufficiency and
                    vanity of human pursuits. Not that he is always severe. He frequently enlivens
                    the mind of his reader by sportive descriptions, and by representing, in
                    elevated measures, ludicrous objects and circumstances, a .species of the mock
                    heroic so admired in Phillips’ Splendid Shilling. The historical account he has
                    given of chairs, in the first book of the Task, is a striking specimen of his
                    powers of versification, and of his talent for humour in this latter style. The
                    attention is however the most <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752966"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2966-0438"/>detained by those passages in which the charms of
                    rural life, and the endearments of domestic retirement, are described. The Task
                    abounds with incidents, introduced as episodes, and interposing an agreeable
                    relief to the grave and serious part of the poetry. His Crazy Kate is a
                    description of the calamity of a disordered reason, admirably exact and
                    affecting.</p>
                <p>• ' She begs, an idle pin of all she meets.</p>
                <p>What other poet would have introduced so minute a circumstance into his
                    representation; and yet that minuteness constitutes its peculiar merit, and
                    produces the happiest effect.</p>
                <p>Of his talent for painting there cannot be a better specimen than his sketch of
                    the melancholy man, probably drawn from what too faithful memory suggested of
                    himself:</p>
                <p>Look where he comes—in this embower’d alcove Stand close concealed, and see a
                    statue move; Lips busy, and eyes fixt, foot falling slow, Arms hanging idly
                    down, hands clasp’d below, Interpret to the marking eye distress, Such as its
                    symptoms only can express.</p>
                <p>That tongue is silent now ;—that silent tongue Could argue once, could jest or
                    join the song, Could give advice, could censure or commend, Or charm the sorrows
                    of a drooping friend. Renounced alike its office and its sport, Its brisker and
                    its graver strains fall short; Both fall beneath a fever’s secret sway, And like
                    a summer brook are past away.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Retirement-</hi></p>
                <p>His occasional poems are remarkably fine, and John Gilpin is one of the most
                    humorous pieces in the language. His next work was a translation of the Iliad
                    and Odyssey ĩrtto Miltonic blank verse. It is unjust to compare the version of
                    Mr Pope with that of Mr Cowper. The merits of each are distinct and appropriate.
                    Mr Cowper died of a severe and lingering illness, at East Dereham, in Norfolk,
                    on the 25th of April 1800.</p>
