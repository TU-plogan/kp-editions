                <p><label type="entry">CRANMER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, the first
                    Protestant archbishop of Canterbury, was descended of an ancient family, and was
                    born on the 2d of July 1489, at Aslacton in the county of Nottingham, being the
                    second son of Thomas Cranmer and of his wife Agnes Hatfield. He received what
                    was then considered as a suitable education for a gentleman; nor did he neglect
                    the recreations of hunting and hawking, and the use of the bow. After his
                    father’s death, and when he himself was only fourteen years of age, he was sent
                    to Jesus College, Cambridge, and about the year 1510 he was elected to a
                    fellowship. Erasmus, one of the great restorers of solid and elegant learning,
                    had already contributed his powerful aid in rescuing this university from
                    scholastic jargon and monkish barbarism. The rectitude of Cranmer’s
                    understanding enabled him to give a beneficial tendency to his academical
                    studies: not satisfied with the antiquated course, he likewise devoted a portion
                    of his time to the acquisition of the Greek and Hebrew languages; and if he
                    never became celebrated for the purity or elegance of Latinity, it must be
                    recollected that his chief attention was devoted to higher objects. Before be
                    had reached the twenty-third year of his age, he vacated his fellowship by
                    marriage. His wife, who in reality appears to have been the daughter of a
                    gentleman, some Catholic writers of his own time have industriously represented
                    as a woman of low condition; and were we even to admit the accuracy of their
                    representations, it is not easy to perceive that he would thus be curtailed of
                    any portion of his moral dignity. He was now employed as a reader or lecturer in
                    Magdalen, or, as it was then called, Buckingham College; and, says John Fox,
                    “for that he would with more diligence apply that his office of reading, placed
                    his said wife in an inn called the Dolphin, the wife of the house being of
                    affinity to her. By reason whereof, and of his open resort unto his wife at that
                    inn, he was much marked of some Popish merchants; whereupon rose the slanderous
                    noise and report against him after he was preferred to the archbishoprie of
                    Canterbury, raised up by the malicious disdain of certain malignant adversaries
                    to Christ and his truth, bruiting abroad everywhere, that he was but a hostler,
                    and therefore without all good learning.” FIis wife died about twelve months
                    after their marriage; and it is an obvious proof of the estimation in which he
                    was held,* that he was immediately restored to the fellowship which he had
                    vaeated. He pursued his studies with renewed ardour; and adhering to the plan of
                    reading with a pen in his hand, he now prepared a stock of materials which he
                    found of no small value in his future controversies.</p>
                <p>In the year 1524 be declined the offer of a fellowship in the college which
                    Wolsey had founded at Oxford. About the same period he took the degree of D. D.,
                    and was appointed to the lectureship in that faculty by his own college. In 1526
                    he was nominated one of the public examiners in divinity; and in this situation
                    he appears to have been instrumental in scattering the seeds of reformation. He
                    had been entrusted with the education of the two sons of a gentleman named
                    Cressy, who resided in the parish of Waltham-Abbey and county of Essex, and
                    whose wife was related to Cranmer. Being driven from Cambridge by an epidemic
                    distemper, the preceptor and his pupils retired to Cressy’s house; nor does it
                    clearly appear that he afterwards resided in the university. The king had made
                    an excursion to the neighbourhood; and two of his attendants, Dr Gardiner,
                    afterwards bishop of Winchester, and Dr Fox, afterwards bishop of Hereford,
                    having met Cranmer at Waltham, began to discuss with him the momentous question
                    of the king’s divorce from Catherine of Aragon. This princess had been married
                    to Arthur, the elder brother of Henry, but, according to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194753057" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3057-0445"/>her own solemn averment,
                    their nuptials had never been consummated. For the second marriage, a papal
                    dispensation had been obtained in due form; nor'does the king appear to have
                    been accessible to any compunctious visit-ings, till he found this nļarriage an
                    impediment to his union with Anne Boleyn. He then exerted all his influence with
                    the pope to procure a sentence, declaring the nullity of a marriage contracted
                    with his brother’s widow; but although his holiness might otherwise have been
                    disposed to lend a willing ear to such a suitor, he was restrained by the
                    consideration that Catherine was the aunt of the emperor Charles the Fifth. Many
                    intrigues had been employed, and much delay had intervened, when this casual
                    discussion took place at Waltham, and when Dr Cranmer suggested the expediency
                    of “trying the question out of the word of God, and thereupon to proceed to a
                    final sentence.” He strongly urged the propriety of continuing the appeal to
                    canonists and divines, for the faculties of various universities had already
                    been solicited to deliver a' formal opinion; but it is clear that the peculiar
                    merit of his advice must be resolved into a hint, more or less direct,
                    respecting the necessity of deciding the question without the authority of the
                    pope. This controversy, originating, not in the king’s scruples of conscience,
                    but in feelings of a very different nature, contributed in no small degree to
                    the elevation of Cranmer, and to the downfall of the church. When Fox, who was
                    then the royal almoner, communicated this plan of effecting a divorce, Henry
                    “swore by the Mother of God, that man hath the right sow by the ear.” His
                    attendance at court was immediately required; and at their first interview, the
                    king enjoined him to lay aside all other avocations, and to bend his faculties
                    to the furtherance of this important <hi rend="italic">device.</hi> In the mean
                    time he commended him to the hospitality of the earl of Wiltshire, father to
                    Anne Boleyn. It is evident that Dr Lingard has very erroneously described him as
                    “a dependant on the family of the king’s mistress ;” for this appears to have
                    been the true origin of his connexion with the family, and his real dependence
                    was first on the hopes, and afterwardson the gratitude, of the king himself.
                    Henry appointed him archdeacon of Taunton, and one of his chaplains; he likewise
                    bestowed upon him some parochial benefice, of which the name is not
                    ascertained.</p>
                <p>Unwilling to hazard an open rupture with the visible head of the church, the king
                    again had recourse to negotiation, and Cranmer was conjoined in a mission to the
                    court of Rome, where he saw “many things contrary to God’s honour.” During the
                    following year, 1531, he was commissioned as sole ambassador to the emperor. He
                    resided for several months in Germany; and there, about the beginning of the
                    year 1532, he married Annc, a niece of the wife of Osiander, an eminent pastor
                    of Nürnberg. At the period of his first marriage he was a layman; but as he was
                    now in priest’s orders, he plainly disregarded the authority of the church. His
                    residence in this country is, with great probability, supposed to have had the
                    effect of bringing him much nearer to the sentiments of the Protestants: here be
                    must have enjoyed many opportunities of becoming acquainted with their views and
                    feelings; nor could his soundness of understanding and honesty of purpose be
                    unprofitably exercised, in a situation so well calculated to second the impulse
                    which his mind had already received. From the gross error of the real presence
                    he only extricated himself by slow degrees. The human understanding had for many
                    centuries been so stultified by this portentous doctrine, that it seemed
                    incapable of regaining a sound and healthful state; and, in this article of
                    belief, the progress of Luther and his followers was only from one absurdity to
                    another; by rejecting <hi rend="italic">transubstantiation,</hi> and adopting
                    <hi rend="italic">consuhstaìitiation,</hi> they introduced a change of
                    scholastic and unscriptural terms, leaving their ideas involved in the ancient
                    maze of Popish errors.</p>
                <p>Archbishop Warham, the patron of Erasmus, died in the month of August 1532, arid
                    Dr Cranmer was immediately recalled from Germany to fill the vacant see of
                    Canterbury. This sudden and high preferment he is said to have accepted with no
                    small reluctance; and one of the difficulties which presented themselves, is
                    supposed to have been connected with the peculiarity of his situation as a
                    married priest. During the preceding reign, it had been decided by the courts of
                    law that the marriage of a priest was voidable, but not void; and consequently
                    that his issue, born in wedlock, was entitled to inherit. But such a marriage
                    was not reconcilable with the principles of the canon law, and much was to be
                    apprchended from the capricious ferocity of the king. His wife was never
                    publicly acknowledged; and, after the promulgation of the six articles in 1539,
                    he found it expedient to send her to her native country. When he was afterwards
                    charged with having thus entered into the state of matrimony, he admitted the
                    fact, but at the same time affirmed “that it was better for him to have his own,
                    than do like other priests, holding and keeping other men’s wives.” Before he
                    took the oath of episcopal obedience to the pope, he adopted the expedient of
                    making a formal protest, that he only took it in such a sense as was consistent
                    with the laws of God, with the rights of the king and his realm, and with the
                    liberty of declaring his own sentiments in matters of religion, even when they
                    might be in opposition to the authority of the pope himself. How far this
                    protest was privately-interposed or publicly divulged, has been much and eagerly
                    disputed between Protestants and Catholics, but it appears to be a question of
                    very little importance. While we are ready to admit that his latest biographer
                    has refuted various allegations of the Popish historians, we still retain a
                    strong conviction that the character of Cranmer is not materially benefited by
                    his zealous defence. To entitle the archbishop elect to receive the bulls from
                    the pope, it was necessary for him to take a prescribed oath: the authority
                    which imposed this oath manifestly left no room for private interpretation; nor
                    can we regard such an expedient in any other light than that of a mere
                    subterfuge. “It was,” says Mr Todd, “the pleasure of his sovereign, but his own
                    aversion, we have seen, that these forms should yet be followed. But instead of
                    engaging himself to the oath, he declared to the king, that without the liberty
                    of opposing it he would decline the honour that was proffered. Of this conduct
                    he never afterwards repented.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Todd’s Life of Archbishop Cranmer, vol. i. p. G8. Lond.
                    1831, 2 vols. 8vo.</p></note> ∙ But is not this a most lame and impotent
                    conclusion? When swearing is not a mere act of profanity, it is in its very
                    essence the act of a man engaging himself by his oath; and if Cranmer thus
                    reserved to himself the liberty of <hi rend="italic">opposing</hi> an oath,
                    which he yet consented to take, he was openly-swearing to perform what he
                    secretly considered as unlawful. What his biographer subjoins is not more
                    satisfactory. “Thus much for the notoriety of the protest. It has been wished
                    that he had taken the papal oath, as his predecessor Warham had taken it,
                    without reserve or explanation, and then proceeded quietly in opposition to the
                    pontiff, as that prelate is believed to have done by submitting, not long
                    before, to the rcgal supremacy, and thus <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753070"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3070-0446"/>advancing a decisive step towards a reformation.
                    The clamour against Cranmer, as to disingenuousness, might then, it has been
                    thought, have been comparatively little, or none. But Cranmer was sincere, and
                    Warham the reverse.” Casuists may suggest divers expedients and salvos, but an
                    honest man has only one method of taking an oath.</p>
                <p>That Cranmer’s elevation is chiefly to be referred to the aptitude which he had
                    discovered for promoting the dissolution of the royal marriage, is a faet which
                    cannot well be doubted. Soon after his consecration he addressed to the king a
                    letter, in which he zealously urged the necessity of bringing this important
                    question to a determination; and as the pious monarch had already been declared
                    the head of the church of England, he had no hesitation in returning an answer,
                    which, says the biographer, “was in perfect accordance with the primate’s
                    suggestion; in which he forgot not to maintain <hi rend="italic">the supremacy
                    he had lately recovered^'</hi> Of the origin and progress of the anomalous, and,
                    we will venture to add, very absurd maxim, that the king is the head of the
                    church, this may be considered as rather a curious account; for in what sense
                    could Henry the Eighth be said to recover a right or prerogative which had never
                    been possessed by him or any of his predecessors?<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Martin, when counsel against the
                    archbishop, reduced him to the necessity of admitting that, according to his
                    principles, Nero was the head of the Christian church at Rome, and the Turk at
                    Constantinople. “Then,” rejoined the civilian, <hi rend="superscript"> tç</hi>
                    he that beheaded the heads of the church, and crucified the apostles, was head
                    of Christ’s church; and he that was never member of the church, is head of the
                    church, by your new-found understanding of God’s word.”</p></note> The queen of
                    England was cited to appear before the archbishop at Dunstable, within a few
                    miles of Ampthill, the place of her residence; and on the 8th of May 1533, he
                    opened his new court, assisted by the bishop of Lineoln as his assessor.
                    Catherine having failed to make her appearance before this irregular tribunal,
                    was, after the expiration of fifteen days, declared contumacious; and the
                    marriage was adjudged to be null and void from the beginning, as having been
                    contracted in defiance of the divine prohibition. In the month of January,
                    F1enry had privately married Anne Boleyn, after having cohabited with her for
                    several years; but it seems to have been asserted without foundation that
                    Cranmer was present at their scandalous nuptials. It is well known that she did
                    not long retain the king’s affections. Ardent love, in so ferocious a breast,
                    was easily converted into deadly hatred; and Anne, when supplanted by a new
                    favourite, was accused of various acts of infidelity, of which it is not certain
                    that she was guilty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    required to exercise his divorcing faculty. “The trial and condemnation of the
                    queen,” says Mr Todd, “almost immediately followed. Not content with this
                    result, the king resolved on further vengeance; and after two days more, the
                    afflicted archbishop <hi rend="italic">was obliged</hi> judicially to declare
                    her marriage invalid, and her offspring illegitimate.” But how was the

                    admitted to have been wrong? The reader must bear in mind that this sentence
                    could have no reference to the queen’s alleged adultery; for, according to the
                    canon law, marriage, which is one of the seven sacraments, cannot be dissolved
                    by any course of judicial procedure; and we may here remark, in passing, that
                    although the modern law of England does not professedly adhere to this notion of
                    a sacrament, it is not completely disentangled from the ancient superstition:
                    the ecclesiastical courts may declare a marriage to have been invalid from the
                    beginning, but they cannot dissolve the sacred bond of matrimony. Cranmer was
                    now <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to declare invalid from the beginning a
                    marriage, which he had formerly pronounced good and valid; and there is too much
                    justice in the remark of Dr Lingard, “never perhaps was there a more solemn
                    mockery of the forms of justice, than in the pretended trial of this
                    extraordinary cause.” Nor is this the last case of divorce to be mentioned.
                    After the death of Jane Seymour, the king married Anne of Cleves; and as he did
                    not find her person agreeable to his taste, he again had recourse to the agency
                    of the dutiful archbishop, and the sentence of invalidity was confirmed by the
                    seal of Cranmer. The next consort of this atrocious tyrant, whom Cranmer has
                    described as “a most godly prince of famous memory,” was Catharine Howard, who
                    was beheaded without being divorced.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    civilian has laboriously discussed the question, “Utrum quis mulierem pro

                    reasons: “quoniam error circa virginitatem continet errorem circa substantiam,
                    cum personae, tum matrimonii.”</p></note></p>
                <p>In these transactions, the archbishop of Canterbury appears to little advantage;
                    nor is it easy to believe that he did not act against the clearest conviction of
                    his own conscience. All or most that can be urged in palliation of his conduct
                    is, that he had fallen on evil days, and that to resist the commands of such a
                    master was certain death. In other respects, he was too much tainted with the
                    errors of the time; but, if he was not exempted from the spirit of persecution,
                    he was subject to an error which, however hideous it may appear to us, extended
                    to nearly all his contemporaries. The execution of Servetus for his theological
                    opinions was formally approved by Melanchthon,<note anchored="true"

                    one of the mildest of the early reformers. Soon after his elevation to the
                    primacy, Cranmer acted as one of the inquisitors who condemned John Frith for
                    denying the doctrine of transubstantiation. “His said opinion is of such
                    nature,” he states in a private letter, “that he thought it not necessary to be
                    believed as an article of our faith, that there is the very corporal presence of
                    Christ within the host and saerament of the altar, and holdeth of this point
                    most after the opinion of Oeeolampadius. And surely I myself sent for him iij.
                    or iiij. times to persuade him tojeave that his imagination; but for all that we
                    could &lt;l&lt;&gt;therein, he would not apply to any counsel, not-withstaħdíng
                    now he is at a final end with all examinatioris; for my Lord of London hath
                    given sentence, and delivered him to the secular powers, where he looketh every
                    day to go unto the fire. And there is also condemned with him one Andrew, a
                    tailor of London, for the said self-same opinion. And thus fare you well. From
                    my manor of Croydon.” Is not this a cool contemplation of such an inhuman act as
                    the burning of his fellow-creatures? It was Andrew Hewet who, honouring Frith,
                    and adhering to his doctrines, was thus condemned to the same cruel death; and,
                    after the lapse of a few years, Cranmer, following the dictates of common sense,
                    adopted the very opinion for which his brethren had been doomed “to go unto the
                    fire.” These holy butcheries were followed by many others. The persecutions
                    which commenced in the reign of the unrelenting father, were not discontinued in
                    that of the milder son; but the case of Joan Bocher, commonly called Joan <pb

                    a more particular notice. The charge against her was to this effect: “That you
                    believe that the Word was made flesh in the Virgin’s belly; but that Christ took
                    flesh of the Virgin you believe not, because the flesh of the Virgin being the
                    outward man, was sinfully gotten and born in sin; but the Word, by the consent
                    of the inward man of the Virgin, was made flesh.”<note anchored="true"

                    Archbishop of Canterbury, p. 181. Lond. 1G94, fol.</p></note> For persisting in
                    her refusal to recant this unhappy jargon, the poor creature was committed to
                    the flames. When Cranmer excommunicated her as a heretic, and, in the true
                    inquisitorial style, ordered her to be delivered to the secular arm, she
                    exclaimed, “It was not long ago that you burned Anne Askew for a piece of bread,
                    and yet came yourself soon after to believe and profess the same doctrine for
                    which you burned her.” The young king was extremely reluctant to imbrue his
                    hands in the blood of such a victim, and a year elapsed before she was ordered
                    for execution. It is plainly stated by the martyrologist that his scruples were
                    at length overcome, or his resolution shaken, by the urgency of the archbishop.
                    About the same period, George Van Paris, a Dutch surgeon residing in London, was
                    burnt for denying the divinity of Christ; nor does it appear that, in any of the
                    various cases which have been recorded, the archbishop felt, or professed to
                    feel, the slightest doubt or misgiving as to the perfect propriety of committing
                    such atrocious murders under the sanction of law and religion.</p>
                <p>Another unequivocal proof of his having deeply imbibed the spirit of persecution,
                    is to be found in the book entitled <hi rend="italic">Reformatio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Legum Ecclesiasticarum.</hi> The plan of this book had originated
                    in the reign of Henry; and in that of his son, Cranmer was placed at the head of
                    eight commissioners, who were enjoined to prepare it for the inspection of a
                    much larger committee, and afterwards for that of the privy council. It is
                    supposed to have been translated into Latin by Sir John Cheke, the king’s
                    preceptor, and by Dr Haddon, master of Trinity Hall at Cambridge, both of whom
                    were eminent for their classical learning, but the latter was a greater master
                    of Latinity. It is not to be regretted that this code of ecclesiastical law
                    never obtained any public sanction. Much of the re^nųpsibility evidently belongs
                    to Cranmer; and his biograpb^ţţàs¾ures us that an abler canonist was not easily
                    to be'iς⅛⅛jσ*within the realm. The title respecting the mode of proceeding in
                    cases of heresy, contains a chapter on obstinate heretics, which adjudges them,
                    after all other remedies have been attempted, to be delivered over to the civil
                    magistrate in order to be punished. “Consumptis .omnibus aliis remediis, ad

                    of such phraseology it would not be difficult to add ninety-seven more; and the
                    direful import of such expressions in the mouth of a canonist, can only be
                    doubtful to those who are unacquainted with the history of the inquisition. In
                    point of form, the hands of churchmen must not be stained with blood; but the
                    sentence of the ecclesiastical judge, when it awards a cruel and ignominious
                    death, or any inferior degree of corporal punishment, must be inflicted under
                    the sanction of the civil power. Mr Hallam has remarked, that “infamy and civil
                    disability seem to be the only punishments intended to be kept up, except in
                    case of the denial of the Christian religion; for if a heretic were, as a matter
                    of course, to be burned, it seems needless to provide, as in this chapter, that
                    he should be incapable of being a witness, or of making a will.” But the Spanish
                    inquisition did not punish with fire and fagot every offence against the
                    Catholic faith; and when, in a subsequent chapter, Cranmer and his associates
                    contemplate the possibility of a heretic avoiding extreme punishment, they <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> do not necessarily disown the fellowship of their
                    brother inquisitors. It is scarcely to be considered as a sufficient vindication
                    of the archbishop, that in a manuscript copy of the work, formerly in his
                    possession, the punishment of perpetual banishment or perpetual imprisonment is
                    specifically mentioned. This correction is not in the hand-writing of Cranmer,
                    but is supposed to be in that of Martyr;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Todd’s Life of Archbishop Cranmer, vol. il. p.

                    capital punishment is completely set at rest. Of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reformatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Legum Ecclesiasticarum,</hi> the first edition
                    was published by John Fox, in the year 1571, from a copy which had been
                    transcribed by the archbishop’s secretary, and corrected by himself as well as
                    by Martyr. It is not therefore difficult to perceive where we must expect to
                    find the text as it was finally adjusted. This bloody text seems to admit of
                    another mode of illustration equally legitimate. The practice of the archbishop
                    was in perfect conformity with the principles which we have here explained. In
                    the reign of Henry, he was accessory to the death of several individuals who
                    denied the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation; and in the reign of Edward,
                    he was accessory to the death of others who denied articles of the creed to
                    which he then adhered. What meaning he himself attached to the expression of
                    delivering a heretic to the civil magistrate, we have already ascertained in the
                    case of Frith; in reference to whom he states, “my Lord of London hath given
                    sentence, and delivered him to the secular powers, where he looketh every day
                    <hi rend="italic">to go unto the fireľ</hi></p>
                <p>Such errors as these are too glaring to be easily concealed; but it is equally
                    certain that his character was adorned by many private virtues, and that the
                    great body of his countrymen cannot fail to regard him in the light of a public
                    benefactor. Under his influence, books of religious instruction were circulated
                    among the people,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of the
                    book which passes under the name of Cranmer’s Catechism, an edition, begun by

                    himself translate this catechism, but, as Wharton states, he “added a large
                    discourse of his own to the exposition of the second commandment, and inserted
                    some few sentences elsewhere.”</p></note> and, what was of inestimable benefit,
                    the Bible was opened to every man capable of reading his mother tongue. It was
                    in a great measure owing to his exertions that the reformation of the church of
                    England was nearly advanced to that point where it still rests. That this
                    reformation should then have been left so incomplete, is less surprising<pb

                    hundred and fifty years.</p>
                <p>By the testament of King Henry, who died in the month of January 1647, the
                    archbishop was placed at the head of a regency, consisting of sixteen
                    individuals, of whom the greater part were favourably disposed to the reformed
                    doctrines. Edward, who was of a tender age, was anxious to promote the same
                    cause; and the seeds which had been sown during the late reign, now became much
                    more vigorous in their growth. The chief instrument of the reformation was
                    undoubtedly Cranmer, who promoted it by his talents and learning, as well as by
                    the influence necessarily connected with his high station. He was one of the
                    compilers of the service-book, and the author of at least three of the homilies,
                    those on salvation, faith, and good works. He was likewise the sole or principal
                    author of the first Articles of Religion, forty-two in number, which were
                    slightly altered in the reign of Elizabeth, and reduced to the number of
                    thirty-nine.</p>
                <p>Edward died at a premature age in the year 1553, after having, at the instigation
                    of the duke of Northumberland, nominated as his successor Lady Jane Grey, who
                    had married the duke’s fourth son, and who was the daughter of the duke of
                    Suffolk, and grand-daughter of Mary, sister to Henry VIII. The king’s two
                    sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, were superseded on the ground of their illegitimate
                    birth. To this scheme the archbishop acceded with no small reluctance. Jane was
                    proclaimed queen, but, after a reign of a few days, was committed to the Tower,
                    and soon died by the hand of the executioner. On the accession of Queen Mary,
                    many of the Protestants were subjected to the extreme tortures which they had
                    felt too little compunction in applying to others. Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer,
                    were first committed to the Tower, and were afterwards removed to Oxford, where
                    they were confined in the common prison called Bocardo, and were at length
                    condemned as obstinate heretics. A long interval elapsed before their execution.
                    Ridley, who had been bishop of London, and Latimer of Worcester, suffered with
                    that noble resolution which became martyrs of the truth, but the mind of Cranmer
                    recoiled under so great a trial of human fortitude; the vain and delusive hope
                    of life impelling him to deny his faith, and to sign no fewer than six
                    recantations. The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel: his offences were not
                    to be pardoned by such a sovereign under the influence of such counsellors; and
                    on the 21st of May 1556, this learned, venerable, and aged man was committed to
                    the flames. Rejecting his unfortunate recantations, he died in the pious
                    profession of the Protestant faith, and suffered the cruel torture of the fire
                    with an undaunted resolution, which his recent conduct had not encouraged his
                    friends to expect. It is not for us, who are placed beyond the reach of such
                    fiery trials, to condemn the weakness for which he made this atonement.</p>
                <p>In the history of Cranmer’s persecution, we find no mention of his wife, or any
                    of his near relations. He however left a widow and two children, Thomas and
                    Margaret. Another daughter, named Anne, had died before him. The surviving
                    children were restored in blood by an act of parliament, passed in the year
                    1563, but it does not appear that they were reinstated in their property. It is
                    asserted by Ames, who however quotes no authority, that the widow married Edward
                    Whitchurch, an eminent printer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    husband. The archbishop’s younger brother, Edmund Cranrner, was archdeacon of
                    Canterbury, but in the reign of Mary was deprived of his preferment, on the
                    ground of his being a married priest. His elder brother John was still in
                    possession of the hereditary manors of Aslacton and Whatton; and four sisters,
                    all married to persons of distinction, likewise survived to bewail the cruel
                    doom of their illustrious kinsman.</p>
                <p>His principal works relate to the portentous doctrine of transubstantiation. The
                    first is entitled “A Defence of the trve and catholike Doctrine of the Sacrament
                    of the Body and Bloud of our Sauiour Christ, with a Confutation of sundry Errors
                    concernyng thesame, grounded and sta-blished vpon Godes holy woorde, and

                    Latin version appeared soon after the death of the author. It bears the title

                <p>Cranmer was a person of a vigorous understanding, improved by extensive learning.
                    His travels and studies had rendered him as familiar with the French, Italian,
                    and German, as with the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages. In theology and the
                    canon law he appears to have been deeply skilled; and, possessing an acute
                    intellect and a clear head, he was capable of applying his various stores of
                    knowledge to the most useful and practical purposes. His works afford a very
                    favourable specimen of the English style of that period; and we are glad to be
                    informed that a complete edition is speedily to issue from the university press
                    of Oxford. With his intellectual endowments he united many of the amiable
                    virtues of private life: his natural disposition was mild and conciliating, and
                    he was distinguished by the engaging affability of his manners. He was however
                    capable of being roused to fierce indignation; for we learn from unquestionable
                    authority, that, on a certain occasion, he offered single combat to the duke of
                    Northumberland. He was a zealous encourager of learning, and eminently practised
                    the virtues of charity and hospitality. But his character, as we have already
                    seen, was not without glaring defects. His compliances with the unhallowed
                    wishes of the king, are partly to be ascribed to his want of that invincible
                    firmness which could alone have sustained him under the frowns of so unrelenting
                    a tyrant; and much influence must doubtless be ascribed to the prevailing notion
                    of the time, that the will of a sovereign prince is not to be resisted by any of
                    his subjects. Compliance in almost every possible case seems to have been
                    regarded as an act of duty; nor is it easy, on any other hypothesis, to account
                    for the long and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753109"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3109-0449"/>abject submission of the English nobility and
                    gentry to the tyranny and caprice of the house of Tudor. Although this
                    consideration does not increase our respect for the archbishop’s character, it
                    is nevertheless obvious that the pliancy of his disposition, by enabling him to
                    retain the favour of the king, enabled him to become a more powerful instrument
                    in promoting the cause of learning and religion. For his deep participation in
                    the bloody persecutions of two successive reigns, we must likewise endeavour to
                    find some apology in the current maxims of the age to which he belonged. FIis
                    own nature was far from being ungentle; but his intellect was bewildered by the
                    doctrines, and his heart hardened by the practices, of the church in which he
                    had been educated. (x.)</p>
