                    family that he was appointed professor of the civil law in the university of
                    Edinburgh. In 1698 the Scotish parliament voted a salary of one hundred and
                    fifty pounds sterling to Alexander Cunningham, as professor of the civil law,
                    “nominat and designed to that profession.” The act was to continue in force
                    during the period of five years; and the same provision in his favour was, for
                    the same period, renewed in 1704.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    “for encouraging a design of illustrating the civill law,” had been remitted to
                    the committee for the security of the kingdom. Vol. x. p∙ 145—About this period,
                    several advocates began to read private lectures on the civil law. One of these
                    was Alexander Drummond, who in the year 1699 inserted the following
                    advertisement in an Edinburgh newspaper: “These are to give advertisement to all
                    persons who are desirous to be instructed in the knowledge of the Institutions
                    and Pandects of the Civil Law, and the laws of this kingdom, or either of the
                    two, or both, that Mr Alexander Drummond of East-field, Advocate, does profess
                    to teach the same; and by reason of a singular method he uses in teaching of the
                    civil law, he undertakes to perfite and accomplish any of a middle capacity,
                    more in a years time, then others have been by being abroad and out of the
                    country 3 years. How profitable and advantagious this may tend to the kingdom in
                    general, be leaves it to every one to judge. He is to be spoke with at his
                    lodging in the foot of Blackfrier Wind.” Another private lecturer on the civil
                    and municipal laws was John Spottiswoode; and their example was followed by John
                    Cunningham, who published his inaugural lecture under the title of “Joannis

                    appeared about the same period with “A Discourse by Mr John Cunninghame,

                    patrons of the university, have always entertained the greatest jealousy of any
                    interference on the part of the crown; and as Cunningham must have held a royal
                    professorship, they would studiously decline to recognize his appointment. The
                    payment of his salary must have ceased at the expiration of the second term of
                    five years, that is, in 1709; and it was in the course of the ensuing year that
                    the magistrates established another chair; nor is it superfluous to mention that
                    this new foundation took place after the death of the duke of Queensberry, who
                    had acted as her majesty’s commissioner at the important crisis of the
                    union.</p>
                <p>So early as the year 1590, the judges, the magistrates, and the advocates and
                    clerks to the signet, had raised a fund of L.3000 for the endowment of a
                    professorship of law in the university of Edinburgh; each of these three parties
                    contributing an equal portion. Adam Newton, an advocate, was first appointed to
                    the office; but having neglected to obtain the approbation of the magistrates,
                    he was dismissed in the year 1594. He afterwards procured better employment, and
                    successively became tutor and secretary to Prince Henry.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Adam Newton was the son of a baker in
                    Edinburgh. Though a layman, he held the deanery of Durham from 1606 to 1620,
                    when he resigned it; and during the latter year he was created a baronet. He
                    translated into Latin King James’s treatise against Vorstius, and the first six
                    books of Paolo Sarpi’s history of the council of Trent. The last two books were
                    translated by Dr Bedell. (Birch’s Life of Prince Henry, p. 14. 218. Lond. 1760,

                    Bisterveld, who was born in the neighbourhood of Ghent, and there was for some
                    time employed in teaching the classics:<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of Buchan, but she left no issue. (Wood’s Peerage, vol. i. p. 268.) The literary
                    historians of Flanders mention some of his poems as having been printed on the
                    continent; and after his settlement in Scotland, he published the following

                    printed by Waldegrave. The first of them contains one Greek and six Latin poems,

                    his resignation, the interest of one third of the sum formerly contributed was
                    allotted for a professor of humanity, and the interest of the remainder for the
                    maintenance of six exhibitioners. Newton and Damman had both taught humanity,
                    without reading any public lectures on law.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the following passage: “Cuningamius ubi haereat, postquam ex hac urbe discessit,
                    nullo labore potui inquirere, nisi quod populares quidam ejus dicant Germanicum
                    iter ab eo susceptum, non alicubi fixisse mansionem: unde tuas ad eum literas

                    p. 168. Florent. 1745, 2 tom. 8vo.) As we have other evidence of the civilian’s
                    acquaintance with Gronovius, we suppose him to be the individual here
                    mentioned.</p></note> He had equally devoted his attention to the studies of
                    philology and the civil law, which at that period were not very vigorously
                    cultivated in his native country; and he at length fixed his residence in
                    Holland, where those studies were prosecuted with uncommon ardour and success. A
                    late writer has erroneously described him as an advocate: in the records of the
                    faculty for that period, we find no advocate of the same name. He now settled at
                    the Hague, where he appears to have resided during the remainder of his life;
                    but we can discover no evidence of his having there taught “both the civil and
                    canon laws.” He apparently lived in Holland as a private gentleman, supported<pb

                    his estate, and probably by an annuity from the noble family with which he had
                    been connected. From a notice which occurs in a work of Best, published in the
                    year 1707, it may perhaps be inferred that he was then residing in that
                    country;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Sed et

                <p>His edition of Horace made its appearance in the year 1721, but long before that
                    period he enjoyed a very high reputation as a classical scholar. His notes are
                    brief, and relate to the various readings; but he announced his intention of
                    preparing another edition, illustrated with more copious annotations; and at the
                    same time he published a separate volume, consisting of animadversions on the
                    notes and emendations of Bentley, whose edition of Horace had been printed ten
                    years before. To this volume, which displays much learning and sagacity, and
                    evinces the author to have studied the art of criticism with uncommon assiduity
                    and success, he has prefixed an address to Dr Bentley, whom he everywhere treats
                    with much freedom, and even severity. Bentley was a man of great vigour of
                    intellect, and of erudition not less accurate than extensive: of the Greek
                    language he possessed a masterly knowledge; and he had studied the ancient
                    metres with a degree of nicety unknown to former critics. His principal defect
                    seems to have been a want of taste; for when he quits the mechanism and analogy
                    of language, and the mere structure of verse, he cannot be regarded as a very
                    safe guide in subjects of polite literature. His conjectural emendations,
                    particularly of the Greek poets, often display singular felicity; but on some
                    occasions they are chiefly remarkable for their audacity. Many of his rash
                    conjectures on Horace are very successfully exposed by Cunningham. One of the
                    emendations on which he seems to congratulate himself with most complacency, is
                    the substitution of <hi rend="italic">ter</hi><hi rend="italic">natos</hi> in
                    the subsequent verse of the Art of Poetry:</p>
                <p>Et male <hi rend="italic">tornαlos</hi> incudi reddere versus.</p>
                <p>A reading more repugnant to every principle of taste could not easily have been
                    devised; and yet his learned correspondent Graevius speaks of it in the
                    following terms; “Eam qui videt et non probat, is in his litteris caecior est
                    quavis talpa. Quid enim torno cum incude ?”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Bentleii Epistolae, p. 137∙ Lond. 1807, 4to.</p></note>
                    Bentley professes to be offended with the incongruity of Horace’s metaphor, and
                    he asks the same question with Graevius; but he perceives no incongruity in an
                    animal being produced at three births, and being moreover hammered upon an
                    anvil. Cunningham, who was fully aware of this absurdity, has unnecessarily
                    adopted the reading <hi rend="italic">formatos,</hi> which appears somewhat
                    flat. There is in reality no occasion for any change: when an artist has turned
                    a piece of iron without being able to give it the shape or polish which he
                    intended, he very naturally brings it back to the anvil, and a second time
                    prepares it for the lathe. The ∣ metaphor therefore which occurs in this
                    passage, is at once consistent and expressive. The vanity and arrogance ' with
                    which Bentley exercised his critical functions,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the Bibliotheca Critica, vol. iii. part.
                    ii. p. 123.</p></note> are likewise exposed by this formidable antagonist.
                    Cunning, ham appears to have been the friend of Le Clerc, and on that account he
                    may have pointed his animadversions with more keenness.</p>
                <p>Cunningham’s animadversions excited no ordinary degree of attention, and he was
                    acknowledged to be the most able of Bentley’s critical antagonists. Jani, a
                    recent editor of the odes of Horace, speaks of him in the following terms:
                    “Omnium doctissime in hoc castigando versatus est Alexander Cuningamius, vir
                    summus et doctissimus, unus omnium qui in Horatium scripserunt criticoum
                    princeps, ipsique Bentleio, si quid intelligo, anteferendus.... Emendationes
                    autem ejus fatendum est omnium doctissi-mas esse ac ingeniosissimas, saepe, si

                    worth five times as much. With respect to his papers, we find some information
                    in a letter from Sir John Pringle to Forbes of Culloden.</p>
                <p>“I wrott to Mr Logan of Dunbar, as I told you I would do, both in your name and
                    mine, about his uncle Mr Cunningham’s papers, and I have since had an evening’s
                    conversation with him; the sum of which was, that his uncle has not left one
                    single scrape of any thing ready for the press, or even in any tolerable order.
                    His notes on Horace are written on the margin of six volumes, whereof three are
                    the text of Horace as he published it, and the other three are his
                    animadversions on Bentley. The use of these I am promised again next week: the
                    Lord have mercy on the patients till I have done with them I His notes on
                    Phaedrus are likewise only on the margins of two editions ofPhaedrus; but he
                    thinks them fuller than the others, and is talking of giving them to Mr
                    Ruddiman, if he will be at pains to putt them in order and publish them. He has
                    marginal notes upon several other authors, as Virgil, Statius, Quintillian,
                    Cicero; any of which he offers to send me after I have done with Horace. His
                    notes on the Corpus are larger than any of the rest, and not writt on the
                    margin, as the rest. His copy of the Corpus is interleaved with clean paper; so
                    that there is a leaf of written notes for every printed leaf. He told me the
                    Advocats Library has applied to him to have it, but he has given the curators no
                    answer as yet, nor did he seem determined when he spoke to me.—What will
                    surprise you most is, that he has left nothing of his scheme of the Christian
                    religion. Mr Logan told me he had inquired at him about it when he was in his
                    perfect senses, but that he declared to him that he had never putt it in
                    writing, and that he would dictate it to him any day, for he had it all in his
                    head, and that it could be contain’d in four or five sheets of paper; however,
                    every day that Logan pressed him to do it, he found always some reason for
                    shifting it, till he was incapable of doing any thing.” This letter is dated at
                    Edinburgh on the 13th of January 1731; and on the 2d of February, he writes
                    thus: “I have gott two C volumes of Horace, with Cunningham’s marginal notes;
                    but the hand is so bad, and the lines so closs on one ano- " ther, that I have
                    difficulty to make sense of them, tho’ I perceive no <hi rend="italic"

                    letter from T. Burnet to Locke, dated at London on the 17th of March 1699. “I
                    thought once of sending this packet with Mr Cunningham, who told me at my
                    chambers some days ago he was to go out to you; but now, after waiting longer
                    than his set time, I was resolved to delay no longer. I wish you would indulge
                    him, before he leaves you, to piece together his proofs of the Christian
                    religion, that the world may enjoy that light he hath so long promised.”<note

                    was not inferior to his reputation as a scholar. About the year 1700, Professor
                    Wodrow played at chess “with Mr Alexander Cunningham of Bloak, his old
                    acquaintance. Mr Cunningham, after playing a game with him, said he thought he
                    was able to give him a rook and a bishop of advantage, and his very outmost was
                    queen, but he doubted that would be too much, which was a high commendation from

                    were different individuals. The father of the historian was Alexander
                    Cunningham, minister of Ettrick, in Selkirkshire, and the owner of a small
                    estate, named Hyndhope, and situated in the same county. The elder son, James,
                    inherited this property, and left descendants. Alexander was educated at Selkirk
                    school, and was originally destined for the church. Aeeording to one account, he
                    prosecuted his aca-demical studies in Holland: this account, which is
                    sufficiently probable in itself, is contained in a communication from the late
                    earl of Buchan to Dr Thomson. From a manuscript notice written by a descendant
                    of his elder brother, we learn that, in the capacity of a travelling tutor, “he
                    was employed both in the Argyle and Newcastle families that he afterwards
                    studied the law of England, and was in great repute as a chamber-counsel, but
                    never pleaded at the bar. He visited his brother at Hyndhope when Murray of
                    Philiphaugh was sheriff of the county, but did not long remain in Scotland.<note

                    travelling tutor to Lord Lome, was previously known from other sources of
                    information. It was stated by the late earl of Hyndford that Cunningham
                    travelled with his uncle and his father, James, afterwards earl of Hyndford, and
                    the Hon. William Car-michael, afterwards solicitor-general for Scotland; that
                    they passed two winters at Utreeht and Franeker, between the years 1692 and
                    1695, and subsequently travelled together for some time. “I have heard,” says
                    his lordship, “that the same Alexander Cunningham was afterwards tutor to an
                    English nobleman, whose name is unknown to me.” If we may rely on the notice
                    already quoted, this young nobleman must have been connected with the Newcastle

                    October 1697, contains the subsequent gleanings of information. “My Lord Argyle
                    has not yet written any thing concerning his son: he was gone from this place to
                    his regiment before I came here, which I was glad of, for I know his 1. colonel
                    will take care of him....As for the project, I know you will not only use all
                    your credit with Secretary Ogilvy, but will also recommend the thing to all the
                    Scots nobility^ and gentry you shall meet with at London. I have bought in this
                    country a considerable number of books, in order to the carrying of it on; and,
                    so soon as I am free of my L∙ Lome, I resolve to set seriously about it.”<note

                    seventeen years of age, was now colonel of a regiment in Flanders. In the course
                    of the following year, Dr Lister found Cunningham at Paris, and he makes an
                    allusion to his having recently visited Rome. “I had a visit,” he remarks, “from
                    Mr Cunningham, tutor to my Lord Lome, a very learned and curious man in books. I
                    askt him (knowing him to have been lately at Rome) very particularly about the
                    papers of Monsieur d’Azout. He told me that he saw him not half a year before he
                    died, and was very intimately acquainted with him, and saw him for a twelvemonth
                    very often. That he told him that he had about 80 difficult passages in
                    Vitruvius, which he had commented and explained; and the correction of a great
                    number of errata in the text. Also that upon Julius Frontinus (though that was a
                    much less task) he had much more to say than he had upon Vitruvius.”<note

                    Cunningham’s history, Dr Thomson had inferred that the author must have
                    accompanied Lord Lome to Rome; but from the context he was led to suppose that
                    this occurrence must have taken place about the close of 1699 or the beginning
                    of 1700.</p>
                <p>In the year 1701, Cunningham was employed in a new capacity. He was sent to
                    France by the king’s authority: the ostensible object of his mission was to
                    conduct a negociation respecting the trade between Scotland and France, but he
                    is supposed to have supplied the king with important information of another
                    kind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cunningham’s Hist,

                    likewise Dr Thomson’s Introduction, p. xiii.</p></note> During the reign of
                    George I. he was appointed minister to the state of Venice, and he retained his
                    functions from 1715 to 1720. How long he survived, we have not hitherto been
                    able to ascertain, but the earl of Hyndford is known to have visited him in
                    London in the year 1735. He was married, and had four sons and a daughter. His
                    eldest son, Robert, a barrister, died unmarried. Thomas married, and had a son
                    and a daughter. Robert died in 1748, and Thomas in 1749: their uncle, James
                    Cunningham of Hyndhope, attended the funerals of both; and at that of the latter
                    he aeted as chief mourner, the only son of the deceased being then a child.
                    Alexander, the third son, was educated at Westminster school, and afterwards
                    went to Leyden, where he died. Jane, the historian’s only daughter, was married
                    to Mr Clayton, brother to the mayor of Newcastle. It is sufficiently evident
                    that the historian was a different person from Alexander Cunningham, who died on
                    the 15th of May 1737, and was buried in the chancel of St Martin’s church. By
                    his testament, registered at Doctors Commons, the latter makes a provision for
                    nephews and nicees, without any mention of his own descendants.</p>
                <p>Long after the death of Cunningham, his Latin history came into the possession of
                    Dr Hollingbery, archdeacon of Chichester, who describes the author as nearly
                    connected with his family. The original has not been published; but a spirited
                    translation, executed by William Thomson, LL. D. made its appearance, under the
                    title of “The History of Great Britain, from the Revolution in 1688 to the
                    Accession of George the First.” Lond. 1787, 2 vols. 4to. It is certainly a
                    curious circumstance that, at so barren a period of its literary annals,
                    Scotland should have produced two learned writers of the same name and
                    surname.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>About the same
                    period, there was a third scholar of the name of Alexander Cunningham, who was
                    professor of humanity in the university of Edinburgh. His testament was
                    confirmed bythe commissary court on the 26th of March 1G97∙ He is the writer of
                    a Latin poem, subjoined to a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Grammatica</hi><hi

                    facs="nls:194754409" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4409-0549"/> is likewise remarkable: both
                    of them were travelling tutors, and both lawyers; both of them were great
                    proficients in Roman literature, and both were famous for their skill at chess.
                    When we consider all these coincidences, as well as the chronological agreement,
                    it does not appear surprising that they should frequently have been supposed to
                    be one and the same individual. It is remarked by Dr Thomson, that if we duly
                    examine Cunningham’s history, “we shall find reason to pronounce it a just and
                    legitimate composition, and perhaps to rank its author in the first class of our
                    historians.” Most readers will at least be disposed to admit that he was a man
                    of learning and talents, and that he has made some important additions to the
                    common stock of materials for the history of the eventful period to which his
                    work relates. His decided attachment to the principles of the Whigs, will
                    further recommend him to those who prefer the interest of the great body of the
                    people to the interest of a particular family and particular classes. (x.)</p>
