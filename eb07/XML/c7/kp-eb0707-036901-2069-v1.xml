                <p><label type="entry">CORNWALLIS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi></label>, the
                    first Marquis, second Earl, and sixth Baron Cornwallis, was born on the 31st of
                    December 1738, of an ancient and honourable family, which had been settled
                    during many centuries in the county of Suffolk. He was educated at Eton School,
                    and afterwards entered of St John’s College, Cambridge, by the name and title of
                    Lord Brome. Having exhibited an early partiality for the military profession, he
                    entered into the army when about seventeen or eighteen years of age, and
                    attained the rank of captain in Colonel Crawford’s light infantry in 1758. Three
                    years afterwards he accompanied the Marquis of Granby to the Continent, in the
                    capacity of aide-de-camp, and with the rank of major; and, in consequence of his
                    good conduct, he was soon afterwards promoted to be lieutenant-colonel of the
                    twelfth regiment of foot. At this period he had also a seat in the House of
                    Commons, as the representative of his patrimonial borough of Eye. Upon the
                    demise of his father, who was the fifth peer of the family, in 1762, he, of
                    course, vacated his seat in the House of Commons, and became a peer of Great
                    Britain, under the title of Earl Cornwallis. In 1765 he was nominated one of the
                    lords of the bedchamber; and, about the same time, he was appointed aide-de-camp
                    to his majesty George III., which gave him the rank of colonel in the line. The
                    favours conferred on him by the court, however, had not the effect of corrupting
                    the natural integrity of his mind. He carefully distinguished between his duties
                    as a senator and as a soldier; and in his capacity of peer of parliament, he
                    displayed the independence of his character in several important questions, by
                    voting against the measures of administration. From the very beginning, he
                    showed himself inimical to those steps which led to the contest with the
                    American colonies; and was one of four peers who joined Earl Camden in opposing
                    the bill for extending the legislative power of Great Britain to our
                    Transatlantic provinces. He also protested against the proceedings of ministers
                    in the case of Mr Wilkes. In 1766 he was promoted to the command of the 33d
                    regi-mentof foot; and two .years afterwards (14th July 1768), he married Miss
                    Jemima Tulikins Jones, daughter of James Jones, Esq.</p>
                <p>But although Lord Cornwallis had uniformly and decidedly opposed those coercive
                    measures which produced the fatal contest with America, he did not hesitate to
                    repair thither, in the service of his country, when his professional exertions
                    were required. Accordingly, when his regiment was ordered for embarkation,
                    although special leave of absence had been obtained for him from the king, he
                    resolved to share the fatigues and dangers of foreign I service, and took leave
                    of his lady, who was so much affected by the separation that she sunk under the
                    weight of her grief into a premature grave.</p>
                <p>Having proceeded to his destination, his lordship took an active part in the
                    subsequent campaigns. Soon after his arrival in America, he served, with the
                    rank of majorgeneral; under Sir William Howe, and distinguished himself as an
                    able and enterprising partizan. In the month of November 1776, he landed on the
                    New Jersey shore, and finding Fort Lee evacuated, he immediately penetrated into
                    the country’, and took possession of the province. His lordship, however, soon
                    discovered that this was a contest in which the triumphs of skill, valour, and
                    discipline, were not attended with the usual consequences of victory; and that
                    the nature of the country, and the mode of warfare adopted by the provincial
                    generals, opposed many obstacles to a speedy and successful termination of
                    hostilities. At the end of the campaign he repaired to New York, with the view
                    of embarking for England, in order that he might have an opportunity of
                    explaining to the British ministry the real ∙ situation of affairs; but having
                    received information of the disasters at Trenton, he deferred his voyage, and
                    returned to the Jerseys.</p>
                <p>The first enterprise of Lord Cornwallis, in the campaign of 1777, was an attempt
                    to surprise an American post in his neighbourhood, in which he partly succeeded.
                    Soon after this, he received orders from General Howe to abandon the Jerseys;
                    and in the month of July he embarked with the English commander-in-chief on the
                    expedition to the Chesapeak. In several of the subsequent events of this
                    campaign his lordship was actively engaged. At the passage of the Brandywine
                    river he commanded a considerable body of troops; and after driving the enemy’
                    before him, he entered and took possession of Philadelphia on the 24th of
                    September 1777. From that period he seems to have had little opportunity of
                    signalizing himself, until the campaign of 1779-1780, when he embarked as
                    lieutenant-general, with Sir Henry Clinton, on the expedition to South Carolina.
                    At the siege of Charlestown, Lord Cornwallis performed eminent services, having
                    attacked and dispersed a body of militia which was hastening to the relief of
                    the place. On the surrender of the town, the command of the province of South
                    Carolina, with about 4000 troops, devolved upon him. He was opposed by General
                    Gates, who had previously distinguished himself in the actions with Burgoyne,
                    and who was now appointed to the chief command of the provincial forces in South
                    Carolina. Gates, having received intelligence of the situation of the royal
                    troops, advanced rapidly towards Cambden, with the design of making an attack on
                    the British lines. Lord Cornwallis, however, having determined not to await the
                    approach of the Americans, left his position, and marched against them with a
                    greatly inferior force. The two armies met on the 16th of August, in a narrow
                    place, where the colonial troops could not avail themselves of their superior
                    numbers. The British general, perceiving the advantage which the ground afforded
                    him, commenced the assault, and the action soon became general. The determined
                    gallantry of the British troops, who charged with the bayonet, at length
                    compelled the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752082?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2082-0370"/> enemy to give way, and they were pursued nearly
                    twenty miles from the field. Many of the colonial troops fell in this
                    engagement; 1000 men were taken prisoners; and seven pieces of cannon, together
                    with the greater part of the ammunition and stores of the provincial army,
                    remained in possession of the British. But this success, brilliant as it was,
                    produced no permanent advantage to the cause of the royalists, and was more than
                    compensated by the misfortunes which ensued. In 1781, Lord Cornwallis having
                    withdrawn, with the force under his command, into York Town, he was surrounded
                    by a numerous American army commanded by Washington; and finding all attempts to
                    repel the besiegers, or to escape through their lines, ineffectual, he was under
                    the necessity of submitting to a capitulation, by which his whole army became
                    prisoners of war.</p>
                <p>Lord Cornwallis now returned to his native country. During the political contests
                    which took place in 1782 and 1783, his lordship was deprived of his situation as
                    constable of the Tower, which, however, was restored to him in 1784. For some
                    years following, his talents were not called into exercise by any conspicuous
                    public employment. But when the affairs of India began to assume a very critical
                    aspect, he was selected as the person best qualified to fill the important
                    situation of governor-general; and he was at the same time invested with the
                    order of the garter. Soon after his arrival in India, the Company were involved
                    in a war with the formidable sovereign of the Mysore, Tippoo Sultan, son of the
                    famous Hyder Ally. The conduct of hostilities was at first intrusted to the
                    Madras government; but towards the end of the year 1790 the governor-general
                    assumed the command of the grand army, and took the field in person. As the
                    events of this war will be detailed in another part of this work, it is
                    unnecessary for us to recapitulate the narrative here. It is sufficient to
                    observe that, by a combination of vigour and prudence, the contest was brought
                    to a successful termination in the course of two campaigns. Tippoo, beaten in
                    the field, and forced to confine his efforts to the defence of his capital, was
                    at length compelled by necessity to submit to such terms as the British
                    commander chose to dictate, and to purchase peace by the sacrifice of half his
                    dominions, and a large portion of treasure. The power of the sultans of Mysore,
                    the most formidable enemies of the British government in India, was thus
                    effectually undermined, and the train laid for its subsequent annihilation.</p>
                <p>At the conclusion of the war in India, Lord Cornwallis returned to England. He
                    was now (1792) created a marquis; admitted a member of the privy council; and,
                    in addition to his other appointments, he was nominated to the lucrative office
                    of master-general of the ordnance, which gave him a seat in the cabinet. A few
                    years afterwards his talents were again required for the public service. Ireland
                    being in a state of ferment, harassed with insurrection, and menaced with
                    foreign invasion, the Marquis of Cornwallis was invested,,with the viceregal
                    powers, and assumed the government in 1798. His administration was short but
                    successful; an invading army was made captive; some of the abuses which
                    prevailed in the internal government of the kingdom were reformed, and
                    tranquillity restored. On the union of Ireland with Great Britain, he resigned
                    the government of the country, and returned to -England. In 1801 he was
                    appointed plenipotentiary to the congress assembled for the purpose of
                    negotiating a general peace, which terminated in the definitive treaty of
                    Amiens.</p>
                <p>Having been thus from his early years actively, and almost uninterruptedly,
                    engaged in the service of his country, it might have been supposed that, his
                    lordship, who had now attained an advanced age, would have been permitted to
                    pass the remainder of his life in the enjoyment of domestic repose. But the new
                    and extensive acquisitions of the East India Company had brought their affairs
                    into a state of embarrassment; and the talents and experience of the Marquis of
                    Cornwallis pointed him out as the individual most likely to restore order and
                    tranquillity to our territorial possessions in Asia. In the year 1805, he
                    accordingly repaired thither a second time as governor-general and
                    commander-in-chief of the forces.</p>
                <p>On his arrival at Calcutta, he found the finances of the country in a most
                    deplorable state; whilst several of the most powerful of the native princes were
                    still in arms, or preparing anew for hostilities. His first object, therefore,
                    was to adopt a variety of arrangements for the purpose of introducing order and
                    economy into the civil department; and he then resolved to place himself at the
                    head of the army, in order that, by an union of firmness and conciliation, he
                    might accomplish what he justly conceived to be the most beneficial measure for
                    our Indian territories, an honourable peace. But at this critical moment our
                    eastern empire was unfortunately deprived of his services. Bodily fatigue,
                    mental exertion, and the vicissitudes of climate, had undermined his
                    constitution; and his health was now so much impaired, that he was obliged to
                    perform his journey by slow and easy stages. Nature at length became completely
                    exhausted; and he died on the 5th of October 1805, at Ghazepore, in the province
                    of Benares, in the sixty-sixth year of his age. He was buried with great pomp;
                    and every mark of respect was paid to his merit. The inhabitants <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> Calcutta voted a mausoleum, and those of Bombay a statue
                    to his memory. His lordship was only once married, and left two children, the
                    present marquis and a daughter.</p>
                <p>Marquis Cornwallis was endowed in no small degree with those qualities which lead
                    to distinction, both in the cabinet and in the field, and rendered important
                    services to his country as a statesman and a general. In council, he displayed
                    moderation and coolness; in conduct, firmness, resolution, and vigour. In public
                    life, he was distinguished by independence of character and inflexible
                    integrity; in private, he was respected and esteemed for his humanity and
                    benevolence.</p>
