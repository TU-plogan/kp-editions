                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    be our <hi rend="italic">common</hi> mother; and in the first or golden age, all
                    things were in <hi rend="italic">common,</hi> as well as the sun and elements.

                    soil, the use of which is common to a particular town or lordship; or it is a
                    profit that a man has in the land of another person, usually in common with
                    others; or a right which a person has to put his cattle to pasture into ground
                    that is <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> not his own. And there is not only common
                    of pasture, but also common of piscary, common of estovers, common of turbary,

                    things occur worthy to be noted, in the course of a man’s thinking or study, and
                    is so disposed, as that, among a number of subjects, any one may be easily
                    found. The advantages of a common-place book are manifold. It not only makes a
                    man read with accuracy and attention, but induces him insensibly to think for
                    himself, provided he considers it not so much a register of sentiments which
                    strike him in the course of reading, as a register of his own thoughts upon
                    various subjects. Many valuable thoughts occur even to men of no extraordinary
                    genius; but these, without the assistance of a common-place book,· are generally
                    lost both to himself and others. There are various methods of arranging
                    common-place books; that of Mr Locke is as good as any that has hitherto been
                    contrived.</p>
                <p>The first page of the book in which it is intended to take down common-places
                    serves as a kind of index to the whole, and contains references to every place
                    or matter therein; and in the commodious contrivance of this index, so as to
                    admit of a sufficient variety of materials, without any confusion, all the
                    secret of the method consists.</p>
                <p>In order to this, the first page, as already mentioned, or, for more room, the
                    first two pages that front each other, are to be divided by parallel lines into
                    twenty-five equal parts, of which every fifth line is to be distinguished by its
                    colour or other circumstance. These lines are to be cut perpendicularly by
                    others, drawn from top to bottom; and in the several spaces the several letters
                    of the alphabet, both capital and minuscle, are to be duly written.</p>
                <p>The form of the lines and divisions, both horizontal and perpendicular, with the
                    manner of writing the letters therein, will be conceived from the following
                    specimen; in which, what is to be done in the book for all the letters of the
                    alŋhabet is here shown in the first four, <hi rend="italic">A,</hi><hi

                <p>The index to the common-place book being thus formed, matters are ready for the
                    taking down any thing therein.</p>
                <p>In order to this, consider to what head the thing you would enter may most
                    naturally be referred, and under which one would be led to look for such a
                    thing: in this head or word regard is had to the initial letter, and the first
                    vowel that follows it, which are the characteristic letters on which all the use
                    of the index depends.</p>
                <p>Suppose, for instance, we would enter down apassage that refers to the head <hi
                    rend="italic">beauty. B</hi> is the initial letter, and <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    the first vowel: then looking upon the index for the partition <hi rend="italic"
                    >B,</hi> and the line <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which is the place for all words
                    whose first letter is <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and the first vowel <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">beauty, beneficence, bread, breeding,
                    blemishes,</hi> and finding no numbers already down to direct us to any page of
                    the book where words of this characteristic have been entered, we turn forward
                    to the first blank page we find, which, in a fresh book, as this is supposed to
                    be, will be page second, and there write what we have occasion for on the head
                    <hi rend="italic">beauty</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> beginning the head in the
                    margin, and indenting all the other subservient lines, that the head may stand
                    out and show itself. This done, we enter the page in which it is written, viz.
                    2, in the index in the space <hi rend="italic">B e</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    from which time the class <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    becomes wholly in possession of the second and third pages, which are consigned
                    to letters of this characteristic.</p>
                <p>Had we found any page or number already entered in the space <hi rend="italic">B
                    e,</hi> we must have turned to the page, and have written our matter in whatever
                    space was left therein. Thus, if after entering the passage on beauty, we should
                    have occasion for <hi rend="italic">benevolence,</hi> or the like, finding the
                    number 2 already possessed of the space of this characteristic, we would begin
                    the passage on benevolence in the remainder of the page; but this not containing
                    the whole, we would carry it on to page third, which is also for <hi
                    rend="italic">b e,</hi> and add the number 3 in the index.</p>

                    thither by original, as arrests and outlawries; or by privilege, or attachment
