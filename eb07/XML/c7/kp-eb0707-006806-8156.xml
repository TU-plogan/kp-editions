                    societies, or of several persons into one society.</p>
                <p>College, among the Romans, was applied indifferently to those employed in the
                    offices of religion, government, the liberal and even mechanical arts and
                    trades; so that anciently the word signified what we now call a corporation or
                    company.</p>
                <p>In the Roman empire, there were not only the <hi rend="italic">college of
                    augurs</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">college of capitolini,</hi> or of those
                    who had the superintendence of the capitoline games; but also colleges of
                    artificers, <hi rend="italic">collegium</hi><hi rend="italic">artificum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> college of carpenters, <hi rend="italic">fabricoum

                    rend="italic">tibicinum,</hi> and so forth. Plutarch observes, that it was Numa
                    who first divided the people into colleges, which he did that each consulting
                    the interests of his college, and occupying himself therewith, might thus be
                    prevented from entering into any general conspiracy against the public
                    repose.</p>
                <p>Each of these colleges had distinct meeting places or halls, and also a treasury
                    and common chest, a register, a person to represent them upon public occasions,
                    and acts of government. They had the privilege of manumitting slaves, of being
                    legates, and of making by-laws for their own body, provided these did not clash
                    with those of the government.</p>
                <p>There are various colleges among the moderns, founded on the model of those of
                    the ancients. Such are the three colleges of the empire, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> College</hi><hi rend="italic">of Electors, or their
                    Deputies,</hi> which formerly assembled in the diet of Ratisbon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> College</hi><hi rend="italic">of Princes,</hi> or
                    the body of princes, or their deputies at the diet of Ratisbon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> College</hi><hi rend="italic">of Cities</hi> is, in
                    like manner, the body of deputies which the imperial cities send to the
                    diet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> College</hi><hi rend="italic">of Cardinals,</hi> or
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sacred</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> College,</hi> a
                    body composed of the three orders of cardinals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">College</hi> is also used for a public place endowed with
                    certain revenues, where the several branches of learning are taught. An
                    assemblage of several of these colleges constitutes an university. The erection
                    of colleges is part of the royal prerogative, and it is not to be done without
                    the king’s license.</p>
                <p>The establishment of colleges or universities is a remarkable period in literary
                    history. The schools in cathedrals and monasteries confined themselves chiefly
                    to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194748169" xml:id="kp-eb0707-8169-0069"
                    />teaching of grammar, and there were only one or two masters employed in that
                    office. But, in colleges, professors were appointed to teach the different parts
                    of science. The first obscure mention of academical degrees in the university at
                    Paris, from which the other universities in Europe have borrowed most of their
                    customs and institutions, occurs <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 1215.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> College</hi><hi rend="italic">of Civilians,</hi>
                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">Doctors' Commons,</hi> a college founded by Or
                    Harvey, dean of the arches, for the professors of the civil law residing in
                    London; where also usually reside the judge of the arches court of Canterbury,
                    the judge of the admiralty, of the prerogative court, &amp;c. with other
                    civilians, who all live, as to diet and lodging, in a collegiate manner,
                    commoning together; whence the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Doctors
                    Commons.</hi> Their house being consumed in the great fire, they all resided at
                    Exeter House in the Strand till 1672; when their former house was rebuilt, at
                    their own expense, in a very splendid manner. To this college belong thirty-four
                    proctors, who make themselves parties for their clients, manage their causes,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> College</hi><hi rend="italic">of Physicians,</hi> a
                    corporation of physicians in London, who, by several charters and acts of
                    parliament of Henry VIII. and his successors, have certain privileges, in virtue
                    of which no man, though a graduate in physic of any university, may, without
                    license, under the said collegeseal, practise physic in or within seven miles of
                    London; with power to administer oaths, fine and imprison offenders in that and
                    several other particulars, to search the apothecaries’ shops, &amp;c. in and
                    about London, to see if their drugs, &amp;c. be wholesome, and their
                    compositions according to the form prescribed by the college in their
                    dispensatory. By the said charter they are also freed from all troublesome
                    offices, such as serving on juries, being constables, keeping watch, providing
                    arms, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Of this college there are a president, four censors, eight electors, a registrar,
                    and a treasurer chosen annually in October; the censors have, by charter, power
                    to survey, govern, and arrest, all physicians, or others practising physic, in
                    or within seven miles of London, and to fine, amerce, and imprison them at
                    discretion. The number of fellows was anciently thirty, till King Charles II.
                    increased their number to forty; and King James II. giving them a new charter,
                    allowed the number of fellows to be enlarged so as not to exceed fourscore;
                    reserving to himself and successors the power of placing and displacing any of
                    them for the future.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> College</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of Physicians</hi> was erected on the 26th November 1681. The
                    design of this institution was, to prevent the abuses daily committed by foreign
                    and illiterate impostors, quacks, &amp;c. For this reason, his majesty, at the
                    time mentioned, granted letters patent to erect into a body corporate and
                    politic, certain physicians in Edinburgh, and their successors, by the title of
                    the President and Royal College of Physicians at Edinburgh, with power to choose
                    annually a council of seven, one of whom to be president: and these are to elect
                    a treasurer, clerk, and other officers; to have a common seal; to sue and be
                    sued; to make laws for promoting the art of physic, and regulating the practice
                    thereof, within the city of Edinburgh, town of Leith, and districts of the
                    Canongate, West Port, Pleasance, and Potterrow, through all which the
                    jurisdiction of the college extends. Throughout this jurisdiction no person is
                    allowed to practise physic, without a warrant from the college, under the
                    penalty of L.5 sterling the first month, to be doubled monthly afterwards while
                    the offence is continued; one half the money arising from such fines to go to
                    the poor, the other to the use of the college. They are also empowered to punish
                    all licentiates in physic within the above-mentioned bounds, for faults
                    committed against the institutions of the college; and to fine them of sums not
                    exceeding 40s. On such occasions, however, they must have one of the bailies of
                    the city to sit in judgment along with them, otherwise their sentence will not
                    be valid. They are also empowered to search and inspect all medicines within
                    their jurisdiction, and throw out into the street all such as are bad or
                    unwholesome; and that they may the better attend their patients, they are
                    exempted from watching, warding, and serving on juries. They are, however,
                    restrained from erecting schools for teaching the art of physic, or conferring
                    degrees on any person qualified for the office of a physician; but are obliged
                    to license all such as have taken their degrees in any university, and to admit
                    as honorary members all the professors of physic in the universities of
                    Scotland. These privileges and immunities are not, however, to interfere with
                    the rights and privileges of the apothecary surgeons, in their practice of
                    curing wounds, contusions, fractures, and other external operations.</p>

                    mind been a religious house, sometimes under the denomination of a priory,
                    sometimes under that of a spital or hospital. At its dissolution under 31st
                    Henry VIII. it was called Elson’s Spital, from the name of its founder, a
                    mercer, in 1329. At present it is a composition of both, namely, a college for
                    the clergy of London, who were incorporated in 1630, in pursuance of the will of
                    Dr White, under the name of the President and Fellows of Sion College; and an
                    hospital for cen poor men and as many women. The officers of the corporation are
                    the president, two deans, and four assistants, who are annually chosen from
                    among the rectors and vicars of London, and are subject to the visitation of the
                    bishop.</p>

                    founded by charter of King Richard III. who granted them several privileges,
                    such as freedom from subsidies, tolls, offices, &amp;c. They had a second
                    charter from King Henry VI.; and a house built near Doctors’ Commons by the Earl
                    of Derby in the reign of King Henry VII. was given them by the Duke of Norfolk
                    in the reign of Queen Mary, which house is now rebuilt.</p>
                <p>This college is subordinate to the earl marshal of England, and the members are
