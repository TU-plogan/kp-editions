                <p><label type="entry">CUVIER, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >George-Leopold-Ciiristian-Frederick-Dagobert</hi></label>, the most celebrated
                    naturalist of modern times, was a native of Montbéliard, now a French town, but
                    formerly the chief place of a principality in Switzerland, dependent on the Duke
                    of λVurtemberg, where he was born on the 23d of August 1769. His family came
                    originally from a village on the Jura, which still bears the name of Cuvier. His
                    father was a retired officer, who had served forty years in a Swiss regiment in
                    the pay of France, whence he derived a moderate allowance or pension, and
                    latterly he held the command of the artillery at Montbe-hard, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194754669" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4669-0569"/>where, under the
                    superintendence of his mother, young Cuvier was initiated in the elements of
                    learning. He was brought up in the Protestant faith, which was that of his
                    family, and early gave indications of those mental qualities for which he
                    afterwards became so greatly distinguished. He was gifted with a memory of
                    extraordinary power, and likewise evinced an aptitude for drawing, his taste for
                    which was formed at the age of twelve, from the works of Buffon. The study of
                    the Latin and Greek languages occasioned him but little difficulty; the German
                    he acquired with equal facility; and he also made himself master of the
                    different other modern languages in succession. He had a passion for every kind
                    of reading, particularly history; and such was the tenacity of his memory, that
                    the driest details of nomenclature, and the most lengthened lists of sovereigns,
                    princes, statesmen, and warriors, were remembered by him without effort, and so
                    forcibly impressed on his mind as never afterwards to be effaced. At the age of
                    fourteen, having acquired nearly all the instruction which the school of
                    Montbéliard could supply, he was sent to Stuttgard, under the patronage of Duke
                    Charles of Wurtemberg, and had a place assigned him, free from all expense, in
                    the Caroline Academy, where he was entered in the month of March 1784. He
                    remained four years at this seminary, and his progress corresponded with the
                    advantages which he enjoyed; and in every department of knowledge which formed
                    the subject of instruction, he evinced that reach of comprehension and soundness
                    of judgment for which he was always remarkable. Lessons were given in five
                    different faculties, one of which was exclusively devoted to the study of
                    government; and, singular as it may appear, it was to this that he attached
                    himself the most. The principal subjects taught were the elementary and
                    practical departments of law, and the more useful details connected with
                    finance, police, agriculture, and technology; and so sensible was he of the
                    advantages of such a branch of instruction, that he always lamented that a
                    corresponding system had not been established in France.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Baron Pasquier states, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Εlοςc of Cuvier,</hi> that the latter had often been heard to
                    express regret at the little assistance afforded in France to those who were
                    employed in acquiring a knowledge of the principles of government. The Baron’s
                    words are, “Quand la science des lois, dont les tribunaux font l’application,
                    est partout, disait-il, l’objet d’études pour lesquelles tous les genres de
                    secours et d’encouragemens sont prodigués, d’où vient qu’on dédaigne, ou au
                    moins qu’on neglige de fournir à la jeunesse les moyens d’acquérir
                    méthodiquement la cohnoissance de cette foule de dispositions, de règlemens qui
                    influent si puissamment sur un nombre infini d’intérêts publics et privés? d’où
                    vient qu’on ne s’occupe pas de lui apprendre de la même manière les principes
                    sur lesquels repose, ou devrait reposer cette législation administrative? Je me
                    plais à rapporter cette vue de Μ. Cuvier, parce qu’elle indique déjà l’attrait
                    que devaient avoir pour lui les travaux auxquels il s’est en effet livré avec
                    tant de zèle, tous les fois que l’occasion lui a été offerte de prêter à
                    l’administration publique le secours de ses talens et de ses
                    lumières.”</p></note> Among the teachers composing the faculty which formed the
                    object of Cuvier’s predilection was Μ. Abel, professor of natural history, who
                    took a lively interest in the progress of the young Frenchman, whose genius he
                    had not failed to discover; contributed to supply him with the means of
                    indulging his inclination for the study of the natural sciences, to which,
                    amidst all his varied occupations, he continually recurred; and engaged him,
                    sometimes in reading and meditating on the standard works in this department of
                    knowledge, and at other times in drawing insects or forming an herbarium. But
                    this favourite occupation did not prevent him from obtaining the most decided
                    success in the other studies prescribed by the rules of the academy; and, at the
                    termination of the course, he received, in addition to the highest prizes, an
                    order of merit conferred only on five or six out of the four hundred pupils
                    belonging to the establishment.</p>
                <p>The term of his education being thus completed, circumstances rendered it
                    necessary for him to turn his thoughts to the active business of life; and his
                    first resource was to engage himself as tutor to superintend the education of
                    one of the children of a Protestant family in Normandy. This situation, how
                    humble soever it may appear, had at least the recommendation of affording him
                    sufficient leisure for the prosecution of his scientific duties; from being
                    employed in the useful labour of instructing others he derived the means of
                    promoting his own improvement; and he never afterwards shrunk from the
                    recollection of his entrance on a path which in process of time conducted him to
                    so much celebrity. It was in July 1788, when he had scarcely completed his
                    nineteenth year, that Cuvier went to reside in Normandy, at a country-house
                    situated near the sea, in the middle of an almost insulated district. In this
                    remote retreat he found a secure asylum from the fury of the revolutionary
                    tempest which desolated so many other parts of France; and during the days of
                    dismal memory with which the history of that period is darkened, he escaped the
                    danger which threatened all who were conspicuous for virtue and excellence.
                    About this time a fortunate accident procured him the acquaintance of Jessier,
                    whom terror had driven to the neighbourhood where Cuvier then resided; and
                    having quickly discerned the talents of the young naturalist, this accomplished
                    person hastened to put him in communication with many scientific men in Paris,
                    particularly with La-mĕtherie, Olivier, Lacépède, Geoffroy, and Mellin de
                    Grandmaison. When the reign of terror had terminated, these distinguished
                    persons invited him to Paris, where the re-establishment of literary and
                    scientific institutions was now becoming an object of attention. Cuvier
                    accordingly repaired to the capital in the spring of 1795, and, by the interest
                    of Mellin and Jessier, he was almost immediately appointed a member of the
                    Commission of Arts, and shortly afterwards made professor to the Central School
                    of the Pantheon. It was for the use of this school that he prepared his <hi

                    l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle des Animaux,</hi> the first work
                    which the public knew to be his, and which, notwithstanding its elementary
                    appearance, has served as the basis of all subsequent works on zoological
                    classification. But his principal object had not yet been attained. He desired
                    to enter the Museum of Natural History, which alone could furnish him with the
                    means of prosecuting the scientific investigations which were already matured in
                    his mind; and this satisfaction was not long denied him; for the professor,
                    Mertrud, who had been appointed to the newly-established chair of comparative
                    anatomy, having attained an advanced age, which unfitted him for teaching a
                    science that was new to him, yielded to the entreaties of his colleagues
                    Jussieu, Geoffroy, and Lacépède, and upon their recommendation accepted Cuvier
                    to supply his place.</p>
                <p>Cuvier, having thus attained the object of his ambition, laboured indefatigably
                    to prove himself worthy of the confidence which had been placed in him, and
                    formed, for the use of comparative anatomy, that collection which is now known
                    throughout all Europe; whilst the lectures by which he rendered it so useful
                    soon attracted a numerous concourse of students, who spread his fame to a
                    distance as an eminent and successful teacher. These lectures have since been
                    published in five volumes 8vo, and their merit is universally acknowledged. This
                    was the grand epoch <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754682"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4682-0570"/>of Cuvier’s life. He had now attained a station
                    which enabled him to give full scope to all his energies, and to reach that
                    height of scientific distinction where he maintained an undisputed pre-eminence
                    for the long period of forty-seven years. Cuvier, in fact, may be regarded as
                    moving in three different spheres; namely, in that of literature, that of public
                    instruction, and that of the administration: yet, in the midst of a multiplicity
                    of occupations, the minutest details, whether these related to public
                    instruction, the deliberations of the council of state, or the committee of the
                    interior, were never neglected by him; and to his unrivalled fame' as a
                    naturalist he was enabled to add the reputation of a most useful as well as a
                    most illustrious citizen.</p>
                <p>The National Institute was established in the year 1796. At this time Cuvier was
                    professor of comparative anatomy in the Museum of Natural History; and, in
                    consequence of the reputation which he had acquired by his course of lectures,
                    as well as by the publication of some memoirs, he was soon invited to become a
                    member. At first the secretaries were only temporary, none of them holding the
                    office longer than two years. Cuvier was the third in order; and, in 1800, when
                    Bonaparte, after his return from Egypt, and the revolution of the 18th Brumaire,
                    which made him first consul, had assumed the title of President of the
                    Institute, this great naturalist found himself placed in intimate relationship
                    with that extraordinary man, then aspiring to every kind of glory, and having
                    his views already turned towards the possession of sovereign power. During the
                    same year M. Danbenton died, and the professor of comparative anatomy was
                    appointed to teach in his stead the philosophy of natural history. In 1802, the
                    first consul, wishing to remodel the system of public instruction, nominated six
                    inspectors to establish lyceums in thirty French towns. Cuvier was one of these,
                    and his commission directed him to superintend the establishment of the lyceums
                    of Marseilles and Bordeaux, which are now royal colleges. During his absence
                    from Paris the Institute was re-organized; perpetual secretaries were appointed,
                    and Cuvier was elected to fill that office in the class of the natural sciences.
                    It was in the latter capacity that, in 1808, he drew up his historical report of
                    the progress of the natural sciences. Napoleon had asked merely for a report;
                    but, under this unassuming title, the skilful reporter contrived not merely to
                    show the road which had already been traversed, but to indicate that which ought
                    still to be pursued. This report was read to the emperor in the council of
                    state, and greatly admired. In the course of the same year the Imperial
                    University was established, and Cuvier nominated one of the councillors of that
                    body for his life. In 1809 and 1811 he was occupied in instituting academies in
                    those parts of the Italian provinces which had been annexed to the empire; in
                    1811 he undertook a similar mission to Holland and the Hans Towns; and in 1813
                    he was sent to Rome, in order to organize a university. These successive
                    journeys could not fail to be profitable to such an observer, whilst the
                    intimate connection which they afforded him opportunities of forming with
                    distinguished men of all countries, enabled him to accumulate most valuable
                    materials for all the works in which he was then engaged. But his administrative
                    talents had not escaped the penetration of Napoleon, who knew well how to
                    estimate men at their real value, and he was soon called to act in a different
                    sphere.</p>
                <p>While at Rome he received the news of his being appointed a master of requests;
                    and, once a member of the council of state, he was not long in raising himself
                    to the first rank. Nor did the events of the year 1814, which overthrew the
                    imperial power, retard his further advancement. He became a councillor of state
                    in the month of</p>
                <p>September in that year; and soon afterwards he was repeatedly offered, but as
                    often declined, the situation of superintendent of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jardin</hi><hi rend="italic">du Roi,</hi> an office on which Buffon had
                    conferred so much celebrity. In the month of February 1815 the university having
                    been remodelled, a place was assigned him, under the title of chancellor, in the
                    royal council of public instruction attached to that institution. But the new
                    convulsion occasioned by the return of Napoleon from Elba prevented his
                    continuing a member of the council of state; he was, however, retained in the
                    Imperial University, where the absence of his name would have created too great
                    a blank. About four months afterwards, when it became necessary to re-establish
                    what the hurricane of the hundred days had overthrown, it was found that neither
                    the system of the Imperial University, nor even that of the Royal University as
                    it had been organised in February, could be fully carried into effect. A
                    provisional arrangement was therefore judged necessary, and a commission
                    appointed to exercise the powers which had been previously vested in a grand
                    master, a council, a chancellor, and a treasurer. Of this commission Cuvier was
                    named a member, and from the first the duties of chancellor devolved on him. He
                    took an active part in the labours of the commission, to which he rendered very
                    important services; and he acted as president on two occasions, each time for
                    more than a year, but always provisionally, his religion disqualifying him for
                    being regularly appointed to that office. In 1818 he visited England, and, on
                    his arrival in London, learned that he had been elected a member of the French
                    Academy; an important addition no doubt to the gratification which must then
                    have been afforded him by the flattering reception which he met with in the
                    British metropolis, from men who were certainly very competent judges of the
                    merit which they honoured with their notice and regard. In 1819 he was appointed
                    president of the section of the interior in the council of state, and from the
                    moment when he entered on this office, the duties of which were alike important
                    and laborious, he never quitted it until the period of his death. In 1824, when
                    a minister of ecclesiastical affairs was appointed, and the new porte-feuille
                    passed into the hands of a bishop who had previously been grand master of the
                    university, the duties of the latter office, as far as they regarded Protestant
                    theology, were entrusted to Cuvier, by whom they continued to be performed
                    during the remainder of his life. In 1827 the superintendence of that department
                    of the administration of the interior which related to the forms of worship not
                    Catholic was committed to him; and, lastly, he was raised to the peerage about
                    the end of the year 1831. But the brilliant career of this great naturalist was
                    now fast drawing towards its close; and he expired on the 13th of May 1832,
                    after four days’ suffering, from an attack of paralysis in the throat, which
                    soon reached his lungs, being then only in the sixty-third year of his age. He
                    died surrounded by nearly all that remained of his domestic circle; by his wife,
                    his daughter-in-law, and his brother, who united all their affection in
                    consoling his last moments. In his family he had suffered severe afflictions,
                    having lost three sons in infancy, whilst his daughter, a model of grace and
                    virtue, was carried off on the eve of contracting a marriage which had received
                    her father’s entire approbation, and promised a long course of happiness. Of
                    four children, also, which his wife had had by a former marriage, and which he
                    had adopted, two were arrested by death at an age when all risks appeared to
                    have ceased, and hope seemed to have become reality.</p>
                <p>We have already mentioned the earliest work which procured him distinction in the
                    natural sciences. In 1811 he published his <hi rend="italic">Recherches
                    sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les Ossemens</hi><hi rend="italic">Fossiles</hi><pb

                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Quadrupèdes.</hi> This work has gone through three
                    editions, and the preliminary discourse has often been reprinted. In 1817
                    appeared his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires pour servir à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mollusques,</hi> which effected a total change in one branch of
                    zoological classification; and also <hi rend="italic">Le Regne</hi><hi

                    >Organization,</hi> in four vols. 8vo, which soon became the foundation of all
                    zoological studies, whilst, in most of the schools, the lectures, collections,
                    and works of research, were all more or less elucidated or illustrated by an
                    appeal to this great work. Cuvier was assisted by his friend Latreille in the
                    part of the work connected with the class of insects, a class which is in itself
                    more numerous than all the rest of the animal kingdom, and which would require
                    for its illustration the whole life of a laborious man; but he had persuaded
                    this skilful entomologist to deviate in some points from his usual system, in
                    order that his labours might the better harmonize with the other parts of the
                    work. During the last years of his life he was occupied with a great work on the
                    natural history of fishes, in twenty volumes, of which eight have already
                    appeared, and the materials for five others were prepared previously to his
                    death. The preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Regne</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Animal</hi> having showed Cuvier how much the study of fishes had fallen behind
                    that of the other branches of zoology, and made him sensible of the difficulties
                    of prosecuting it, owing to the obscurity in which the anatomy of these animals
                    was involved, the impossibility of knowing with precision the. laws deducible
                    from the comparison of their organs, the want of good collections, and the
                    somewhat artificial spirit which had hitherto prevailed in the study of
                    ichthyology, he exerted himself to collect skeletons of fishes from all parts of
                    the world, anatomised a great number with unusual care, associated with himself
                    in the study of their details a man of merit, Μ. Valenciennes, to assist him,
                    and, in a period comparatively short, became thus enabled to arrange the
                    elements of that history of fishes, of which, as stated above, eight volumes
                    have already appeared. Several years ago Cuvier also undertook a course of
                    lectures on the history of the natural sciences, which he delivered from notes,
                    and which, according to the testimony of all who heard him, were remarkable for
                    eloquence, precision, and lucid arrangement. He was, besides, occupied with a
                    new edition of his lectures on comparative anatomy, and wished to devote the
                    remainder of his life to a great treatise on the same science, for which,
                    indeed, he had brought together the immense collection of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jardin</hi><hi rend="italic">du Roi,</hi> whilst the greater number of the
                    drawings necessary for the work were already completed, a very considerable
                    portion of them having been executed by his own hand. “This,” said he, “will be
                    a work almost entirely new, because our immense collections, and the works
                    executed by other anatomists, since the first publication, have furnished me
                    with many new facts; but I see with pleasure that the system requires little
                    change, and that it continues preferable, at least in my opinion, to those which
                    have been adopted since by some learned men.” This project, which was always
                    present to his mind, and for which he had in fact laboured nearly forty years,
                    seemed to him necessary for completing as it were the cycle of his works; but
                    the melancholy doubt which he oftener than once expressed, that he would not
                    live to complete his design, was but too soon verified; and he died leaving the
                    work in the state which we have already described. Such indeed was the
                    surprising fertility of genius for which this great naturalist was
                    distinguished, that he left behind him unpublished works which, as De Candolle
                    remarks, might well be supposed to have absorbed the labour of a whole
                    lifetime.</p>
                <p>Cuvier was a man of an extremely active and enterprising, yet sound and
                    methodical mind. In him strong natural sagacity and almost unerring good sense
                    were united with unwearied industry, an invincible love of labour, a habit of
                    hearing and investigating every thing with patience, admirable correctness and
                    precision in thinking, and singular clearness in the explanation of doctrines
                    and systems, however complicated and refined these might be. Nor was he less
                    remarkable for the variety than for the extent and completeness of his
                    acquirements. In literature, in the sciences, in practical education, and in
                    civil administration, his abilities were displayed, if not with equal brilliancy
                    in all, at least with distinguished success. His Eloges are all masterpieces of
                    their kind, which, while they enable us to form an idea of the extent of his
                    knowlege in the natural sciences, evince, at the same time, great literary skill
                    in the disposition and arrangement of his materials, and consummate address in
                    the selection of those prominent points which are best calculated to convey a
                    distinct general idea of the course or route which it was his object to trace
                    out. Of this kind of composition some beautiful examples had previously appeared
                    in France; and Fontenelle, D’Alembert, Condorcet, and Vicq-d’Azir, were each
                    greatly distinguished, though often for very different qualities. But Cuvier may
                    with justice be considered as having excelled all his predecessors in the art of
                    analysing the principles and describing the origin and progress of a science,
                    with such a degree of precision and perspicuity as to bring it to the level of
                    every capacity. Aiming less at effect than Fontenelle, free from the disdainful
                    and ill-disguised scepticism of D’Alembert and Condorcet, and possessed of more
                    profound and varied knowledge than Vicq-d’Azir, he could intersperse, in the
                    most attractive manner, his instructive and able expositions of the labours and
                    discoveries of those whom he celebrated, with details of their history and
                    private life, which generally attested the humble origin whence they had emerged
                    to usefulness and celebrity. It is no doubt easy to conceive a style more
                    correct and skilfully laboured than Cuvier’s, but it is difficult to imagine one
                    better adapted to his extensive erudition, or more appropriate to the subject of
                    which he is treating, and the thought which, at the time, he requires to
                    express. His varied talents, however, are perhaps best proved by the influence
                    which he exerted on natural history. For, independently altogether of his
                    discoveries, and the benefits which he conferred upon the science by his works,
                    he may be said to have created, so much did he improve, the cabinet of
                    comparative anatomy attached to the Museum of Natural History at Paris; and when
                    placed by the choice of his colleagues at the head of this establishment, he
                    contributed greatly to accelerate its progress, and carried into its general
                    details that activity and that perfection of methodical arrangement for which he
                    was ever distinguished. When called to co-operate in the direction of public
                    instruction, whether in the council of the university, in the provinces, or in
                    countries then dependent upon France, he everywhere made himself remarkable for
                    the same qualities, and evinced a desire not merely to improve the general
                    system of education, but also to render it more easily accessible. His remarks
                    on the primary instruction of Holland sufficiently evince his solicitude for the
                    diffusion of knowledge among the people; and the effects of his arrangements in
                    the higher studies have proved extensively beneficial, not only by the
                    correction of much that was evil, but also by affording greater scope and a
                    fairer field for their advancement. In making the round of the administrative
                    functions (with the exception of censor, which he nobly refused when the
                    government wished to bestow it on him), he displayed the same superiority which
                    distinguished his career in the more congenial pursuits of science, literature,
                    and public instruction. He was in fact <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754708"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-4708-0572"/>so well acquainted with laws, regulations, and
                    official acts of all kinds, that his colleagues in the administration
                    continually deferred to him, and were every day more and more surprised at the
                    extent and accuracy of his information respecting subjects which seemed the
                    least likely to engage the attention of a man so much devoted to the pursuits of
                    science. In a word, the range of his knowledge was surpassingly great. He had
                    all his life read much; he had been a constant and attentive observer; and he
                    had never forgotten any thing which seemed worth remembering. A powerful and
                    retentive memory, sustained and directed by sound judgment and singular
                    sagacity, formed the principal foundation of his immense works, and of the
                    success which more or less attended him in all his employments. Nor in the midst
                    of a life so occupied did he neglect the graces and accomplishments of society.
                    His conversation, sometimes grave and solemn, sometimes piquant and lively, at
                    all times distinguished for its propriety and correctness, made him the ornament
                    of the saloons, and the delight of all those who had the honour of his
                    acquaintance. He was a warm, sincere, and faithfùl friend; full of gratitude to
                    those who had contributed to his early advancement in life; moderate in all his
                    habits; and wholly unimpeachable in the different relations of social life. He
                    engaged the minds and hearts of those who surrounded him; and whilst he
                    displayed great ability in directing the efforts of others towards the
                    accomplishment of his own views, he was wholly free from that engrossing
                    selfishness which sometimes attends great mental superiority. In a word, Cuvier
                    was a good as well as great man, combining with talents and accomplishments of
                    the first order that high personal worth which conciliates universal esteem,
                    disarms envy, and sheds fresh lustre even on the brightest and noblest mental
                    endowments. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
