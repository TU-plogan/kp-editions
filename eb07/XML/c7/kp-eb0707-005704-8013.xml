                <p><label type="entry">COLD</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> is often disputed whether cold has any actual
                    existence, or should be considered as merely the privation of heat. Nor is that
                    question of a modern date. Plutarch attempted to discuss it, in his tract <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">primo frigido</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and the reasonings which he there employs, though abundantly vague, are
                    yet curious. Cold, he says, affects the senses as well as heat; and it is not
                    less active, since it condenses and consolidates bodies. He therefore inclines
                    to the opinion, that cold is a distinct and independent power in nature. With
                    the Stoic philosophers, he regards air as by its constitution cold and dark; and
                    hence water drawn from a well freezes on being exposed to the atmosphere, while
                    rivers overshadowed by high banks seldom freeze, and even where their surface
                    congeals, the heat is not exhaled, but only driven down nearer the bottom.</p>
                <p>It is contrary to sound physics to admit more principles than are indispensably
                    required, and this argument alone may be sufficient for the rejection of cold as
                    a distinct power in nature. What we term cold, in reference to our feelings, is
                    merely the diminution of heat; but the existence and materiality of heat rest on
                    a very different foundation. The introduction of heat into a body is accompanied
                    by the infusion of a certain extrinsic repulsive force, and its passage through
                    the mass is connected with a series of depending internal motions, which imply
                    the regular expenditure of time and velocity. The contraction which follows on
                    the diminution of heat is due to the mutual attractive powers of the particles
                    of the substratum, now exerted with less opposition. That expansion, again,
                    which some fluids manifest in the act of congelation, proceeds from the
                    operation of the principle of crystallization, with the recondite nature of
                    which we are still unacquainted.</p>
                <p>The notion that cold has a separate and independent existence, appears, however,
                    to receive some countenance from the elegant experiment of collecting and
                    concentrating the frigorifie impressions in the focus of a metallic reflector.
                    This curious fact, which is one of the oldest in physical science, has lately
                    been revived, and combined with circumstances of peculiar interest. The
                    experiment was first mentioned about the year 1590, by Baptista Porta, in the
                    enlarged edition of his <hi rend="italic">Magia Naturalis,</hi> when the four
                    books of which it originally consisted were augmented to twenty, at the very
                    time that his ingenious countryman Sanctorio had invented and applied to medical
                    purposes the air thermometer. Porta relates, that, if a shut eye be held in the
                    focus of a speculum, before which is placed a ball of snow, intense cold will be
                    felt on the eye-lid.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Si

                    the celebrated discoverer of infinitesimals, in his work on the conic sections,
                    printed in 1632, and entitled <hi rend="italic">Lo Specchw Ustorio,</hi>
                    extended the experiment to all impressions which he conceived to be propagated
                    in straight lines, not only to those of heat and cold, but to those of sound,
                    and even smell.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Cavalieri mentions that, with a spherical speculum made of lead, and
                    indifferently polished, he was able to inflame dry substances by the reflexion
                    of a charςoal fire; and that, with a deep truncated parabolic speculum, badly
                    polished, he produced the same effect in the open focus, from a small fire of
                    wood at the distance of five feet. Esperienza di questo ho fatto io, che con vno
                    Specchio sfericodi piõbo ancor mal polito, ho acceso il fuoco nella materia
                    arida al fuoco di carboni; e di più ľhò fatto con la superficie parabolica, cioè
                    con vn canone parabolico, che hauea il suo foco vicino alla cima, essendo esso
                    specchio parabolico trôcato pur nella cima, quai’ era di stagno, e mal polito

                    philosopher, the same form of speculum which concentrates light and heat must
                    likewise collect cold, which spreads.from its source, from a mass of snow for
                    instance, in straight lines. The hyperbola is, therefore, the figure which he
                    thinks the best adapted for the purpose; and he proposes this for condensing the
                    smells radiated from an odoriferous substance. Hora dunque basterà quello, che

                    Academy del Cimento, with the important addition of the thermometer, which that
                    learned body had the merit of introducing into practice. Similar experiments
                    were next performed by Mariotte in France.</p>

                    into great neglect. We find scarcely any mention of their application to
                    physical researches, till, after the lapse of more than half a century, Kraft
                    repeated, at St Petersburg, during the severe winter of 1740, the frigorifie
                    experiment of the Italian philosophers, with a reflector belonging to the
                    cabinet of the Imperial Academy. Ambitious to operate on a grand scale, he
                    selected three huge blocks of clear ice, nearly of a cubical form, each side
                    being two, four, and five feet; but, to save the trouble of transporting them,
                    he carried the speculum out of doors. No sensible effect, however, was then
                    perceived by him, though he used the air thermometer on account of its extreme
                    delicacy. In 1744, this academician again resumed the observation, and with
                    scarcely better success, having obtained only a doubtful cold of three degrees.
                    The cause of the failure was evidently his performing the experiment out of
                    doors, and not in a warm room. The blocks of ice had, by long standing, acquired
                    almost the same temperature as their ambient medium. Had the air happened to
                    become suddenly colder, they might, from their relative condition, have excited
                    impressions even of heat, and thus have perplexed philosophy for many years
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>Such unsatisfactory results, from the action of a mass of ice of above a ton
                    weight, seem for a long time to have shaken the belief in former experiments;
                    and the subject was almost forgotten, when Pictet of Geneva, in 1781, repeated
                    the original observation, on a small scale, indeed, but with entire success.
                    Since that time a pair of brass reflectors, with a wire case for holding
                    charcoal or snow, has been deemed an essential apparatus in every physical
                    cabinet. The concentration of cold in the focus of a speculum always excites
                    surprise; and the experiment is often exhibited with a sort of mysterious air,
                    as if it established, or at least rendered probable, the distinct and material
                    existence of cold; but, in fact, it is not more difficult to conceive the
                    impressions of cold to be collected than those of heat. Both those impressions
                    are only relative to the temperature of the atmosphere, which serves as the
                    medium of their transmission. The one process terminates with the deposition of
                    a portion of heat, the other with its abstraction.</p>
                <p>The diminution of heat, or the increase of cold, is produced in nature under four
                    different circumstances: 1. By the obliquity or absence of the sun; 2. by the
                    tenuity of the higher atmosphere; 3. by the evaporation which takes place in dry
                    air; and, 4. by the chilling impression shot downwards from a clear and serene
                    sky.</p>
                <p>I. In our temperate climates the thermometer in winter very seldom descends
                    fifteen degrees on Fahrenheit’s scale, below the point of congelation; but in
                    the higher latitudes the intensity of the cold is often far greater. In the
                    northern parts of Sweden and Russia, the rivers and ordinary lakes are frozen to
                    the depth of several feet; wine, and even ardent spirits, become converted into
                    a spongy mass of ice, and, as the cold still augments, it penetrates the living
                    forests, and congeals the very sap of the trees, which occasionally burst from
                    this internal expansion with tremendous noise. The Baltic Sea has been
                    repeatedly covered with a solid floor of ice, capable of transporting whole
                    armies, with all their stores and engines of war. Those waters, indeed, arc only
                    brackish; but the more northern ocean itself has often been frozen to a very
                    considerable thickness. In Siberia and Hudson’s Bay, and even in the northern
                    provinces of Sweden, mercury has been at some times observed contracted by
                    exposure into a solid semi-metal; and, consequently, the cold which then
                    prevailed must have exceeded seventy-one degrees, or thirty-nine below the
                    commencement of Fahrenheit’s scale.</p>
                <p>2. In elevated tracts the increase of cold is very striking. Even at an altitude
                    of three miles and a half, the air is generally sixty-eight degrees colder than
                    at the level of the sea. On the summit of the Andes, therefore, a' thermometer
                    would often sink perhaps under the beginning of Fahrenheit’s scale; and it seems
                    probable that mercury would naturally freeze in winter on the top of Mont Blanc.
                    Mountains are hence regarded as the grand stores or depositaries of cold in the
                    milder climates. In every country, therefore, the air of subterraneous caves,
                    and the water of deep springs or wells, are during the summer months
                    comparatively cold. Hence the obvious advantage of cellars, in addition to their
                    preserving an uniform temperature, which is so favourable to the ripening of the
                    liquors deposited in them. But the air at the bottom of an open and very deep
                    pit must be colder than the mean state of the ground; for in all the changes
                    which take place at the surface, the cold air will descend, and the warm air
                    still float over the mouth of the pit. The wealthier classes of antiquity were
                    accustomed, accordingly, to cool the wine for their tables by suspending it for
                    some time in a bucket let down near the surface of profound wells.</p>
                <p>3. Evaporation is a natural process, by which heat is powerfully abstracted by
                    the exhaling moisture, while this assumes a gaseous constitution in the act of
                    combining with dry air. The fact seems to have been known in the warm regions of
                    the East at a very early period of society, suggested probably by the familiar
                    use of a rude unglazed pottery for all culinary purposes. The Egyptians, and
                    other inhabitants of the sultry shores of the Levant, have, from the remotest
                    ages, cooled the water for drinking in their porous jars. Athenaeus reports,
                    from a history of Protagorides, that King Antiochus had always a provision for
                    his table prepared in that way. The water having been carefully decanted from
                    its sediment into earthen pitchers <hi rend="italic">(iιδgs∕ais
                    ×egaμs∕a∕ζ),</hi> these were transported to the highest part of his palace, and
                    exposed to the clear and keen atmosphere <hi rend="italic"
                    >(sξa∕0g∕aξou&lt;r∕v),</hi> two boys being appointed to watch them the whole
                    night, and kept constantly wetting their sides. This labour of sprinkling the
                    surface of the jars seems to have been afterwards spared, in consequence
                    probably of the adoption of a more porous kind of earthenware. Galen, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Commentary on Hippocrates,</hi> relates, that he witnessed the
                    mode of cooling water, which was practised in his time, not only at Alexandria,
                    but over all Egypt. The water having been previously boiled, was poured at
                    sunset into shallow pans (αyyo∕ς <hi rend="italic">ũōrgaMivoiç),</hi> which were
                    then carried to the house-tops, and there exposed during the whole night to the
                    wind; and, to preserve the cold thus acquired, the pans were removed at
                    day-break, and placed on the shaded ground, surrounded by leaves of trees,
                    prunings of vines, lettuce, or other slow-conducting substances.</p>
                <p>The bottles or bags made of goat-skins, in which the wandering Arabs are wont to
                    carry their scanty provision of water, allowing a small portion of the liquid to
                    transude and exhale, render it by consequence comparatively cool, and better
                    fitted to mitigate or allay the intolerable thirst created in traversing their
                    sandy deserts. In Guinea, it is customary to fill gourds or calabashes with
                    water, and suspend them all night from the outer branches of trees.</p>
                <p>The Moors introduced into Spain a sort of unglazed earthen jugs, named <hi
                    rend="italic">bucaros</hi> or <hi rend="italic">alcarrazas,</hi> which, being
                    filled with water, present to the atmosphere a surface constantly humid, and
                    furnish by evaporation, during the dry and hot weather, a refreshing beverage.
                    The same practice has been adopted by degrees in various parts of the south of
                    Europe. In India, during certain months, the apartments are kept comparatively
                    cool, by dashing <pb break="no" facs="nls:194748039"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-8039-0059"/>water against the matting of reeds or bamboos
                    which line the doors and outside of the walls. Even the more luxurious mariners,
                    in their voyages between the tropics, are accustomed to cool their wines by
                    lapping the bottle with wet flannel, and suspending it from the yard or under
                    the cabin windows. In all such cases the effect is accelerated, though not
                    augmented, by the swiftness of the current of air. What have been called <hi
                    rend="italic">Egyptian coolers,</hi> and lately produced by our potters, are
                    less perfect in their operation. Being very thick, they require only to be
                    soaked in water, and the evaporation from their surface cools the adjacent air.
                    On the inside, however, where the bottle is placed, the action, in consequence
                    of the confined humidity, must be enfeebled. In damp weather, these vessels, it
                    is evident, are entirely useless.</p>
                <p>The natives of India likewise are enabled, by directing a skilful process of
                    evaporation, to procure for themselves a supply of ice during their short
                    winter. In the upper country, not far however from Calcutta, a large open plain
                    being selected, three or four excavations are made in it, about thirty feet
                    square and two feet deep, and the bottom covered to the thickness of nearly a
                    foot with sugar canes or dried stalks of Indian corn. On this bed are placed
                    rows of small unglazed earthen pans, about an inch and quarter deep, and
                    extremely porous. In the dusk of the evening, during the months of December,
                    January, and February, these are filled with soft water previously boiled and
                    suffered to cool; when the weather is very fine and clear a great part of the
                    water becomes frozen during the night. The pans arc regularly visited at
                    sunrise, and their contents thrown into baskets which retain the ice. These are
                    now carried to a conservatory, made by sinking a pit fourteen or fifteen feet
                    deep, lined with straw under a layer of coarse blanketing. The small sheets of
                    ice are thrown down into the cavity, and rammed into a solid mass. The mouth of
                    the pic is then closed up with straw and blankets, and sheltered by a thatched
                    roof.</p>
                <p>4. It was stated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Climate,</hi> that
                    impressions of cold are constantly showered down from a clear and azure sky.
                    These effects are no doubt more conspicuous in the finer regions of the globe.
                    Accordingly, they did not escape the observation of the ancients, but gave rise
                    to opinions which were embodied in the language of poetry. The term <hi
                    rend="italic">ar</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">%</hi>
                    was applied only to the grosser part of the atmosphere, while the highest
                    portion of it, free from clouds and vapour, and bordering on the pure fields of
                    aether, received the kindred appellation of <hi rend="italic">aièpa.</hi> But
                    this word and its derivatives have always been associated with ideas of <hi

                    Athenaeus to signify the cooling of a body by exposure under a serene sky. Homer

                <p>In the finer climates, especially, a transpiercing cold is, therefore, felt at
                    night under the clear and sparkling canopy of heaven. The natives carefully
                    avoid exposing themselves to this supposed celestial influence; yet a thin shed
                    of palm leaves may be sufficient at once to scrcen them from the scorching rays
                    of the sun, and to shelter them against the chilling impressions rained from the
                    higher atmosphere. The captains of the French gallies in the Mediterranean used
                    formerly to cool their wines in summer by hanging the flasks all night from the
                    masts. At daybreak they were taken down and lapped in several folds of flannel,
                    to preserve them in the same state. The frigorifie impression of a serene and
                    azure sky must undoubtedly have concurred with the power of evaporation in
                    augmenting the energy of the process of nocturnal cooling practised anciently in
                    Egypt, and now systematically pursued in the higher grounds of India. As the
                    chilness accumulated in the ground is greatest in clear nights, when the moon
                    shines brightest, it seemed very natural to impute this effect partly to some
                    influence emanating from that feeble luminary. It was long imagined that the
                    lunar beams are essentially cold; and some philosophers, at no remote period,
                    have attempted even to prove the fact by experiment. Mr Boyle, though he
                    rejected judicial astrology, was yet disposed to admit the notion of stellar
                    influences.</p>
                <p>The obvious mode of cooling water, or other liquids, by the infusion of ice or
                    snow, was practised in the warmer countries from the earliest ages. It is even
                    mentioned in the Proverbs of Solomon, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >As the cold of snoiv in the time of harvest,</hi> so is a faithful messenger to
                    them that send him.” Aristotle, presuming that the finer parts of water are
                    dissipated by congelation, maintained that it is pernicious to drink melted
                    snow. This speculative opinion seems not, however, to have been regarded by the
                    ancients. Theocritus calls snow-water an <hi rend="italic">ambrosial drink,
                    noroς aμβξoff</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">oς.</hi> Xenophon
                    mentions the practice of cooling wine by the addition of snow. It is related by
                    the historians of Alexander the Great, that in his Indian expedition, when he
                    laid siege to the city of Petra, he commanded thirty pits to be dug and filled
                    with snow, which was covered over with oak branches. The luxurious Romans had
                    excavations regularly formed for keeping snow the whole year, chaff and other
                    light substances being employed to preclude from it the access of heat. But as
                    the snow preserved in this way could not escape being soiled, instead of mixing
                    it directly in the drinking cup, a more refined practice was introduced of
                    surrounding the silver goblet which contained the liquor with a mass of the
                    melting snow. This improvement was ascribed to the profligate emperor Nero.
                    Similar modes of storing up snow have been adopted in all the warm countries.
                    The caves on the sides of Mount Aetna are considered as natural magazines for
                    supplying a material which is not only carried down to Palermo and Messina, but
                    even shipped to the island of Malta. The Italians formerly cooled their wine by
                    setting the large glass flasks containing it in wide vessels of wood or cork,
                    the intervening space being filled with snow on which water was poured.</p>
                <p>Saltpetre or nitre being almost a natural production of the East, its property of
                    rendering water cold by solution was probably known from a very remote period to
                    the oriental nations. This process of cooling is described in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutes of</hi> Akbar as the discovery of that enlightened
                    prince, who governed India with parental mildness from the year 1560 to 1605.
                    One part of nitre is directed to be thrown into a vessel containing two parts of
                    water; and a gugglet of pewter or silver filled with pure water, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194748052" xml:id="kp-eb0707-8052-0060"/>and having its mouth close
                    stopped, is then stirred quickly in the mixture for the space of a quarter of an
                    hour.</p>
                <p>The frigorifie property of nitre was probably first communicated from India or
                    Persia to Europe, and seems to have become known to the Italians about the
                    middle of the sixteenth century. As early as the year 1550, all the rich
                    families in Rome cooled the liquors for their tables by dissolving that salt in
                    water. Into a vessel of cold water the nitre was gradually added in the
                    proportion of a fourth or fifth part, while a globular bottle with a long neck,
                    containing the wine or water to be cooled, was whirled rapidly round its axis.
                    The salt, being afterwards recovered by crystallization, would always serve the
                    same purpose again with undiminished effect. In India every family of
                    distinction keeps a domestic, whose sole employment is to cool liquors by this
                    process; but nitre being cheap in that country, it is used in larger
                    proportions, and the water charged with it is allowed to become a perquisite of
                    the operator.</p>
                <p>The application of salts to produce cold was extended by Boyle, and afterwards
                    more successfully by Fahrenheit. But within these twenty years Mr Walker of
                    Oxford, and Professor Lowitz of St Petersburg, have resumed the subject, and
                    produced compound saline powders possessed of intense frigorifie power. The
                    solution of salts in water expanding that liquid, augments its capacity for
                    heat, and consequently depresses its temperature. This effect is likewise the
                    greater in proportion to the quantity of saline matter which can be dissolved.
                    But after water is saturated with one species of salt, it can still absorb some
                    portion of another. Hence the frigorifie effects of solution are always
                    increased by employing a compound dry powder. Nitre and sal-ammoniac, or the
                    nitrate of potash and the muriate of soda, in equal parts, added in the form of
                    a dry powder to three parts by weight of water, will sink Fahrenheit’s
                    thermometer forty degrees. But equal parts of the muriate of ammonia and of the
                    nitrate of potash, with one part and a half of the sulphate of soda or common
                    Glauber’s salt, will cool down three parts of water forty-six degrees. A still
                    greater effect, amounting to fifty-seven degrees, is produced by dissolving
                    equal parts of the nitrate of ammonia and of the carbonate of soda in one part
                    of water. The frigorifie action is in general augmented by throwing the
                    desiccated powder into dilute acid instead of water. Thus three parts of the
                    phosphate of soda, and two parts of the nitrate of ammonia, joined to rather
                    more than one part of weak nitric acid, will sink the thermometer seventy-one
                    degrees.</p>
                <p>These changes induced on the temperature of the liquid menstruum are no doubt
                    considerable, yet they are still only transient, and the process requires some
                    address and manipulation, not always readily attained. But the principle of
                    evaporation, when rightly understood, leads to a far easier mode of cooling
                    liquids, which maybe prolonged at pleasure. A close investigation of that
                    principle, at the very commencement of his philosophical labours, has conducted
                    Professor Leslie through the whole train of his discoveries on the subject of
                    refrigeration. The process of evaporation had not then been examined with
                    attention. The depression of temperature which always accompanies it was hastily
                    supposed to be proportiònal to the rate with which the moisture is dissipated,
                    and to be therefore augmented by every circumstance that can accelerate this
                    effect. If water, contained in à porous vessel, expose on all sides its surface
                    to a current of air, it will cool down to a certain point, and there its
                    temperature will remain stationary. The rapidity of the current must no doubt
                    hasten the period of equilibrium, but the degree of cold thus induced will be
                    still the same. A little reflection may discover how this happens. Though the
                    humid surface has ceased to grow colder, the dispersion of invisible vapour, and
                    the corresponding abstraction of heat, still continues without intermission. The
                    same medium, therefore, which transports the vapour, must also furnish the
                    portion of heat required for its incessant formation. In fact, after the water
                    has been once cooled down, each portion of the ambient air which comes to touch
                    the evaporating surface must, from its contact with a substance so greatly
                    denser than itself, be likewise cooled to the same standard, and must hence
                    communicate to the liquid its surplus share of heat, or the difference between
                    the prior and the subsequent state of the solvent, which is proportional to the
                    diminution of temperature it has suffered. Every shell of air which encircles in
                    succession the humid mass, while it absorbs, along with the moisture which it
                    dissolves, the measure of beat necessary to convert this into steam, does at the
                    same instant thus deposit an equal measure of its own heat on the chill exhaling
                    surface. The abstraction of heat by vaporization on the one hand, and, on the
                    other, its deposition at the surface of contact, are therefore opposite
                    contemporaneous acts, which soon produce a mutual balance, and thereafter the
                    temperature induced continues without the smallest alteration. A rapid
                    circulation of the evaporating medium may quicken the operation of those causes;
                    but so long as it possesses the same drying quality, it cannot in any degree
                    derange the resulting temperature. The heat deposited by the air on the humid
                    surface becomes thus an accurate measure of the heat spent in vaporizing the
                    portion of moisture required for the saturation of that solvent at its lowered
                    temperature» The dryness of the air is therefore, under all circumstances,
                    precisely indicated by the depression of temperature produced on a humid surface
                    which has been exposed freely to its action.</p>
                <p>Guided by these views, Mr Leslie was enabled to construct a correct <hi
                    rend="italic">hygrometer,</hi> that should indicate the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dryness</hi> of the air, from the diminution of temperature which a small body
                    of water, exposed on all sides, suffers by evaporation. His efforts again to
                    improve this instrument led him next to the invention of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >differential thermometer,</hi> which was converted into an hygrometer by having
                    one of its balls covered with cambric, lint, or tissue paper, capable of being
                    easily wetted. Reduced to such a delicate and commodious form, it detected with
                    the utmost precision, and under all circumstances, the relative condition of the
                    air in regard to dryness.</p>
                <p>It appears that absorbent substances, exposing a broad surface, are capable of
                    assimilating to their previous state the air confined over them. Flannel, for
                    instance, which has been intensely dried, will support a remarkable degree of
                    dryness in a close receiver. The trap-rock and compound clays, brayed into a
                    coarse powder, and desiccated before a strong fire, will exert a more powerful
                    and extended action. But dried oat-meal will act with equal energy, and for a
                    longer time. Of the saline substance⅛, the muriate of lime absorbs moisture with
                    the greatest and most protracted force. After it has become drenched with
                    humidity, it may likewise be recovered again, though the process of restoring it
                    unaltered is rather troublesome. But the best and most powerful absorbent is the
                    concentrated sulphuric acid, or the oil of vitriol of commerce, which continues
                    for a long time to attract moisture with almost undiminished force, and
                    possesses besides the valuable property, after it has become charged with
                    humidity, of being easily restored again by the application of heat to its
                    original strength.</p>
                <p>To cool water in any climate or state of the atmosphere, we have only therefore
                    to put it into a small porous vessel, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194748065"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-8065-0061"/>presenting on all sides a humid surface, and to
                    suspend this within a close wide cistern, of which the bottom is covered with a
                    layer of sulphuric acid. The broad surface of the acid absorbing the moisture as
                    fast as it diffuses itself through the confined air, keeps that medium
                    constantly at a point of extreme dryness, and thus enables it to support, with
                    undiminished vigour, the process of evaporation.</p>
                <p>In practice, the cistern or refrigeratory, having a broad cylindrical form, from
                    twelve to sixteen inches in diameter, and composed of dense well-glazed
                    earthenware (see Plate CLXXI∏∙ fig· 7), is placed in a cellar or other cool
                    place, and charged with sulphuric acid to the height of about half an inch from
                    the bottom. One of the porous earthen pots, being filled up to the lip with
                    water fresh drawn from the well, is set upon a low porcelain stand in the middle
                    of the cistern, to which the lid or cover is then carefully adapted. In the
                    space of from three to perhaps five hours, the cooling is nearly completed, and
                    the pot should now be removed; for though the water will be kept at the same
                    degree of coldness as long as it remains shut up within the refrigeratory, the
                    acid would be unnecessarily weakened by the incessant absorption of
                    moisture.</p>
                <p>The production of cold is greater when the cistern is large, or when a small pot
                    is used, insomuch that the effect will be diminished one half if the humid
                    surface should equal that of the acid, the opposite actions of such surfaces
                    inducing an exactly intermediate state with respect to dryness and moisture in
                    the condition of the aerial medium. The power of evaporation is also diminished
                    in the low temperatures. Thus, if the atmosphere were at 95° by Fahrenheit, the
                    water within the refrigeratory might be cooled down 36°, or brought to 59°; but
                    if the thermometer be at 50°, the water can be cooled only 18°, which brings it
                    to the freezing point. This seems to be a very convenient property, since the
                    power of the refrigeratory is always the greatest at the season when its
                    application is most wanted.</p>
                <p>It is easy, therefore, by such means to cool water in our climate at all times to
                    near the freezing point, and, even under the torrid zone, to reduce it to the
                    temperature of 60°, which in those regions is sufficient perhaps for essential
                    comfort. </p>
                <p>By supplying a succession of porous earthen pots, the acid will continue to act
                    with scarcely diminished force, till it has absorbed half its weight of
                    moisture; during which time it will have assisted in cooling about fifty times
                    that quantity of the water exposed to evaporation. At this stage the dilute acid
                    should be drawn off, and a charge of concentrated acid again introduced into the
                    refrigeratory· . ....</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> r</hi>- This method of procuring cold, it will readily be
                    perceived, could be employed with advantage for various domestic purposes. For
                    instance, butter may in summer be kept cool for the table, by putting it, after
                    being washed with water, into a wet porous pot, and shutting this up for a
                    couple of hours in the refrigeratory. To cool wine sufficiently, one bottle only
                    is used at a time in the smallest refrigeratory. A sheath of stocking or
                    flannel, previously soaked in water, being drawn over the body of the bottle, it
                    is laid in a reclined position on one of the porcelain sliders, near the surface
                    of the acid, and allowed to remain shut up during the space of three or four
                    hours.</p>
                <p>The refrigerating combination here employed produces its effect, by a sort of
                    invisible distillation carried on by the play and circulation of the included
                    air. The minute portions of moisture which successively combine with the
                    contiguous medium, must abstract from the mass of water as much heat as would
                    support them in the state of vapour, or would in ordinary cases convert them
                    into steam. This vapour again being conveyed through the air, is attracted by
                    the sulphuric acid, and, recovering its liquid constitution, deposits the heat
                    which it had borne away. The acid is therefore warmed at the expense of the
                    water subjected ∙to evaporation, and the whole performance of the apparatus
                    consists in a mere transfer and interchange of condition.</p>
