                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">CONDE</label>, Louis <hi rend="smallcaps">de Bourbon, Prince
                    of,</hi> was born at Paris on the 8th of September 1621. He was styled Duke
                    d’Enghìen, till he succeeded to the title of Prince of Condé by his father’s
                    death in the year 1646. As he was of a tender and delicate constitution, the
                    prince sent him to the castle of Montrond, in Berri, that he might breathe a
                    purer and more salutary air. Here he was educated in his infancy by some
                    experienced and prudent citizens’ wives. But when he was of a proper age, the
                    prince took upon himself the task of governor, and appointed as his assistant Μ.
                    de la Poussières, a private gentleman, and a man of honour, fidelity, and good
                    nature, who made it a rule to observe inviolably the orders that were given him.
                    Two Jesuits distinguished for their genius and knowledge were also given him as
                    preceptors.</p>
                <p>With these attendants the Duke d’Enghien went to settle at Bourges, where he
                    frequented the college of Jesuits and, besides the ordinary studies, was taught
                    ancient and modern history, mathematics, geography, declamation, and also riding
                    and dancing, in which last he soon excelled. He made so great progress in his
                    studies, that before the age of thirteen he defended in public some questions in
                    philosophy with infinite applause. On his return from Mont rond, he received as
                    his tutor Μ. de Merille, a man deeply versed in the knowledge of ancient and
                    modern laws, of the holy scriptures, and of the mathematics. Under the direction
                    of this eminent person the duke went through a new course with prodigious
                    success, acquiring a critical taste in the arts and sciences, which he retained
                    during his whole life. His chief inclination, however, lay towards the military
                    art; and at the age of eighteen he obtained permission to make his first
                    campaign as a volunteer in the army commanded by Μ. de la Meilleraye. This
                    campaign proved unfortunate; and the Duke d’Enghien was only a witness of the
                    marshal’s imprudence and disgrace. Nevertheless, in this campaign he laid the
                    foundation of that renown which made him afterwards be considered as the
                    greatest general of his age.</p>
                <p>On his return to Paris, the duke waited upon Cardinal Richelieu at Ruel. The
                    minister was so pleased with his conversation, that he soon afterwards made
                    proposals of an alliance with the Prince of Condé, by marrying the Duke
                    d’Enghien to Claire Clémence de Maillé Brezé, the cardinal’s niece. The duke
                    consented to this match in obedience to his father; but the force he put upon
                    himself by yielding to it was so great, that he fell dangerously ill, and it was
                    long before he recovered.</p>
                <p>The duke served two more campaigns as a volunteer; one under the Marshal de la
                    Meilleraye, and the other in the army of Louis XIII. which conquered Roussillon.
                    In 1643, at the age of twenty-two, he obtained from the king, at the persuasion
                    of Cardinal Mazarin, the command of the army destined to cover Champagne and
                    Picardy; which command was confirmed to him after the king’s death by the queen
                    regent, Anne of Austria, to whose interest he was strongly devoted. In this
                    situation, although he had never been present at any battle, he soon gave such a
                    specimen of his abilities as crowned him with glory. The Spaniards, who
                    threatened France with an invasion, were defeated by him at Rocroi on 19th May
                    1643, and their hitherto invincible infantry destroyed; a signal victory, which
                    made him from that time be considered as the guardian genius of his country. He
                    next formed the project of besieging Thionville, and proposed it to the council
                    of regency. The latter consented with fear and distrust; but the duke carried it
                    into execution with such skill, activity, and courage, that he became the object
                    of general admiration. In two months time Thionville surrendered. At length,
                    having covered Alsace and Lorrain from the Imperialists, he returned to Paris,
                    where he obtained the government of Champagne, and that of the city of
                    Stenai.</p>
                <p>The three following years were little more than a series of military operations.
                    The battles of Fribourg, in which the Duke d’Enghien triumphed over Field
                    Marshal Count de Mercy, the greatest general in all Germany; the taking of
                    Philipsbourg, and a great number of other places, which rendered him master of
                    the Palatinate, and of the whole course of the Rhine; the victory of Nordlingen,
                    by which he revenged the Viscount de Turcnne’s defeat at Mariendal; the siege
                    and conquest of Dunkirk; the success of his arms in Catalonia, where, though he
                    was forced to raise the siege of Lerida, he kept the Spaniards in awe, and cut
                    to pieces their rear-guard; these are the principal events which distinguish the
                    campaigns of 1644, 1645, and 1646.</p>
                <p>The victories of the Duke d’Enghien, his great reputation, and the esteem with
                    which the people regarded him, began now to give umbrage to Mazarin. The
                    cardinal’s dislike to him appeared on the death of the Duke de Brezé, admiral of
                    France. The Prince of Condé earnestly demanded for his sen the Duke de Brezé’s
                    places; but Mazarin, afraid of increasing the wealth and power of a prince whom
                    his victories and the confidence of the people and the army had already rendered
                    too formidable to him, evaded his request, by persuading the queen to take the
                    admiralty to herself. On the death of his father, the minister’s dislike to the
                    young Prince of Condé became still more apparent. By the minister’s persuasion
                    he had accepted of the command of the army in Catalonia; but, on his arrival at
                    Barcelona, he found neither troops, money, artillery, provisions, nor
                    ammunition. Enraged at this deception, he vented his resentment in bitter
                    complaints and severe animadversions; but by the resources which he found in his
                    own genius, the prince added new lustre to his glory.</p>
                <p>The campaign of 1648 was as glorious to Condé as those which preceded it had
                    been. To disconcert the projects of the Archduke Leopold, the prince resolved to
                    attack him even in the heart of the Low Countries; and, in spite of the
                    difficulties which he had to surmount, he besieged the important city of Ypres,
                    and took it in sight of the enemy’s forces.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this success, Condé saw himself on the point of experiencing the
                    greatest reverse of fortune. His army was a prey to scarcity, to nakedness,
                    contagious distempers, and desertion. For eight months it had received no supply
                    from the minister except half a muster. Every thing was furnished by the prince
                    himself, who expended what money he had, and borrowed more, in order to supply
                    his troops. When it was represented to him that he was in danger of ruining
                    himself by such an enormous expense, he replied, that since he every day
                    ventured his life for the service of his country, he could very well sacrifice
                    his fortune to it. Let but the government exist, added he, and I shall want for
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>The French army having been reinforced by four thousand of the troops of Weimar,
                    Condé attacked the Spaniards, who were advantageously encamped near Lens, and
                    gained a complete victory over them. He afterwards besieged Fumes, the garrison
                    of which, consisting of five hundred men, surrendered themselves prisoners of
                    war.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194749898" xml:id="kp-eb0707-9898-0202"/>
                <p>But the prince was wounded in the trenches there by a musket-shot, which struck
                    him above the right hip; and the contusion proved so great that he was forced to
                    submit to several incisions.</p>
                <p>The French court, animated with the victory at Lens, thought this a proper time
                    to take vengeance on the factions which for some time had violently agitated the
                    kingdom; and accordingly imprisoned Broussel and Blanc-menil, two of the
                    principal leaders of the country party. This vigorous proceeding, however,
                    occasioned a general revolt. Two hundred thousand men took arms in Paris,
                    barricaded the streets, invested the Palais Royal, and demanded the liberation
                    of the prisoners. It was necessary to release them; but from that time the regal
                    authority was annihilated, the queen exposed to a thousand insults, and Mazarin
                    durst no longer venture out of the Palais Royal. In this embarrassment the queen
                    recalled the Prince of Condé, as the only person from whom she could hope for
                    support. He had retired to Ruel, whither the regent had gone with the young king
                    and Mazarin. Anne of Austria proposed to him the reducing of Paris by force of
                    arms; but he calmed the resentments <hi rend="italic">of that</hi> princess, and
                    instead of becoming accessory to her vengeance, directed all his views to pacify
                    the kingdom, and at length brought about an accommodation between the parties,
                    who all desired it with equal ardour. But new incidents soon rekindled the
                    combustion. The treachery of Mazarin, and the artifices of the leaders of the
                    country party, occasioned fresh cabals and fresh troubles. Condé was caressed by
                    the leaders of both parties; but at last, enraged at the arrogance of the
                    malcontents, who every day formed new pretensions, he took part openly with the
                    court, though he thought it ungrateful, and protected the minister, though he
                    did not esteem him.</p>
                <p>The royal family, the Duke of Orleans, Condé, and Mazarin, left Paris privately
                    in the night between the 5th and 6th of January 1646, and went to St Germains.
                    The parliament sent deputies to learn from the queen herself the reasons of her
                    departure, and to beg her to name the citizens whom she suspected, that they
                    might be tried. Mazarin had the imprudence to dismiss the envoys without any
                    answer. Exasperated at this, the people again took up arms in order to defend
                    themselves against the court, which had determined to block up and to starve the
                    capital, in order to suppress the party of malcontents. Accordingly, with seven
                    or eight thousand men, the broken relics of the last campaign, the Prince of
                    Condé formed a design of reducing above five hundred thousand intrenched behind
                    walls. He had neither money nor magazines, and he had to operate in the depth of
                    a most severe winter; nevertheless he constantly defeated the troops of the
                    malcontents; prevailed on het army which marched to their assistance under
                    Turenne to abandon that general; stopped the progress of the Duke de
                    Longueville, who had caused an insurrection in Normandy; got the start of the
                    Spaniards, who were advancing to give him battle; and ultimately reduced the
                    refractory capital.</p>
                <p>De Retz, coadjutor of Paris, and afterwards cardinal, was the life and soul of
                    the revolters, and directed all their motions. He had taken Catiline as his
                    model, and he was equally intrepid, and capable of the most daring actions, of
                    an exalted genius, but governed by ambition. He signalized his hatred to Mazarin
                    by arming the malcontents, and he himself raised at his own expense a regiment
                    which he called the regiment of Corinth. Peace was at length signed at St
                    Germains; but neither party carried its point, and scarcely any one but Condé
                    acquired glory in this war. After the conclusion of the treaty, the prince
                    repaired to the capital, and traversed the streets in his coach, without
                    attendants. All persons of any consequence paid their compliments to him, and
                    the parliament sent a solemn deputation to thank him for the peace to which he
                    had so powerfully contributed.</p>
                <p>The important service which Condé had just rendered the court entitled him to the
                    acknowledgments of the queen, and especially of Mazarin; but the dark soul of
                    the cardinal only remembered it to punish a too fortunate and too powerful
                    protector. He privately vowed the prince’s destruction; at least resolved that
                    he should give the whole kingdom a pattern of submission to and dependence on
                    his will. However, not to excite public indignation, he still kept up
                    appearances with the prince, and deceived him, by making the most flattering
                    proposals, which he always found means to avoid fulfilling. On the other hand,
                    the enraged prince despised the minister, and treated him with disdain. After
                    this they were again reconciled only to be again at variance. Each in his turn
                    courted the country party'·, in order to make it subservient to his designs. At
                    length Mazarin thought of an expedient, which had but too frequently answered
                    his purpose, of creating an irreconcilable quarrel between that party and the
                    prince. Among the malcontents, the Marquis de la Boulaye, aman of an infamous
                    character, had obtained the confidence of the party by false appearances of
                    hatred to the cardinal, while he secretly kept up a correspondence with his
                    eminence. It is pretended that he made him an offer of killing Condé privately.
                    Mazarin was charmed with the proposal; but he only required Boulaye to exhibit
                    all the proofs of an assassination, and to act in such a manner that every thing
                    might concur to render the country party suspected of that crime. He was
                    punctually obeyed; the coach was stopped; some pistols were fired at it, by
                    which two of the footmen were dangerously wounded; and after this shameful
                    exploit, La Boulaye took refuge in the hotel of the Duke of Beaufort, who was
                    the hero of the party, in order no doubt to countenance the prince’s suspicion
                    of the malcontents. Luckily Condé was not in his coach when it was stopped; the
                    cardinal had spread the report of his intended assassination, and, in concert
                    with the queen and the prince, he had prevailed to have the coach sent away
                    empty, in order to prove the reality of the attempt. Mazarin counterfeited a
                    zeal for the prince’s safety; declaimed furiously against the malcontents, who,
                    he pretended, had made an attempt on a life so precious to the state; and
                    inflamed Condé’s resentment against the Duke of Beaufort and the coadjutor, whom
                    he supposed to be the∙authors of this heinous outrage. The prince was so
                    strongly prejudiced that he refused to heaY them when they appeared before him
                    to justify themselves. He demanded justice against them of the king, formally
                    accused them before the parliament, and remained inflexible in spite of the
                    pains which the leaders of the party took to demonstrate to him that he had been
                    imposed upon. The affair was brought before the parliament; the accused defended
                    themselves; and the coadjutor, who had discovered the cardinal’s secret,
                    unmasked him so well, that the prince agreed to a private negotiation with the
                    malcontents, requiring nothing more than the coadjutor’s leaving Paris, but with
                    the rank of ambassador to Rome or Vienna. That prelate would have consented to
                    this to satisfy Condé, if Mazarin, some days afterwards, had not given him the
                    choice of any recompense, in order to engage his concurrence in the prince’s
                    destruction. Master of the queen’s mind, which he guided as he pleased, and sure
                    of having inflamed against Condé the resentment of the malcontents, he sought
                    and obtained, by means of the Duchess of Chevreuse, the support of that powerful
                    faction, which connected itself the more readily with him, in the hope that the
                    prince’s fall would soon enable it without difficulty to crush the cardinal
                    himself. The coadjutor had private conferences with the queen and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194749911" xml:id="kp-eb0707-9911-0203"/>the minister. Condé had
                    notice of it, and in order to dis- ' cover if it were true, he endeavoured to
                    extort by surprise an admission from Mazarin’s own mouth. “Cardinal,” said he
                    one day, “it is publicly reported that you have nightly meetings with the
                    coadjutor, disguised like a trooper,” accompanying this speech with a quick and
                    penetrating look. But the cardinal, who was a perfect master of dissimulation,
                    answered him in such a free and apparently artless manner, that he entirely
                    removed Conde’s apprehensions; and the latter slighted the information he had
                    received of the plot forming against him. Mazarin wanted nothing but the support
                    of the Duke of Orleans, and at last found means, through the Duchess of
                    Chevreuse, to inflame the jealousy of that fickle and inconstant prince, and to
                    engage him to consent to the imprisonment of Condé. And having thus united all
                    parties, and fearing no other obstacle, this ungrateful and perfidious minister
                    made preparations for privately arresting the prince, the order for which was
                    signed on the 18th January 1650. Condé having that day repaired as usual to the
                    Palais Royal, to assist at council with the Prince of Conti and the Duke of
                    Longueville, the queen gave orders to arrest all the three, and to convey them
                    without any noise to the castle of Vincennes. She was instantly obeyed, and the
                    princes were strictly guarded in that prison.</p>
                <p>In this unexpected reverse of fortune, the fortitude and greatness of Conde’s
                    mind were remarkable. Confined with the two other princes in the tower of
                    Vincennes, where neither supper, furniture, nor beds were provided, he contented
                    himself with two new laid eggs, and threw himself, in his clothes, on a truss of
                    straw, where he slept twelve hours without waking. He still retained his
                    cheerfulness, and dedicated the greater part of his time to reading, and the
                    rest to conversation, playing at battledoor and shuttle-cock, to bodily
                    exercises, and the cultivation of flowers.</p>
                <p>Mazarin triumphed in the disgrace of the princes, proscribed all those who were
                    attached to Condé, and behaved in the most insolent and arbitrary manner
                    possible. The prince’s friends, however, notwithstanding their being striefly
                    watched, found means to keep up a regular correspondence with him, and made
                    various attempts to release him. In particular, troops were raised by the Dukes
                    of Bouillon and Rochefoucault, and the Viscount de Turenne; and the Princess of
                    Condé engaged the province of Guienne to declare in his favour. But all those
                    efforts would, perhaps, have been ineffectual, if other and more powerful
                    resources had not been employed.</p>
                <p>In that gallant and warlike age, every thing was managed by the intrigues of five
                    or six women, who possessed the confidence of the leaders of the state, and of
                    the various parties. The Princess of Mantua, wife to one of the sons of the
                    Elector Palatine, king of Bohemia, who principally directed the counsels in the
                    party of the princes, found means to reconcile the Duke of Orleans, the
                    coadjutor, and the malcontents, with the friends of the prince, and all united
                    their efforts against the cardinal; while the parliament, on the other side,
                    loudly demanded the release of the prisoners. The different orders of the state
                    also united in soliciting it, insomuch that the queen was at last prevailed on
                    to give her consent. At this news Mazarin was so confounded that he fled in the
                    disguise of a trooper, and arrived at the gates of Richelieu, where a body of
                    horse waited for him. The parliament, informed by the king of his flight,
                    thundered forth an arrêt, by which he was obliged to leave the kingdom, with his
                    family and foreign servants, in the space of fifteen days, under the penalty of
                    being exposed to a criminal prosecution. The queen desired to follow him with
                    the king; but the nobles and burghers invested the Palais Royal, and prevented
                    the execution of this project, which would have kindled a civil war. Mazarin,
                    therefore, perceiving that it was impossible for the queen to join him,
                    determined to go himself to restore the princes to their liberty, and to get the
                    start of the deputies who were coming to acquaint them with their release. On
                    his arrival at Havre, he informed the princes that they were free, entreated
                    Conde’s friendship, and was so abject as to prostrate himself at the feet of the
                    man whom he had so basely oppressed. Condé gave him a polite reception, and
                    spoke to him in a free and cheerful tone; but, tired with the mean submissions
                    which the cardinal lavished upon him, left his eminence without making any
                    promise, and set out on his return to Paris, which he entered as it were in
                    triumph, amidst the acclamations of all’orders of men, and the demonstrations of
                    a most sincere and general joy.</p>
                <p>After this a civil war ensued, in which the Prince of Condé sided with the
                    malcontents. Being pressed by the king’s army, he retired into the faubourg of
                    St Antoine, where he behaved with the utmost bravery; upon which the citizens
                    opened their gates and received him, and a peace soon afterwards ensued. His
                    hatred of the cardinal, however, induced him to quit Paris, and take refuge
                    among the Spaniards, who made him generalissimo of their forces; and he captured
                    Rocroi. But the peace of the Pyrenees restored him to his country; and he again
                    signalized himself at the head of the king’s armies. Being afflicted with gout,
                    he refused the command of the army in 1676, and retired to Chantilly, where he
                    was as much esteemed for the virtues of peace as he had before been for his
                    military talents. He diedin 1686, at Fontainbleau.</p>
