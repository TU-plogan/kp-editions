                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Among</hi> the various schemes devised for checking the
                    progress of pauperism in England, and for augmenting the comfort and happiness
                    of the lower classes, few seem to have obtained a greater degree of popularity,
                    or to be more generally patronised, than the <hi rend="smallcaps">cottage
                    system</hi>;—that system which proposes, under certain restrictions, to furnish
                    the industrious poor with cottages and small pieces of land, to be used for the
                    purpose of keeping kine, raising potatoes, or for some other species of
                    husbandry.</p>
                <p>It is not our intention to detail the various peculiarities of the plans of
                    different authors by whom the efficacy of the cottage system has been
                    maintained. We shall content ourselves with examining the fundamental principles
                    on which the whole scheme is founded; and, in so doing, we shall endeavour to
                    resolve the important question, whether the more minute division of landed
                    property, and the letting of small farms and patches of ground, to any
                    considerable portion of the lower classes, would tend to improve their condition
                    and character, and to reduce the sum total of human misery.</p>
                <p>As the effects of the cottage or small farming system on the condition of the
                    poor must, in a great measure, depend on the fact of its tending to increase or
                    diminish the exchangeable value of raw produce, it will be necessary, first of
                    all, to inquire into its probable operation in this respect. If it should tend
                    to reduce the price of corn, cattle, &amp;c. or to render their acquisition less
                    difficult, that would be a strong presumption in its favour. But, on the other
                    hand, if it should tend to raise the price of these articles of provision, or to
                    make them exchange for a greater quantity of labour, its introduction would
                    obviously be prejudicial to the community', and especially to the labouring
                    classes.</p>
                <p>We have already endeavoured to show that the price of. raw produce has a natural
                    tendency to rise as society ad- <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> vances, and as a
                    country becomes more populous. <hi rend="italic">(Prin∙' ciples of the Corn
                    Laws.}</hi> The best lands being first brought under cultivation, recourse is
                    afterwards had to* those which are inferior, and require a greater quantity <hi
                    rend="subscript"> c</hi> of labour to make them yield the same produce. The <hi
                    rend="italic">reali</hi> price of this produce, which is always regulated by the
                    quantity of labour necessary to its production, is therefore increased; and it
                    exchanges for a greater portion of those commodities the production of which has
                    not also become more difficult.</p>
                <p>Had the inventive genius of man been limited in its powers; had the ploughs,
                    harrows, and other machinesand implements used in agriculture, at once attained
                    their utmost degree of perfection, and remained ever after in the same state;
                    the rise in the price of raw produce consequent to the increase of population
                    would have been much more obvious. λVhen in such a state of things it became
                    necessary to resort to poorer soils in order to raise additional quantities of
                    food, a corresponding increase of <hi rend="italic">manual labour</hi> would
                    have been required. On this hypothesis no improvement could have taken place in
                    the powers of the labourer himself. Having already reached the perfection of his
                    art, a greater degree of animal exertion could alone have overcome fresh
                    obstacles. More labour would have been necessary to the production of a greater
                    quantity of food; and it would have been necessary in the precise proportion
                    according to which the quantity <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752303"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2303-0387"/>was increased. Thus, supposing the labour of <hi
                    rend="italic">ten</hi> men to have been required, during a given number of days,
                    to produce <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> quarters of wheat, from land of a certain
                    quality,—when <hi rend="italic">fifteen</hi> quarters were produced in the same
                    time and from the same land, <hi rend="italic">fifteen</hi> hands must have been
                    employed in its production. The effects of improved machinery, and of a better
                    system of manuring and cropping, are here supposed to be entirely out of the
                    question. Had the arts continued in this stationary state, the price of raw
                    produce must obviously have varied directly with every variation in the quality
                    of the soils successively brought under cultivation.</p>
                <p>But in an improving society, the circumstances which regulate the real and
                    exchangeable values of raw produce are extremely different. Here, too, it has
                    doubtless a constant tendency to rise; for notwithstanding that every successive
                    improvement in agriculture, and every new device by which labour may be saved,
                    and the energies and powers ofmachinery augmen ted, operate to lower
                    prices,—still the rise of profits, and the consequent stimulus given to
                    population, by every fall in the price of raw produce, increase the demand, and
                    again raise prices, by forcing the cultivation of poorer soils. But this rise is
                    rendered much less perceptible than it would be in a stationary state of
                    society. After inferior soils have been brought under cultivation, more
                    labourers may be required to raise the same quantities of food; but as the
                    powers of the labourers are augmented, a smaller number is required, in
                    proportion to the work to be performed, than if no such improvement had taken
                    place. It is in this way that the tendency to an increase in the price of raw
                    produce is counteracted in the progress of society. The productive energies of
                    the earth itself gradually diminish, and we are compelled to resort to soils of
                    a constantly-decreasing degree of fertility; but the productive energy of the
                    labour employed to extract produce from these soils is as constantly improved.
                    Two directly opposite and continually-acting principles are thus set in motion.
                    From the operation of the causes to which we have alluded, the increasing
                    sterility of the soil is sure, in the long run, to overmatch the increasing
                    power of machinery and the improvements of agriculture, so that prices
                    experience a corresponding rise. Occasionally, however, meliorations in the
                    latter more than compensate, during lengthened periods, for any deterioration in
                    the quality of the former, and a fall of prices is the consequence. Should an
                    equilibrium take place, and the opposite principles exactly counterpoise each
                    other, prices would remain stationary.</p>
                <p>Had the whole surface of the earth been originally of the same degree of
                    fertility, and had <hi rend="italic">the same outlay of capital and labour
                    always continued to yield the same amount of raw j&gt;roduce,</hi> the effects
                    of improved machinery and agriculture in reducing prices would have been quite
                    obvious. If such had been the case, raw produce must have invariably <hi
                    rend="italic">fallen</hi> in value as society advanced. There would have been
                    nothing to counteract the effects of improvements. The quantity of labour
                    required for the production of all sorts of commodities would, by reason of
                    improvements in machinery and the arts, have been almost always diminishing; and
                    of course their real price would have been as constantly on the decline.</p>
                <p>It results, as a consequence of these principles, that any constitution of
                    society, or any method of dividing landed property, which should operate to
                    counteract t∙he spirit of improvement, or which should prevent agriculturists
                    from adopting the most efficacious methods for saving labour and expense in
                    carrying on their business, would be materially injurious.</p>
                <p>The rate of profit, and consequently the power to accumulate capital and
                    population, is ultimately regulated by the price of farm produce. If its price
                    be relatively low, that is, if it be easily produced, a comparatively small
                    outlay of labour will suffice to obtain a large quantity of produce. If, in a
                    country thus situated, property be protected, and full scope be given to
                    accumulation, wealth will rapidly increase. Where labour is mpre than ordinarily
                    productive, the labourer receives a large share of the produce of his exertions,
                    at the same time that a large net profit remains to his employer. In America,
                    labour is extremely well rewarded, but the profits of stock are,
                    notwithstanding, muclι higher than in Europe. The choice of immense tracts of
                    fertile and unoccupied land relieves the farmers of the United States from the
                    necessity of cultivating any but the richest soils. The wants of the country can
                    be supplied without having recourse to lands of an inferior quality; and
                    although the wages of workmen are comparatively high, yet, as their labour is
                    proportionally productive, capitalists realize a corresponding and ample
                    profit.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of raising sufficient supplies of corn is the principal cause why
                    old-settled and densely-peopled countries advance slowly in the accumulation of
                    capital and riches, and why the profits of stock in them are comparatively low.
                    Were it not, however, for the improvements which are constantly making in
                    agriculture, this difficulty would be greatly increased. ∙ These, by enabling
                    the increasing sterility of the soil to be partially overcome, reduce the cost
                    of production, or the real price of food; and by this means the rate of profit,
                    and consequently the power to accumulate wealth and population, is prevented
                    from falling so low as it would do in a society where no improvements were
                    made.</p>
                <p>Now this, we apprehend, must be the situation of every country in which a minute
                    division of landed property, or an extended cottage system, has been introduced.
                    The produce of a small farm of five, ten, or even twenty acres, may perhaps
                    enable its occupier to preserve his family from downright starvation, but it
                    will never enable him to accumulate stock to any extent. “Where,” asks Mi-Young,
                    “is the little farmer to be found who will cover his whole farm with marl at the
                    rate of 100 or 150 tons per acre? who will drain all his land at the expense of
                    two or three pounds an acre? who will pay a heavy price for the manure of towns,
                    and convey it thirty miles by land carriage? who will float his meadows at the
                    expense of L.5 per acre? who, to improve the breed of his sheep, will give 1000
                    guineas for the use of a single ram for à single season? who will send across
                    the kingdom to distant provinces for new implements, and for men to use them?
                    who employ and pay men for residing in provinces where practices are found which
                    they want to introduce into their farms? At the very mention of such exertions,
                    common in England, what mind can be so perversely framed as to imagine, for a
                    single moment, that <hi rend="smallcaps">such things</hi> are to be effected by
                    <hi rend="italic">little farmers? Deduct from agriculture</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">all</hi><hi rend="italic">the practices that have made it
                    flourishing in this island, and you have precisely the management of small
                    farms” ( Travels in France,</hi> 2d edition, vol. i. p. 410.) Besides, though it
                    were admitted that small farmers might accumulate capital, they could not apply
                    it in the most efficient manner. “The division of labour which, in every pursuit
                    of industry, gives skill and dispatch, cannot take place on the greatest farms
                    in the degree in which it is found in manufactures; but upon small farms it does
                    not take place at all. The same man by turns applies to every work of the farm;
                    upon the larger occupation there are ploughmen, thrashers, hedgers, shepherds,
                    cow-herds, ox-herds, limeburners, drainers, &amp;c. This circumstance s of
                    considerable importance, and decides that every work will be better performed on
                    a large <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752316" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2316-0388"/>than
                    on a small farm. One of the greatest engines of good farming, a sheep-fold, is
                    either to be found on a large farm only, or at an expense of labour which
                    destroys the profit.” <hi rend="italic">(Travels in France,</hi> vol. I. p.
                    409.)</p>
                <p>Neither could a small farmer use any but the simplest machines, and he must, in a
                    great measure, be prevented from availing himself of the powers of the lower
                    animals. An Irish cottager cannot employ either a thrashing-machine or a horse.
                    Manual labour is his only engine for extracting produce from the earth. He
                    cannot avail himself of natural agents, nor render them subservient to the great
                    work of production. Those improvements which, in countries where capital is
                    accumulating in masses, are every day rendered more efficient, and tend
                    materially to reduce the price of raw produce, and to render the necessaries of
                    life attainable by less labour, are altogether incompatible with a minute
                    division of landed property. The additional supplies of food required in a
                    kingdom divided into small occupancies cannot be produced without a proportional
                    increase of manual labour; so that raw produce rises in price with every
                    increase of population, or as soon as it becomes necessary to cultivate inferior
                    soils. There is, in this case, nothing left to counteract increasing sterility.
                    It is neither cheeked by improved machinery, nor by any expedients for saving
                    labour. But, being allowed to exert its full effect, society very soon becomes
                    clogged in its progress; and its future advancement is rendered extremely
                    problematical.</p>
                <p>This, we conceive, constitutes a fundamental objection to every attempt to
                    introduce a plan for dividing landed property into minute portions; for surely
                    nothing can be more preposterously absurd than to think of relieving the
                    hardships and distresses of the poor by recommending the adoption of a scheme
                    which would infallibly tend to raise the price of the principal necessaries of
                    life.</p>
                <p>But a minute division of landed property is not merely disadvantageous from its
                    having a tendency to raise the price of raw produce, by preventing the most
                    advantageous distribution of capital and labour; it must also exercise a
                    powerful effect on manufactured commodities, and, by increasing the cost of
                    their production, contribute to enhance their real price.</p>
                <p>In a country like England, where an improved system of husbandry is generally
                    introduced, where farms are extensive, and where improved machinery is employed
                    in agricultural operations, a comparatively small proportion of the inhabitants
                    are engaged in the cultivation of the soil. The rest are employed in
                    manufacturing, in carrying the products of the different districts of the
                    kingdom to where they are in the greatest demand, and in exchanging them for the
                    products of other countries. Farmers do not spend their time in clumsy attempts
                    to manufacture their own produce; and manufacturers cease to interest themselves
                    about the raising of corn and the fattening of cattle. Every class bestows its
                    undivided attention on some particular department of industry. Labour is
                    economized, and it is also perseveringly and judiciously applied. Agriculturists
                    raise the largest crops, because they can readily exchange them for other
                    commodities conducive to their comforts and enjoyments; whilst manufacturers and
                    merchants are stimulated to increase the quantity and to improve the quality of
                    their articles, that they may thereby command a greater quantity of raw produce.
                    As valuable or desirable objects are multiplied, greater efforts are made to
                    procure them. A spirit of industry, and a desire to rise in the world, are
                    universally diffused, and the apathy and languor which are natural to a
                    stationary state of society are scarcely known.</p>
                <p>“It is,” says Dr Smith, “the great multiplication of the productions of the
                    different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a
                    well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the
                    lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work
                    to dispose of, beyond what lie himself has occasion for; and every other workman
                    being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity
                    of his own goods for a great quanti ty, or, what comes to the same thing, for
                    the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what
                    they have occasion for; and they accommodate him as amply with what he has
                    occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different
                    ranks of society.”</p>
                <p>But if a country were generally divided info small farms, these effects could
                    only take place in a very limited extent. Where a great proportion of the
                    inhabitants is directly supported by the produce of the soil, it is obvious that
                    there must be less of it to support others. Small farmers have it not in their
                    power to purchase any considerable quantity of manufactured goods; nor, where
                    these abound, are manufacturers able to purchase a large share of the produce of
                    the soil. Neither capital nor labour can, in such circumstances, be employed in
                    the most advantageous manner; and that division of labour, to the influence of
                    which the greater part of the improvement of society may be justly ascribed, can
                    only be partially introduced. A considerable portion of the coarser sorts of
                    manufactured commodities would, in a country so occupied, be prepared at home,
                    though at a much greater expense; for the small surplus of agricultural produce
                    that would remain, after satisfying the wants of the cultivators, would be
                    barely sufficient to procure such necessaries as could not be procured by the
                    rude efforts of agricultural labourers. Being obliged to engage by turns in
                    every different employment, workmen would be prevented from acquiring a proper
                    degree of dexterity in any.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“In Ireland, the minute division of land, and the manner in which the
                    inhabitants are scattered over the country, render it necessary for labour of
                    various kinds to be. combined in the same individual; and thus each family
                    becomes the manufacturers of their own clothing, and of every thing else which
                    they use. Most of tliç raw materials being supplied either by their flocks, or
                    the produce of their land, they are better able to continue this system, and to
                    dispense with the use of articles imported or made by regular workmen. In arts

                    while the same system exists, no taste can be excited for a superior mode of
                    life, nor will much encouragement be given to the establishment of
                    manufactories. Except in the cotton branches, and in the curing of provisions,
                    this pernicious system is everywhere observed; it pervades all ranks, from the
                    nobleman, who makes his own candles, cultivates his own patch of flax, and has
                    it spun by his servants, to the cotter, whose wife and daughters spin and
                    manufacture the frieze and woollen stuffs which serve them as clothing.”

                    expended on a commodity that its exchangeable value is regulated, it is obvious
                    that, where there is a minute division of landed property, not only the price of
                    corn, but also that of all sorts of manufactured commodities, would be
                    increased. Labour would become less powerful in producing or in procuring them;
                    and the situation of the great body of the people, who have only labour to
                    barter for commodities, would be rendered comparatively wretched. No one would
                    have any, or but very little surplus produce to dispose of; and instead of
                    general opulence, we should meet with nothing but universal poverty. “The
                    tendency of such a system,” says an intelligent writer who had carefully
                    observed its effects, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">is to

                <p>It deserves to be mentioned, that a minute division of landed property, by
                    preventing the extension and improvement of manufacturing industry, renders the
                    occupiers of land almost entirely dependent on its proprietors. Those farmers
                    who incur the displeasure of their landlords are unable to betake themselves to
                    another employment, and are obliged to submit to every species of indignity. The
                    state of society during the middle ages approached, in some respects, very
                    nearly to this; and it should be remembered, that the division of labour, and
                    the extension of commerce and manufactures, has been even more beneficial, from
                    its having effected the abolition of villenage, and removed the grinding
                    oppression of feudal tyranny, than from its having multiplied the comforts and
                    conveni-encies of life. Nor is it less certain that every discovery of a new
                    channel in which industry may be advantageously employed, affords an additional
                    guarantee for the enjoyment of personal freedom and independence. By enlarging
                    the field of exertion, and adding to the means of acquiring an independent
                    livelihood, whilst it increases the comforts of every individual, it also
                    renders them less liable to be affected by derangements in any particular branch
                    of business, or by the partialities and caprices of those in authority.</p>
                <p>It is impossible that the prizes in the lottery of human life can be too much
                    multiplied. The greater the variety of ways by which men may rise to eminence,
                    the more vigorous will be the efforts to rise. Where full scope is given to the
                    accumulation of property, all individuals, even those in the humblest walks of
                    life, arc cheered with the idea that, by industry and economy, they' may better
                    their situation, emerge from obscurity, and acquire opulence. But in an
                    essentially agricultural society', where the greater part of the population is
                    directly engaged in the culture of the soil, there is but little variety of
                    condition. In such countries capital cannot be accumulated; great cities cannot
                    exist; and the liberal arts and professions, which chiefly depend on them for
                    protection and support, and to which they owe their birth, are neither
                    patronised nor indulged in. It is not to be imagined that cultivators,
                    engrossed, as small farmers must constantly be, with the thoughts of providing
                    for their present wants, can pay any attention to schemes of general or
                    prospective improvement. Such men have no sufficient motive to stimulate them to
                    exertion; and a perpetual sameness, like that of China, or at most a nearly
                    imperceptible progress, is all that can be expected amongst them, and it is all
                    that ever will take place. It is only in countries like America or England that
                    the energies of man, as well as the powers of the soil, are developed to their
                    full extent. There, while the diversity' of the objects of pursuit gives ample
                    room for gratifying the diversity of dispositions, the applause consequent on
                    any invention that either extends the power of man over the physical world, or
                    enlarges his intellectual faculties, perpetuates the discoveries made and the
                    spirit which makes them.</p>
                <p>Most of the misconceptions and erroneous opinions to be met with respecting the
                    cottage system appear to have originated in hasty and premature attempts at
                    generalization, founded on a few limited observations of its local effects. But
                    first appearances are, in this case especially, the most fallacious. The effects
                    observed to result from the partial granting of cottages, furnish no clue by
                    which to trace the ultimate consequences of the system. On the contrary, they
                    are eminently calculated to mislead. Were cottages, with small pieces of ground
                    attached to each, let at a moderate rent to a few of the most industrious
                    labourers in the best cultivated districts of Great Britain, there can be no
                    doubt that the situation of those individuals would, in the first instance, be
                    ameliorated. They would acquire these possessions with previously-formed habits
                    of industry and economy. When their own little farm did not require their
                    exertions, they would be able to find employment in the more extensive farms in
                    their vicinity; and might in this way procure the ploughs, harrows, and carts of
                    their neighbours to assist them in their operations. Such men would be employed
                    with nearly as much effect as they would have been had they continued as farm
                    servants on estates managed in the first style. It is even probable that their
                    exertions would, in the first instance, be rather increased, inasmuch as a part
                    of the labour necessary for the cultivation of the small farm would be executed
                    at extra hours, after the ordinary day’s labour was performed.</p>
                <p>But the truth of this statement is nowise inconsistent with the principles which
                    we have been endeavouring to establish. The <hi rend="italic">ultimate</hi> and
                    necessary consequences of a minute division of landed property deserve to be as
                    much attended to as those which arc immediate and transitory only.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> place, it is extremely probable that the
                    small farmers would, at no distant period, become disgusted with the life of
                    laborious exertion which they had formerly led. It is natural to suppose, that,
                    having become comparatively independent, and not being under the necessity of
                    constantly employing themselves, occasional intervals of relaxation would take
                    place. A cottager, however small his possession, has some species of produce to
                    dispose of. This leads to a habit of going to market, where much precious time
                    is lost in the adjustment of trifling bargains. “Nothing,” as Mr Young has
                    justly remarked, “can be more absurd than a strong hearty man walking some
                    miles, and losing a day’s work, in order to sell a dozen of eggs or a chicken,
                    the value of which would not be equal to the labour of conveying it if he were
                    properly employed.” Such habits, too, are almost sure to lead to dissipation.
                    The small farmer must have his porter and his gin as well as the extensive
                    farmer. It is the want of time and opportunity, still more than the want of
                    money, that prevents a hired labourer from apeing the conduct of his employers.
                    The circumstances, too, which distinguish a farm-servant from a farmer, are much
                    better defined, and more easily appreciated, than those which distinguish a
                    small farmer from an extensive one. The latter are both placed, if we may use
                    the expression, in the same caste; and hence the extravagances of the small
                    farmer, though equally hurtful to himself and his family with those of a
                    labourer, are less an object of animadversion in the neighbourhood. They clash
                    less with popular prejudices and received opinions; and there is, therefore, a
                    greater probability of their being more indulged in.</p>
                <p>If these consequences of the introduction of small farms should not become
                    obvious in the lifetime of the first occupiers, they would certainly discover
                    themselves in that of their successors. Not having undergone the same rigid
                    training as their fathers, the views and habits of the two races would be
                    essentially different. And the character of the industrious labourer, which had
                    predominated in the first, would, in the second, give place to that of the
                    half-employed, petty farmer.</p>
                <p>But, in the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> place, it is obvious that the
                    beneficial effects observed to follow the first introduction of small farms
                    depend almost entirely on their occupiers having it in their power to employ'
                    themselves at other work when their labour is not required at home. Now, with a
                    generally extended cottage system, this could not be the case. Where <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> farms are small, none would require the labour of extra
                    hands, noι∙ would they afford their own <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752342"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2342-0390"/>possessors constant employment, except, perhaps,
                    during seed-time and harvest. Nor is it to be imagined that the leisure of a
                    poor cottager has any thing in common with that of an extensive farmer or
                    capitalist. The cottager is inactive, not because be has realized funds adequate
                    for his support, but because no exertions can better his condition, and because
                    there is no demand for his labour. No man, it should be recollected, loves
                    exertion or industry for its own sake. All have some end or object in view, the
                    accomplishment of which is to compensate for the toils and privations to which
                    they at present submit. But a small farmer is almost entirely cut off from the
                    expectation of rising in society. No person possessed of capital would ever
                    think of embarking in such a hopeless concern; and after supporting a family, no
                    small farmer, originally without capital, is ever able to accumulate any. As it
                    is impossible for him to escape from poverty, the cottager naturally becomes
                    indolent and careless. His opinions of∙what is necessary to his comfortable
                    subsistence are degraded, and he ultimately sinks into a state of sluggish or
                    stupid indifference.</p>
                <p>That this is a fair picture of the state of society in every country in which
                    landed property is divided into minute portions, is abundantly certain. But we
                    have no occasion to go from home to seek for an exemplification of its effects.
                    We have only to turn to Ireland. There the cottage system has been submitted to
                    the test of experiment, and it is proper that the result should be generally
                    known.</p>
                <p>In our inquiry into the principles of the corn laws, we endeavoured to show that
                    the granting of high bounties on the exportation of corn from Ireland, in 1780
                    and 1784, contributed to the extension of tillage, and to the breaking up of the
                    pasture grounds in that kingdom. But the want of capital^ and the consequent
                    impossibility of procuring tenants capable of taking large farms, obliged the
                    proprietors to divide their lands into small portions. Large tracts of old grass
                    land were ploughed up, and let in farms of from ten to twenty acres; and in this
                    way the stimulus, intended to act as an incitement to agricultural improvement,
                    has had a much more powerful effect in causing the subdivision of farms, and in
                    increasing the agricultural population of the country.</p>
                <p>Mr Newenham’s authority is decisive as to this fact. “Large farms,” he informs
                    us, “of from 500 to 1500 and 2000 acres, once so common in Ireland, hold
                    actually no sort of proportion to farms of from ten to thirty or forty acres. In
                    the county of Down, Mr Dubordieu says that farms run from twenty to forty,
                    fifty, and in some instances as far as a hundred acres. Such is the case in most
                    other parts of Ireland. For several years past the landlords of that county have
                    been much in the habit of letting their lands in small divisions. Besides this,
                    the cottier system, or the giving a certain quantity of land as an equivalent
                    for wages, prevails throughout most parts of Ireland. In fact, upwards of four
                    fifths of the Irish people are subsisted chiefly on the produce of the land
                    which they hold.” <hi rend="italic">(Inquiry intodhe Population of Ireland,</hi>
                    p. 270.)</p>
                <p>Every part of Mr Wakefield’s work on Ireland abounds with interesting information
                    respecting the effects of this minute division of landed property. Our limits,
                    however, will only permit our extracting the following passages.</p>
                <p>When noticing the state of landed property in Kerry, Mr Wakefield observes: “Few
                    persons here occupy such a quantity of land as to oblige them to employ a
                    labourer; it is not, therefore, customary for people to go from their own homes
                    to work, and, indeed, none but those who have taken very dear farms, and
                    experience the necessity of procuring a little ready money, ever think of it.
                    This system, Considered in a public point of view, strikes me as being
                    exceedingly injurious. A country occupied by inhabitants whose ambition is so
                    limited that they have no desire to push their industry beyond that indolent
                    exertion which procures them the bare necessaries of life, inust remain without

                    ended. The existence, however, of these wretched beings depends entirely on the
                    season; for if their potato crop fails, they are in danger of being starved.
                    This mode of life, instead of elevating the moral faculties in the slightest
                    degree, tends only to depress and degrade thetn. It becomes the parent of
                    idleness, the worst evil that can afflict human nature; and that habit, if it
                    spreads or becomes general, must lead to national poverty, and even want, with
                    its concomitants, vice and misery.” <hi rend="italic">(Account of Ireland,</hi>

                <p>“In Fermanagh,” says he, “whether it arises from habit, or a natural propensity
                    to indolence, the people do net rise until a late hour in the morning, and the
                    cows are not milked till noon. There being but a poor market for the produce of
                    the earth, little encouragement is afforded to industry; they therefore seldom
                    think of turning their time to the best advantage.” <hi rend="italic">(Account

                <p>In his chapter on rural economy, Mr Wakefield makes the following observations:
                    “The Irish cottier’s only anxiety is, that the butter and the pig sold, and the
                    labour given to his landlord, may be equal in value to the payment which he has
                    to make. When satisfied on this head, his mind is at rest; he has no further
                    wants, and neither he nor his family consider labour as of any importance to
                    their happiness. His potatoes are left in the ground till the commencement of
                    frost makes him apprehend that his food may be locked up in the earth; and
                    though very great inconvenience has been occasioned by this negligence, the
                    repeated experiment of the bad result arising from it has not yet been able to
                    induce the peasantry of Ireland to adopt a better method. It is very common to
                    hear persons of higher rank observe, when a very early frost takes place, that ‘
                    it is a fortunate event, as it will oblige the <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> to
                    dig up their potatoes’ <hi rend="italic">(for the</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>It is not necessary to quote authorities to prove the miserable state of the
                    hovels in which the cottagers reside. Notwithstanding his prejudices in their
                    favour, Mr Newenham admits “that a <hi rend="italic">bedstead</hi> is a luxury
                    which a great majority of the Irish labouring poor are strangers to. And as for
                    clocks, warming-pans, frying-pans, tea-kettles, cups and saucers, &amp;c. which
                    we find in every cottage here, I believe it is unnecessary to say that they <hi
                    rend="italic">never</hi> constitute a part of the poor Irishman’s furniture.”
                    <hi rend="italic">(Inquiryrespecting the Population of Ireland,</hi> p.

                <p>We shall close these statements with an extract from Mr Curwen’s work on Ireland.
                    That experienced agriculturist travelled through the greater part of it in 1813,
                    and, after having carefully inquired into the condition of the small farmers and
                    cottagers, gave the result of his investigation in the following terms: “The
                    size of farms, from fifteen to thirty acres, would give an average of about
                    twenty-two or twenty-three acres to each. Portions of these arc again sublet to
                    cottiers, whose rents are paid by labour done for the tenants, from whom they
                    sometimes receive milk and some other necessaries. These running accounts are an
                    endless source of dissatisfaction, of dispute, and of contention, at the
                    quarter-sessions. In some <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752355"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2355-0391"/>of the more populous parts of Ireland there is
                    supposed to be an inhabitant for every aere, while the cultivation of the soil,
                    as now practised, does not afford employment for a third of that population. In
                    the north, where the linen trade has been established, the lower classes are
                    weavers, which gives them a great superiority over the southern districts. The
                    labour on the highways and great roads, for which such large assessments are
                    made on the counties, afford, for a portion of the year, a great source of
                    employment.</p>
                <p>“The minute subdivision of lands among these occupants is attended with many
                    serious evils. The rents of these sublet parcels, become so high to the actual
                    cultivators as to preclude all profitable returns from their labour, lt affords
                    too great a facility to marriage. The population becomes increased beyond the
                    capital of the country employed in husbandry; and the supernumerary individuals
                    are compelled to subsist on the produce of others’ labour, to which they have no
                    power of contributing. The aggregate number of horses is greater than would be
                    required if the estates were distributed into moderately sized farms; while the
                    want of farming buildings, besides other disadvantages, prevents the
                    accumulation of manure.</p>
                <p>“The labourers, with few exceptions, are all married. The farmers have no hired
                    servants of either sex residing in their dwellings; this is another serious evil
                    arising out of small farms. Ireland, which in extent is nearly equal to one half
                    of Great Britain, does not probably employ one tenth of the agricultural
                    servants.</p>
                <p>“The buildings on every farm being erected at the expense of the tenant, are
                    necessarily on the most limited scale, seldom more than a cabin, and this
                    insufficient for the children of the family beyond their earliest days. As the
                    children grow up, they are compelled to seek another establishment for
                    themselves, and to hazard every consequence that may ensue. Alternative they
                    have none. The interests of all parties suffer, and it would be for the
                    advantage of the whole community to promote a radical reform of the present
                    disreputable system.”</p>
                <p>Such are the ruinous effects produced by the small farming system. And such, too,
                    with some few exceptions, would be the effects of having a country parcelled out
                    into small <hi rend="smallcaps">freehold properties.</hi> A few words will be
                    sufficient to show the similarity of the cases.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First,</hi> It is obvious that the division of labour would be
                    quite as inapplicable in a country divided into small properties as in one
                    occupied by small farmers. The proprietor of ten, twenty, or fifty acres, can as
                    little afford to keep ploughmen, hedgers, thrashers, &amp;c. as the person who
                    holds them on lease. But whatever may be the capital of the occupier of a small
                    farm, its <hi rend="italic">size</hi> will not admit of its being farmed so as
                    to yield the largest quantity of produce with the least possible expenditure of
                    labour.</p>
                <p>It may be supposed, perhaps, that, in countries occupied entirely by proprietors,
                    raw produce may be sold at a cheaper rate than in those occupied by farmers,
                    who, in addition to the expense of labour, are burdened with the payment of
                    rent. This, however, is really not the ease. The price of raw produce, as well
                    as of manufactured commodities, is determined by the quantity of labour
                    necessary to its production. Rent, it has been demonstrated, does not enter into
                    price. Corn is not high because rent is paid, but rent is paid because corn is
                    high; and no reduction would take place in the price of corn although landlords
                    should relinquish the whole of their rent. Such a measuro would turn some
                    farmers into landlords, and some landlords into beggars; but it would not
                    diminish the quantity of labour necessary to raise corn on the least productive
                    land in cultivation; and it is this quantity which determines its price, and
                    consequently the price of the whole crop.</p>
                <p>Although, therefore, it cannot be doubted that the condition of the greater part
                    of the occupiers of land, in a country held by small proprietors, must, upon the
                    whole, be preferable to their condition in a country held by small farmers, the
                    condition of every other class would be unaffected. The price of corn is the
                    same whether it is raised by a small farmer or a small proprietor. Neither of
                    them is able to bring his produce to market upon the same reasonable terms as an
                    extensive farmer. The profits of stock would, therefore, be less than in
                    countries where agriculturists are in a situation to adopt every expedient by
                    which labour may be saved or rendered more efficient; and the power of the
                    society to accumulate wealth would be proportionally diminished.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> place, small properties, as well as small
                    farms, have a strong tendency to increase the agricultural population of a
                    country in a ratio far exceeding the demand. A property of forty or fifty acres
                    of good land might support a single family in tolerably easy circumstances; but
                    what is to become of the children? No country, it will be remembered, which is
                    divided into small occupancies, can ever furnish surplus produce sufficient,
                    after satisfying the wants of the cultivators, to feed a numerous body of
                    merchants, handicraftsmen, &amp;c.; nor would small occupiers have any demand
                    for the products or services of such persons. There could therefore be no demand
                    for that surplus population which an agriculturał society is always producing;
                    and the division of the paternal property would be the only way in which
                    families could be provided for. This, however, is only calculated to make bad
                    worse. Farms of forty or fifty acres are not inea-pableof pretty good
                    cultivation; but those of twenty or twenty-five, and still more of ten or twelve
                    acres, must be ill cultivated. But in essentially agricultural countries, such,
                    for example, as France, where the right of primogeniture is almost unknown, and
                    where property must be divided in nearly equal portions amongst all the children
                    of a family, properties can hardly fail to be reduced even below <hi
                    rend="italic">ten</hi> acres. They must, in fact, be perpetually lessening,
                    until, to use the words of Mr Young, when pointing out the pernicious effects of
                    this system in France, “you arrive at the limit beyond which the earth,
                    cultivate it as you please, will feed no more mouths; yet those simple manners,
                    which instigate to marriage, still continue. What then is the consequence, but
                    the most dreadful imaginable. By persevering in this system, you soon would
                    exceed the populousness of China, where the putrid carcasses of dogs, cats,
                    rats, and every species of filth and vermin, are sought with avidity, to sustain
                    the life of wretches who were born only to be starved. Small properties much
                    divided prove the greatest source of misery that can possibly be conceived; and
                    this has operated to such an extent and degree in France, that a law undoubtedly
                    ought to be passed, to render all division, below a certain number of arpents,
                    illegal.” <hi rend="italic">( Travels in France,</hi> vol. i. pp. 413, 414.)</p>
                <p>The condition of the agricultural classes in France has been materially
                    ameliorated since Mr Young visited that kingdom. The abolition of the feudal
                    privileges of the nobility and clergy, and of the gabelle, corvée, and other
                    grievously oppressive and partial burdens, would of itself have sufficed to make
                    the farmers and small proprietors more respectable and comfortable. A great part
                    too of the property of the church, and of the emigrants, came into their hands
                    at extremely low prices. By this means small properties were augmented, and
                    fresh energy was given to the agriculturists. Still, however, the extreme
                    division of landed property, wļfich, in consequence <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194752368" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2368-0392"/>of the law of equal
                    partition, is every day becoming more minute, and the consequent excess of the
                    rural population, form the prime evils in the soeial condition of the people of
                    France. “The population of that country,” says Mr Birkbeck, “seems to be
                    arranged thus :—A town depends for subsistence on the lands immediately around
                    it. The cultivators individually have not much to spare; because, as their
                    husbandry is a sort of <hi rend="italic">gardening,</hi> it requires a large
                    country population, and has, in proportion, less superfluity of produce. Thus is
                    formed a numerous but poor population. The cultivator receives payment of his
                    surplus produce in sous, and he expends only sous. The tradesman is on a par
                    with the farmer; as they receive so they expend; and thus 50,000 persons may
                    inhabit a district, with a town of 10,000 inhabitants in the centre of it,
                    bartering the superfluity of the country for the arts and manufactures of the
                    town: poor from generation to generation, and growing continually poorer as they
                    increase in numbers, in the country by the division and subdivision of property,
                    in the town by the division and subdivision of trades and professions. Such a
                    people, instead of proceeding from the necessaries to the comforts of life, and
                    then to the luxuries, as is the order of things in England, are rather
                    retrograde than progressive. There is no advancement in French society; no
                    improvement, nor hope of it.” <hi rend="italic">( Tour in Frances</hi> 4th edit.

                <p>It has been said, that property in land is of all others the most active
                    instigator to severe and incessant labour. This, however, is a very doubtful
                    proposition. It is true, that the exertions of a little proprietor are not
                    paralyzed by the apprehension of being turned out of his farm before he has
                    reaped the reward of his labours. But, on the other hand, his certainty of a
                    resource, his dependence on a small piece of ground from which he cannot be
                    ejected, and which will preserve him from absolute want, joined to the
                    impossibility of his rising in the world, foster indolent habits. A farmer can
                    never calculate with certainty on getting a renewal of his lease. Unless he has
                    accumulated some capital, he is always exposed to the risk of being thrown
                    destitute upon the world; but it is not so with the small proprietor. He relies
                    for support, not upon capital, but upon land. He is exempted from all chance of
                    being turned out of his possession; and he has not therefore the same powerful
                    motive to save and accumulate as the other. The small proprietors and farmers of
                    France, Mr Birkbeck informs us, “having absolutely no means of improving their
                    situation, submit to necessity, and pass their lives contentedly.” The same is
                    the case in Great Britain. “Throughout England there is no comparison between
                    the case of a day-labourer and of a little farmer; we have no people that work
                    so bard and fare so ill as the latter.” (Young’s <hi rend="italic">Travels in
                    France,</hi> vol. i. p. 415.) And those counties of Scotland, Kinross for
                    example, in which property is very much divided, are uniformly behind in their
                    agriculture, and are farmed in a very inferior style to those where estates are
                    more extensive.</p>
                <p>It is foreign to the object of this article to compare the moral and political
                    effects produced by the division of landed property into large and small
                    portions. We shall merely observe, that a needy population, but scantily
                    supplied with the necessaries, and enjoying very few of the comforts of life, is
                    not very likely to be imbued with a just sense, either of the dignity of man or
                    of his rights. An agricultural population, spread over a wide extent of country,
                    has no point of re-union. Men only feel their consequence; they only act in a
                    collective capacity, and with vigour and effect, after they have been condensed
                    into masses and collected in cities. It is comparatively easy to animate the
                    inhabitants of a large town with the same spirit; there is a sympathy in their
                    joys and in their sufferings; and the redress of an injury done to a single
                    individual becomes, in some measure, the business of the whole. But with
                    agriculturists the case is different; they may be trampled down piecemeal; they
                    cannot act collectively, and must, therefore, submit with less resistance to the
                    yoke of the oppressor. Of all the arguments in favour of a minute division of
                    landed property', that which supposes it should powerfully contribute to keep
                    alive a feeling of manly independence, seems the most futile and
                    preposterous.</p>
                <p>As a plan for relieving the distresses of the poor, the cottage system is perhaps
                    the very worst that can be devised. It should always be borne in mind, that
                    except in the case of maimed and impotent persons, there cannot, generally
                    speaking, be any poor in a country, that deserve to be relieved, unless the
                    population be redundant. As long as the supply of labour does not exceed the
                    demand, the whole industrious part of the community may be employed; none but
                    the idle and profligate can be without work, and the means of subsistence; and
                    it will not, we presume, be contended that cottages ought to be built for their
                    reception. In all cases, however, where the poverty and distress of the people
                    proceed from a redundancy of population,—and that is the case wherever
                    industrious persons are unable to procure wages sufficient to purchase the
                    ordinary necessaries and comforts of life —it would surely be most absurd to
                    attempt to improve their condition by introducing a system, which, whatever
                    might be its immediate effects, would lead to a still greater redundancy of
                    population. Now, this would most unquestionably be the consequence of the
                    introduction of the cottage system. A person who gets possession of a cottage
                    and a small piece of ground, finds himself in a situation to marry. Being no
                    longer dependent for mere subsistence on the good will of his employers, but
                    feeling, if not an increase of wealth, at least an increase of security against
                    want, the cottager is naturally stimulated to contract that engagement, into
                    which men are otherwise sufficiently prone to enter. A cottage could not indeed
                    be of any use to a single man. Either a wife or a female servant would be
                    required to superintend its domestic economy; and as a cottager could not afford
                    to pay wages, it is easy to perceive which of the two he would prefer.</p>
                <p>No person would think of attempting to relieve the distress occasioned by a bad
                    harvest, or by any sudden derangement of the affairs of the commercial world, by
                    proposing the adoption of a cottage system. The plan of granting cottages has
                    only been recommended in cases where a permanent difficulty has been experienced
                    in procuring employment. But in every such case the cure is worse than the
                    disease. Where the population is redundant,—and an industrious man can never be
                    long without employment from any other cause,—it should be our object not to
                    accelerate, but to retard the rate of its increase— not to increase, but to
                    diminish the number of cottages.</p>
                <p>Unluckily, we are not left to argue speculatively on these points, or to refer
                    for illustrations to France and Ireland. England furnishes examples both of the
                    advantage of throwing obstacles in the way of the erection of cottages, and of
                    the evils attending their too great multiplication<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194752381" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2381-0393"/>. Some of the latter had
                    manifested themselves at a very early period; and in the 31st of Elizabeth an
                    act was passed “for the avoiding of the great inconveniences which are found by
                    experience to grow, by the erecting and building of great numbers and multitudes
                    of cottages, which are daily more and more increased in many parts of this
                    realm.” To counteract the evil, it was enacted that in future no cottage should
                    be built, to which <hi rend="italic">four</hi> acres of land were not attached.
                    This statute contributed to check the increase of cottages; but we are clearly
                    of opinion that the poor-laws have opposed by far the most formidable obstacle
                    to their multiplication, and consequently to that of the agricultural
                    population. As soon as they were enacted, landlords and occupiers saw, that if,
                    by the erection of cottages, the splitting of farms, or otherwise, the
                    population upon their estates or occupancies was unduly augmented, they would be
                    burdened with the support of all who, from old age, sickness, want of
                    employment, or any other cause, might become at any future period unable to
                    provide for themselves. The wish to avoid incurring any such indefinite
                    responsibility not only rendered landlords and farmers exceedingly cautious
                    about admitting new settlers upon their estatesand farms, but stimulated them,
                    whenever the demand for labour was not pretty brisk and constant, to take
                    measures for diminishing the population, and for hindering its increase beyond
                    its proper level, by pulling down cottages, and preventing their being rebuilt.
                    The influence of this principle has been most powerful. In proof of this we
                    might refer to a host of authorities; but the following extract from a work of
                    Arthur Young, published in 1771, will probably be deemed sufficient: “One great
                    inducement to marriage is the finding without difficulty a comfortable
                    habitation; and another, nearly as material, when such requisite is found, to be
                    able to exercise in it whatever business a man has been educated to, or brought
                    up in. The first of these points is no easy matter to be accomplished; for it is
                    too much the interest of a parish, both landlords and tenants, to decrease the
                    cottages in it, and, above all, to prevent their increase, so that, in process
                    of time, habitations are extremely difficult to be procured. There is no parish
                    but had much rather that its young labourers would continue single; in that case
                    they are not in danger of becoming chargeable; but, when married, the case
                    alters: all obstructions are, therefore, thrown in the way of their marrying;
                    and none more immediately than rendering it as difficult as possible for the
                    men, when married, to procure a house to live in; and this conduct is found so
                    conducive to easing the rates, that it universally gives rise to an <hi
                    rend="italic">open war against cottages.</hi> How often do gentlemen who have
                    possessions in a parish, when cottages come to sale, purchase them, and
                    immediately raze them to the foundation, that they may never become the <hi
                    rend="italic">nests,</hi> as they are called, of <hi rend="italic">beggars
                    brats,</hi> by which means their tenants are not so burdened in their rates, and
                    their farms let better; for the rates are considered as much by tenants as the
                    rent. In this manner cottages are the perpetual objects of jealousy, the young
                    inhabitants arc prevented from marrying, and population is obstructed.” <hi

                    300-302.)</p>
                <p>We are inclined to think that the comparatively slow increase of the agricultural
                    population of England, down to thebeginning of last war, and the high wages
                    received by the labourers, are mainly attributable to the circumstances now
                    stated. But since the alteration of the poor-laws in 1795, the obstacles to the
                    increase of cottages have been to a considerable extent removed, at least in
                    some considerable districts in the south, and the inconveniences thence
                    resulting have been most striking. In several instances the parochial overseers
                    have agreed to pay the rents of the cottages occupied by paupers; and as the
                    assessment for the poor is not imposed on houses, but on the land according to
                    its value, the owners of small patches have, in many instances, been tempted to
                    cover them with cottages, to the great injury of the more extensive landowners
                    of the parish, who are in fact obliged to pay their rents. This system has had
                    the most pernicious operation. It has acted as an incentive to premature
                    marriages, and, in many districts, has increased the supply of labour much
                    beyond the demand. Some very interesting evidence upon this subject was given
                    before the Committee of the House of Commons on Emigration in 1826. A most
                    intelligent witness, Mr Hodges, Μ. P. for Kent, expressed himself as follows: “I
                    am quite satisfied that the erection of cottages has been a most serious evil
                    throughout the country; and I have been induced, acting on that conviction, to
                    concur with other cottage proprietors, who are going to take down from
                    twenty-six to thirty cottages as soon as the present occupants are out of them,
                    if they emigrate, as we think they will do; for it we leave the buildings
                    standing, <hi rend="italic">young persons of seventeen and eighteen years of
                    age, and even younger, would marry immediately, and thus the evd would
                    continue.” (Report,</hi> p. 136.) And in another place, Mr Hodges says, “Perhaps
                    I am taking a liberty in adverting to what I stated the other day; but without
                    an attention to the fact then disclosed, of the prodigious increase of cottages
                    of late years, all other regulations will be nugatory; and I cannot forbear
                    urging again, that this, or any similar measure, having for its object the
                    relief of parishes from their overpopulation, must of necessity become perfectly
                    useless, unless the act contain some regulations with respect to the erecting
                    and maintaining of cottages.” <hi rend="italic">(Report,</hi> p. 185.) The
                    evidence of other witnesses is precisely similar to this.</p>
                <p>In Yorkshire, and all the north of England, where the pernicious practice of
                    mixing up poor-rates and wages has not been introduced, cottages have not been
                    unduly increased, and the poor are comparatively prosperous. We do therefore
                    think that no time should be lost in bringing forward some legislative measure,
                    capable of checking the progress of the evil pointed out by Mr Hodges; and this
                    might be done either by making the owners of all cottages responsible for their
                    occupants, or by making the assessments to the poor proportional to the
                    population on the land as well as to its value. It is not to be endured, that
                    the proprietor of a few acres should be allowed, by covering them with cottages,
                    and letting them to occupants for whom there is no demand, to reduce the whole
                    labouring population of a parish to a state of pauperism, and to bring a heavy
                    burden on the owners of the land and other property, that he may put a few
                    pounds into his pocket. The longer we delay grappling with the evil, it will
                    become the more formidable, and the more difficult to put down. But either of
                    the measures now suggested would arrest its progress; and were they combined
                    with a judiciously devised system of emigration, the surplus labourers by which
                    some districts are now oppressed might be easily got rid of, and the labouring
                    population restored to its former sound and healthy state.</p>
                <p>Neither the circumstance of the cottage system increasing the price of food by
                    preventing the accumulation of capital and the improvement of machinery, nor its
                    tendency to diffuse idleness and dissipation, is half so injurious to the
                    labouring classes, as its influence in factitiously stimulating population.
                    Although it were possible, and certainly it i⅛ not, immediately to provide for
                    all the paupers in England, by granting them cottages and small pieces of land
                    at a moderate rent, in the course of a few years <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194752394" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2394-0394"/>we should be in a much worse
                    situation than at present. What would become of the pauper families? If the
                    cottage system be once fairly introduced, where shall it stop? If it was proper
                    to relieve the distresses of the sires in this way, why not apply it to those of
                    the sons? The call for relief in the latter case would be more pressing than in
                    the former, inasmuch as the population would be more superabundant. It would
                    then be impossible to retrace our steps. A fresh allotment of cottages would
                    become necessary, and a fresh stimulus would be applied to population. In this
                    way the cottage system would at length overspread the whole country. “The
                    principle of gravitation,” to borrow the language of Mr Ricardo, “is not more
                    certain than the tendency of such a system to change wealth and power into
                    misery and weakness; to call away the exertion of labour from every object
                    except that of providing mere subsistence; to confound all intellectual
                    distinction; to busy the mind continually in supplying the body’s wants; until
                    at last all classes should be infected with the plague of universal
                    poverty.”</p>
                <p>The fact that the cottage system tends to give a factitious stimulus to
                    population, and hence to cause a reduction of the real wages of labour, is of
                    itself sufficient to satisfy every unprejudiced inquirer of its pernicious
                    influence on the lower classes. But its bad effects would not stop there. After
                    landed property had been divided into minute portions, and population had begun
                    to press against the limits of subsistence, cottagers, in order to preserve
                    their families from want, would resort to such crops as supply the greatest
                    quantity of food on the smallest extent of ground. An extensive farmer
                    cultivates those only which yield the largest net profit. But the small farmer
                    must look to other considerations; the necessities of those depending on him for
                    support must first be provided for. He must have food before he begins to think
                    of profit. A cottager with five, ten, or fifteen acres of land, could not
                    support himself and a family on wheaten bread and butcher-meat. He would be
                    forced to resort to some less expensive food, —to relinquish first one enjoyment
                    and then another; and, descending step <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> by step,
                    according as the increase of population increased the competition for cottages,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">potatoes</hi> would at length constitute his only fare.</p>
                <p>Although the price of labour fluctuates with every fluctuation of the demand and
                    supply, it is, like every other thing, possessed of exchangeable value,
                    ultimately regulated by the expense of production. Where labourers consider neat
                    cottages, comfortable clothes, bread, beef, tea, and the like, necessary to
                    their comfortable and decent subsistence—and where, unless they have a prospect
                    of being able to command these enjoyments, they are less inclined to marry—wages
                    are necessarily high. But, under the cottage system, wages would not merely
                    experience a temporary depression from an excessive supply, but would be
                    permanently reduced. It would supply workmen at a comparatively small expense.
                    And wages, being no longer regulated by the price of wheat, beef, and other such
                    articles, but by that of potatoes, a species of food raised at the least
                    possible cost, they would sink to the very lowest point</p>
                <p>From the fact of manufactured commodities generally falling, and of raw produce
                    generally rising (See Pnnci- <hi rend="italic">ples of Corn Laws'),</hi> in the
                    progress of society, such a disproportion in their values is at length created,
                    that, in those countries where labourers are chiefly supported on corn, beef,
                    &amp;c., and where wages must of course be mainly regulated by their price, they
                    are able, by sacrificing a small portion of their food, to provide liberally for
                    all their other wants. But where the potato forms the ordinary food of the lower
                    classes, the operation of this principle is scarcely perceptible. Potatoes, it
                    is true, as well as corn, rise in real value as society advances, or as it
                    becomes necessary to raise them on poorer soils; but, under any circumstances,
                    the labour required to produce as many potatoes as will feed a workman, bears
                    but a small proportion to that which is required to produce corn or butcher-meat
                    for the same purpose. In a comparative point of view, therefore, very little
                    additional command over manufactured commodities would be gained by the labourer
                    who diminished his consumption of potatoes; and hence the actual condition of a
                    population chiefly dependent on that root is not only much worse than it would
                    be were they dependent on some more expensive food, but their future prospects
                    are rendered still more gloomy and discouraging.</p>
                <p>It would not be an easy task to enumerate all the evils to which a country is
                    exposed, where the real wages of labour are reduced extremely low, or where they
                    are regulated by the price of the cheapest species of food; but they are
                    unquestionably of an appaling description. Where wealth is accumulated, the
                    moreopulent and middleclasses, and even the lower orders, consume considerably
                    more than the mere necessaries of life. In a season of scarcity, this
                    consumption being diminished, has the same effectas the importation of an
                    additional supply of provisions from abroad. But where the mass of the
                    population is reduced to a dependence on mere necessaries, they cannot diminish
                    their consumption. In a nation in this situation, consumption remains nearly the
                    same, and a deficient crop is sure to entail disease, famine, and death, on a
                    considerable portion of the community. This is no very alluring prospect held
                    out by the cottage system, but it would be fully realized. When a bad harvest
                    happens in a country abounding in capital and manufactures, these are exported,
                    and corn is brought home from every quarter of the world. But what superfluous
                    produce would a nation of cottagers, or rather, we should say, of paupers, have
                    to dispose of? Millions die in China and Hindustan whenever there is any serious
                    deficit in the rice crop. The extremity of want is felt in Ireland when the
                    potato is not ordinarily productive; and the sole reason why famines are not so
                    frequent as in China is, that the cottage •system is not yet universally
                    introduced, and that some capitalists are still to be found in that country, (c.
