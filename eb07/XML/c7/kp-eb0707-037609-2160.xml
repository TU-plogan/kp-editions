                <p><label type="entry">CORRECTION</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Printing,</hi> the
                    act of retrenching the faults of a work; or the reading which the corrector
                    gives the first proofs, in order to point out and amend the faults which are to
                    be rectified by the compositor.</p>
                <p>The corrections are placed on the margin of each page, right against the line
                    where the faults are found. There are different characters used to express
                    different corrections, asTĴ or δ, <hi rend="italic">dele,</hi> for any thing to
                    be effaced or left out. When any thing is to be inserted, the place is marked in
                    the line with a caret <hi rend="smallcaps">λ,</hi> and the insertion added in
                    the margin. When a word, syllable, or the like, is to be altered, it is erased
                    out of the proof, and that to be put in its stead is written in the margin;
                    always observing, if there be several mistakes in the same line, that the
                    corrections in the margin be separated by little bars or strokes, thus, ļ. If a
                    space be omitted, its place is marked with a caret, and the margin with ⅝'. If a
                    space be wrong placed, as in the middle of a word, the two parts are connected
                    with a cu rve, and the same character put in the margin. If a letter be
                    inverted, this is expressed on the margin by Ç, If any thing be transposed, it
                    is marked thus: <hi rend="italic">The shortest</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">are the</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >follics</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">best;</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">the shortestfolliesare the best;</hi> and on the margin is added
                    <hi rend="italic">tr.</hi> in a circle. If Roman characters are to be changed
                    for Italic, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> a line is drawn under them
                    thus, and <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Italic</hi> added to
                    the margin: if lower case letters are to be altered into small capitals, a
                    double line is used. If a sentence is entirely omitted, the place is marked with
                    a caret, and in the margin is inserted the word <hi rend="italic">out,</hi> and
                    a reference made to the page of the copy in which the sentence occurs. If the
                    letters of a word stand too far asunder, a line is drawn under them, and in the
                    margin is put a crooked line or hook, thus <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> ~,.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Correction</hi><hi rend="italic">House,</hi> a place of
                    confinement, where vagrants and persons guilty of offences of an inferior degree
                    suffer punishment by being obliged to labour for a certain period of time, as
                    for months or years, according to the nature of the offence committed. The
                    benefits arising to society, and the reformation of offenders, from this mode of
                    punishment, have been variously estimated by different writers, according to the
                    views which they have taken of the effects and consequences which are supposed
                    to follow the confinement and restraint to which the criminal is subjected. See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Punishments.</hi></p>
