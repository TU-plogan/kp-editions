                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CROESUS</label>, the last king of Lydia, was remarkable for
                    his riches and conquests, his temporary prosperity, and sad reverse of fortune.
                    He subdued the Phrygians, Mysians, Paphlagonians, Thracians, and Carians,
                    amassed immense treasures, and became one of the most powerful and magnificent
                    of princes. He invited the learned to his court, and took great pleasure in
                    conversing with them. Thales of Miletus, Pittacus of Mitylene, Bias of Priene,
                    Cleobulus of Lindus, and other sages who lived in that age, as well as Aesop the
                    fabulist, and the most elegant Greek poets of the time, were welcomed at the
                    court of Croesus. There is still on record a memorable conversation which took
                    place between that prince and Solon, which seemed to predict the subsequent
                    events of his reign, and which had a late but important influence on the
                    character and fortune of the Lydian king. Croesus having entertained his
                    Athe-nian guest for several days, ostentatiously showed him the magnificence of
                    his palace, and the riches of his treasury. After all had been displayed, the
                    king complimented Solon on his curiosity and love of knowledge; and asked him,
                    as a man who had visited many countries, and reflected deeply on what he had
                    seen, whom of all men he accounted most happy. From the particular occasion, as
                    well as the air with which the question was proposed, it was evident that the
                    king expected a flattering rather than an honest answer. But Solon’s character
                    had not been enervated by the vices of a court, and he replied with a manly
                    freedom— Tellus the Athenian. Croesus, who had scarcely learned to distinguish,
                    even in imagination, between wealth and happiness, inquired, with a tone of
                    surprise, why this preference was given to Tellus. Tellus, rejoined Solon, was
                    not conspicuous for his riches or his grandeur, being only a simple citizen of
                    Athens; but he was descended from parents who had deserved the first honours of
                    the republic. He was equally fortunate in his children, who had obtained
                    universal esteem by their probity, patriotism, and every useful quality of mind
                    and body; and as to himself, he died fighting gallantly in the service of his
                    country, which his valour rendered victorious in a doubtful combat; on which
                    account the Athenians buried him on the spot where he fell, and distinguished
                    his memory by every honour which public gratitude can confer on illustrious
                    merit. After this answer, Croesus had but little encouragement to ask Solon, in
                    the second place, whom, next to Tellus, he considered as most happy. Such,
                    however, is the illusion of vanity, that he yet ventured to put this question,
                    no doubt entertaining hopes of being favourably answered. But Solon replied with
                    the same freedom as before—the brothers Cleobis and Biton, two youths of Argos,
                    whose strength and address were crowned with repeated victory at the Olympic
                    games; who deserved the affection of their parents, the gratitude of their
                    country, and the admiration of Greece; and who, having ended their lives with
                    peculiar honour, were commemorated by the most signal monuments of immortal
                    fame. “And is the happiness of a king, then,” said Croesus, “so little regarded,
                    that you, Grecian stranger, prefer to it the mean condition of an Athenian or
                    Argive citizen ?” The reply of Solon justified his reputation for wisdom. “The
                    life of man,” said he, “consists of seventy years, which make 25,550 days; an
                    immense number,.yet, in the longest life, the events of any one day will not be
                    found exactly alike to those of another. The affairs of men are liable to
                    perpetual vicissitudes; the divinity who presides over our fate is envious of
                    too much prosperity; and all human life, if not condemned to calamity, is at
                    least liable to accident. Whoever has uninterruptedly enjoyed a prosperous tide
                    of success may justly be calledyòŵwöfe; but he cannot before his death be
                    entitled to the epithet of <hi rend="italic">happy"</hi></p>
                <p>The events which soon followed this conversation prove how little satisfaction is
                    derived from the possession of a throne. Victorious in war, unrivalled in
                    wealth, supreme in power, Croesus felt and acknowledged that he was unhappy. The
                    warmest affections of his soul centred in his son Atys, a youth of the most
                    promising hopes, who had often fought and conquered by his side. The strength of
                    his attachment was accompanied with an excess of paternal care, and the anxiety
                    of his waking hours disturbed the tranquillity of his rest. He dreamed that his
                    beloved son had been slain by a dart; and the solicitude with which the father
                    watched over his safety having prevented the youth from indulging in his usual
                    occupations and amusements, and thereby rendered him too eager to enjoy them,
                    most probably exposed him to the very misfortune which his parent had dreaded
                    the most. Having reluctantly permitted him to engage in a hunting party, the
                    juvenile ardour of Atys, increased by the impatience of long restraint, made him
                    neglect the precautions necessaryin that manlyamusement; and he was slain by a
                    dart aimed at a wild boar of monstrous size, which had long spread terror over
                    the whole country of the Mysians. The fatal weapon proceeded from the hand of
                    Adrastus, a Phrygian prince and fugitive, whom Croesus had purified from the
                    involuntary guilt of a brother’s blood, and had long distinguished by peculiar
                    marks of bounty. To the grateful protection of this Phrygian Croesus had
                    recommended, at parting, the safety of his beloved son. A mournful procession of
                    Lydians brought the dead body of Atys to Sardis, and the ill-fated slayer
                    followed behind. When they approached the royal presence, Adrastus stepped
                    forward and entreated Croesus to put him to death; thinking life no longer to be
                    endured, after killing, first his own brother, and then the son of his
                    benefactor. But the Lydian king, notwithstanding the excess of his affliction,
                    acknowledged the innocence of Adrastus, and the power of fate. “Stranger,” said
                    he, “your action is blameless, being committed without design. I know that my
                    son was destined to a premature death.” But Adrastus, though pardoned by
                    Croesus, could not pardon himself. When the mourners were removed, he privately
                    returned, and perished by his own hand upon the tomb of Atys.</p>
                <p>During two years Croesus remained disconsolate for the loss of his son; and might
                    have continued to indulge his unavailing affliction during the remainder of
                    life, had not the growing greatness of Persia, which threatened the safety of
                    his dominions, roused him from his dream of misery. He marched against Cyrus
                    with a great army, but was defeated; and retreating to his capital, Sardis, was
                    there besieged. The city was taken by assault; and as a Persian soldier was
                    about to kill Croesus, that prince’s only surviving son, who had hitherto been
                    dumb, terrified at his father’s danger, cried, “Stop, soldier, and touch not
                    Croesus.” But though delivered by this extraordinary accident from the blind
                    rage of the soldier, he seemed to be reserved for a harder fate. Dragged into
                    the presence of his conqueror, he was loaded with irons; and the stem,
                    unrelenting Cyrus, of whom so flattering a picture is drawn in the philosophical
                    romance of Xenophon, ordered him, with his Lydian attendants, to be committed to
                    the flames. An immense pile of wood and other combustibles was accordingly
                    erected in the most spacious part of the city; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194753447" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3447-0475"/>and the miserable victims,
                    bound hand and foot, were placed on the top of the pyre. Cyrus, surrounded with
                    his generals, witnessed the dreadful spectacle, having, either from an
                    abominable superstition, or from a motive of curiosity equally detestable, bound
                    himself by a vow to sacrifice Croesus as the first fruits of his Lydian victory.
                    Meanwhile the unfortunate Lydian, oppressed by the intolerable weight of his
                    present calamity, compared with the security and splendour of his former state,
                    recollected the memorable conversation he had held with the Athenian sage, and
                    uttered with a deep groan the name of Solon. Cyrus asked by an interpreter whose
                    name he invoked. “His,” replied Croesus, “whose words ought ever to speak to the
                    hearts of kings.”</p>
                <p>The words of a dying man are fitted to make a strong impression; and those of
                    Croesus deeply affected the mind of Cyrus. Considering the speech of Solon as
                    addressed to himself, the Persian repented of his intended cruelty towards the
                    unfortunate prince, who had formerly enjoyed all die pomp of prosperity; and
                    dreading the vengeance which might lurk concealed in the bosom of fate, gave
                    orders that the pyre should be extinguished. This event, which saved the life of
                    Croesus, recommended him to the favour of his conqueror; and Cyrus gave orders
                    that he should be henceforth seated by his side, and treated as a king. But the
                    mind of Croesus had undergone a still more important revolution; for, tutored in
                    the useful school of adversity, he had learned to think with patience and to act
                    with prudence, to govern his passions by the dictates of reason, and to repay by
                    wholesome advice the generous behaviour of his Persian master. This fallen
                    monarch survived his conqueror, and the manner of his death is not known.</p>
