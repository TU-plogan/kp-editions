                    feasts which were held among the ancients in honour of the god Consus or
                    Neptune, but different from those other feasts of the same deity called <hi
                    rend="italic">Neptunalia.</hi> They were introduced with a magnificent cavalcade
                    or procession on horseback, because Neptune was reputed to have first taught men
                    the use of horses.</p>
                <p>Evander is said to have first instituted this feast, and it was re-established by
                    Romulus under the name of Consus, because it was some god under the denomination
                    of Consus who suggested to him the rape of the Sabines; and it was probably with
                    a view to the achievement in question that he established the festival. To this
                    feast all his neighbours were invited; and, taking advantage of the solemnities
                    and sacrifices, he seized the women.</p>
                <p>The consualia were of the number of feasts called sacred, as being consecrated to
                    a divinity. Originally they were not distinguished from those of the circus; and
                    hence it is that Valerius Maximus says the rape of the Sabines was effected at
                    the games of the circus.</p>
                <p>Plutarch observes that, during the days of this solemnity, horses and asses were
                    left at rest, and were dressed up with crowns and other ornaments, on account of
                    its being the feast of Neptunus Equestris. According to Festus, the cavalcade
                    was performed with mules, it being an opinion that this was the animal
                    originally used in drawing the car.</p>
                <p>Servius gives us to understand that the consualia happened on the 13th of August;
                    but Plutarch, in the life of Romulus, places them on the 18th, and the old Roman
                    calendar on the 21st, of that month.</p>
