                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">COLET, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, dean of St
                    Paul’s, the son of Henry Colet, knight, was born in London in the year 1466. His
                    education commenced in St Anthony’s school in that city, whence, in 1483, he was
                    sent to Oxford, and probably to Magdalene College. After seven years study of
                    logic and philosophy, he took his degrees in arts. About the year 1493, Mr Colet
                    went to Paris, and thence to Italy, probably with the design of improving
                    himself in the Greek and Latin languages, which at that time were imperfectly
                    taught in our universities. On his return to England in 1497, he took orders,
                    and returned to Oxford, where he read lectures gratis on the epistles of St
                    Paul. At this period he possessed the rectory of St Dennington in Suffolk, to
                    which indeed he had been instituted at the age of nineteen; and he was also
                    prebendary of York, and canon of St Martin’s le Grand in London. In 1502 he
                    became prebendary of Sarum, in 1505 prebendary of St Paul’s, and immediately
                    after dean of that cathedral, having previously taken the degree of doctor in
                    divinity. He was no sooner raised to this dignity than he introduced the
                    practice of preaching and expounding the Scriptures; and soon afterwards
                    established a perpetual divinity lecture, three days every week, in St Paul’s
                    Church; an institution which gradually made way for the Reformation. About the
                    year 1508, Dean Colet formed’his plan for the foundation of St Paul’s school,
                    which he completed in 1512, and endowed with estates to the amount of L.122 and
                    upwards. The celebrated grammarian William Lyle was the first master, and the
                    company of mercers were appointed trustees. The dean’s notions of religion were
                    so much more rational than those of the contemporary clergy, that they deemed
                    him little better than a heretic; and on this account he was so frequently
                    molested that he at last determined to spend the rest of his days in peaceful
                    retirement. With such intention he built a house near the palace of Richmond;
                    but being seized with the sweating sickness, he died in 1519, in the fifty-third
                    year of his age, and was buried on the south side of the choir of St Paul’s,
                    where a stone was laid over his grave, with no other inscription than his name.
                    Besides the preferments above mentioned, he was rector of the guild of Jesus at
                    St Paul’s, and chaplain to King Henry VIII. Dean Colet, though a Catholic, was
                    an enemy to the gross superstitions of the church of Rome. He disapproved of
                    auricular confession, the celibacy of priests, and such other tenets and
                    ceremonies as have since been condemned by all protestant dissenters from the
                    church of Rome. He wrote, L <hi rend="italic">Absolutissimus</hi><hi
