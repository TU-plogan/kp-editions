                <p><label type="entry">COMITIA</label>, in Roman antiquity, were general assemblies
                    of the people, lawfully called by some magistrate for the enactment or
                    prohibition of any thing by their votes.</p>
                <p>The proper comitia were of three sorts, <hi rend="italic">curiata,
                    centuriata,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tributa,</hi> with reference to the three
                    grand divisions of the city and people into <hi rend="italic">curiae,
                    centuriae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tribes:</hi> for by comitia <hi
                    rend="italic">calata</hi> were meant all the comitia in general, the term <hi
                    rend="italic">calata,</hi> from %αλsω, or <hi rend="italic">calo,</hi> being
                    their common epithet, though it was at last restricted to assemblies for the
                    creation of priests, and the regulation of last wills and testaments.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">comitia curiata</hi> owed its origin to the division which
                    Romulus made of the people into thirty curiae, ten being contained in every
                    tribe. The curiae answered in most respects to the parishes in our cities, being
                    not only separated by proper bounds and limits, but distinguished too by the
                    différent places set apart in each for the celebration otdivine service, which
                    was performed by particular priests, one to every curia, called <hi
                    rend="italic">curiones.</hi></p>
                <p>Before the institution of the comitia centuriata, all the great concerns of the
                    state were transacted in the assembly of the curiae; as the election of kings
                    and other chief officers, the making and abrogating of laws, and the judging of
                    capital crimes. After the expulsion of the kings, when the commons had obtained
                    the privilege of having tribunes and aediies, they were for some time elected at
                    these assemblies; but that ceremony being at length transferred to the comitia
                    tributa, the curiae were never convened to give their votes, excepting upon
                    occasion of making some particular law, relating to adoptions, wills, and
                    testaments, or the creation of officers for an expedition, or for electing some
                    of the priests, as the <hi rend="italic">flamines,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">curio</hi><hi rend="italic">maximus,</hi> who were themselves
                    chosen by every particular curia. The power of calling these assemblies belonged
                    at first only to the kings; but on the establishment of the democracy, this
                    privilege was allowed to most of the magistrates, and sometimes to the
                    pontifices.</p>
                <p>The persons who had the liberty of voting were such Roman citizens as belonged to
                    the curiae, or actually lived in the city, and conformed to the customs and
                    rites of their proper curiae; and all were excluded who dwelt without the bounds
                    of the city, or retained the ceremonies of their own country, even although they
                    had been honoured with theyŉs <hi rend="italic">civitatis.</hi> The place where
                    the curiae met was the <hi rend="italic">comitium,</hi> a part of the forum. No
                    fixed time was appointed for holding any of the comitia, but they were convened
                    only as business required.</p>
                <p>The people being met together, and confirmed by the report of good omens from the
                    augurs, which was necessary in all the assemblies, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rogatio</hi> or business to be proposed to them was publicly read. After this,
                    if none of the magistrates interposed, upon the order of him who presided in the
                    comitia, the people divided into their proper curiae, and consulted of the
                    matter; and then the curiae being called out, as it happened by lot, gave their
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194749261" xml:id="kp-eb0707-9261-0153"/> votes man by
                    man, in ancient times <hi rend="italic">viva voce,</hi> and afterwards by
                    tablets; the most votes in every curia going for the voice of the whole curia,
                    and the most curiae For the general consent of the people.</p>
                <p>In the time of Cicero, the comitia curiata were so much out of fashion that they
                    were formed only by thirty lictors representing the thirty curiae; whence, in
                    his second oration against Rullus, he calls them <hi rend="italic">comitia
                    adumbrata.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">comitia centuriata</hi> were instituted by Servius Tullius,
                    who had obliged every one to give a true account of what he was worth, and
                    divided the people, according to the returns, into six ranks or classes, which
                    he subdivided into a hundred and ninety-three centuries. The first classis,
                    containing the equites and richest citizens, consisted of ninety-eight
                    centuries. The second, including the tradesmen and mechanics, consisted of
                    twenty-two centuries; the third of twenty; the fourth of twenty-two; the fifth
                    of thirty; and the sixth, composed of the poorer sort, of only one century; but
                    this, though it had the same name with the rest, yet was seldom regarded, and
                    scarcely allowed any power in public matters. ITence it is common with the Roman
                    authors, when they speak of the classes, to reckon no more than five, the sixth
                    not being worth their notice. This last classis or order was divided into two
                    parts or orders, the <hi rend="italic">proletarii</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >capite censi.</hi> The former, as their name implies, were designed purely to
                    stock the republic with men, since they could supply it with so little money;
                    and the latter, who paid the lowest tax of all, were rather counted and
                    marshalled by their heads than by their estates.</p>
                <p>Persons of the first rank, by reason of their pre-eminence, had the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">classici</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">classici auctores</hi> came to signify the most approved writers.
                    All others, of what classis soever, were said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >infra</hi><hi rend="italic">classem.</hi> The assembly <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi> of the people by centuries was held for the election of consuls, censors,
                    and praetors; as also for the judging of persons accused of what was called <hi
                    rend="italic">crimen</hi><hi rend="italic">perduellionis,</hi> or actions by
                    which the party had showed himself an enemy to the state, and for the
                    confirmation of all such laws as were proposed by the chief magistrates, who had
                    the privilege of calling these assemblies.</p>
                <p>The place appointed for their meeting was the <hi rend="italic">campus
                    martius</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> because, in the primitive times of the
                    commonwealth, when they were under continual apprehensions of enemies, the
                    people, to prevent any sudden assault, went armed, in martial order, to
                    hold"these assemblies, and were for that reason forbidden by the laws to meet in
                    the city, because an army was upon no account to be marshalled within the walls;
                    yet, in later ages, it was thought sufficient to place a body of soldiers as <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> guard in the Janiculum, where an imperial standard was
                    erected, the taking down of which denoted the conclusion of the comitia.</p>
                <p>Though the time of holding these comitia for other matters was undetermined, yet
                    the magistrates, after the year of the city 601, when they began to enter upon
                    office on the kalends of January, were constantly <hi rend="italic"
                    >designed</hi><hi rend="italic">(designati)</hi> about the end of July and the
                    beginning of August.</p>
                <p>All the time between their election and confirmation they continued as private
                    persons, that inquisition might be made into the election, and that the other
                    candidates might have time to enter objections, if they thought fit to do so.
                    Yet, at the election of the censors, this custom did not hold; for as soon as
                    they were elected they were immediately invested with the honour.</p>
                <p>By the institution of these comitia, Servius Tullius secretly conveyed the whole
                    of the power from the commons; for the centuries of the first and richest class,
                    who were called out first, being more numerous by three than all the rest put
                    together, if they agreed, as they generally did, the business was already
                    decided, and the other classes were needless and insignificant. However, the
                    three last scarcely ever came to vote.</p>
                <p>In the time of freedom, the commons, in order to remedy this disadvantage,
                    obtained that, before the centuries proceeded to vote any matter at these
                    comitia, that century should give its suffrages first upon which it fell by lot
                    to do so, with the name of <hi rend="italic">centuria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >prerogativa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while the rest were to follow
                    according to the order of their classes. After the constitution of the
                    thirty-five tribes into which the classes and their centuries were divided, the
                    tribes cast lots, in the first place, which should be the <hi rend="italic"
                    >prerogative tribe,</hi> and then the centuries of the tribes also cast lots for
                    the honour of being a prerogative century. All the other tribes and centuries
                    had the appellation of <hi rend="italic">jure vocatae,</hi> because they were
                    called out according to their proper places.</p>
                <p>The prerogative century being chosen by lot, the chief magistrate, sitting in a
                    tent in the middle of the campus martius, ordered that century to come out and
                    give their voices; upon which they presently separated from the rest of the
                    multitude, and came into an inclosed apartment, which they termed <hi
                    rend="italic">septa</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ovilia,</hi> passing over the <hi
                    rend="italic">pontes</hi> or narrow boards laid there for the occasion; on which
                    account <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">pontibus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dęįici</hi> signifies to be denied the privilege of voting, and
                    persons thus dealt with were called <hi rend="italic">depon-tani.</hi></p>
                <p>At the farther end of the pontes stood the <hi rend="italic">diribitores</hi> (a
                    sort of under officers, so called from their marshalling the people), who
                    delivered to every man, in the election of magistrates, as many tablets as there
                    appeared candidates, and one of these names was written upon every tablet. A
                    proper number of great chests were set ready in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >septa,</hi> and every voter threw in which tablet he pleased.</p>
                <p>Close by the chests were stationed some of the public servants, who, taking out
                    the tablets of every century, for every tablet made a prick or a point in
                    another tablet, which was kept for the purpose. Thus, the business being decided
                    by most points, gave occasion to the phrase <hi rend="italic">omne tulit
                    punctum,</hi> and the like.</p>
                <p>The same method was observed in the justiciary process at these comitia, and also
                    in the confirmation of laws, except that, in both these cases, only two tablets
                    were offered to every person, on one of which was written U. R. and on the other
                    A. in capital letters; the two first standing for <hi rend="italic">ιdi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rogas,</hi> “be it as you desire,” relating to the magistrate who
                    proposed the question; and the last for <hi rend="italic">antiquo,</hi> or “I
                    forbid it.”</p>
                <p>It is remarkable, that though in the election of magistrates, and in the
                    ratification of laws, the votes of that century whose tablets were equally
                    divided signified nothing; yet in the trials of life and death, if the tablets
                    for and against were the same in number, the person was actually acquitted.</p>
                <p>The division of people into <hi rend="italic">tribes</hi> was an invention of
                    Romulus after he had admitted the Sabines into Rome; and though he constituted
                    at that time only three, yet as the state increased in power, and the city in
                    number of inhabitants, they rose by degrees to thirty-five. For a long time
                    after this institution, a <hi rend="italic">tribe</hi> signified no more than a
                    certain space of ground with its inhabitants. But at last the matter was quite
                    altered, and a tribe was no longer <hi rend="italic">pars</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >urbis,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">pars</hi><hi rend="italic">civitatis,</hi>
                    not a quarter of the city, but a company of citizens living wherever they
                    pleased. This change was chiefly occasioned by the original difference between
                    the tribes in point of honour; for Romulus having committed all mechanic arts to
                    the care of strangers, slaves, and libertines, and reserved the labour of
                    agriculture to the freemen and citizens, who by this active course of life might
                    be prepared for martial service, the <hi rend="italic">tribus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rus~</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:194749274"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-9274-0154"/><hi rend="italic">ticae</hi> were for this reason
                    esteemed as more honourable than the <hi rend="italic">tribus urbanoe.</hi> And
                    now all persons being desirous of getting into the more creditable division, and
                    there being several ways of accomplishing their wishes, as by adoption, by the
                    power of censors, or the like, that rustic tribe which had the most worthy names
                    in its roll had the preference to all others, though of the same general
                    denomination. Hence all of the same great family bringing themselves by degrees
                    into the same tribe, gave the name of their family to the tribe which they
                    honoured; whereas at first the generality of the tribes did not receive their
                    names from persons, but from places.</p>
                <p>The first assembly of the tribes we meet with is about the year of Rome 263,
                    having been convened by Sp. Sici-nius, tribune of the commons, upon account of
                    the trial of Coriolanus. Soon after the tribunes of the commons were ordered to
                    be elected here, and at last all the inferior magistrates and the collegiate
                    priests. The same comitia served for enacting laws relating to war and peace,
                    and all others proposed by the tribunes and plebeian officers, though they had
                    not properly the name of <hi rend="italic">leges,</hi> but only that of <hi
                    rend="italic">plebiscita.</hi> They were generally convened by the tribunes of
                    the commons; but the same privilege was allowed to all the chief magistrates.
                    They were confined to no place; and therefore we sometimes find them held in the
                    comitium, sometimes in the campus martius, and now and then in the capitol. The
                    proceedings were in most respects conformable to those already described in the
                    account of the other comitia, and therefore need not be insisted on. We may only
                    observe further of the comitia in general, that when any candidate was found to
                    have most tablets for a magistracy, he was declared to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >designed</hi> or elected by the president of the assembly, and this they termed
                    <hi rend="italic">renuneiari consul, preetor,</hi> or the like; and that the
                    last sort of the comitia only could be held without the consent or approbation
                    of the senate, which was necessary to the convening of the other two.</p>
