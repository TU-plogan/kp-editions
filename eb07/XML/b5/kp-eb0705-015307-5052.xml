                    was born of an ancient family at Nevers, on the 20th November 1748. He was
                    educated at the military school of Paris, and devoted himself particularly to
                    the study of the languages. At the. age of seventeen he was sent by the
                    government to Strasburg, where he studied public law under the celebrated
                    Professor Kugler. Having spent three years there, he received a commission in
                    the regiment of Auvergne. When scarcely twenty, he was appointed secretary of
                    legation at the diet of Ratisbon; and after having been employed during four
                    years in the discharge of various diplomatic functions, he returned to bis
                    regiment, where he continued to occupy himself with the study of public law. In
                    1777 he went as first secretary to M. de Mout-morin, who was appointed
                    ambassador to the court of Madrid. Eight years afterwards, Montmorin having been
                    recalled, Bourgoing remained eighteen months at Madrid in the character of
                    charge d’affaires. It was during this long residence in Spain that he collected
                    the materials for his <hi rend="italic">Tableau de l’Espagne Moderne.</hi> On
                    his return to France in 1787, he was sent as minister plenipotentiary to
                    Hamburg; and, in 1791, he went in a similar capacity to Madrid, where he
                    remained until the month of March 1793. Having again returned to France during
                    the most troublesome period of the Revolution, he retired ¢į9 his native town,
                    where for some time he filled the first municipal office. The revolution of the
                    18th <hi rend="italic">Brumaire</hi> (10th November 1799) drew him at length
                    from the bosom of privacy. In 1801 the first consul appointed him minister
                    plenipotentiary at the court of Denmark, and afterwards at that of Sweden. In
                    1808 he was sent as minister plenipotentiary to Saxony. At Dresden he was
                    attacked by the complaint which terminated his life; and he died at Carlsbad,
                    whither he had repaired for the benefit of the waters, on the 20th of July 1811,
                    at the age of sixty-three.</p>
                <p>Bourgoing was a man of the most disinterested integrity; and he died poor,
                    although he had been employed in various situations in which he might have found

                    of acquiring wealth. He left a family of five children, three sons and two
                    daughters. The following is a list of his publications; 1. <hi rend="italic"

                    first published in 1789, 3 vols. 8vo. The fourth edition augmented, was

                    Moderne,</hi> in 1807, in 3 vols. 8vo, with an atlas. This is the best known and
                    most esteemed of his works, and has been translated into various languages. 2.

                    edition of this work, although the second is continued to the death of Pius VI.

                    translated some other works from the German, and published several tracts of
                    little importance. In 1808 he published an edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Travels of the T&gt;uc du Châtelet in Portugal;</hi> and he was the editor of
