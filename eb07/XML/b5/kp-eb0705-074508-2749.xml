                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">BURTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label>, known to
                    the learned by the name of <hi rend="italic">Democritus junior,</hi> was a
                    younger brother of the William Burton who wrote the Antiquities of
                    Leicestershire, and born of an ancient family at Lindley, in that county, upon
                    the 8th of February 1576. He was educated in grammatical learning in the free
                    school of Sutton Colefield, in Warwickshire; in the year 1593 he was sent to
                    Brazen-nose College in Oxford; and in 1599 he was elected student of
                    Christ-church. In 1616 he had conferred upon him by the dean and canons of
                    Christ-church, the vicarage of St Thomas, in the west suburb of Oxford, to the
                    parishioners of which it is said that he always gave the sacrament in wafers;
                    and this, with the rectory of Segrave in Leicestershire, given him some time
                    afterwards by George Lord Berkeley, he held to the day of his death, which
                    happened in January 1639. He was a man of general learning, a distinguished
                    philosopher, an exact mathematician, and, what constitutes the peculiarity of
                    his character, a very curious calculator of nativities. He was extremely
                    studious, and of a melancholy turn; yet an agreeable companion, and very
                    humorous. The <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy,</hi> by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Democritus junior,</hi> as he calls himself, shows that these different
                    qualities were strangely mixed together in his composition. This book was
                    printed first in quarto, afterwards in folio, in 1624, 1632, 1638, and 1652, to
                    the great emolument of the bookseller, who, as Mr Wood tells us, got an estate
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742762" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2762-0746"/> by it. Some
                    circumstances attending his death occasioned strange suspicions. He died in his
                    chamber at or very near the time which, it seems, he had some years before
                    predicted from the calculation of his nativity; and this exactness made it
                    whispered about that, for the glory of astrology, and rather than that his
                    calculation should fail, he became <hi rend="italic">a,fclode se.</hi> This,
                    however, was generally discredited. He was buried with due solemnity in the
                    cathedral of Christ-church, and had a fair monument erected to his memory. He
                    left behind him a very choice collection of books, many of which he bequeathed
                    to the Bodleian Library, and a hundred pounds to Christ-church, the interest of
                    which was to be laid out yearly in books for their library.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Burton,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> D.D. a learned
                    divine, was born in 1696, at Wembworth, in Devonshire, of which parish his
                    father was rector. He was educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In 1725,
                    being then pro-proctor and master of the schools, he spoke a Latin oration
                    before the determining bachelor, which is entitled “<hi rend="italic">Heli,</hi>
                    or an Instance of a Magistrate’s erring through unseasonable Lenity; written and
                    published with a view to encourage the salutary exercise of academical
                    discipline;” and he afterwards treated the same subject still more fully in four
                    Latin sermons before the university, and published them with appendixes. He also
                    introduced into the schools, Locke, and other eminent modern philosophers, as
                    suitable companions to Aristotle; and printed a double series of philosophical
                    questions for the use of the younger students; from which Mr Johnson of Magdalen
                    College, Cambridge, took the hint of his larger work of the same kind, which has
                    gone through several editions. When the settling of Georgia was in agitation, Dr
                    Bray, justly revered for his institution of parochial libraries, Dr Stephen
                    Hales, Dr Berriman, and other learned divines, entreated Mr Burton’s pious
                    assistance in that undertaking. This -he readily gave, by preaching before the
                    society in 1732, and publishing his sermon, with an appendix on the state of
                    that colony; and he afterwards published an account of the designs of the
                    associates of Dr Bray, with an account of their proceedings. About the same
                    time, on the death of Dr Edward Littleton, he was presented by Eton College to
                    the vicarage of Maplc-Derham, in Oxfordshire. Here a melancholy scene, which too
                    often appears in the mansions of the clergy, presented itself to his view; a
                    widow, with three infant daughters, without a home, without a fortune. From his
                    compassion arose love, the consequence of which was marriage; for Mrs Littleton
                    was handsome, elegant, accomplished, ingenious, and had great sweetness of
                    temper. In 1760 he exchanged his vicarage of Maple-Derham for the rectory of
                    Wor-plesdon in Surrey. In his advanced age, finding his eyes begin to fail him,
                    he collected and published, in one volume, all his scattered pieces, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Opuscula</hi><hi rend="italic">Miscellanea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and soon after died, on the 11th of February 1771.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Burton-upon-Trent,</hi> a market-town of the hundred of
                    Offlow, in the county of Stafford, 128 miles from London. The river Trent is
                    navigable for large barges as high as the bridge at this town. It is celebrated
                    for ale of peculiar excellence, and has some manufactures of hats, cotton goods,
                    and iron, with several tanneries. The market, which is large, is held on
                    Thursday. The country around it is very fertile in corn. The inhabitants
                    amounted in 1801 to 3679, in 1811 to 3979, in 1821 to 4114, and in 1831 to
                    4399.</p>
