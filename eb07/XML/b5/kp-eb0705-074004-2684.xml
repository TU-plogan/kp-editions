                <p><label type="entry">BURNS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label>, the national
                    bard of Scotland, was born on the 25th of January 1759, in a clay-built cottage
                    about two miles south of the town of Ayr. He was the eldest son of William
                    Burncs, or Burness, who at the period of Robert’s birth was gardener and
                    overseer to a gentleman of small estate; but resided on a few acres of land
                    which he had on lease from another person. The father was a man of strict
                    religious principles, and also distinguished for that penetration and knowledge
                    of mankind which was afterwards so conspicuous in his son. The mother of the
                    poet was likewise a very sagacious woman, and possessed an inexhaustible store
                    of ballads and legendary tales, with which she nourished the infant imagination
                    of him whose own productions were destined to excel them all.</p>
                <p>These worthy individuals laboured diligently for the support of an increasing
                    family; nor, in the midst of harassing struggles, did they neglect the mental
                    improvement of their offspring; a characteristic of Scottish parents, even under
                    the most depressing circumstances. In his sixth year Robert was put under the
                    tuition of one Campbell, and subsequently under Mr John Murdoch, a <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193742697" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2697-0741"/>very faithful and
                    pains-taking teacher. With this individual he remained for a few years, and was
                    accurately instructed in the first principles of composition. The poet and his
                    brother Gilbert were the aptest pupils in the school, and were generally at the
                    head of the class. Mr Murdoch, in afterwards recording the impressions which the
                    two brothers made on him, says, “Gilbert always appeared to me to possess a more
                    lively imagination, and to be more of the wit, than Robert. I attempted to teach
                    them a little church-music. Here they were left far behind by all the rest of
                    the school. Robert’s ear in particular was remarkably dull, and his voice
                    untunable. It was long before I could get them to distinguish one tune from
                    another. Robert’s countenance was generally grave, and expressive of a serious,
                    contemplative, and thoughtful mind. Gilbert’s face said, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mirth, with thee I mean to live;</hi> and certainly, if any person who knew the
                    two boys had been asked which of them was the most likely to court the muses, he
                    would never have guessed that <hi rend="italic">Robert</hi> had a propensity of
                    that kind.”</p>
                <p>Besides the tuition of Mr Murdoch, Burns received instructions from his father in
                    writing and arithmetic. Under their joint care he made rapid progress, and was
                    remarkable for the ease with which he committed devotional poetry to memory. The
                    following extract from his letter to Dr Moore in 1787 is interesting, from the
                    light which it throws upon his progress as a scliolar, and on the formation of
                    his character as a poet :—“At those years,” says he, “I was by no means a
                    favourite with any body. I was a good deal noted for a retentive memory, a
                    stubborn sturdy something in my disposition, and an enthusiastic idiot piety. I
                    say <hi rend="italic">idiot</hi> piety, because I was then but a child. Though
                    it cost the schoolmaster some thrashings, I made an excellent scholar; and by
                    the time I was ten or eleven years of age, I was a critic in substantives,
                    verbs, and particles. In my infant and boyish days, too, I owed much to an old
                    woman who resided in the family, remarkable for her ignorance, credulity, and
                    superstition. She had, I suppose, the largest collection in the country, of
                    tales and songs concerning devils, ghosts, fairies, brownies, witches, warlocks,
                    spunkies, kelpies, elf-candles, deadlights, wraiths, apparitions, cantrips,
                    giants, enchanted towers, dragons, and other trumpery. This cultivated the
                    latent seeds of poetry; but had so strong an effect on my imagination, that to
                    this hour, in my nocturnal rambles, I sometimes keep a sharp look-out in
                    suspicious places; and though nobody can be more sceptical than I am in such
                    matters, yet it often takes an effort of philosophy to shake off these idle
                    terrors. The earliest composition that I recollect taking pleasure in was <hi
                    rend="italic">The Vision of Mirza,</hi> and a hymn of Addison’s, beginning, <hi
                    rend="italic">How are thy servants blest, 0 Lord!</hi> I particularly remember
                    one halfstanza, which was music to my boyish car—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> For though on dreadful whirls we hung </l>
                    <l part="N"> High on the broken wave— </l>
                </lg>
                <p>I met with these pieces in <hi rend="italic">Mason’s English Collection,</hi> one
                    of my school-books. The first two books I ever read in private, and which gave
                    me more pleasure than any two books I ever read since, were, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Life of Hannibal,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The History of Sir William
                    Wallace.</hi> Hannibal gave my young ideas such a turn, that I used to strut in
                    raptures up and down after the recruiting drum and bagpipe, and wish myself tall
                    enough to be a soldier; while the story of Wallace poured a tide of Scottish
                    prejudice into my veins, which will boil along there till the flood-gates of
                    life shut in eternal rest.”</p>
                <p>Mr Murdoch’s removal from Mount Oliphant deprived Burns of his instructions; but
                    they were still continued by the father of the bard. About the age of fourteen
                    he was sent to school every alternate week for the improvement of his writing.
                    In the meanwhile he was busily employed upon the operations of the farm; and, at
                    the age of fifteen, was considered as the principal labourer upon it. About a
                    year after this he gained three weeks of respite, which he spent with his old
                    tutor Murdoch at Ayr, in revising the English grammar, and in studying the
                    French language, in which he made uncommon progress. Ere his sixteenth year
                    elapsed, he had considerably extended his reading. The vicinity of Mount
                    Oliphant to Ayr afforded him facilities for gratifying what had now become a
                    passion. Among the books which he had perused were some plays of Shakspeare,
                    Pope, the works of Allan Ramsay, and a collection of songs which constituted his
                    <hi rend="italic">vade-mecum.</hi> "I pored over them,” says he, “driving my
                    cart or walking to labour, song by song, verse by verse, carefully noticing the
                    true tender or sublime from affectation and fustian.” So early did he evince his
                    attachment to the lyric muse, in which he was destined to surpass all who have
                    gone before or succeeded him.</p>
                <p>At this period the family removed to Lochlea, in the parish of Tarbolton. Some
                    time before, however, he had made his first attempt in poetry. It was a song
                    addressed to a rural beauty about his own age; and though possessing no great
                    merit as a whole, it contains some lines and ideas which would have done honour
                    to him at any age. After the removal to Lochlea his literary zeal slackened, for
                    he was thus cut off from those acquaintances whose conversation stimulated his
                    powers, and whose kindness supplied him with books. For about three years after
                    this period he was busily employed upon the farm; but at intervals lie paid his
                    addresses to the poetic muse, and with no common success. The summer of his
                    nineteenth year was spent in the study of mensuration, surveying, &amp;c. at a
                    small sea-port town, a good distance from home. He returned to his father’s
                    considerably improved. “My reading,” says he, “was enlarged with the very
                    important addition of Thomson’s and Shenstone’s works. I had seen human nature
                    in a new phasis; and I engaged several of my school-fellows to keep up a
                    literary correspondence with me. This improved me in composition. I had met with
                    a collection of letters by the wits of Queen Anne’s reign, and I pored over them
                    most devoutly; I kept copies of any of my own letters that pleased me; and a
                    comparison between them and the composition of most of my correspondents
                    flattered my vanity. I carried this whim so far, that though I had not three
                    farthings worth of business in the world, yet almost every post brought me as
                    many letters as if I had been a broad plodding son of day-book and ledger.”</p>
                <p>His mind, peculiarly susceptible of tender impressions, was continually the slave
                    of some rustic charmer. In the “heat and whirlwind of his love,” he generally
                    found relief in poetry, by which, as by a safety valve, his turbulent passions
                    were allowed to have vent. He formed the resolution of entering the matrimonial
                    state; but his circumscribed means of subsistence as a farmer preventing his
                    taking that step, he resolved on becoming a flaxdresser, for which purpose he
                    removed to the town of Irvine in 1781. The speculation turned out unsuccessful;
                    for the shop catching fire, was burnt, and the poet returned to his father
                    without a sixpence. During his stay at Irvine he had met with Ferguson’s poems.
                    This circumstance was of some importance to Burns, for it roused his poetic
                    powers from the torpor into which they had fallen, and in a great measure
                    finally determined the <hi rend="italic">Scottish</hi> character of his poetry.
                    He here also contracted some friendships, which he himself says did him
                    mischief; and, by his brother Gilbert’s account, from this date there was a
                    serious change in his conduct. The venerable and excellent<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193742710" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2710-0742"/> parent of the poet died soon
                    after his son’s return. The support of the family now devolving upon Burns, in
                    conjunction with his brother he took a sub-lease of the farm of Mossgiel, in the
                    parish of Mauchline. The four years which he resided upon this farm were the
                    most important of his life. It was here he felt that nature had designed him for
                    a poet; and here, accordingly, his genius began to develope its energies in
                    those strains which will make his name familiar to all future times, the
                    admiration of every civilized country, and the glory and boast of his own.</p>
                <p>The vigour of Burns’s understanding, and the keenness of his wit, as displayed
                    more particularly at masonic meetings and debating clubs, of which he formed one
                    at Mauchline, began to spread his fame as a man of uncommon endowments. He now
                    could number as his acquaintance several clergymen, and also some gentlemen of
                    substance; amongst whom was Mr Gavin Hamilton, writer in Mauchline, one of his
                    earliest patrons. One circumstance more than any other contributed to increase
                    his notoriety. “Polemical divinity,” says he to Dr Moore in 1787, “about this
                    time was putting the country half mad; and I, ambitious of shining in
                    conversation-parties on Sundays, at funerals, &amp;c. used to puzzle Calvinism
                    with so much heat and indiscretion, that I raised a hue-and-cry of heresy
                    against me, which has not ceased to this hour.” The farm which he possessed
                    belonged to the Earl of Loudon, but the brothers held it in sub-lease from Mr
                    Hamilton. This gentleman was at open feud with one of the ministers of
                    Mauchline, who was a rigid Calvinist. Mr Hamilton maintained opposite tenets;
                    and it is not matter of surprise that the young farmer should have espoused his
                    cause, and brought all the resources of his genius to bear upon it. The result
                    was <hi rend="italic">The Holy Fair, The Ordination, Holy Willies Prayer,</hi>
                    and other satires, as much distinguished for their coarse severity and
                    bitterness, as for their genius.</p>
                <p>The applause which greeted these pieces emboldened the poet, and encouraged him
                    to proceed. In his life by his brother Gilbert, a very interesting account is
                    iven of the occasions which gave rise to the poems, and the chronological order
                    in which they were produced. The exquisite pathos and humour, the strong manly
                    sense, the masterly command of felicitous language, the graphic power of
                    delineating scenery, manners, and incidents, which appear so conspicuously in
                    his various poems, could not fail to call forth the admiration of those who were
                    favoured with a perusal of them. But the clouds of misfortune were gathering
                    darkly above the head of him who was thus giving delight to a large and widening
                    circle of friends. The farm of Mossgiel proved a losing concern; and an amour
                    with Miss Jane Armour, afterwards Mrs Burns, had assumed so serious an aspect,
                    that he at first resolved to fly from the scene of his disgrace and misery. One
                    trait of his character, however, must be mentioned. Before taking any steps for
                    his departure, he met Miss Armour by appointment, and gave into her hands a
                    written acknowledgment of marriage, which, when produced by a person in her
                    situation, is, according to the Scots law, to be accepted as legal evidence of
                    an <hi rend="italic">irregular</hi> marriage having really taken place. This the
                    lady burned at the persuasion of her father, who was adverse to a marriage; and
                    Burns, thus wounded in the two most powerful feelings of his mind, his love and
                    pride, was driven almost to insanity. Jamaica was his destination; but as he did
                    not possess the money necessary to defray the expense of his passage out, he
                    resolved to publish some of his best poems, in order to raise the requisite sum.
                    These views were warmly promoted by some of his more opulent friends; and a
                    sufficiency of subscribers having been procured, one of the finest volumes of
                    poetry that ever appeared in the world issued from the provincial press of
                    Kilmarnock.</p>
                <p>It is hardly possible to imagine with what eager admiration and delight they were
                    everywhere received. They possessed in an eminent degree all those qualities
                    which invariably contribute to render any literary work quickly and permanently
                    popular. They were written in a phraseology of which all the powers were
                    universally felt, and which being at once antique, familiar, and now rarely
                    written, was therefore fitted to serve all the dignified and picturesque uses of
                    poetry, without making it unintelligible. The imagery and the sentiments were at
                    once natural, impressive, and interesting. Those topics of satire and scandal in
                    which the rustic delights; that humorous imitation of character, and that witty
                    association of ideas familiar and striking, yet not naturally allied to one
                    another, which has force to shake his sides with laughter; those fancies of
                    superstition, at which one still wonders and trembles; those affecting
                    sentiments and images of true 'religion, which are at once dear and awful to the
                    heart; were all represented by Burns with the magical power of true poetry. Old
                    and young, high and low, grave and gay, learned and ignorant, alľwere alike
                    surprised and transported.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, a few copies of these fascinating poems found their way to
                    Edinburgh, and having been read to Dr Blacklock, obtained his warmest
                    approbation; and he advised the author to repair to Edinburgh. Burns lost no
                    time in complying with this request; and accordingly, towards the end of the
                    year 1786, he set out for the capital, where he was received by Dr BJacklock
                    with the most flattering kindness, and introduced to every person of taste among
                    that excellent man’s friends. Multitudes now vied with each other in patronising
                    the rustic poet. Those who possessed at once true taste and ardent philanthropy
                    were soon united in his praise; those who were disposed to favour any good thing
                    belonging to Scotland, purely because it was Scottish, gladly joined the cry;
                    while those who had hearts and understandings to be charmed without knowing why,
                    when they saw their native customs, manners, and language, made the subjects and
                    the materials of poesy, could not suppress that impulse of feeling which
                    struggled to declare itself in favour of Burns.</p>
                <p>Thus did Burns, ere he had been many weeks in Edinburgh, find himself the object
                    of universal curiosity, favour, admiration, and fondness. He was sought after,
                    courted with attentions the most respectful and assiduous, feasted, flattered,
                    caressed, and treated by all ranks as the great boast of his country, whom it
                    was scarcely possible to honour and reward in a degree equal to his merits.</p>
                <p>A new edition of his poems was called for; and the public mind was directed to
                    the subject by Henry Mackenzie, who dedicated a paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lounger</hi> to a commendatory notice of the poet. This circumstance will ever
                    be remembered to the honour of that polished writer, not only for the warmth of
                    the eulogy he bestowed, but because it was the first printed acknowledgment
                    which had been made to the genius of Burns. The copyright was sold to Creech for
                    L.100; but the friends of the poet advised him to forward a subscription. The
                    patronage of the Caledonian Hunt, a very influential body, was obtained. The
                    list of subscribers rapidly rose to 1500; many gentlemen paying a great deal
                    more than the price of the volume; and it was supposed that the poet derived
                    from the subscription and the sale of his copy-right a clear profit of at least
                    L.700.</p>
                <p>The conversation of Burns, according to the testimony of all the eminent men who
                    heard him, was even more wonderful than his poetry. He affected no soft air nor
                    graceful motions of politeness, which might have ill accorded <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193742723" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2723-0743"/>with the rustic plainness of
                    his native manners. Conscious superiority of mind taught him to associate with
                    the great, the learned, and the gay, without being overawed into any such
                    bashfulness as might have rendered him confused in thought or hesitating in
                    elocution. He possessed withal an extraordinary share of plain common sense or
                    mother-wit, which prevented him from obtruding upon persons, of whatever rank,
                    with whom he was admitted to converse, any of those effusions of vanity, envy,
                    or self-conceit, in which authors who have lived remote from the general
                    practice of life, and whose minds have been almost exclusively confined to
                    contemplate their own studies and their own works, are but too prone to indulge.
                    In conversation he displayed a sort of intuitive quickness and rectitude of
                    judgment upon every subject that arose. The sensibility of his heart, and the
                    vivacity of his fancy, gave a rich colouring to whatever opinions he was
                    disposed to advance; and his language was thus not less happy in conversation
                    than in his writings. Hence those who had met and conversed with him once, were
                    pleased to meet and to converse with him again and again.</p>
                <p>For some time he associated only with the virtuous, the learned, and the wise,
                    and the purity of his morals remained uncontaminated. But unfortunately he fell,
                    as others have fallen in similar circumstances. He suffered himself to be
                    surrounded by persons who were proud to tell that they had been in company with
                    Burns, and had seen Burns as loose and as foolish as themselves. He now also
                    began to contract something of arrogance in conversation. Accustomed to be among
                    his associates what is vulgarly but expressively called “the cock of the
                    company,” he could scarcely refrain from indulging in a similar freedom and
                    dictatorial decision of talk, even in the presence of persons who could less
                    patiently endure presumption.</p>
                <p>After remaining some months in the Scottish metropolis, basking in the noontide
                    sun of a popularity which, as Dugald Stewart well remarks, would have turned any
                    head but his own, he formed a resolution of returning to the shades whence he
                    had emerged, but not before he had perambulated the southern border. On the 6th
                    of May 1787 he set out on his journey, and, visiting all that appeared
                    interesting on the north of the Tweed, proceeded to Newcastle and other places
                    on the English side. He returned in about two months to his family at Mauchline;
                    but in a short period he again set out on an excursion to the north, where he
                    was most flatteringly received by all the great families. On his return to
                    Mossgicl he completed his marriage with Miss Armour. He then concluded a bargain
                    with Mr Miller of Dalswinton, for a lease of the farm of Elliesland, on
                    advantageous terms.</p>
                <p>Burns entered on possession of this farm at Whitsunday 1788. He had formerly
                    applied with success for an excise commission, and during six weeks of the
                    summer of this year he had to attend to the business of that profession at Ayr.
                    His life for some time was thus wandering and unsettled; and Dr Currie mentions
                    this as one of his chief misfortunes. Mrs Burns came home to him towards the end
                    of the year, and the poet was accustomed to say that the happiest period of his
                    life was the first winter he spent in Elliesland. The neighbouring farmers and
                    gentlemen, pleased to obtain for a neighbour the poet by whose works they had
                    been delighted, kindly sought his company, and invited him to their houses.
                    Burns, however, found an inexpressible charm in sitting down beside his wife, at
                    his own fireside; in wandering over his own grounds; in once more putting his
                    hand to the spade and the plough; in forming his inclosures, and managing his
                    cattle. For some months he felt almost all that felicity which fancy had taught
                    him to expect in his new situation. He had been Tor a time idle; but his muscles
                    were not yet unbraced for rural toil. He now seemed to find a joy in being the
                    husband of the mistress of his affections, and in seeing himself the father of
                    children such as promised to attach him for ever to that modest, humble, and
                    domestic life, in which alone he could hope to be permanently happy. Even his
                    engagements in the service of the excise did not, at first, threaten either to
                    contaminate the poet or to ruin the farmer.</p>
                <p>From various causes, the farming speculation did not succeed. Indeed, from the
                    time he obtained a situation under government, he gradually began to sink the
                    farmer in the exciseman. Occasionally he assisted in the rustic occupations of
                    Elliesland, but for the most part he was engaged in very different pursuits. In
                    his professional perambulations over the moors of Dumfriesshire he had to
                    encounter temptations which a mind and temperament like his found it difficult
                    to resist. His immortal works had made him universally known and
                    enthusiastically admired; and accordingly he was a welcome guest at every house,
                    from the most princely mansion to the lowest country inn. In the latter he was
                    too frequently to be found as the presiding genius, and master of the orgies.
                    However, he still continued at intervals to cultivate the muse; and, besides a
                    variety of other pieces, he produced at this period the inimitable poem of Tam
                    o’Shanter. Johnson’s Miscellany was also indebted to him for the finest of its
                    lyrics. One pleasing trait of his character must not be overlooked. He
                    superintended the formation of a subscription library in the parish, and took
                    the whole management of it upon himself. These institutions, though common now,
                    were not so at the period of which we write; and it should never be forgotten
                    that Burns was amongst the first, if not the very first, of their founders in
                    the rural districts of southern Scotland.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of 1791 he finally abandoned his farm; and obtaining an
                    appointment to the Dumfries division of excise, he repaired to that town on a
                    salary of L.70 per annum. All his principal biographers concur in stating that
                    after settling in Dumfries his moral career was downwards. Heron, who had some
                    acquaintance with the matter, says, “His dissipation became still more deeply
                    habitual; he was here more exposed than in the country to be solicited to share
                    the revels of the dissolute and the idle; foolish, young men flocked eagerly
                    about him, and from time to time pressed him to drink with them, that they might
                    enjoy his wit. The Caledonian Club, too, and the Dumfriesshire and Galloway
                    Hunt, had occasional meetings in Dumfries after Burns went to reside there; and
                    the poet was of course invited to share their conviviality, and hesitated not to
                    accept the invitation. In the intervals between his different fits of
                    intemperance he suffered the keenest anguish of remorse, and horribly afflictive
                    foresight. His Jane behaved with a degree of conjugal and maternal tenderness
                    and prudence, which made him feel more bitterly the evil of his misconduct,
                    although they could not reclaim him.”</p>
                <p>This is a dark picture, perhaps too dark. The Rev. Mi-Gray, who, as the teacher
                    of his son, was intimately acquainted with Burns, and had frequent opportunities
                    of judging of his general character and deportment, gives a more amiable
                    portrait of the bard. Being an eye-witness, the testimony of this gentleman must
                    be allowed to have some weight. “The truth is,” says he, “Burns was seldom <hi
                    rend="italic">intoxicated.</hi> The drunkard soon becomes besotted, and is
                    shunned even by the convivial. Had he been so, he could not have long continued
                    the idol of every party.” This is strong reasoning; and he goes on to mention
                    other circumstances which seem to confirm the truth of his position. In
                    balancing these two statements, a juster estimate of the moral deportment of
                    Burns may be formed.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742736" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2736-0744"/>
                <p>In the year 1792 party politics ran to a great height in Scotland, and the
                    liberal and independent spirit of Burns did certainly betray him into some
                    indiscretions. A general opinion prevails, that he so far lost the good graces
                    of his superiors by his conduct, as to consider all prospects of future
                    promotion as hopeless. But this appears not to have been the case; and the fact
                    that he acted as supervisor before his death is a strong proof to the contrary.
                    Of his political verses few have as yet been published. But in these he warmly
                    espoused the cause of the Whigs, which kept up the spleen of the other party,
                    already sufficiently provoked; and this may in some measure account for the
                    bitterness with which his own character was attacked.</p>
                <p>Whatever opinion may be formed of the extent of his dissipation in Dumfries, one
                    fact is unquestionable, that his powers remained unimpaired to the last; it was
                    there he produced his finest lyrics, and they are the finest, as well as the
                    purest, that ever delighted mankind. Besides Johnson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Museum,</hi> in which he took an interest to the last, and contributed most
                    extensively, he formed a connection with Mr George Thomson of Edinburgh. This
                    gentleman had conceived the laudable design of collecting the national melodies
                    of Scotland, with accompaniments by the most eminent composers, and poetry by
                    the most eminent writers, in addition to those words which were originally
                    attached to them. From the multitude of songs which Burns wrote from the year
                    1792 till the commencement of his illness, it is evident that few days could
                    have passed without ļvis producing some stanzas for the work. The following
                    passage from his correspondence, which was also most extensive, proves that his
                    songs were not hurriedly got up, but composed with the utmost care and
                    attention. “Until I am complete master of a tune in my own singing, such as it
                    is,” says he, “I can never compose for it. My way is this. I consider the poetic
                    sentiment correspondent to my idea of the musical expression,— then choose my
                    theme,—compose one stanza. When that is composed, which is generally the most
                    difficult part of the business, I walk out,—sit down now and then,—look out for
                    objects in nature round mc that are in unison or harmony with the cogitations of
                    my fancy, and workings of my bosom,—humming every now and then the air, with the
                    verses I have framed. When I feel my muse beginning to jade, I retire to the
                    solitary fireside of my study, and there commit my effusions to paper; swinging
                    at intervals on the hind legs of my elbow-chair, by way of calling forth my own
                    critical strictures, as my pen goes. Seriously, this, at home, is almost
                    invariably my way.” This is not only interesting for the light which it throws
                    upon his method of composition, but it proves that conviviality had not as yet
                    greater charms for him than the muse.</p>
                <p>From his youth Burns had exhibited ominous symptoms of a radical disorder in his
                    constitution. A palpitation of the heart, and a derangement of the digestive
                    organs, were conspicuous. These were, doubtless, increased by <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> his indulgences, which became more frequent as he
                    drew towards the close of his career. In the autumn of 1795 he lost an only
                    daughter, which was a severe blow to him. Soon afterwards he was seized with a
                    rheumatic fever; and “long the die spun doubtful,” says he, in a letter to his
                    faithful friend Mrs Dunlop, “until, after many weeks of a sick bed, it seems to
                    have turned up life, and I am beginning to crawl across my room.” The cloud
                    behind which his sun was destined to be eclipsed at noon had begun to darken
                    above him. Before he had completely recovered, he had the imprudence to join a
                    fescive circle; and, on his return from it, he caught a cold, which brought back
                    his trouble upon him with redoubled severity. Seabathing was had recourse to,
                    but with no ultimate success.</p>
                <p>He lingered until the 21st of July 1796, when he expired. The interest which the
                    death of Burns excited was intense. All differences were forgotten; his genius
                    only was thought of. On the 26th of the same month he was conveyed to the grave,
                    followed by about ten thousand individuals of all ranks, many of whom had come
                    from distant parts of the country to witness the solemnity. He was interred with
                    military honours by the Dumfries volunteers, to which body he had belonged.</p>
                <p>Thus, at the age of thirty-seven, an age when the mental powers of man have
                    scarcely reached their climax, died Robert Burns, one of the greatest poets whom
                    his country has produced. It is unnecessary to enter into any lengthened
                    analysis of his poetry or character. His works are universally known and
                    admired, and criticism has been drawn to the dregs upon the subject; and that,
                    too, by the greatest masters who have appeared since his death,—no mean test of
                    the great merits of his writings. He excels equally in touching the heart by the
                    exquisiteness of his pathos, and exciting the risible faculties by the breadth
                    of his humour. H <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> s lyre had many strings, and he
                    had equal command over them all; striking each, and frequently in chords, with
                    the skill and power of a master. That his satire sometimes degenerates into
                    coarse invective, cannot be denied; but where personality is not permitted to
                    interfere, his poems of this description may take their place beside any thing
                    of the kind which has ever been produced, without being cbsgraced by the
                    comparison. It is unnecessary to re-echo the praises of his best pieces, as
                    there is no epithet of admiration which has not been bestowed upon them. Those
                    who had best opportunities of judging, are of opinion that his works, stamped as
                    they are with the impress of sovereign genius, fall short of the powers he
                    possessed. It is therefore to be lamented that he undertook no great work of
                    fiction or invention. Had circumstances permitted, he would probably have done
                    so; but his excise duties, and without doubt his own follies, prevented him.
                    FIis passions were strong, and his capacity of enjoyment corresponded with them.
                    These continually precipitated him into the vortex of pleasure, where alone they
                    could be gratified; and the re-action consequent upon such indulgences (for he
                    possessed the finest discrimination between right and wrong) threw him into low
                    spirits, to which he was also constitutionally liable. His mind, being thus
                    never for any length of time in an equable tone, could scarcely pursue with
                    steady regularity a work of any length. His moral aberrations, as detailed by
                    some of his biographers, have been exaggerated, as already noticed. This has
                    been proved by the testimony of many witnesses, from whose authority there can
                    be no appeal; for they had the best opportunities of judging. In fine, it may be
                    doubted whether he has not, by his writings, exercised a greater power over the
                    minds of men, and the general system of life, than has been exercised by any
