                <p><label type="entry">BURMAN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Peter</hi></label>, a philologer
                    and critic of high reputation, was born at Utrecht on the 26th of June 1668. His
                    father, Francis Burman, professor of divinity in that university, was the son of
                    a German clergyman, whom the destructive war of the Palatinate had driven from
                    Frankenthal: his mother was Mary the daughter of Abraham Heydan, professor of
                    divinity in the university of Leyden. Thus he was doubly connected with men of
                    letters, and various members of the same family distinguished themselves by
                    their writings. While he was yet in the eleventh year of his age, he had the
                    misfortune to lose his pious and learned father; but this loss, great as it
                    certainly was, appears to have been in a very considerable degree supplied by
                    the assiduity, prudence, and piety of his mother. He was educated in the public
                    school of Utrecht, where his progress must have been very rapid, for at the age
                    of thirteen he became a student in the university. For several years he attended
                    the lectures of Graevius, a professor of great learning and eminence, who ably
                    blended Greek with Latin erudition, and to whose private friendship, joined to
                    his public instructions, Burman seems to have been in a great measure indebted
                    for that strong predilection which he continued to evince for philological
                    studies. Here, among other departments of literature, he assiduously cultivated
                    Latin composition, and he gradually attained to no mean proficiency both as an
                    orator and a poet.</p>
                <p>Burman’s original destination was for the legal profession; and after having
                    devoted some years to literature, he next applied himself to the study of the
                    law. The university of Utrecht was then highly distinguished as a school of
                    jurisprudence, and among other great names, it could boast of Noodt, one of the
                    ablest civilians of modern times. He attended the lectures of this professor,
                    and likewise those of Van Muyden and Van de Poll, who both taught the municipal
                    as well as the civil law; nor did he neglect the lectures of H. Cocceii on the
                    feudal law, and on the treatise of Grotius <hi rend="italic">De Jure Belli ac
                    Pads·</hi> A further proof of his assiduity he exhibited in a dissertation <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Vicesima</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Haereditatum,</hi> which he publicly defended with great applause.</p>
                <p>It is a common practice for the more liberal and inquisitive students of Holland
                    and Germany to pass from one university to another, and the practice has an
                    obvious tendency to improve the youthful mind, by removing local prejudices, and
                    by introducing a new current of refined thought. Burman accordingly spent a year
                    at Leyden, where he studied philosophy under Voider, but in the mean time did
                    not neglect his favourite pursuits of classical erudition. He attended the
                    lectures of the younger Gronovius on some of the Greek writers, together with
                    those of Ryckius on Tacitus. Of this Latin historian, the latter professor was
                    about that period engaged in preparing a new edition, with a separate volume of
                    animadversions. Returning to the university of Utrecht, he continued to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193742385" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2385-0717"/> cultivate the
                    friendship of Graevius, and to profit by his instructions and advice. In the
                    month of March 1688 he took the degree of doctor of laws, having previously
                    written and defended a learned dissertation <hi rend="italic">De Transactions
                    bus.</hi> “The attainment of this honour,” as Dr Johnson has remarked, “was far
                    from having upon Burman that effect which has been too often observed to be
                    produced in others, who, having in their own opinion no higher object of
                    ambition, have elapsed into idleness and security, and spent the rest of their
                    lives in a lazy enjoyment of their academical dignities. Burman aspired to
                    further improvements, and, not satisfied with the opportunities of literary
                    conversation which Utrecht afforded, travelled into Switzerland and Germany,
                    where he gained an increase both of fame and learning.”</p>
                <p>But having made choice of a profession, it had now become necessary to enter upon
                    a new course; and on his return to his native city, he applied his talents and
                    learning to the practice of the law. We are informed that he pleaded various
                    causes with much force and eloquence; nor will this account appear improbable to
                    those who are acquainted with the vigour and decision displayed in his ordinary
                    strain of composition. On the first of December 1691 he was appointed receiver
                    of the tithes which were originally paid to the bishop of Utrecht: this was an
                    office of considerable credit, and was usually bestowed upon persons of some
                    distinction. While engaged in these occupations, he married Eve Clotterboke, the
                    daughter of a burgomaster of Briel, much commended for her beauty and
                    accomplishments. She became the mother of ten children, eight of whom died at an
                    early age, and only two sons survived their father. This learned advocate might
                    have risen to great eminence in his profession; but as the love of letters was
                    his predominant passion, he gladly availed himself of an opportunity of leaving
                    the bar and returning to the university. A recommendation from his friend
                    Graevius to the magistrates of Utrecht procured him the professorship of
                    eloquence and history, to which was afterwards added the professorship of the
                    Greek language, and that of politics. His first appointment was that of an
                    extraordinary professor, or of a professor <hi rend="italic">extra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ordinem.</hi> He took possession of his chair on the 10th of
                    December 1696; and on that occasion pronounced an oration <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Eloquentia et</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetice.</hi> His
                    academical labours, which were thus so various, must likewise have been very
                    formidable; but being a man of an excellent capacity, and of unwearied
                    application, he ably performed whatever he had undertaken, and gradually
                    acquired a high and merited reputation. His lectures attracted a numerous
                    auditory, and his multifarious publications rendered his name familiarly known
                    wherever ancient learning was successfully cultivated. The most serious labours
                    of his life were devoted to the illustration of the Roman classics, and in this
                    department he had but few rivals.</p>
                <p>Soon after his appointment to the professorship, he published a collection of
                    letters from learned men, and chiefly relating to topics of learning: “Marquardi
                    Gudii et doctorum Virorum ad eum Epistolae; quibus accedunt ex bibliotheca
                    Gudiana clarissimorum et doctissimorum Virorum, qui superiore et nostro saeculo
                    floruerunt, et Claudii Sarravii, Senatoris Parisiensis, Epistolae ex eadem
                    bibliotheca auctiores; curante Petro Burmanno.” Ultrajecti, 1697, 4to. About the
                    same period he prepared an edition of Phaedrus. Amst. 1698, 8vo. This edition
                    was twice reprinted; and after an interval of nearly thirty yeais, he published
                    the same poet with a new commentary. He next produced “Q. Horatius Flaccus.
                    Accedunt J. Rutgersii Lectiones Venusinae.” Traj. Batav. 1699, 12mo. Burman has
                    prefixed a dedication and preface, but the only notes which occur are those of
                    Janus Rutgersius, who died in the year 1625, after having established no mean
                    reputation as a scholar by the publication of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Variae</hi><hi rend="italic">Lectiones.</hi> These editions were followed by a
                    learned dissertation, entitled “<hi rend="italic">Zιυς Kατα</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">ζατr</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">

                    Traj. Bat. 1700, 4to. Resuming the illustration of the Latin poets, he now
                    prepared an edition of Valerius Flaccus. Ultraj. 1701, 12mo. This edition
                    includes the notes of N. Heinsius, who had himself published the text in 1680:
                    but after a long interval, Burman edited the same poet with more ample
                    illustrations, which were partly derived ,rJm various other critics. Leidae,
                    1724, 4to. He was chosen rector of the university in 1703, and again in
                    1711.</p>
                <p>. Graevius, one of the chief ornaments of the university of Utrecht, died in the
                    year 1703, and his grateful pupil honoured his memory by a funeral oration,
                    which is ably and affectionately written, and contains an interesting sketch of
                    his life and character. His great and valuable collection of writers on Roman
                    antiquities is well known among scholars. He engaged in a more extensive
                    undertaking, a collection of writers on the history and antiquities of Italy;
                    and after his decease, the charge of inspecting its progress devolved upon
                    Burman, who contributed nine different prefaces. “Thesaurus Antiquitatum et
                    Historiarum Italiae.” Lugd. Bat. 1704-25, 45 tom. fol. The book is described in
                    the title as “tomis x. vel voluminibus xlv. distinctus each volume consisting of
                    several parts, which amount to the size of volumes. Burman likewise wrote the
                    preface to an edition, undertaken by Graevius, of Gruter’s “Inscriptiones
                    Antiquae totius Orbis Romani.” Amst. 1707, 2 tom. fol.</p>
                <p>His next literary enterprise was an edition of a prose writer, Petronius Arbiter.
                    Traj. ad Rhen. 1709, 4to. The learned editor was attacked in an anonymous
                    publication, consisting of a few pages, and bearing the title of “Burmanniana,
                    sive Calumniarum Petri Burmanni in Collegas et Populares Specimen.” Amst. 1710,
                    12mo. These calumnies are collected from his annotations on Petronius. His most
                    elaborate edition was very unfavourably noticed by Le Clerc,<note

                    xix. p∙ 351 Le Clerc commences his review in the following terms: “Je ne mets

                    confined himself to bis adversary’s literary character. The subsequent passage
                    refers to his morals: “Je ne parlerai pas de l’imprudence qu’il y a à parler

                    us, not in such clear and direct terms of disavowal as might naturally have been
                    expected from a man conscious of his innocence. (Burman, <hi rend="italic"

                    form of a Latin dialogue between bpudaeus and Gorallus; and the manner in which
                    Burman speaks of it seems to justify his suspicions.</p></note> who by the
                    freedom of his strictures in various publications, more particularly in his

                    many eminent members of the republic of letters. Of grammarians and verbal
                    critics he spoke with habitual contempt, and thus increased the offence that was
                    merely personal. Some of his philological mistakes had been exposed by
                    Perizonius, but he was attacked by Burman in a more ferocious manner. His
                    literary delinquencies were fiercely discussed in the preface to Petronius; and
                    his contemptuous review of the edition was followed by a volume entitled “Le
                    Gazettier Menteur, ou Mr. Le Clerc convaincu de Mensonge et de Calomnie, par
                    Pierre Burman.” Utrecht, 1710, 12mo. Whatever may have been the extent of the

                    and it was by no means inconsiderable, the spirit of this work is not to be
                    commended. Burman’s edition was long afterwards attacked in a separate volume,
                    written by some anonymous author, whose animosity was not equalled by his
                    learning.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(rabnen <hi

                    of Florence, the typography is apparently Dutch. Another edition of Petronius
                    appeared after the death of the indefatigable editor. Lugd. Bat. 1743, 4to. Le
                    Clerc had published his unfortunate edition of Menander and Philemon in the year
                    1709; and in the course of the ensuing spring Dr Bentley, under an assumed name,
                    transmitted his <hi rend="italic">Emendationes</hi> to Burman, who lost no time
                    in communicating to the public such a morsel of criticism. Traj. ad Rhen. 1710,
                    8vo. I nder his own name, he prefixed a preface of thirty-four pages, in which
                    he assailed Le Clerc with extreme virulence, and enumerated many errors which
                    the author had leit unnoticed. Not satisfied with relieving his spleen in this
                    manner, he added a poetical address to the Manes of the injured poets, in which
                    he endeavoured to condense the essence of his vituperation. Of the spirit of
                    this effusion the reader may be enabled to judge from a brief specimen:</p>

                </lg>
                <p>Burman soon afterwards published a compendium entitled “Antiquitatum Romanarum
                    brevis Descriptio.” Ultraj. 1711, 8vo. His early study of jurisprudence was not
                    without its advantages in those departments of literature to which he devoted
                    himself with such persevering energy. His knowledge of the civil law he found of
                    frequent use in illustrating the Latin classics; and he published an elaborate
                    and valuable work which bears a reference to law as well as history, “De
                    Vectigalibus Populi Romani Dissertatio.” Ultraj. 1714, 8vo. Of this dissertation
                    the original sketch had appeared in 1694; and he lived to publish an edition
                    greatly improved, and combined with his Jupiter Fulgerator. Leidae, 1734,
                    4to.</p>
                <p>“In 1714,” says Dr Johnson, “he formed a resolution of visiting Paris, not only
                    for the sake of conferring in person, upon questions of literature, with the
                    learned men of that place, and of gratifying his curiosity with a more familiar
                    knowledge of those writers whose works he admired, but with a view more
                    important, of visiting the libraries, and making those enquiries which might be
                    of advantage to his darling study. The vacation of the university allowed him to
                    stay at Paris but six weeks, which he employed with so much dexterity and
                    industry, that he had searched the principal libraries, collated a great number
                    of manuscripts and printed copies, and brought back a great treasure of curious
                    observations. In this visit to Paris he contracted an acquaintance, among other
                    learned men, with the celebrated Father Montfaucon, with whom he conversed, at
                    their first interview, with no other character than that of a traveller; but
                    their discourse turning upon ancient learning, the stranger soon gave such
                    proofs of his attainments, that Montfaucon declared him a very uncommon
                    traveller, and confessed his curiosity to know his name; which he no sooner
                    heard, than he rose from his seat, and, embracing him. with the utmost ardour,
                    expressed his satisfaction at having seen the man whose productions of various
                    kinds he had so often praised; and, as a real proof of his regard, offered not
                    only to procure him an immediate admission to all the libraries of Paris, but to
                    those in remoter provinces, which are not generally open to strangers, and
                    undertook to ease the expenses of his journey by procuring him entertainment in
                    all the monasteries of his order. This favour Burman was hindered from accepting
                    by the necessity of returning to Utrecht, at the usual time of beginning a new
                    course of lectures, to which there was always so great a concourse of students,
                    as much increased the dignity and fame of the university in which he
                    taught.”</p>
                <p>When his talents and learning had thus procured him a high and well-earned
                    reputation, the death of Perizonius left a vacancy in the professorship of
                    history, the Greek language, and eloquence, in the university of Leyden; and
                    Burman had the honour of being nominated the successor of a man who had occupied
                    a very conspicuous place among the scholars of the age. He was distinguished by
                    the acuteness of his intellect, and the solidity of his judgment: he was equally
                    skilled in Greek and Roman literature, and with his critical skill he united a
                    masterly knowledge of the most abstruse departments of ancient history. Burman,
                    who was no unworthy successor, took possession of his chair on the 2d of July
                    1715, and then pronounced an inaugural oration, “De publici Humanioris
                    Disciplinae Professoris proprio Officio et Munere.” He was afterwards appointed
                    professor of the history of the United Provinces, and likewise of poetry; and to
                    all these functions was finally added the office of keeper of the university
                    library. He was twice chosen rector of the university, namely, in 1719 and in
                    1731.</p>
                <p>In the midst of these academical toils, which would have been more than
                    sufficient for a person of ordinary application, he still found leisure for the
                    preparation of elaborate editions of Latin classics, and, among the rest, for an
                    edition of Velleius Paterculus. Lugd. Bat. 1719, 8vo. It was reprinted after the
                    death of the editor. Lugd. Bat. 1744, 8vo. From this ancient historian he made a
                    transition to an ancient rhetorician, and completed an edition of the works of
                    Quintilian. Lugd. Bat. 1720, 3 tom. 4to. The last volume is occupied with the
                    declamations ascribed to that writer, and with those of Calpurnius Flaccus. A
                    pompous edition of Quintilian was afterwards produced by Capperonnier (Paris,
                    1725, fol.); and as Burman thought himself treated with less than due respect,
                    he took an ample revenge in a work entitled “Petri Burmanni Epistola ad Claudium
                    Capperonnerium, Theologum Licentia-tum, Diaconum Ambianensem, et Graecae Linguae
                    Professorem, de nova ejus Μ. Fabii Quinctiliani de Institutione Oratoria
                    Editione.” Leidae, 1726, 4to. Among other branches of learning, the Parisian
                    professor has betrayed his ignorance of the Roman law, and on this account is
                    severely chastised by his unrelenting adversary. But in the mean time Burman had
                    superintended an edition of Justin, which is without a commentary, but contains
                    an excellent preface. Lugd. Bat. 1722, 12mo.</p>
                <p>His editorial labours were next bestowed upon a modern author, whose fame is
                    nearly classical. An elaborate edition of Buchanan had been published by
                    Ruddiman in the year 1715. The value of his annotations was very generally
                    acknowledged, but the narrow and pitiful prejudices of a Jacobite frequently
                    entangled his judgment; and every subject which bore to politics any reference,
                    however remote, was viewed through a dim medium. The political tendency of his
                    preface and notes was so far from being agreeable to the admirers of Buchanan,

                <p>association was speedily formed at Edinburgh, for the express purpose of
                    vindicating their favourite author in a new edition of his works. Their efforts
                    however proved abortive, and the task of editorship devolved into more able
                    hands. Arrested by the frequent and wide variation between the author and his
                    <hi rend="italic">jure</hi><hi rend="italic">divino</hi> editor, Burman had
                    nearly been induced to relinquish his undertaking, and to advise his printer
                    Langerak to procure assistance from Scotland, where the authenticity of the
                    facts could best be ascertained. Of the new edition projected at Edinburgh he
                    was likewise apprized; though it does not appear, as some writers pretend, that
                    the associated critics made him a voluntary offer of private assistance. The
                    printer however urging him to proceed without waiting for this vindicatory
                    edition, he at length republished the works of Buchanan, together with
                    Ruddiman’s preface, notes, dissertation, and other appendages.<note

                    entirely philological. His other engagements did not permit him to undertake the
                    task of correcting the press; and accordingly his edition is somewhat less
                    accurate than that of his predecessor. The general value of Ruddiman’s labours
                    he acknowledges in terms of due respect; but he occasionally rejects his
                    particular opinions in a manner which that learned man was disposed to regard as
                    contemptuous; and some of his expressions relative to British literature, and to
                    the native country of Buchanan, were such as could not easily be forgotten. Two
                    years afterwards, when Ruddiman edited the Latin poems of Dr Pitcairne, he
                    eagerly embraced an opportunity of asserting the honour of his native country;
                    and the same topics were yet fresh in his recollection when he resumed his long
                    labours at the venerable age of eighty-one.</p>
                <p>Of the epistolary correspondence of literary men, Burman was a curious and
                    diligent collector. At a much earlier period of his life he had published the
                    epistle of Gudius and other scholars; and he now prepared a more ample and
                    voluminous work, which appeared under the title of “Sylloge Epistolarum a Viris
                    illustribus scriptarum.” Leidae, 1727, 5 tom. 4to. This collection, which forms
                    a great repository of literary anecdote and critical disquisition, is
                    occasionally illustrated with the notes of the editor. In the course of the same
                    year, he completed the printing of a work which holds a very distinguished place
                    among his learned labours, namely, his edition of the works of Ovid. Amst. 1727,
                    4 tom. 4to. Like several of his other editions of the classics, it contains not
                    merely his own notes, but likewise those of various commentators. Ovid was
                    evidently one of his favourite authors, and he has bestowed much care and
                    attention in the adjustment of the text, as well as in its illustration. With
                    regard to the text, his chief guide is Nicoaus Heinsius, a most able critic in
                    Latin poetry. Burman had formerly published a small edition without a
                    commentary. His next edition, <hi rend="italic">cum notis variorum,</hi> was
                    that of the “Poetae Latini Minores.” Leidae, 1731, 2 tom. 4to. This curious
                    collection was succeeded by an edition, equally elaborate, of the works of
                    Suetonius. Amst. 1736, 2 tom. 4to. After another short interval followed “M.
                    Annaei Lucani Pharsalia, cum commentario Petri Burmanni.” Leidae,1740, 4to. In
                    the preface to this publication, he speaks of Bentley with some degree of
                    asperity. They were both men of great eminence in classical literature; and
                    although they were both of the same irascible temper, the friendly relations
                    between them had been of long duration. Some suspicions and jealousies had
                    however intervened, in consequence of their having each projected an edition of
                    Lucan ata much earlier period; and the breach had been rendered irreparable, by
                    Burman’s decisive measure of subjoining Dr Hare’s <hi rend="italic">Epistola
                    Critica</hi> to his fourth edition of Phaedrus.<note anchored="true"

                <p>But the labours of this indefatigable scholar were now drawing to a close. His
                    health had originally been vigorous, and those who have the slightest
                    acquaintance with his history must be aware that he was capable of enduring
                    great and continued toil. His temperate mode of living, and his attention to
                    bodily exercise, long contributed to preserve a healthful constitution; but a
                    scorbutic disease, incidental to that climate, having supervened, he found
                    himself unable to take his usual walks, or other recreation, and was at last
                    afflicted with many painful symptoms of a decayed frame and shattered nerves.
                    While he languished in a state of hopeless decay, he had the honour of receiving
                    a letter from Bignon, keeper of the royal library at Paris, accompanying a copy
                    of the printed catalogue, transmitted to him by his majesty’s command. This mark
                    of royal favour might possibly cast a faint gleam of earthly comfort on his bed
                    of sickness; but he now required consolation from a higher source, and with a
                    due mixture of fervour and humility he appears to have approached the fountain
                    of living waters. His religious opinions had either been misunderstood or
                    misrepresented; and he felt a commendable solicitude to remove this erroneous
                    impression, by the most unequivocal declaration of his hopes in the mercy of God
                    through the mediation of Jesus Christ. In this devout frame of mind he closed a
                    long and active life, on the 31st day of March 1741, in the seventy-third year
                    of his age.</p>
                <p>At the period of his death, he had made great progress in a new edition of
                    Virgil, and it was afterwards completed by his learned nephew, who bore the same
                    name with himself. Amst. 1746, 4 tom. 4to. To the younger Burman we are likewise
                    indebted for the collective edition of his poems, which appeared under the
                    following title: “Petri Burmanni Poematum libri quatuor, nunc primum in lucem
                    editi, curante Petro Burmanno Juniore.” Amst. 1746, 4to. His orations were
                    collected by another editor, Nicoaus Bondt: “Petri Burmanni Orationes, antea
                    sparsim editae, et ineditis auctae. Accedit Carminum Appendix.” Hagae Comitis,
                    1759, 4to. Of the Latin language Burman possessed a masterly knowledge, and in
                    verse as well as prose he writes with vivacity and energy; but he is less
                    scrupulous in his diction than some more recent members of the same university,
                    especially Ruhnkenius and Wytten-bach. He is entitled to the praise of a skilful
                    versifier; and his elegiac poems are sufficient to evince that he had not
                    studied Ovid in vain. His orations, which are eighteen in number, had been
                    delivered on various occasions of academical solemnity, and several of them
                    contain a large infusion of verse. The collection is closed by a funeral
                    oration, written by his colleague, H. Oosterdyk Schacht, from which we have
                    borrowed most of our notices respecting his personal history; but our account of
                    his writings is necessarily derived from other sources. In this enumeration of
                    his posthumous works, it remains to be mentioned that his annotations on
                    Claudian were printed in his nephew’s edition of that poet.</p>
                <p>The character of Burman is ably and impartially delineated by Dr Johnson. “He was
                    a man of moderate stature, of great strength and activity, which he preserved by
                    temperate diet, without medical exactness, and by allotting proportions of his
                    time to relaxation and amusement, not suffering his studies to exhaust his
                    strength, but <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742424" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2424-0720"
                    />relieving them by frequent intermissions; a practice consistent with the most
                    exemplary diligence, and which he that omits will find at last that time may be
                    lost, like money, by unseasonable avarice. In his hours of relaxation he was
                    gay, and sometimes gave way so far to his temper, naturally satirical, that he
                    drew upon himself the ill-will of those who had been unfortunately the subjects
                    of his mirth; but enemies so provoked he thought it beneath him to regard or to
                    pacify; for he was fiery, but not malicious, disdained dissimulation, and in his
                    gay or serious hours preserved a settled detestation of falsehood.<note

                    appears rather from judicious compilations, than original productions. His style
                    is lively and masculine, but not without harshness and constraint, nor perhaps
                    always polished to that purity which some writers have attained. He was at least
                    instrumental to the instruction of mankind, by the publication of many valuable
                    performances, which lay neglected by the-greatest part of the learned world;
                    and, if reputation be estimated by usefulness, he may claim a higher degree in

                <p>Such was the personal and literary character of Burman, as it presented itself to
                    the sagacious observation of this distinguished writer. His name however is less
                    favourably known to the readers of English poetry, where it is repeatedly used
                    to denote whatever is dull and pedantic. Pope, who was not himself a very
                    profound scholar, endeavoured to restore a sort of equilibrium by disparaging
                    the attainments of those who were most conspicuous for their erudition. Bentley
                    is supposed to have excited his spleen by bestowing a too scanty measure of
                    praise on his translation of Homer; nor did the poet neglect any opportunity of
                    directing the edge of his satire against “that awful Aristarch,” and those who
                    successfully cultivated similar studies. The following verses occur in the <hi

                <p>If to his other qualifications Pope had added one half of the critical learning
                    possessed by Bentley, Kuster, Burman, or Wasse, he would have found himself in a
                    better condition for writing notes on Homer. Mallet, who was anxious to
                    recommend himself to the favour of so great a poet, aimed his shafts in the same
                    direction. His poem <hi rend="italic">Of Verbal Grit</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∖</hi><hi rend="italic">cism</hi> contains the subsequent passage:</p>

                </lg>
                <p>Dr Armstrong, a contemporary poet, has indulged in a similar vein of sarcasm; nor
                    do we feel much inclination to commend these lines in his <hi rend="italic">Art

                <p>The injustice and absurdity of such censures as these it would here be idle to
                    expose. If we admit the value of the ancient classics, we must also admit the
                    expediency of their being rendered intelligible; and how this could have been
                    effected without the intervention of critics and philologers, it would not
                    perhaps be so easy to discover. Bentley, Burman, and many other verbal critics
                    who might be enumerated, were possessed of uncommon talents, as well as
                    erudition; and the ingredients which enter into the formation of an able
                    commentator on the classics, are more rare and more numerous than some
                    individuals may be apt to imagine.</p>
                <p>Of the two surviving sons of Burman, the elder, named Francis, made choice of a
                    military life, and obtained promotion in the army. His brother Caspar, who
                    betook himself to the profession of the law, was elevated to the bench, and was
                    elected a deputy to the states general. He was likewise a man of letters, and
                    published several works, which illustrate the civil and literary history of his
                    native country. “Analecta Historica de Hadriano VI. Pontifice Maximo.” Traj. ad
                    Rhen. 1727, 4to. “Trajectum eruditum, Virorum Doctrina inlustrium, qui in Urbe
                    Trajectina, et Regione Trajectensi nati sunt, sive ibi habitarunt, Vitas, Fata,
                    et Scripta exhibens.” Traj. ad Rhen. 1738, 4to. He is also the author of a work
                    in the Dutch language, published in 1750-1 under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Utrechte Jaarbocken,</hi> and extending to three volumes. He died on the 22d of
                    August 1755.</p>
                <p>His grandfather Francis Burman, who has already been mentioned as professor of
                    divinity at Utrecht, published various works on theology.<note anchored="true"

                    son Francis was born at Utrecht in 1671, became professor of divinity in that
                    university in 1715, and died in 1718. He was the author of different works,
                    written in the Latin and Dutch languages. His son John Burman, Μ. D. was born in
                    1707, was appointed professor of botany at Amsterdam, and died in 1780. He
                    evinced much zeal in his own branch of science, and published several works on
                    botany. Nicoas Laurens Burman, Μ. D. his son, and his successor in . the
                    botanical chair, was born in 1734, and died in 1793, after having produced some
                    works in his own department. Francis Burman, the brother of John, was the third
                    individual of the same name and family who held the professorship of divinity at
                    Utrecht.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Biographie

                <p>But a more conspicuous member of the same remarkable family, was his other
                    brother Peter Burman. On the 13th of October 1714 he was born at Amsterdam,
                    where his father was then a minister. When only four years of age he lost his
                    father, and the care of his education devolved upon his uncle, who communicated
                    to him his own ardent love of classical learning. His academical studies he
                    completed at Utrecht, where in 1734 he took the degree of doctor of laws, having
                    previously written and defended a dissertation <hi rend="italic">De Jure
                    Annulorum</hi><hi rend="italic">aureorum,</hi> which has been thought worthy of
                    being reprinted in the collection of Oelrichs.<note anchored="true"

                    nominated professor of eloquence<pb break="no" facs="nls:193742437"

                    room of Wesseling, who had been removed to Utrecht. The chair of poetry was in
                    1741 added to his other appointments; but in the course of the following year he
                    accepted of an invitation to the Athenaeum of Amsterdam, where he became
                    professor of history, eloquence, the Greek language, and poetry, keeper of the
                    public library, and visitor of the Latin schools. In his literary character he
                    bore a considerable resemblance to his more celebrated uncle, and was evidently
                    a man of extensive learning.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Habebat enim cum ipse maximam doctrinae copiam, tum vero

                    an ample collection of his Latin poems. “Petri Bunnan-ni Secundi Poematum libri
                    quatuor.” Lugd. Bat. 1774, 4to. “Carminum Appendix.” Lugd. Bat. 1779, 4to. He
                    edited several of the classics on a plan similar to that commonly adopted by his
                    uncle. We have already mentioned the edition of Virgil, completed by his learned
                    labour, and' must now continue the enumeration of his classical publications.
                    “Anthologia veterum Latinorum Epigram-matumet Poematum, sive Catalecta Poetarum
                    Latinorum.” Amst. 1759—73, 2 tom. 4to. “Aristophanis Comoediae undecim Graece et
                    Latine.” Lugd. Bat. 1.760, 2 tom. 4to. “Claudii Claudiani Opera.” Amst. 1760,
                    4to. “Ciceronis (vel incerti auctoris) Rhetoricoum ad Herennium libri quatuor,
                    et de Inventione libri duo.” Lugd. Bat. 1761, 8vo. “Propertii Elegiarum libri
                    IV.” Traj. ad Rhen. 1780, 4to. This last work, which he did not himself bring to
                    a conclusion, was conducted through the press by Van Santen, an elegant and
                    correct scholar, who, under the name of Santenius, is well known to those who
                    are acquainted with the literary history of that age. At an earlier period,
                    Burman had published a modern poet in the same elaborate and splendid manner.
                    “Petri Lotichii Secundi Opera omnia.” Amst. 1754, 2 tom. 4to. He likewise
                    undertook the task of editing the works of some modern critics. “Henrici Valesii
                    Emendationum libri V. et de Critica libri duo,” &amp;c. Amst. 1740, 4to. “Nicoai
                    Heinsii Adversariorum libri IV.” &amp;c. Harlingae, 1742, 4to. Of his personal
                    history, a few particulars remain to be told. He was thrice married. About a
                    year before his death, he resigned his professorship, and having received a
                    liberal pension from the curators of the Athenaeum, he retired to his villa at
                    Santhorst, in the hope of long enjoying literary repose; but having been struck
                    with apoplexy, he expired on the 24th of June 1778. He appears to have been a
                    person of a disposition sufficiently irritable: he was from time to time
                    involved in various strifes and contentions; and his quarrels with a Dutch and a
                    German professor, Saxius and Klotz, gave occasion to many inveetives in the
                    Latin, Dutch, and German languages.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Harlesius de Vitis Philologorum, vol. i. p. 114.</p></note>
                    According to the testimony of his adversaries, he was not remarkable for his
                    sobriety. To this alleged failing Klotz alludes in the following ludicrous
                    verses, written in the character of the schoolmaster of Santhorst.</p>
