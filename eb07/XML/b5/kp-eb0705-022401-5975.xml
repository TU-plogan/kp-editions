                <p><label type="entry">BRECHIN</label>, a town of Scotland, in the county of Forfar
                    and parish of Brechin, is situated on the face of a hill about the centre of the
                    parish, on the left bank of the River South Esk, which is crossed below the town
                    by a stone bridge of two arches. Brechin consists of one main street running
                    north and south, with several smaller streets. On the south, the town is
                    continued by two suburbs named the Upper and Nether Tenements, which hold in feu
                    of the families of South Esk and Panmure.</p>
                <p>This town is said to have been the capital of Pictavia, and the royal seat of the
                    Pictish kings; and the hill of Caterthun, about four miles north of the town,
                    surrounded with an immense coronal of loose stones, is supposed to have been a
                    fortification belonging to that ancient nation. In the earliest record extant,
                    the name of the town is spelt as at present; but as in the days of St Columba
                    there was a noted Druid of the name of “Broichan,” probably the town may have
                    derived its appellation from some such source. The Culdees are reported to have
                    had a convent here; and their abbot Leod was witness to the grant made by King
                    David to his new abbey of Dunfermline. In after-times the Culdees gave way to
                    the Mathurines or Red Friars, the ruins of whose house, according to Maitland,
                    are still to be seen in the College or Chandry Wand.</p>
                <p>Brechin was founded into a bishopric by David I. about 1150. At the Reformation
                    its revenues amounted in money and kind to L.700 per annum; but after that event
                    they were miserably reduced by various grants, and mainly by the alienation of
                    lands and tithes, by Alexander Campbell, the first Protestant bishop, to his
                    chieftain the Earl of Argyll. In 1572 James VI. with consent of John Earl of
                    Morton, Regent, founded an hospital in the burgh. “Mr George Buchanan, pensioner
                    of Crossragwell,” is one of the witnesses to the grant, which was ratified by
                    his majesty in 1587, when he attained majority. The magistrates and council are
                    patrons of this charity, from which they give a small weekly allowance to the
                    poor, no hospital apparently having ever been erected. William de Brechin
                    founded a chapel in 1256, called Maison de Dieu. Albinus, bishop of Brechin in
                    the reign of Alexander II. was witness to the grant. Parts of the walls of the
                    chapel still remain in the Maison Dieu Vennel, a little west of the High Street,
                    and prove that the chapel had originally been an elegant little building. The
                    house itself, and the property about it, with the superiority of some other
                    lands, are generally gifted by the crown to the rector of the grammar-school
                    during his incumbency, who hence takes the title of preceptor of Maison-dieu.
                    The cathedral, which is now used as the parish church, was originally a handsome
                    Gothic building; but its appearance has been much injured by modern
                    “improvements.” The steeple attached is a noble-looking square tower, with an
                    octagon spire, rising to the height of 128 feet. Close to the church stands the
                    round tower, one of those singular structures which are generally supposed to
                    have been places of look-out belonging to the Picts, although their real use has
                    long baffled the research of antiquaries. These towers are peculiar to North
                    Britain and Ireland; in the latter they are frequent, in the former only two at
                    this time exist, one at Brechin and another at Abernethy. There is no stair in
                    the Brechin tower, and the only access to the top is· by means of six ladders
                    placed on wooden semicircular floors,' which rest on circular projections within
                    the tower. The height from the ground to the roof is eighty-five feet, the inner
                    diameter within a few feet of the bottom is eight feet, and the thickness of the
                    wall at that part four feet two inches, so that the whole diameter is nearly
                    sixteen feet; the circumference is very near forty-eight feet; the inner
                    diameter at top is six feet seven inches, the thickness of the wall two feet ten
                    inches, and the circumference thirty-eight feet eight inches. These proportions
                    give the building an inexpressible elegance. The top is roofed with an octagonal
                    spire eighteen feet high, which makes the whole height of the building 103 feet.
                    Certain it is, that during strong winds this tower has often been observed to
                    vibrate. A stone built into the wall of the church-yard, evidently modernized,
                    but most probably copied from an older stone, records, in not inelegant Latin,
                    that during 1647 six hundred persons died of the plague in Brechin in the course
                    of four months.</p>
                <p>Within the burgh there is a house said to have been a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hospitium</hi> of the knights templars, now appropriately used as an inn. These
                    knights seem to have had some lands in the neighbourhood, as there is a piece of
                    ground close by Brechin bearing the title of Temple Hill of Bothers. A little to
                    the north of this last-mentioned place is Huntly Hill, remarkable for the battle
                    fought there between ’ the Earls of Huntly and Crawford, in consequence of the
                    rebellion raised in 1452, on account of the murder of the Earl of Douglas in
                    Stirling Castle. The victory fell to the royalists under Huntly, who has hence
                    given his name to the ground/</p>
                <p>Brechin Castle, the seat of Lord Panmure, stands on the brink of a perpendicular
                    rock overhanging the South Esk, a ’ little to the south of the town. This castle
                    was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193735988" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5988-0225"/>besieged
                    by the English under Edward I. in 1303, and was for twenty days gallantly
                    defended by Sir Thomas Maule, ancestor of the family of Panmure, who was slain
                    by a stone thrown from an engine placed on the opposite rising ground, when the
                    castle was instantly surrendered. The south front of the castle above the river
                    presents a romantic mixed mass of buildings, covered with ivy, and showing some
                    remains of the original structure. The west front forms a regular building, in
                    the style of the seventeenth century.</p>
                <p>Brechin was burnt by the Danes in 1012, and by the Marquis of Montrose in 1645.
                    At present it has a neat appearance, the excellent free-stone quarries in the
                    vicinity giving every opportunity for substantial erections. The chief
                    manufactures of this place consist of various branches of the linen trade. There
                    is also an extensive distillery in the town, and a smaller one in the immediate
                    vicinity; and at the mills of Brechin a good deal of wheat is ground for distant
                    markets. Brechin has a market every Tuesday, which is well frequented by dealers
                    in grain. About a mile from the town, on the Trinity Muir, four annual fairs are
                    held, the principal of which takes place in June. The town is governed by a
                    provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, seven merchant and two trades’
                    counsellors. This burgh is the seat of a presbytery, and, besides the
                    Presbyterian church, it contains a neat Episcopal chapel, two meeting-houses
                    belonging to the United Associate Synod, one belonging to the Original Seceders,
                    and a Relief chapel. There is an endowed grammarschool under a rector, and a
                    parochial school under two teachers besides assistants, with several private
                    schools, in the town.</p>
                <p>Maitland, the laborious historian of Edinburgh and London, and Dr John Gillies,
                    the historian of Greece, were natives of this place. James Tytler, an eccentric
                    and unfortunate personage, one of the contributors to the early editions of the
                    Encyclopaedia Britannica, was born in the immediate neighbourhood. The
                    population of the town and Tenements in 1831 was 5060. Brechin is eight miles
                    from Montrose, thirteen from the county town of Forfar, forty-two from Aberdeen,
                    and the same distance from Perth. Long. 2. 18. W*. Lat. 56. 40. N.</p>
