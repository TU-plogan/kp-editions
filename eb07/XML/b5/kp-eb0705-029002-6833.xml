                <p><label type="entry">BRISSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mathurin James</hi></label>, a
                    zoologist and natural philosopher, born at Fontenay-le-Comte, 3d April 1723, the
                    son of Mathurin Brisson and Louisa Gabrielle Jourdain. He was originally
                    intended for the church, but he had acquired at an early age a taste for natural
                    history, which was particularly encouraged by the advantage that he enjoyed of
                    passing his holidays with the justly-celebrated Reaumur, who had an estate near
                    Fontenay. At the age of twenty-four he had made great progress in his
                    theological studies, and had fully qualified himself for the rank of a
                    subdeacon; but his courage failed him at the time appointed for taking orders,
                    and he then determined to confine himself to the study of physical sciences.
                    Reaumur had the direction of the chemical laboratory of the Academy of Sciences,
                    and had given up the salary attached to it to several young men in succession,
                    whom he appointed as his assistants, and of whom Pitot and Nollet became
                    afterwards the most distinguished. He now chose Brisson for the situation, which
                    served him, as it had done his predecessors, rather as a step in his advancement
                    with respect to general science, than in enabling him to pursue any objects more
                    immediately chemical; and he followed his passion in attaching himself almost
                    exclusively to natural history. The collection of Reaumur furnished him with
                    ample materials for his studies, and with the principal subjects described in
                    his works on the <hi rend="italic">Animal Kingdom.</hi> The first of these was
                    published in 1756, containing quadrupeds and cetaceous animals. It consists of
                    simple descriptions of the different species, together with synonyms in various
                    languages, more in the nature of a prodromus than of a complete history. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Ornithologie</hi> appeared in 1760, forming six volumes, and
                    containing a number of well-executed plates. But upon Reaumur’s death, the
                    collection having been added to the royal cabinet, Messrs Buffon and Daubenton,
                    the directors of that cabinet, not affording him all the accommodations that he
                    expected, he discontinued the work, and altogether renounced the study of
                    natural history in favour of natural philosophy.</p>
                <p>Μ. Brisson had been chosen a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1759: he soon
                    afterwards associated himself with the Abbé Nollet in delivering lectures on
                    experimental physics, and obtained the reversion of his appointments of
                    professor in the college of Navarre, and instructor of the royal family in
                    natural philosophy and natural history. The subject of electricity was at this
                    time warmly debated between Nollet and Franklin; and Μ. Brisson had a difficult
                    task to perform, in discussing the merits of a mistaken friend and an
                    overbearing opponent; but, in fact, this department of science was at that time
                    too little understood to make it disgraceful for Nollet to be in error with
                    respect to the utility of conductors, or for Brisson to remain neutral upon this
                    and other similar questions. He seems, however, by no means to have adhered to
                    the character of neutrality in his anonymous <hi rend="italic">Translation</hi>
                    of Priestley’s <hi rend="italic">History of Electricity,</hi> published in 1771,
                    and accompanied by notes, which exhibit a spirit of acrimonious criticism, not
                    at all calculated to enhance the merit of the work which he wished to introduce
                    to the notice of his countrymen» He also attempted, in an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay on Waterspouts,</hi> published in the Memoirs of the academy, to explain
                    a variety of electrical phenomena, by means of the different currents of fluid
                    imagined by Nollet, but certainly with very little success.</p>
                <p>He afterwards undertook a course of experiments on the <hi rend="italic">Specific
                    Gravity of Alcohol and Water,</hi> mixed in different proportions, which led him
                    to a conjecture, at that time somewhat singular, that water was not a
                    homogeneous substance. He assisted Μ. Trudaine and other observers in the
                    experiments which they made on <hi rend="italic">Heat and Light</hi> with the
                    powerful lens of Bernière; and, in conjunction with Μ. Cadct, he endeavoured to
                    disprove the opinion of Beccaria, that electricity has a power of reviving the
                    <hi rend="italic">metallic oxides.</hi> He also made experiments on the <hi
                    rend="italic">refractive powers</hi> of fluids which might be substituted for
                    flint glass in the object-glasses of telescopes; on the utility of different
                    kinds of <hi rend="italic">steel for magnetical purposes;</hi> and on the mode
                    of renewal of the <hi rend="italic">shells of some species of snails.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1772, Μ. Brisson published a memoir on the <hi rend="italic">Specific
                    Gravities of Metals,</hi> a subject which, in all its extent, occupied a great
                    portion of his attention during twenty years of his life. The results of his
                    experiments on a great variety of substances were collected into a single volume
                    of <hi rend="italic">Tables of Specific Gravities,</hi> which was published in
                    1787. It was principally for the use of students who attended his lectures that
                    he published his <hi rend="italic">Traite de Physique</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionnaire,</hi> both of them containing elementary and popular
                    information, rather calculated exclusively for the immediate purpose which they
                    were intended to serve, than for being of permanent utility in the promotion of
                    the sciences. At a late period of his life he renewed his attention to the
                    subject of chemistry, when the discoveries of his junior contemporaries had
                    given greater certainty and precision to its laws; and his last work was an <hi
                    rend="italic">Elementary Treatise</hi> on that science, intended for the use of
                    his pupils in the central school.</p>
                <p>FIis whole life was occupied in his studies, and the history of his various works
                    comprehends the history of everything that is to be recorded concerning him.
                    After eighty years of uninterrupted activity of mind, an attack of apoplexy
                    reduced him to a state of second childhood, and effaced from his memory all
                    traces even of his native language, except a few words of the dialect of Poitou,
                    which he had spoken when he was a boy. He died on the 23d of June 1806, and his
                    place in the academy was filled by Μ. Guy-Lussac. (Delambre, <hi rend="italic"
