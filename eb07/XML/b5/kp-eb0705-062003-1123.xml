                <p><label type="entry">BUCANEER</label>, one who dries and smokes flesh or fish
                    after the manner of the Indians. The name was particularly given to the first
                    French settlers on the island of St Domingo or Hayti, whose sole employment
                    consisted in Hunting bulls or wild boars, in order to sell their hides and
                    flesh. The name has also been applied to those famous piratical adventurers,
                    chiefly English and French, who joined together to commit depredations on the
                    Spaniards of America. Of both these we shall give an account.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">The Bucaneers of St Domingo.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    The Spaniards had not long been in possession of the West Indies and of the
                    continent of America, when other nations, especially the English and French,
                    began to seek establishments there. But though the Spaniards were unable to
                    people such extensive countries themselves, they were resolved that no others
                    should do it for them, and therefore waged a cruel war on all those of any other
                    nation who attempted to settle in any of the Antilles or Caribbee Islands. The
                    French, however, were at last lucky enough to acquire some footing in the island
                    of St Christophers; but by the time they began to subside into a regular form of
                    government, the Spaniards found means to dislodge them. Upon this the wretched
                    fugitives, considering at how great a distance they were from their mother
                    country, and how near to the island of Hispaniola or St Domingo, the northern
                    parts of which were then uninhabited, and full of swine and black cattle,
                    immediately resolved to take possession of that country, in conjunction with
                    several other adventurers of their own and the English nation; especially as the
                    Dutch, who now began to appear in these seas, promised to supply them
                    plentifully with all kinds of necessaries they might require, in exchange for
                    the hides and tallow they should procure by hunting.</p>
                <p>These new settlers obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">bucaneers,</hi> from
                    their custom of bucanning their beef and pork in order to keep it for sale or
                    for their own consumption. But some of them soon grew tired of this new way of
                    life, and took to planting; whilst many more chose to turn pirates, trusting to
                    find among those who remained on shore a quick sale for all the plunder they
                    could make at sea. This new body of adventurers were called <hi rend="italic"
                    >freebooters,</hi> from their making free prey or booty of whatever came in
                    their way.</p>
                <p>The colony now began to thrive at a great rate, by the cheap and easy manner in
                    which the freebooters acquired the greatest riches, and the profusion with which
                    they distributed them amongst their old companions, the bucaneers and planters,
                    for the merest trifles. This brought numbers of settlers from France in quality
                    of indentured servants, though they toiled rather like slaves than servants
                    during the three years for which they generally bound themselves. One of these
                    men presuming to represent to his master, who always fixed upon a Sunday for
                    sending him with skins to the port, that God had forbidden such a practice when
                    he had declared that “six days shalt thou labour, and on the seventh day shalt
                    thou rest,” the brutish bucaneer replied, “And I say to thee, six days shalt
                    thou kill bulls, and strip them of their skins, and on the seventh day shalt
                    thou carry their hides to the sea shores; and this command was followed by
                    blows. Thus the colony consisted of four classes; bucaneers, freebooters,
                    planters, and indentured servants who generally remained with the bucaneers or
                    planters. And these four orders composed what they now began to call the <hi
                    rend="italic">body of adventurers,</hi> who lived together in perfect harmony,
                    under a kind of democracy; every freeman having a despotic authority over his
                    own family, and every captain being sovereign in his ship, though liable to be
                    discarded at the discretion of the crew. .</p>
                <p>The planters had settled chiefly in the little island of Tortuga, on the northern
                    coast of Hispaniola; but soon afterwards some of them having gone to the great
                    island to hunt with the bucaneers, the rest were surprised by the Spaniards; and
                    all, even those who had surrendered at discretion in hopes of mercy, were put to
                    the sword or hanged. The next care of the Spaniards was to rid tie great island
                    of the bucaneers; and for this purpose they assembled a body of five hundred
                    lance-men, who, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741136" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1136-0621"
                    />their seldom going fewer than fifty in a company, obtained from their enemies
                    the name of the <hi rend="italic">Fifties.</hi> But before detailing the
                    particulars of this attack we shall endeavour to give some account of the
                    manners and customs of the people whom it was proposed to extirpate.</p>
                <p>The bucaneers lived in little huts built on some spots of cleared ground, just
                    large enough to dry their skins on, and contain their bucanning houses. These
                    spots they called <hi rend="italic">boucans,</hi> and the huts they dwelt in <hi
                    rend="italic">ajoupas</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> a word which they
                    borrowed from the Spaniards, and the Spaniards from the natives. Though these
                    ajoupas lay <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> open on all sides, they were very
                    agreeable to the hardy inhabitants, in a climate where wind and air are so very
                    desirable things. As the bucaneers had neither wives nor children, they
                    associated by pairs, and mutually rendered each other all the services a master
                    could reasonably expect from a servant, living together in so perfect a
                    community, that the survivor always succeeded his deceased partner. This kind of
                    union or fellowship they called <hi rend="italic">Śemateloter</hi>
                    (insailoring), and each other <hi rend="italic">matelot</hi> (sailor), whence is
                    derived the custom of giving, at least in some parts of the French Antilles, the
                    name <hi rend="italic">matelotage</hi> (sailorage) to any kind of society formed
                    by private persons for their mutual advantage. They behaved to each other with
                    the greatest justice and openness of heart; it was considered as a crime to keep
                    any thing under lock and key; but, on the other hand, the least pilfering was
                    unpardonable, and punished with expulsion from the community. And, indeed, there
                    could be no great temptation to steal, seeing it was reckoned a point of honour
                    never to refuse a neighbour what he wanted; and where there was so little
                    property, it was impossible there should be many disputes. If any such happened,
                    the common friends of the parties at variance interposed, and soon put an end to
                    the difference.</p>
                <p>As to laws, the bucaneers acknowledged none but an odd jumble of conventions made
                    between themselves, which, however, they regarded as the sovereign rule. They
                    silenced all objections by coolly answering, that it was not the custom of the
                    coast; and grounded their right of acting in this manner on their baptism under
                    the tropic, which freed them, in their opinion, from all obligations antecedent
                    to that marine ceremony. The governor of Tortuga, when that island was again
                    settled, though appointed by the French court, had very little authority over
                    them; and they contented themselves with rendering him from time to time some
                    slight homage. They had in a manner entirely shaken off the yoke of religion,
                    and thought they did a great deal in not wholly forgetting the God of their
                    fathers. We are surprised to meet with nations among whom it is a difficult
                    matter to discover any trace of a religious worship; and yet it is certain, that
                    had the bucaneers of St Domingo been perpetuated on the same footing on which
                    they subsisted at the time we are speaking of, the third or fourth generation of
                    them would have possessed as little religion as the Caffres and Hottentots of
                    Africa, or the Cannibals of the South Sea Islands.</p>
                <p>They even laid aside their surnames, and assumed nicknames or martial names, most
                    of which afterwards continued in their families. Many, however, on their
                    marrying, which seldom happened till they turned planters, took care to have
                    their real surnames inserted in the French contract; and this practice gave
                    occasion to a proverb, which long remained current in the French Antilles, that
                    a man is not to be known till he takes a wife.</p>
                <p>Their dress consisted of a filthy greasy shirt, dyed with the blood of the
                    animals they killed; a pair of trousers still more nasty; a thong of leather by
                    way of belt, to which they hung a case containing some Dutch knives, and a kind
                    of short sabre called <hi rend="italic">manchette;</hi> a hat without any brim,
                    except a little flap in the front; and shoes of hogskin, all of a piece. Their
                    guns were four feet and a half in the barrel, and of a calibre sufficient to
                    admit balls of an ounce. Every man had his contract servants, more or fewer
                    according to his abilities; besides a pack of twenty or thirty dogs, among which
                    there was always a couple of beagles. Their chief employment at first was
                    ox-hunting; and if at any time they chased a wild hog, it was rather for
                    pastime, or to make provision for a feast, than for any other advantage. But in
                    process of time some of them betook themselves entirely to the hunting of hogs,
                    whose flesh they bucanned in the following manner: first, they cut the flesh
                    into long pieces, an inch and a half thick, and sprinkled them with salt, which
                    they rubbed off after twenty-four hours; then they dried these pieces in stoves,
                    over a fire made of the skin and bones of the beast, till they grew as hard as a
                    board, and assumed a deep brown colour. Pork prepared in this manner might be
                    kept in casks a twelvemonth and longer; and when steeped a little while in
                    lukewarm water, it became plump and rosy, yielding, either broiled, boiled, or
                    otherwise dressed, a grateful smell, sufficient to tempt the most languid
                    appetite and please the most delicate palate.</p>
                <p>In hunting, they set out at day-break, preceded by the beagles, and followed by
                    their servants with the rest of the dogs; and as they made it a point never to
                    baulk their beagles, they were often led by them over the most frightful
                    precipices, and through places which any other mortal would have deemed
                    absolutely impassable. As soon as the beagles had roused the game, the rest of
                    the dogs struck up and surrounded the beast, stopping it, and keeping a constant
                    barking till the bucaneer could get near enough to shoot it, in doing which he
                    commonly aimed at the pit of the breast; and when the beast fell he hamstrung
                    it, to prevent its rising again. But it has sometimes happened that the
                    creature, not wounded enough to tumble to the ground, has run furiously at his
                    pursuer, and ripped him open. In general, however, the bucaneer seldom missed
                    his aim; and when he did, he was nimble enough to get up the tree behind which
                    he usually had the precaution to place himself; whilst some of them have been
                    seen to overtake the beast in chase, and hamstring it without any further
                    ceremony.</p>
                <p>As soon as the prey was half skinned, the master cut out a large bone, and sucked
                    the marrow for breakfast; leaving the rest to his servants, one of whom always
                    remained behind to finish the skinning, and bring the skin, with a choice piece
                    of meat for the huntsman’s dinner. They then continued the chase till they had
                    killed as many beasts as there were heads in the company. The master was the
                    last to return to the boucan, loaded like the rest with a skin and a piece of
                    meat. Here the bucaneers found their tables ready; for every one had his
                    separate table, which was the first thing, any way fit for the purpose, that
                    came in their way, a stone, the trunk of a tree, and the like. No table-cloth,
                    no napkin, no bread or wine, graced their board; not even potatoes, or bananas,
                    unless they found them ready to their hand. When this did not happen, the fat
                    and lean of the game, taken alternately, served to supply the place. A little
                    pimento, and the juice of an orange, formed their only sauce; contentment, peace
                    of mind, a good appetite, and abundance of mirth, made every thing agreeable.
                    Thus they lived and spent their time, till they had completed the number of
                    hides for which they had agreed with the merchants; which done, they carried
                    them to Tortuga, or some port of the great island.</p>
                <p>As the bucaneers used much exercise, and fed only on flesh, they generally
                    enjoyed a good state of health. 1hey were indeed subject to fevers; but these
                    were either such <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741149"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1149-0622"/>as lasted only a day, and left no sensible
                    impression the day following, or slight slow fevers, which did not hinder them
                    from action, and were of course so little regarded, that it was usual with the
                    patient, when asked how he did, to answer, “Very well; nothing ails me but the
                    fever.” It was impossible, however, that they should not suffer considerably by
                    such fatigues, under a climate to the heat of which few of them had been early
                    enough inured. Hence the most considerate among them, after they had got money
                    enough for that purpose, turned planters ;—the rest soon spent the fruits of
                    their labour in taverns and tippling-houses; and many had so habituated
                    themselves to this kind of life, as to become incapable of any other. Nay, there
                    have been instances of young men, who having early embarked through necessity in
                    this painful and dangerous profession, persisted in it afterwards, merely
                    through a principle of libertinism, rather than return to France and take
                    possession of the most plentiful fortunes.</p>
                <p>Such were the bucaneers of St Domingo, and such was their situation when the
                    Spaniards undertook to extirpate them. And at first the assailants met with
                    great success; for as the bucaneers hunted separately, every one attended by his
                    servants, they were easily surprised. Hence the Spaniards killed numbers, and
                    took many more, whom they condemned to a most cruel slavery. But whenever the
                    bucaneers had time to put themselves into a state of defence, they fought like
                    lions, to avoid falling into the hands of a nation from whom they were sure to
                    receive no quarter; and by this means they often escaped; nay, there are many
                    instances of single men fighting their way through numbers. These dangers,
                    however, and the success of the Spaniards in discovering their boucans, where
                    they used to surprise and cut the throats of the bucaneers and their servants in
                    their sleep, engaged them to cohabit in greater numbers, and even to act
                    offensively, in hopes that by so doing they might at last induce the Spaniards
                    to let them live in peace. But the fury with which they behaved whenever they
                    met any Spaniards served only to make their enemies more intent on their
                    destruction; and assistance coming to both parties, the whole island was turned
                    into a slaughter-house, and so much blood spilt on both sides, that many places,
                    on account of the carnage of which they had been the scenes, were described as
                    the hill of the massacre, the plain of the massacre, the valley of the massacre,
                    and so forth.</p>
                <p>At length the Spaniards grew tired of this mode of proceeding, and had recourse
                    to their old method of surprise, which, against enemies of more courage than
                    vigilance, was likely to succeed better. This placed the bucaneers under a
                    necessity of never hunting except in large parties, and fixing their boucans in
                    the little islands on the coast, where they retired every evening; an expedient
                    which succeeded very well, and the boucans, by being more fixed, soon acquired
                    the air and consistency of little towns. When the bucaneers had once established
                    themselves, as here related, each boucan sent out scouts every morning to the
                    highest part of the island, in order to reconnoitre the coast, and see if any
                    Spanish parties were abroad. If no enemy appeared, they appointed a place and
                    hour of rendezvous in the evening, and were never absent if not killed or made
                    prisoners. When, therefore, any one of the company was missing, it was not
                    lawful for the rest to hunt again till they had got intelligence of him if
                    taken, or avenged his death if killed. Things continued in this situation for a
                    long time, till the Spaniards made a general hunt over the whole island, and, by
                    destroying the game, forced the bucaneers to betake themselves to another course
                    of life. Some of them turned planters, and thus increased the French settlements
                    on the coast, or formed others; whilst the rest, not relishing so confined and
                    regular a life, entered among the freebooters, who thereby became a very
                    powerful body. France, which had hitherto disclaimed for her subjects these
                    ruffians, whose successes were only temporary, acknowledged them, however, as
                    soon as they formed themselves into settlements, and took proper measures for
                    their government and defence.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Bucaneers, the Pirates.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Before
                    the English had effected any settlement in Jamaica, and the French in St
                    Domingo, some pirates of both nations, who were afterwards so much distinguished
                    by the name of <hi rend="italic">Bucaneers,</hi> had driven the Spaniards out of
                    the small island of Tortuga; and, fortifying themselves there, had with an
                    amazing intrepidity made excursions against the common enemy. They formed
                    themselves into small companies consisting of fifty, a hundred, or a hundred and
                    fifty men each. A boat, of greater or smaller size, was their only armament.
                    Here they were exposed night and day to all the inclemencies of the weather,
                    having scarce room enough to lie down. A love of absolute independence rendered
                    them averse from those mutual restraints which the members of society impose
                    upon themselves for the common good; and as the authority they had conferred on
                    their captain was confined to his giving orders in battle, they lived in the
                    greatest confusion. Like the savages, having no apprehension of want, nor any
                    care to preserve the necessaries of life, they were constantly exposed to the
                    severest extremities of hunger and thirst; but deriving from their very
                    distresses a courage superior to every danger, the sight of a ship transported
                    them to a degree bordering on frenzy. They never deliberated on the attack, hut
                    it was their custom to board the ship as soon as possible. The smallness of
                    their vessels, and the skill they showed in the management of them, screened
                    them from the fire of the larger class of ships; and they presented only the
                    fore part of their little vessels filled with fusileers, who fired at the
                    port-holes with so much exactness that it entirely confounded the most
                    experienced gunners. As soon as they threw out the grappling, the largest
                    vessels seldom escaped them.</p>
                <p>In cases of extreme necessity they attacked the people of every nation, but fell
                    upon the Spaniards at all times. They thought that the cruelties which the
                    latter had exercised on the inhabitants of the new world justified the
                    implacable aversion they had sworn against them. But this was heightened by the
                    mortification they felt in seeing themselves debarred from the privileges of
                    hunting and fishing, which they considered as natural rights. Their principles
                    of justice and religion in no degree interfered with their predatory habits; for
                    whenever they embarked on any expedition, they used to pray to heaven for the
                    success of it; and they never came back from plundering, without returning
                    thanks to God for their victory.</p>
                <p>The ships which sailed from Europe to America seldom tempted their avidity, since
                    the merchandise which these contained could not have been easily sold, nor
                    indeed very profitable to those barbarians. They always waited for them on their
                    return, when they were certain they were laden with gold, silver, jewels, and
                    all the valuable productions of the new world. If they met with a single ship
                    they never failed to attack her. As to the fleets, they followed them till they
                    sailed out of the Gulf of Bahama; an as soon as any one of the vessels was
                    separated by accident from the rest, it was taken. The Spaniards, who trembled
                    at the approach of the bucaneers, whom they called devils, immediately
                    surrendered. Quarter was granted if the cargo proved to be a rich one; if not,
                    all the prisoners were thrown into the sea.</p>
                <p>The bucaneers, when they had got a considerable boo at first held their
                    rendezvous at the island of Tortuga, in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741162"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1162-0623"/>, order to divide the spoil; but afterwards the
                    French went to St Domingo, and the English to Jamaica. Each person, holding up
                    his hand, solemnly protested that he had secreted nothing of what he had taken.
                    If any one among them was convicted of perjury, a case which seldom happened, he
                    was left, as soon as an opportunity offered, upon some desert island, as a
                    traitor unworthy to live in society. Such of their number as had been maimed in
                    any of their expeditions were first provided for. If they had lost a hand, an
                    arm, a leg, or a foot, they received twenty-six pounds; whilst an eye, a finger,
                    or a toe, lost in fight, was valued only at half this sum. The wounded were
                    allowed half a crown per day for two months, to enable them to have their wounds
                    taken care of; and if they had not money enough to answer these several demands,
                    the whole company were obliged to engage in some fresh expedition, and to
                    continue it till they had acquired a sufficient stock to enable them to satisfy
                    these honourable contracts. The remainder of the booty was then divided into as
                    many shares as there were bucaneers. The commander could only lay claim to a
                    single share; but they complimented him with two or three, in proportion as he
                    had acquitted himself to their satisfaction. Favour never had any influence in
                    the division of the booty, for every share was determined by lot. The most rigid
                    justice was extended even to the dead. Their share was given to the man who was
                    known to be their companion when alive, and therefore accounted their heir. If
                    the person who had been killed had no intimate, his portion was sent to his
                    relations when they were known; and if there were no friends or relations, it
                    was distributed in charity to the poor, and to the churches, which consented to
                    offer up prayers for the person in whose name these benefactions were given.</p>
                <p>When these duties had been complied with, they then indulged themselves in all
                    kinds of profusion. Unbounded licentiousness in gaming, wine, women, and every
                    kind of debauehery, was earned to the utmost pitch of excess, and was stopt only
                    by the want which such profusion brought on. Those who had been enriched with
                    several millions were in an instant totally ruined, and rendered destitute of
                    clothes and provisions. They returned to sea; and the new supplies which they
                    acquired were soon lavished in the same manner as before.</p>
                <p>The Spanish colonies, flattering themselves with the hope of seeing an end to
                    their miseries, and reduced almost to despair at finding themselves a perpetual
                    prey to these ruffians, grew weary of navigation. They gave up all the power,
                    conveniencies, and fortune, which their connections procured them, and formed
                    themselves into so many distinct and separate associations. They were sensible
                    of the great inconvenience arising from such a conduct, and avowed it; but the
                    dread of falling into the hands of rapacious and savage men had greater
                    influence over them than the dictates of honour, interest, and policy. This gave
                    rise to that spirit of inactivity which continues to the present time,
                    notwithstanding the agitating events of which that quarter of the world has
                    since been the theatre.</p>
                <p>The despondeney thus produced served only to increase the boldness of the
                    bucaneers. As yet they had only appeared in the Spanish settlements in order to
                    carry off provisions when in want of them. But they no sooner found their
                    captures begin to diminish, than they determined to recover by land what they
                    had lost at sea. The richest and most populous countries of the continent were
                    plundered and laid waste. The culture of lands was as much neglected as
                    navigation; and the Spaniards dared no more appear in their public roads, than
                    sail in the latitudes which belonged to them.</p>
                <p>Among the bucaneers who signalized themselves in this new species of freebooting,
                    Montbar, a gentleman of Languedoe, particularly distinguished himself. Having by
                    chance, in his infancy, met with a circumstantial account of the cruelties
                    practised in the conquest of the New World, he conceived an aversion, which he
                    carried to a degree of frenzy, against that nation which had committed such
                    enormities. The enthusiasm which this spirit of humanity worked him up to merged
                    in a feroeity still more cruel than that of the religious fanaticism to which so
                    many victims had been sacrificed. The manes of these unhappy sufferers seemed to
                    rouse him, and call for vengeance. He had heard some account of the bucaneers,
                    who were said to be the most inveterate enemies to the Spanish name; and he
                    therefore embarked, with some others, on board a ship in order to join them.</p>
                <p>In the passage they met with a Spanish vessel, attacked, and, as was usual in
                    those times, immediately boarded it. Montbar, with a sabre in his hand, fell
                    upon the enemy, broke through them, and, hurrying twice from one end of the ship
                    to the other, levelled every thing that opposed him. When he had compelled the
                    enemy to surrender, leaving to his companions the happiness of dividing so rich
                    a booty, he contented himself with the savage pleasure of contemplating the dead
                    bodies of the Spaniards, against whom he had sworn a constant and deadly
                    hatred.</p>
                <p>Fresh opportunities soon occurred which enabled him to exercise this spirit of
                    revenge without extinguishing it. The ship which conveyed him arrived on the
                    coast of St Domingo, where the bucaneers on land immediately applied to barter
                    provisions for brandy. As the articles they offered were of little value, they
                    alleged in excuse that their enemies had overrun the country, laid waste their
                    settlements, and earned off all their property. “Why,” replied Montbar, “do you
                    tamely suffer such insults ?” “Neither do we,” answered they; “the Spaniards
                    have experienced what kind of men we are, and have therefore taken advantage of
                    the time when we were engaged in hunting; but we are going to join some of our
                    companions who have been still worse treated than we, and then we shall have
                    warm work.” “If you approve of it,” answered Montbar, “I will head you, not as
                    your commander, but as the foremost to expose myself to danger.” The bucaneers
                    perceiving from his appearance that he was the very man they wanted, cheerfully
                    accepted his offer; and the same day they overtook the enemy, when Montbar
                    attacked them with an impetuosity that astonished the bravest, and scarce one
                    Spaniard escaped the effects of his fury. The remaining part of his life was
                    equally distinguished as this day. The Spaniards suffered so much from him, both
                    by sea and land, that he acquired the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exterminator.</hi></p>
                <p>His savage disposition, as well as that of the other bucaneers who attended him,
                    having obliged the Spaniards to confine themselves within their settlements, the
                    freebooters resolved to attack them there. This new method of carrying on the
                    war required superior forecs; and their associations in consequence became more
                    numerous. The first considerable one was that formed by UOlonois, who derived
                    his name from the sands of Olones, the place of his birth. From the abject state
                    of a bondsman, he had gradually raised himself to the command of two canoes,
                    with twenty-two men; and with these he was so successful as to take a Spanish
                    frigate on the coast of Cuba. He then repaired to Port-au-Prince, in which were
                    four ships, fitted out purposely to sail in pursuit of him; but he took them,
                    and threw all the crews into the sea except one man, whom he saved in order to
                    send him with a letter to the governor of the Havannah, acquainting him with
                    what he had done, and assuring him that he would treat in the same manner all
                    the Spaniards who should fall into his hands, not excepting the governor himself
                    if he were fortunate<pb break="no" facs="nls:193741175"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1175-0624"/> enough to take him. After this expedition he ran
                    his canoes and prize ships aground, and sailed with his frigate only to the
                    island of Tortuga.</p>
                <p>At Tortuga he met with Michael de Basco, who had distinguished himself by taking,
                    even under the cannon of Porto Bello, a Spanish ship, estimated at L.218,500,
                    and by other actions equally brave and daring. These two gave out that they were
                    going to embark together on an expedition equally glorious and profitable; and
                    in consequence they soon collected together four hundred and forty men. This
                    body of men, the most numerous which the bucaneers had yet been able to muster,
                    sailed to the Bay of Venezuela, which runs up into the country for the space of
                    about fifty leagues. The fort which was built at the entrance for its defence
                    was taken; the cannon were nailed up; and the whole garrison, consisting of two
                    hundred and fifty men, were put to death. They then re-embarked and came to
                    Maracaybo, built on the western coast of the lake of the same name, at the
                    distance of ten leagues from its mouth. This city, which had become flourishing
                    and rich by its trade in skins, tobacco, and cocoa, was deserted; and the
                    inhabitants had retired with their effects to the other side of the bay. If the
                    bucaneers had not lost a fortnight in riot and debauchery, they would have found
                    at Gibraltar, near the extremity of the lake, every thing which the inhabitants
                    had secreted, to secure it from being plundered. On the contrary they met with
                    fortifications lately erected, which they had the bootless satisfaction of
                    making themselves masters of at the expense of a great deal of blood; for the
                    inhabitants had already removed to a distance the most valuable part of their
                    property. Exasperated at this disappointment, they set fire to Gibraltar; and
                    Maracaybo would have shared the same fate had it not been ransomed. Besides the
                    sum which they received for its ransom, they also carried off all the crosses,
                    pictures, and bells of the churches; intending, as they said, to build a chapel
                    in the island of Tortuga, and to consecrate this part of their spoils to sacred
                    purposes. Such was the religion of these barbarous people, who could make no
                    other offering to heaven than that which arose from their robberies and
                    plunder.</p>
                <p>But while they were idly dissipating the spoils which they had made on the coast
                    of Venezuela, Morgan, the most renowned of the English bucaneers, sailed from
                    Jamaica to attack Porto Bello. His plan of operations was so well contrived that
                    he surprised and took the city without opposition. The conquest of Panama was an
                    object of much greater importance. To secure this Morgan thought it necessary to
                    sail in the latitudes of Costa-Rica, in order to procure some guides in the
                    island of St Catharines, where the Spaniards confined their malefactors. This
                    place was so strongly fortified that it might to have held out for ten years
                    against a considerable army. But notwithstanding this, the governor, on the
                    first appearance of the pirates, sent privately to concert measures how he might
                    surrender himself without incurring the iïŋputation of cowardice; and the result
                    of this consultation was, that Morgan in the night-time was to attack a fort at
                    some distance, while the governor was to sally out of the citadel to defend a
                    post of so much consequence, and that the assailants should then attack him in
                    the rear, and take him prisoner, which would occasion an immediate surrender of
                    the place. It was agreed that a smart firing should be kept up on both sides,
                    without doing mischief to either. This farce was admirably carried on. The
                    Spaniards, without being exposed to any danger, appeared to have done their
                    duty; and the bucaneers, after having totally demolished the fortifications, and
                    put on board their vessels a prodigious quantity of warlike ammunition, which
                    they found at St Catharines, steered their course towards the river Chagrc, the
                    only channel whereby they could arrive at the place which was the object of
                    their wishes.</p>
                <p>At the entrance of this considerable river a fort had been built upon a steep
                    rock, which the waves of the sea constantly beat against. This bulwark,
                    naturally difficult of access, was defended by an officer whose extraordinary
                    abilities were equal to his courage, and by a garrison which was in all respects
                    worthy of such a commander. Here the bucaneers, for the first time, met with a
                    resistance which could only be equalled by their perseverance; and it was a
                    doubtful point whether they should succeed orbe obliged to raise the siege, when
                    a lucky accident happened which proved favourable to their glory and their
                    fortune. The commander was killed, and the fort accidentally took fire; upon
                    which the besiegers, taking advantage of this double calamity, made themselves
                    masters of the place.</p>
                <p>Morgan left his vessels at anchor, with a sufficient number of men to guard them,
                    and sailed up the river in his sloops for thirty-three miles, till he came to
                    Cruces, where it ceases to be navigable; and he then proceeded by land to
                    Panama, which was only five leagues distant. Upon a large and extensive plain
                    which stretched out before the city, he met with a considerable body of troops,
                    whom he put to flight with the greatest ease, and entered the city, which was
                    now abandoned. Here were found prodigious treasures concealed in the wells and
                    caves; some valuable commodities were also taken in the boats which were left
                    aground at low water; and in the neighbouring forests were likewise found
                    several rich deposits. Having burnt the city, they set sail with a great number
                    of prisoners, who were ransomed a few days afterwards, and arrived at the mouth
                    of the Chagre with a prodigious booty.</p>
                <p>In 1603 an expedition of the greatest consequence was formed by Van Horn, a
                    native of Ostend, but who had served all his life among the French. His own
                    intrepidity prevented his tolerating the least signs of cowardice amongst those
                    who associated with him. In the heat of an engagement he went about his ship,
                    observed his men in succession, and immediately killed those who shrunk at the
                    sudden report of a pistol, gun, or cannon. This extraordinary discipline
                    rendered him the terror of the coward and the idol of the brave. In other
                    respects he readily shared with the men of spirit and bravery the immense riches
                    which were acquired in the course of his marauding expeditions. When he went
                    upon such expeditions, he generally sailed in his frigate, which was his own
                    property. But his designs requiring greater numbers to carry them into
                    execution, he called to his assistance Grammont, Godfrey, and Jonqué, three
                    Frenchmen distinguished by their exploits, and Lawrence de Graff, a Dutchman,
                    who had signalized himself still more than they. Twelve hundred bucaneers joined
                    themselves to these commanders, and sailed in six vessels for Vera Cruz.</p>
                <p>The darkness of the night favoured their landing, which was effected about three
                    leagues from the place, where they arrived without being discovered. The
                    governor, the fort, the barracks, and the posts of the greatest consequence,
                    every thing, in short, which could occasion any resistance, were taken by the
                    break of day. All the citizens, men, women, and children, were shut up in the
                    churches, whither they had fled for shelter. At the door of each church were
                    placed barrels of gunpowder to blow up the building; and a bucaneer, with a
                    lighted match, was to set fire to it upon the least appearance of an
                    insurrection.</p>
                <p>While the city was kept in this state of terror, it was easily pillaged; and
                    after the bucaneers had carried off whatever was most valuable, they made a
                    proposal to the citιzθ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> 1 <hi rend="superscript">

                    />three days, cheerfully accepted the terms which were offered them. Half of the
                    money was paid the same day, and the other part was expected from the interior
                    of the country, when there appeared on an eminence a considerable body of troops
                    advancing, and near the port a fleet of seventeen ships from Europe. At the
                    sight of this armament, the bucaneers, without any marks of surprise, retired
                    quietly, with fifteen hundred slaves they had seized, as a trifling
                    indemnification for the rest of the money they expected, the settling of which
                    they referred to a more favourable opportunity. Their retreat was equally
                    daring. They boldly sailed through the midst of the Spanish fleet, which let
                    them pass without firing a single gun, and, in fact, seemed afraid of being
                    attacked and beaten. The Spaniards would not probably have escaped so easily, if
                    the vessels of the pirates had not been laden with silver, or if the Spanish
                    fleet had been freighted with any other effects but such merchandise as was
                    little valued by these daring freebooters.</p>
                <p>A year had scarcely elapsed since their return from Mexico when, on a sudden,
                    they were all seized with a passion for going to plunder Peru. It is probable
                    that the hopes of finding greater treasures upon a sea little frequented, than
                    on one long exposed to piracies of this kind, was the cause of this expedition;
                    but it is somewhat remarkable, that both the English and French, and the
                    associations of these two nations, had projected this plan at the same time,
                    without any communication, intercourse, or design of acting in concert with each
                    other. About four thousand men were employed in this expedition. Some of them
                    proceeded by Terra Firma, others by the Straits of Magelhaens, to the place
                    which formed the object of their wishes; and if the intrepidity of these
                    barbarians had been directed, under the influence of a skilful commander, to a
                    single end, it is certain that they would have deprived the Spaniards of this
                    important colony. But their natural character presented an invincible obstacle
                    to so rare a union; for they always formed themselves into several distinct
                    bodies, sometimes even so few in number as ten or twelve, who acted together, or
                    separated, as whim or caprice dictated. Grognier, Lecuyer, Picard, and Le Sage,
                    were the most distinguished officers among the French; David Samms, Peter
                    Wilner, and Towley, among the English.</p>
                <p>Such of these adventurers as had got into the South Sea by the Straits of Darien
                    seized upon the first vessel which they found upon the coast; and their
                    associates, who had sailed in their own vessels, were not much better provided.
                    Weak, however, as they were, they several times beat the squadrons which were
                    fitted out against them. But these victories were prejudicial to them, by
                    interrupting their navigation; and when there were no more ships to be taken,
                    they were continually obliged to make descents upon the coasts to get
                    provisions, or to go by land in order to plunder those cities where the booty
                    had been secured. They successively attacked Seppa, Puebla-Nuevo, Leon, Realejo,
                    Puebla-Viejo, Chiriquita, Lesparso, Granada, Vil-lia, Nicoy, Tecoanteca,
                    Muemeluna, Chiloteca, New Segovia, and Guayaquil, the most considerable of all
                    these places.</p>
                <p>Many of these places were taken by surprise, and most of them deserted by their
                    inhabitants, who fled at the sight of the enemy. As soon as the bucaneers took a
                    town, it was directly set on fire, unless a sum proportioned to its value was
                    paid to save it. The prisoners taken in battle were massacred without mercy if
                    they were not ransomed by the governor or some of the inhabitants; while gold,
                    pearls, or precious stones, were the only things accepted of for the payment of
                    their ransom. Silver being too common, and too weighty for its current value,
                    would have been troublesome to them. The chances of fortune, which seldom leave
                    guilt unpunished, or adversity without a compensation for its suffering, atoned
                    for the crimes committed in the conquest of the New World; and the Indians were
                    amply avenged on the Spaniards.</p>
                <p>While such piracies were being committed on the Southern Ocean, the Northern was
                    threatened with the same by Grammont. He was a native of Paris, by birth a
                    gentleman, and had distinguished himself in a military capacity in Europe; but
                    his passion for wine, gaming, and women, had obliged him to join the pirates.
                    Nevertheless he was affable, polite, generous, and eloquent; endued with a sound
                    judgment, and a person of approved valour; qualities which soon made him be
                    considered as the chief of the French bucaneers. As soon as it was known that he
                    had taken up arms, he was immediately joined by a number of brave men. The
                    governor of St Domingo, who had at length prevailed upon his master to approve
                    of the project, equally wise and just, of fixing the pirates in some place, and
                    inducing them to become cultivators, was desirous of preventing the concerted
                    expedition, and forbade it in the king’s name. But Grammont, who had a greater
                    share of sense than his associates, was not on that account inclined to comply,
                    and sternly replied, “How can Louis disapprove of a design he is unacquainted
                    with, and which has been planned only a few days ago This answer highly pleased
                    all the bucaneers, who directly embarked in 1685 to attack Campeachy.</p>
                <p>They landed without opposition. But at some distance from the coast they were
                    attacked by eight hundred Spaniards, who were beaten and pursued to the town,
                    which both parties entered pell-mell together. The cannon they found there were
                    immediately levelled against the citadel; but as these had very little effect,
                    they were contriving some stratagem to enable them to become masters of the
                    place, when intelligence was brought that it had been abandoned. There remained
                    in it only a gunner, an Englishman, and an officer of signal courage, who chose
                    rather to expose himself to the greatest extremities than basely to fly from the
                    place with the rest. The commander of the bucaneers received him with marks of
                    distinction, generously released him, gave him up all his effects, and, besides,
                    complimented him with some valuable presents; such influence have courage and
                    fidelity even on the minds of those who systematically violate all the rights of
                    society.</p>
                <p>The conquerors of Campeachy spent two months in searching the environs of the
                    city to the extent of twelve or fifteen leagues, and in carrying off every thing
                    which the inhabitants in their flight thought they had preserved. When all the
                    treasure they had collected from every quarter was deposited in the ships, a
                    proposal was made to the governor of the province, who still kept the field with
                    nine hundred men, to ransom his capital city. His refusal determined them to
                    burn it, and demolish the citadel. The French, on the festival of St Louis, were
                    celebrating the anniversary of their king; and in the transports of their
                    patriotism, intoxication, and national love of their prince, they burnt to the
                    value of a million of logwood; a part, and a very considerable one too, of the
                    spoil which they had made. After this singular and extravagant instance of
                    folly, of which Frenchmen only would boast, they returned to St Domingo.</p>
                <p>In 1697 twelve hundred bucaneers were induced to join a squadron of seven ships
                    which sailed from Europe under the command of one Pointis, to attack the famous
                    city of Carthagena. This was the most difficult enterprise which could be
                    attempted in the New World. The situation of the port, the strength of the
                    place, and the badness of the climate, were so many obstacles which would have
                    seemed insurmountable to any but such men as the bucaneers. But every obstacle
                    yielded to their valour and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741201"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1201-0626"/>good fortune; the city was taken, and booty gained
                    to the amount of L.1,750,000. Their rapacious commander, however, deprived them
                    of the advantages resulting from their success. He scrupled not, as soon as they
                    set sail, to offer L.5250 for the share of those who had been the chief
                    instruments in procuring him so considerable a spoil.</p>
                <p>The bucaneers, exasperated at this treatment, resolved immediately to board the
                    vessel called the Sceptre, where Pointis himself was, and which at that time was
                    too far distant from the rest of the ships to expect to be assisted by them. And
                    this avaricious commander was upon the point of being massacred, when one of the
                    malcontents cried out, “Brethren, why should we attack this rascal? He has
                    carried off nothing that belongs to us. He has left our share at Carthagena, and
                    there we must go to recover it.” This proposal was received with general
                    applause. A savage joy at once succeeded the gloomy melancholy which had seized
                    them; and without further deliberation all their ships sailed towards
                    Carthagena.</p>
                <p>As soon as they had entered the city without meeting with any resistance, they
                    shut up all the men in the great church, and exacted payment of L.218,750, the
                    amount of their share of booty which they had been defrauded of, promising to
                    retreat immediately upon compliance with their demand, but threatening the most
                    dreadful vengeance in case of refusal. Upon this the most venerable priest in
                    the city mounted the pulpit, and made use of the influence which his character,
                    his authority, and his eloquence gave to him, to persuade his hearers to yield
                    up without reserve all the gold, silver, and jewels in their possession. But the
                    collection made after the sermon not furnishing the sum required, the city was
                    ordered to be plundered.</p>
                <p>At length, after amassing all they could, these adventurers set sail, when
                    unfortunately they met with a fleet of Dutch and English ships, then in alliance
                    with Spain. Several of the pirates were either taken or sunk, with the cargoes
                    they had on board; and the rest escaped to St Domingo.</p>
                <p>Such was the last memorable event in the history of the bucaneers. The separation
                    of the English and French, wdιen the war on account of the Prince of Orange
                    divided the two nations; the success of the means employed to promote the
                    cultivation of land among their colonies, by the assistance of these
                    enterprising men; the prudence evinced in selecting the most distinguished among
                    them, and intrusting them with civil and military employments; and the
                    protection afforded to the Spanish settlements, which till then had been a
                    general object of plunder; all these circumstances, and various others, besides
                    the impossibility of supplying the place of these remarkable men, who were
                    continually dropping off, concurred to put an end to a society as extraordinary
                    as any that ever existed. ∖∖ ithout any regular system, without laws, without
                    subordination, and even without any fixed revenue, they became the astonishment
                    of the age in which they lived, as they will be also of posterity.</p>
