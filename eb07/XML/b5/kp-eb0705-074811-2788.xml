                    rend="smallcaps">Basra</hi></label>, a celebrated city of Asia, in the
                    government of Bagdad, situated on the western bank of the Shut-ul-Arab, about
                    seventy miles from the mouth of this noble stream, which is navigable to the
                    city for ships of 500 tons burden. Bussora is surrounded by walls, which are
                    kept in a tolerable state of repair.</p>

                <p>They have five gates, and arc at the lowest computation about seven miles in
                    circuit. They are washed by the river, which frequently inundates the low-lying
                    plain in which the city is situated, so that it appears like an island in the
                    middle of a lake. It is, without exception, the most filthy town that can be
                    conceived; the streets are exceedingly narrow; and the stench arising from
                    nuisances, everywhere exposed to view, is intolerable. The houses are meanly
                    built, partly of sun-dried, and partly of burnt bricks, with flat roofs,
                    surrounded by a parapet; and the bazars, though stocked with the richest
                    merchandise, are miserable structures, not arched, as in Bagdad and the Persian
                    towns, but covered with mats laid on rafters of date trees, which hardly afford
                    protection from the scorching rays of the sun. Of the vast area within the
                    walls, the greater proportion is occupied with gardens and plantations of palm
                    trees, intersected by a number of little canals, cleaned twice a day, on the ebb
                    and flow of the tide, which rises here about nine feet. The largest of these
                    canals, which approaches the English factory and the palace of the governor,
                    situated about two miles from the river, is continually crowded with small
                    vessels. The town has scarcely any public buildings that deserve notice. It has
                    khans and coffee-houses without number, a wretched hum-mum, and upwards of forty
                    mosques, of which one only is worthy of the name; and this, with the palace of
                    the governor and the English factory, which are all contiguous to one another,
                    are the only decent buildings in the place. The population is a heterogeneous
                    mixture of all the nations in the East, and consists of Turks, Arabs, Indians,
                    Persians, Armenians, Jacobites, and Jews. The Arabs, however, constitute the
                    principal class; and the Turks, though they are masters of the town, are not
                    numerous.</p>
                <p>Bussora is a great emporium of Indian commerce. Three or four English ships of
                    about 400 tons burden arrive in the course of a year from Calcutta; but the
                    chief part of the traffic is carried on in Arabian bottoms; and the merchants of
                    Muscat possess some of the finest vessels that navigate the Indian seas. From
                    various parts of Hindustan, Bussora receives silk, muslin, linen, white and blue
                    cloth for the clothing of the Arabians, gold and silver stuffs, various metals,
                    sandal wood, and indigo; pearls from Bahrein, and coffee from Mocha; shawls,
                    fruit, and the precious metals from Persia; spices from Java; and European
                    commodities, which are scarce and dear, from different parts. The trade with the
                    interior is conducted by means of caravans to Aleppo and Bagdad, whence the
                    goods are conveyed to Constantinople. The returns are made in Indian goods,
                    bullion, pearls, dates, copper, raw silk; horses, which being very strong and
                    beautiful, are exported by the English; and gall-nuts. A Turkish fleet was
                    formerly stationed here, which suppressed all piratical adventurers in the
                    Persian Gulf. But it is now reduced to ten or twelve decayed hulks, incapable of
                    unmooring out of the river; and the dignified office of capitan pasha, then held
                    immediately under the Porte, is now one of the most insignificant appointments
                    in the gift of the pasha of Bagdad.</p>
                <p>The situation of the town is unhealthy, owing to the inundations of the river,
                    from which noxious exhalations arise, and strangers are commonly attacked by
                    fever after a short residence. The adjoining country is fertile, producing,
                    besides rice, wheat, barley, and elates of different species, a variety of
                    fruits and vegetables, such as apricos, apples, figs, olives, pomegranates, and
                    grapes; and cabbages, broccoli, lettuce, onions, peas, beans, and truffles, in
                    vast quantities. There are whole fields of roses, which the inhabitants
                    cultivate for the purposes of distillation. The licorice plant also grows amidst
                    the date groves on the borders of the river. The wild Arabs from the
                    neighbouring deserts frequently harass the peasants by their predatory
                    incursions. To guard against these, and to protect the farms and country houses,
                    Abdulla Aga has built a wall for sixty miles along the adjoining desert, at all
                    the gates of which guards are placed. But flying parties of Arabs still break
                    through this barrier, and annoy the peaceable inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The city of Bussora was founded by Omar, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 636; and
                    its situation was so favourable for commerce, that in a few years it became a
                    large and flourishing city. It was conquered by the Turks in 1668, and since
                    that period has experienced many revolutions. It was taken in 1777, after a
                    siege of eight months, by the Persians under Sa-dick Khan. In about a year it
                    fell again into the hands of the Turks, who were again deprived of it by the
                    scheik of the Montefidge Arabs. The town was in October following recovered by
                    Solyman Pasha, who encountered the scheik on the banks of the Euphrates, and put
                    him to flight. The governor has ever since been sent from Bagdad, and is
                    generally an officer of high rank. The population is estimated at 60,000. It is
                    210 miles south from Ispahan, and 1815 south-east from Constantinople. Long. 44.
