                <p><label type="entry">BÓULTER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr Hugh</hi></label>, was born
                    in or near London, of reputable and wealthy parents. He was educated at
                    Merchant-Tailor’s School before the Revolution, and was from thence admitted a
                    commoner of Christ-church in Oxford. Some time afterwards he was chosen a demy
                    of Magdalen College, at the same election with Mr Addison and Dr Wilcox. From
                    the merit and learning of the persons elected, this was commonly called by Dr
                    Hough, president of the college, the “golden election.” He afterwards became
                    fellow of the same college; in which station he continued till the year 1700,
                    when he was invited to London by Sir Charles Hodges, principal secretary of
                    state, who made him his chaplain, and recommended him to Dr Tennison, archbishop
                    of Canterbury; but for his first preferments he was indebted to the Earl of
                    Sunderland, by whose interest and influence he was promoted to the parsonage of
                    St Olave in Southwark, and the archdeaconry of Surrey. Here he continued
                    discharging very faithfully and diligently every part of his pastoral office,
                    till he was recommended to attend George I. as his chaplain when he went to
                    Hanover in 1719. He had the honour to teach Prince Frederick the English
                    language; and by his conduct he so won the king’s favour, that he promoted him
                    to the deanery of Christchurch and the bishopric of Bristol in the same year. As
                    he was visiting his diocese five years afterwards, he received a letter from the
                    secretary of state, acquainting him that his majesty had nominated him to the
                    archbishopric of Armagh and primacy of Ireland. This honour he would gladly have
                    declined, and desired the secretary to use his good offices with his majesty to
                    excuse him from accepting it. At this juncture Ireland happened to be in a great
                    flame, occasioned by Wood’s project; and the ministry thought that the bishop
                    would greatly contribute to quench it by his judgment, moderation, and address.
                    The king therefore laid his absolute commands upon him, and he submitted, but
                    with some reluctance. As soon as he had taken possession of the primacy, he
                    began to consider the country in which his lot was cast for life as his own, and
                    to promote its true interest with the greatest zeal and assiduity. Accordingly,
                    he exerted himself in performing the noblest acts of beneficence and public
                    spirit. In seasons of the greatest scarcity he was more than once instrumental
                    in preventing a famine which threatened that nation. On one of these occasions
                    he distributed vast quantities of corn throughout the kingdom, for which the
                    House of Commons passed a vote of public thanks; and at another time two
                    thousand five hundred persons were fed at the poor-house in Dublin, every
                    morning, and as many every evening, for a considerable time together, mostly at
                    thq primate’s expense. When schemes were proposed for the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193734987" xml:id="kp-eb0705-4987-0148"/>advantage of the country, he
                    encouraged and promoted them not only with his counsel, but his purse. He had
                    great compassion for the poor clergy of his diocese, who were disabled from
                    giving their children a proper education; and he maintained several of these
                    children in the university. He erected four houses at Drogheda for the reception
                    of clergymen’s widows, and purchased an estate for the endowment of them. His
                    charities for augmenting small livings and buying glebes amounted to upwards of
                    L.30,000, besides what he devised by will for the like purposes in England. In
                    short, the instances he gave of his generosity and benevolence of heart, his
                    virtue, piety, and wisdom, are almost innumerable, and the history of his life
                    is his noblest panegyric. This excellent prelate died at London, on the 2d June
                    1742, and was interred in Westminster-abbey, where a beautiful monument of
                    finely-polished marble was erected to his memory.</p>
