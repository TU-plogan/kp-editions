                <p><label type="entry">BRONZING</label>. A combination of metals which has received
                    the name of bronze was employed by the ancients in the fabrication of different
                    utensils, and in casting busts, statues, and other subjects, either larger or
                    smaller than life. The Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, nations which subsisted
                    long and were familiar with the most refined state of the arts, used this
                    compound metal in the greater part of the decorations of those magnificent
                    temples and palaces whose ruins only have remained to later eras. But amidst the
                    general wreck there are still some fragments preserved, which indicate the
                    perfection which had been attained in the employment of bronze. The wealth of
                    some ancient cities was estimated by the number of their brazen statues; and
                    Delphos, Athens, and Rhodes, are reported to have each possessed three thousand.
                    Some distinguished Romans adorned the public edifices of their city in this
                    manner; and so strong a propensity was excited for multiplying works of this
                    kind, that an observation became current, that in Rome the people of brass were
                    not less numerous than the Roman people. It has been remarked, that the works
                    which we now execute in iron or steel were little known to the ancients; that
                    their arms and armour were usually of brass, or the compound now alluded to; and
                    that a set of surgeon’s instruments consisting entirely of bronze was discovered
                    at Pompeii.</p>
                <p>Bronze is extremely hard, sonorous, more brittle than brass, and more fusible
                    than copper, from which, and its not being liable to tarnish, it is peculiarly
                    adapted for casts of statues. Various nations have compounded the metals
                    employed in different proportions. The Egyptians are said to have taken two
                    thirds of brass and one third of copper. According to Pliny, the bronze of the
                    Grecians was formed in the same way, with the addition of one tenth part of lead
                    and a twentieth of silver; which proportions were adopted by the Romans. In
                    modern times bronze is generally composed of two thirds of copper and one third
                    of brass, and sometimes small quantities of lead and zinc have been added. These
                    latter render the cast more compact and brilliant; and the combination of
                    different substances occasions the readier fusibility of the whole than when
                    separate. The ancient bronzes, however, present a difference in appearance and
                    composition from those executed’by the moderns, and the fact is ascertained in
                    respect to the metallic proportions, by skilful chemists on analysis. An
                    illustration of this fact is sometimes given in the four celebrated horses of
                    bronze, supposed to be the work of Lysippus, a Greek artist; which were brought
                    from Venice, by command of Bonaparte, to the Thuilleries at Paris, and, on the
                    fall of that extraordinary man, restored to their original position.</p>
                <p>The casting of bronze statues is a nice and difficult art, requiring long
                    experience and the judicious management of a great apparatus. An exact model
                    must be made of the subject to be cast, and nicely coated over with wax not less
                    than an inch thick, on which the artist works the impression meant to be taken.
                    A mould is then formed, consisting of several hollow pieces of wood or other
                    resisting substance, filled with a mixture of clay and sand, which is applied to
                    the model, in order that its outline may be received. The mould being united
                    together, is perforated by a number of channels, and the melted metal being
                    discharged from a furnace by means of these into the interior, thus produces the
                    cast. When cold, the external covering is taken off, and the subjects appear as
                    if covered with spines, which are the channels filled with metal: these arc
                    removed by saws, files, and chisels; and any imperfections on the surface being
                    corrected, the whole is completed. But this in detail is a tedious, laborious,
                    and expensive process; and the difficulty of producing beautiful works in bronze
                    conspires to give them a high value in the estimation of the lovers of the arts.
                    In general, the natural colour of the composition remains unaltered, and with
                    the lapse of time tends to black, or particular shades of green; but some
                    artists render it black artificially", or give it <hi rend="italic">a</hi> green
                    colour from the first. It is the delicacy of the workmanship, however, that
                    constitutes the value of bronzes, not the colour, because it is the former alone
                    which constitutes the difficulty, and calls for the skill of the artist.
                    Colossal figures are sometimes obtained in bronze; but more usually, when of
                    very large dimensions, they are formed by the union of several pieces, and are
                    hollow within; as is also the case with some of those of smaller size.
                    Considerable premiums have been offered by the <hi rend="italic">Society for the
                    Encouragement of Arts,</hi> for promoting the execution of bronze figures in
                    England, but few have been claimed. Nevertheless, British artists have produced
                    several very creditable works, if we take the low condition of sculpture in
                    view, but, either from wantof skill or practice,neither the bronzes of this
                    island nor those of the Continent can rival the masterpieces of antiquity.
                    Perhaps it is only the best specimens which are preserved, and many of inferior
                    note have been allowed to decay, or cease to attract attention; an in this way
                    we may partly account for our own inferiori j∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193740720" xml:id="kp-eb0705-0720-0589"/>
                <p>The substances on which bronzing is employed are either metals, wood, ivory,
                    clay, or plaster; but more general preference is given to wood or plaster. The
                    colours are of various shades and intensity; their composition and application
                    being in a great measure arbitrary, according to the will of the artist. This
                    art is nothing but a species of painting, far from the most delicate kind; and,
                    when applied to plaster figures, may be done either with or without cement, the
                    latter rendering it more durable. One principal ingredient in bronzing is
                    gold-powder, for the preparation of which the following receipt is given. A
                    quantity of leaf-gold is ground with virgin honey on a stone, until the texture
                    of the leaves be completely broken, and their parts divided to the most minute
                    degree. The mixture of gold and honey is then removed from the stone and put
                    into a basin of water, whereby the honey may be melted, and the gold freed from
                    it; and the basin is allowed to stand at rest until the gold subsides. When it
                    does so, the water is poured off, and fresh quantities are added, until the
                    honey be entirely washed away; after which the gold is put in paper, and dried
                    for use. This is the true gold powder; besides which, there is another, called
                    German gold, in common use; and also a third, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >aurum</hi><hi rend="italic">mosaicum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">musicum,</hi>
                    greatly employed in bronzing, and which is thus prepared. A pound of tin, seven
                    ounces of flour of sulphur, half a pound of purified quicksilver, and the same
                    quantity of sal ammoniac, are taken as the necessary ingredients. The tin being
                    melted in a crucible, the quicksilver is added to it; and, when this mixture is
                    cold, it is reduced to powder, and ground with the sal ammoniac and sulphur,
                    until the whole be thoroughly mixed. They are then to be calcined in a matrass,
                    and die sublimation of the other ingredients will leave the tin converted into
                    the <hi rend="italic">aurum</hi><hi rend="italic">mosaicum,</hi> which is found
                    at the bottom of the glass like a mass of bright flaky gold powder. Should any
                    black or discoloured particles appear, they must be removed. The sal ammoniac
                    used here must be very white and clean, and the mercury quite pure, and
                    unadulterated with lead. These colours are commonly employed in bronzing; but
                    when a shade more of a red, resembling copper, is required, it can easily be
                    obtained by grinding a very small quantity of red lead along with them. Copper
                    powder may be procured by dissolving filings or slips of that metal with nitrous
                    acid in a receiver. When the acid is saturated the slips are to be removed; or,
                    if filings be employed, the solution is to be poured off from what remains
                    undissolved. Small iron bars are then put in, which will precipitate the copper
                    from the saturated acid, in a powder of the peculiar appearance and colour of
                    copper; and the liquid being poured from the powder, this is to be washed clean
                    off the crystals by repeated levigations. In addition to these compounds, we may
                    name gold size, which is of particular use in bronzing and several other
                    branches of the arts. This is prepared from a pound of linseed oil, with four
                    ounces of gum animi. The latter is gradually supplied in powder to the oil,
                    while boiling; and it is necessary that it should be stirred with every
                    successive dose, until the whole be dissolved and incorporated with the oil. The
                    mixture is still allowed to continue boiling, until a small quantity, when taken
                    out, appears of a thicker consistence than tar, and the whole being then
                    strained through a coarse cloth, is put aside. When used, it must be ground with
                    as much vermilion as will render it opaque, and, at the same time, diluted with
                    such a quantity of oil of turpentine as will bring it to a proper consistence
                    for working freely with the pencil.</p>
                <p>In regard to the operation of bronzing itself, if a cement is to be used, the
                    powders now described may be mixed with strong gum water or isinglass, and laid
                    on the subject with a brush or pencil; in doing which, some artists recommend
                    beginning at the bottom and proceeding upwards. By a different process, gold
                    size, prepared with a due proportion of turpentine, may be taken, and the
                    subject covered with it; then being allowed to dry very nearly, but still
                    preserving a certain clamminess, a piece of soft leather wrapped round the
                    finger is dipped in the powder, and rubbed over the work; or, what is judged
                    preferable, it may be spread with a soft camel-hair pencil. The whole, now
                    covered, must be left to dry, and the loose powder then cleared away by a hair
                    pencil also. Here the principal nicety consists in ascertaining the proper
                    period of dryness for applying the powder, as much of the effect depends on it.
                    But this method of bronzing is esteemed better, because the gold size binds the
                    powders to the ground, without any hazard of their scaling or rubbing off, which
                    sometimes happens when gum or isinglass is employed. The precise tint of
                    bronzing is regulated by taste; and, indeed, a very perceptible difference
                    appears both in ancient and modern statues, resulting either from age or the
                    metallic proportions.</p>
                <p>Bronzing on wood may be effected by a particular process, somewhat varying from
                    the general rules. Prussian blue, patent yellow, raw umber, lamp-black, and
                    pipe-clay, are ground separately with water, on a stone, and as much of them as
                    will make a good colour put into a small vessel three fourths full of size, not
                    quite so strong as what is called clean size in gilding. This mixture is found
                    to succeed best on using about half as much more pipe-clay as of the rest; but
                    this depends on taste and fancy in preferring a peculiar tint. The wood being
                    previously cleaned and smoothed, and coated with a mixture of clean size and
                    lamp-black, receives a new coating with the preceding ingredients, twice
                    successively, having allowed the first to dry: afterwards the bronze-powder is
                    to be laid on with a pencil, and the whole burnished or cleaned anew, observing
                    to repair the parts which maybe injured by this operation. Next, the work must
                    be coated over with a thin lather of Castile soap, which will take off the glare
                    of the burnishing, and afterwards carefully rubbed with a woollen cloth. The
                    gangrenous appearance of the cavities is effected by slightly wetting them with
                    a camel-hair pencil dipped in the lather, and then sprinkling them with a little
                    dust of verditer gum. The superfluous powder may be rubbed off when dry.</p>
                <p>In bronzing iron, the subject should be heated to a greater degree than the hand
                    can bear, and German gold, mixed with a small quantity of spirit of wine
                    varnish, spread over it with a pencil. Should the iron be already polished, it
                    is necessary to heat it well and moisten it with a linen rag wet in vinegar, on
                    purpose to obscure the glare, that the bronze-powder may be sufficiently
                    incorporated with the surface. There are other methods of accomplishing the same
                    object, as by employing some coloured mordant, when the iron is not to be
                    exposed to heat, and spreading the bronze over the mordant, when half dry, with
                    a pencil. Bronze is injured by humidity; and it is said not to preserve its
                    proper quality beyond ten years; but it may be renewed, in which case the
                    subject must be completely cleaned.</p>
                <p>There is an analogous method of silvering casts of plaster of Paris, and other
                    substances, which is also called bronzing, and conducted after the manner above
                    described ∙ but it is not in general repute.</p>
                <p>Conjectures have been entertained, that artists originally resorted to bronzing
                    solely for the purpose of correcting the glare of colours; but this is
                    exceedingly improbable ∙ and it is certainly unnecessary to seek farther than
                    the inducement of easily imitating metallic figures esteemed by the curious.
                    This art has of late years come into very general use, and has received many
                    improvements.</p>
