                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BRETON, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Cape Breton</hi></label>, an
                    island near the eastern side of the continent of North America, situated between
                    forty-five and forty-seven degrees of north latitude. It is separated from Nova
                    Scotia by a narrow strait called Canso, and is about a hundred miles in length
                    by fifty in breadth. It is surrounded with little sharp-pointed rocks, separated
                    from each other by the waves, above which some of their tops are visible. All
                    its harbours are open to the southeast. On the other parts of the coast there
                    are but few anchoring places for small vessels. Except in the hilly portions,
                    the surface of the country has but little solidity, being everywhere covered
                    with a light moss, and with water. The dampness of the soil is exhaled in fogs,
                    without rendering the air unwholesome; but the climate is very cold, owing
                    either to the number of the lakes, which cover more than half the island and
                    remain frozen for a considerable period of the year, or to the extent of the
                    forests, and the fogs that totally intercept the rays of the sun.</p>
                <p>Though some fishermen had long resorted to this island every summer, not more
                    than twenty or thirty ever settled there. The French, who took possession of it
                    in August 1713, were properly the first inhabitants. They changed its name to
                    that of Isle Royale, and fixed upon Fort Dauphin as their principal settlement.
                    This harbour was two leagues in circumference, and might have been rendered
                    impregnable at a trifling expense; but the difficulty of approaching it
                    occasioned it to be abandoned, after great labour had been bestowed upon the
                    undertaking. The settlers then turned their views to Louisbourg, the access to
                    which was easier; and convenience was thus preferred to security. The
                    fortification of Louisbourg, however, was not begun till the year 1720.</p>
                <p>In the year 1714 some fishermen, who till then had lived in Newfoundland, settled
                    in this island. It was expected that their number would soon have been
                    increased; but these hopes were disappointed. Some distressed adventurers from
                    Europe, however, came over from time to time to Cape Breton, and the number of
                    inhabitants gradually increased to four thousand. They were settled at
                    Louisbourg, Fort Dauphin, Port Toulouse, Nerucka, and on all the coasts where a
                    proper beach was to be found for drying cod. The inhabitants never applied
                    themselves to agriculture, the soil being wholly unfit ŕòr it. They frequently
                    sowed corn, but it seldom came to maturity; and when it did thrive sð as to be
                    worth reaping, it degenerated so much that it was unfit for seed next harvest.
                    In a word, the soil of Cape Breton seemed calculated to invite none but
                    fishermen and soldiers.</p>
                <p>Though the island was entirely covered with forests before it was inhabited, its
                    woods scarcely ever became an object of trade. The peltry trade was a very
                    inconsiderable object. It consisted only of the skins of a few lynxes, elks,
                    musk-rats, wild cats, bears, otters, and foxes of a red and silver-gray colour.
                    Some of these were procured from a colony of Mickmac Indians who had settled on
                    the island with the French, and never could raise more than sixty men able to
                    bear arms. The rest came from St John’s, or the neighbouring continent. Greater
                    advantages might possibly have been derived from the coalmines, which abound in
                    the island. The strata lie in a horizontal direction; and being only about eight
                    feet below the surface, they may consequently be worked without digging deep or
                    draining off the waters. But notwithstanding the prodigious demand for coal from
                    New England between the year 1745 and 1749, these mines would probably have been
                    forsaken, had not the ships which were sent out to the French islands wanted
                    ballast.</p>

                <p>The people of Cape Breton did not send all their fish to Europe. Part was
                    exported to the French southern islands, on board twenty or twenty-five ships of
                    from seventy to a hundred and forty tons burden. Besides the cod, which formed
                    at least half their cargoes, they exported to the other colonies timber, planks,
                    thin oak-boards, salted salmon, and mackerel, train-oil, and sea-coal, which
                    were paid for in sugar and coffee, but chiefly in rum and molasses. The island,
                    however, could not consume all these commodities, and as Canada took but a small
                    part of the overplus, it was chiefly bought by the people of New England, who
                    gave in exchange fruits, vegetables, wood, brick, and cattle.</p>
                <p>This island, which may be considered as the key of Canada, was attacked by the
                    English in 1745. The plan of the invasion was laid at Boston, and New England
                    bore the expense of it. A merchant named Pepperel, who had excited, encouraged,
                    and directed the enterprise, was intrusted with the command of an army of 6000
                    men, which had been levied for the expedition; and these forces, convoyed by a
                    squadron from Jamaica, brought the first news to Cape Breton of the danger that
                    threatened it. But although the advantage of a surprise would have secured the
                    landing without opposition, and the invaders had to encounter but 600 regular
                    troops and 800 inhabitants hastily armed, still the success of the undertaking
                    was precarious. Little could be expected from a militia suddenly assembled, who
                    had never seen an enemy, and who were to act under the direction of sea-officers
                    only. But an incident, fortunate for the invaders, neutralized even this
                    insufficient force.</p>
                <p>The construction and repairs of the fortifications of Louisbourg had always been
                    left to the care of the garrison, and the soldiers were anxious to be employed
                    in these works. But when they found that those who should have paid them
                    appropriated to themselves the profit of their labours, and when the justice
                    they demanded was denied them, they determined to assert their rights, and their
                    indignation rose to such a height that they despised all authority. They had in
                    fact been in open rebellion for six months, when the British appeared before the
                    place. This apparition, however, did not produce the union which was so
                    necessary for the common defence. The soldiers indeed made advances; but their
                    commanders, mistrusting a generosity of which they themselves were incapable,
                    kept their men in a manner prisoners, till an ill-managed defence had reduced
                    them to the necessity of capitulating. The whole island shared the fate of
                    Louisbourg, its only bulwark.</p>
                <p>This valuable possession, restored to France by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle,
                    was again attacked by the British in 1758. On the 2d of June, a fleet of
                    twenty-three ships of the line and eighteen frigates, having on board 16,000
                    troops, anchored in Gabarus Bay, within half a league of Louisbourg. It had been
                    attempted to render the landing impracticable near the town; and in the prudent
                    precautions <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> which had been taken, the beśiegers saw
                    the dangers and difficulties they had to expect; but, far from being deterred by
                    these, they had recourse to stratagem, and, extending their line so as to
                    threaten the whole coast, they landed by force of arms at Cormorant Creek. This
                    place was naturally weak. The French had fortified it with a good parapet
                    planted with cannon, behind which they had posted 2000 soldiers and some
                    Indians, while in front they had constructed with felled trees an impenetrable
                    abbattis.</p>
                <p>But these and other precautions that had been taken were rendered abortive by the
                    impetuosity of the French. The English had scarce begun to move towards the
                    shore, when their enemies exposed the snare they had laid for them. By opening a
                    brisk but hasty fire on the boats, and still more by prematurely removing the
                    boughs that masked the forces, the English, apprised of their danger,
                    immediately turned back, and the benefit of these preparations was entirely
                    lost. The situation of the English, however, was still sufficiently critical,
                    especially as they saw no other place to effect a landing on except a rock,
                    which had always been deemed inaccessible. But General Wolfe, while occupied in
                    reirnbarking his troops, and sending off the boats, ordered Major Scott to
                    repair thither; and that officer immediately proceeded towards the spot with his
                    men. The Major’s own boat approached first, but sinking at the very instant he
                    stepped ashore, he climbed up the rock alone, in hopes of meeting with a hundred
                    of his men who had been sent to attempt a landing at another point. Instead of
                    this number, he found only ten; but with these few he gained the summit of the
                    rock, where ten Indians and sixty Frenchmen killed two of them and mortally
                    wounded three. But notwithstanding this loss he stood his ground under cover of
                    a thicket, till the troops, regardless alike of the raging surf and the fire of
                    the cannon, came up to him and put him in full possession of that important
                    post, the only one that could secure the landing. The French, as soon as they
                    saw that the enemy had got a firm footing on land, betook themselves to the only
                    remaining refuge, and shut themselves up in Louisbourg. But the fortifications
                    were in a bad condition; the revêtements of the several curtains had entirely
                    crumbled away; there was but one casemate and a small magazine that were
                    bombproof; and the garrison consisted only of 2900 men. Notwithstanding these
                    disadvantages, however, the besieged made an obstinate resistance; and it was
                    only on the eve of an assault, which it was impossible to sustain, that they
                    talked of surrendering. An honourable capitulation was granted them, and the
                    possession was confirmed to Great Britain by the peace in 1763, after which the
                    fortifications were blown up, and the town of Louisbourg dismantled.</p>
