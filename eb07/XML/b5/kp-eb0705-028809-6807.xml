                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BRINDLEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, a man
                    celebrated for mechanical inventions, and particularly skilful in planning and
                    conducting inland navigation, was born in 1716, at Tunsted in Derbyshire.
                    Through the mismanagement of his father, his education was totally neglected;
                    and, at seventeen, he bound himself apprentice to a mill-wright, near
                    Macclesfield, in Cheshire. He served his apprenticeship, and afterwards setting
                    up for himself, by inventions and contrivances of his own advanced the
                    mill-wright business to a degree of perfection which it had not attained before.
                    The consequence was, that his fame as an ingenious mechanic spreading widely,
                    his genius was no longer confined to the business of his profession. In 1752 he
                    erected a very extraordinary water-engine at Clifton, in Lancashire, for the
                    purpose of draining coal mines; and, in 1755, he was employed to execute the
                    larger wheels for a new silk mill at Congleton, in Cheshire. The potteries of
                    Staffordshire were also about this time indebted to him for several valuable
                    additions to the mills used by them for grinding flint-stones. In 1756 he
                    undertook to erect a steam-engine near Newcastle-under-Line, upon a new plan;
                    and it is believed that he would have brought this engine to a great degree of
                    perfection, if some interested engineers had not opposed him.</p>
                <p>His attention, however, was soon afterwards called off to another object, which
                    in its consequences has proved of high importance to trade and commerce; namely,
                    the projecting and executing of inland navigations. By these navigations the
                    expense of carriage is lessened; a communication is opened from one part of the
                    kingdom to another, and from each of these parts to the sea; and hence products
                    and manufactures are afforded at a moderate price. The Duke of Bridgewater
                    having at Worsley, about seven miles from Manchester, a large estate abounding
                    with coal, which had hitherto lain useless because of the expense of
                    land-carriage, and being desirous to work these mines, perceived the necessity
                    of constructing<pb break="no" facs="nls:193736820" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6820-0289"
                    /> a canal from Worsley to Manchester; upon which occasion Brindley was
                    consulted, and having declared the scheme practicable, an act for this purpose
                    was obtained in 1758 and 1759. But as it was afterwards discovered that the
                    navigation would be more beneficial if carried over the river Irwell to
                    Manchester, another act was obtained to vary the course of the canal ^agreeably
                    to the new plan, and likewise to extend a side-branch to Longford Bridge in
                    Stretford. Brindley, in the mean time, had begun these great works, being the
                    first of the kind ever attempted in England with navigable subterraneous tunnels
                    and elevated aqueducts; and, in order to preserve the level of the water, and
                    free it from the usual obstructions of locks, he carried the canal over rivers
                    and many large and deep valleys. When it was completed as far as Barton, where
                    the Irwell is navigable for large vessels, he proposed to carry it over that
                    river by an aqueduct of thirty-nine feet above the surface of the water; and
                    though this project was treated as wild and chimerical, yet, supported by his
                    noble patron, he began his work in September 1760, and the first boat sailed
                    over it in July 1761. The duke afterwards extended his ideas to Liverpool, and
                    obtained, in 1762, an act for branching his canal to the tideway in the Mersey;
                    this ramification of the work being carried over the rivers Mersey and Bolland,
                    and over many wide and deep valleys.</p>
                <p>The success of the Duke of Bridgewater’s undertakings encouraged a number of
                    gentlemen and manufacturers in Staffordshire to revive the idea of a canal
                    navigation through that county, and Brindley was therefore engaged to make a
                    survey from the Trent to the Mersey. This canal was begun in 1766, conducted
                    under Brindley’s direction as long as he lived, and finished after his death by
                    his brother-in-law Mr Flemshall in May 1777. The proprietors called it the Canal
                    from the Trent to the Mersey; but the engineer, more emphatically, the Grand
                    Trunk Navigation, on account of the numerous branches, which, as he justly
                    supposed, would be every way extended from it. It is ninety-three miles in
                    length, and, besides a large number of bridges over it, has seventy-six locks
                    and five tunnels. The most remarkable of the tunnels is the subterraneous
                    passage of Harecastle, being 2880 yards in length, and more than seventy yards
                    below the surface of the earth. The scheme of this inland navigation had
                    employed the thoughts of the ingenious part of the kingdom for upwards of twenty
                    years before, and some surveys had been made; but Harecastle Hill, through which
                    the tunnel is constructed, could neither be avoided nor overcome by any
                    expedient which the most able engineers could devise. It was Brindley alone who
                    surmounted this, and other similar difficulties arising from the variety of
                    strata and quicksands, which no one but himself would have attempted to
                    conquer.</p>
                <p>Brindley was engaged in many other similar undertakings; for a fuller account of
                    which the reader is referred to the <hi rend="italic">Biographia
                    Britannica,</hi> and to a curious and valuable pamphlet, published many years
                    since, entitled <hi rend="italic">The History of Inland Navigations,
                    particularly that of the Duke of Bridgewater.</hi> Brindley died at Turnhurst in
                    Staffordshire on the 27th September 1772, in his fifty-sixth year, being
                    supposed to have shortened his days by too intense application, and to have
                    brought on a hectic fever, which continued in his system for some years before
                    it consumed him. He never indulged or relaxed himself in the common diversions
                    of life, not having the least relish for them; and though once prevailed on to
                    see a play in London, yet he declared that he would on no account be present at
                    another, because it so disturbed his ideas for several days after as to render
                    him unfit for business. When any extraordinary difficulty occurred to him in the
                    execution of his works, he generally retired to bed, and lay there one, two, or
                    three days, till he had surmounted it. He then got up and executed his design
                    without any drawing or model; for he had a prodigious memory, and carried every
                    thing in his head.</p>
                <p>As his station in life was low, and his education totally neglected, so his
                    exterior accomplishments were suitable to them. He could indeed read and write,
                    but very indifferently; and he was perhaps as thoroughly <hi rend="italic"
                    >abnormis sapiens,</hi> “of mother-wit, and wise without the schools,” as any
                    man that ever lived. “He is as plain a looking man,” says a writer of the time,
                    describing him, “as one of the boors in the Peak, or his own carters; but when
                    he speaks, all ears listen; and every mind is filled with wonder at the things
                    he pronounces to be practicable.” The same author adds, “Being great in himself,
                    he harbours no contracted notions, no jealousy of rivals; he conceals not his
                    method of proceeding, nor asks patents to secure the sole use of the machines
                    which he invents and exposes to public view. Sensible that he must one day cease
                    to be, he selects men of genius, teaches them the power of mechanics, and
                    employs them in carrying on the various undertakings in which he is engaged. It
                    is not to the Duke of Bridgewater only that his services are confined; he is of
                    public utility, and employs his talents in rectifying the mistakes of despairing
                    workmen and artizans. His powers shine most in the midst of difficulties; when
                    rivers and mountains seem to thwart his designs, then appears his vast capacity,
                    by which he makes them subservient to his will.” Happening on one occasion to be
                    examined before a committee of the House of Commons, and to express a decided
                    preference for artificial navigation as a means of internal communication, a
                    member asked him, “For what purpose, then, do you think rivers were created ?”
                    “To furnish water for navigable canals,” replied Brindley after a moment’s
                    hesitation.</p>
