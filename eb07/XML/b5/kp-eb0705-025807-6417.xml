                <p><label type="entry">BRICK</label>, a kind of artificial stone made of baked
                    clay.</p>
                <p>1. The art of making bricks is so simple that it must have been practised in the
                    earliest ages of the world; probably before mankind had discovered the method of
                    fashioning stones to suit the purposes of building. The book of Genesis informs
                    us, that burnt bricks were employed in the construction of Babel. Now, as this
                    structure appears to have been raised about four hundred years after the period
                    of the Γιood, we may say, without much exaggeration, that the method of making
                    bricks existed from the very origin of society. Bricks seem to have been in
                    common use in Egypt while the Israelites were in subjection to that nation; for
                    the task assigned them was the making of brick; and we are informed in Exodus
                    that the Israelites built two Egyptian cities. No particulars are given in
                    Scripture of the method of making bricks; but as straw was one of the
                    ingredients, and as it very seldom rains in Egypt, it is probable that their
                    bricks were not burnt, but merely baked by the heat of the sun. The same mode of
                    making bricks seems still to be practised in the East; for the ruins of the
                    tower near Bagdad are formed of unburnt bricks. We have seen specimens from that
                    place; they are large, but thin, and have a brown colour. It is not at all
                    likely that structures of unburnt brick should have been able to resist the
                    weather since the time of Nebuchadnezzar; and hence it is probable that the
                    tower in question was raised by the Arabs in comparatively modern times.</p>
                <p>The art of brick-making was carried to considerable perfection by the Greeks.
                    Pliny informs us that they made use of bricks of three different sizes,
                    distinguished by the following names; <hi rend="italic">didoron,</hi> or six
                    inches long; <hi rend="italic">tetradoro», οx</hi> twelve inches long; and <hi
                    rend="italic">pentadoron,</hi> or fifteen inches long (lib. XXXV. c. 14). That
                    the Romans excelled in the art of making bricks we have the amplest evidence,
                    since brick structures raised at Rome 1700 years ago still remain as entire as
                    when first built. Brick-making has been carried to great perfection by the
                    Dutch, who have long been in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736430"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6430-0259"/>habit of forming their floors, and even in some
                    cases of paving their streets with bricks. And it is remarkable how long their
                    bricks will continue uninjured in such situations. Though brick-making has long
                    been carried on in England, and especially in the neighbourhood of London, upon
                    a very great scale, and though the process upon the whole is conducted in this
                    country with very considerable skill, yet it must be acknowledged that English
                    bricks are by no means so durable as Dutch bricks. We are disposed to ascribe
                    this inferiority not so much to the nature of the materials employed in the
                    manufacture of English bricks, as to the mode most frequently employed in London
                    in building houses. Few of the London houses, comparatively speaking, are
                    freeholds. Most of them are built upon ground let for a lease of a certain
                    number of years, which seldom exceeds ninety-nine years. After the expiration of
                    this period, the house becomes the property of the landlord who let the ground.
                    Thus it becomes the interest of the builder to construct the house so that it
                    shall last only as long as the lease. Hence the goodness of the bricks becomes
                    only a secondary object. Their cheapness is the principal point. The object,
                    therefore, of the brickmakers is not to furnish durable bricks, but to make them
                    at as cheap a rate as possible. Accordingly, the saving of manual labour, and of
                    fuel, has been carried by the makers of London bricks to very great lengths. We
                    cannot but consider this mode of proceeding as very objectionable, and as
                    entailing a much heavier expense upon London than would have been incurred had
                    twice the original price been laid out upon the bricks when they were first
                    used, and had the houses been constructed to last a thousand instead of a
                    hundred years. No doubt, certain advantages attend these ephemeral structures.
                    The inhabitants are enabled, once every century, to suit their houses to the
                    prevailing taste of the day; and thus, there are no antiquated houses in London.
                    But as the increase of the price of all the materials of building has more than
                    kept pace with the increase of the wealth of individuals, it is to be questioned
                    whether the houses are always improved when they are pulled down and
                    rebuilt.</p>
                <p>2. The best material for making brick is what in the English language is called
                    <hi rend="italic">loam,</hi> a term usually applied to a natural mixture of sand
                    and clay. Such a mixture may be converted into brick without any addition
                    whatever. Marl likewise answers the purpose of common bricks very well, indeed
                    better than most other mixtures. Marl is a natural mixture of limestone and clay
                    in variable proportions. Now, the more lime it contains, the better does it
                    answer for a manure; and the less lime it contains, the more suitable it is to
                    the brick-maker.</p>
                <p>It would be in vain to attempt a particular detail of the constituents of clay,
                    because they varytoo much from each other to admit of any correct
                    generalization. We believe, however, that clays very frequently consist of
                    decomposed felspar, in which case we may conceive them as composed of about
                    three parts of silica in the state of a very fine powder <hi rend="subscript">
                    5</hi> and one part of alumina. This is the case with porcelain clay. Indeed,
                    the porcelain clay of Cornwall appears incon trover tibly to be nothing else
                    than decayed felspar, or perhaps felspar which never had assumed any other form
                    than that of clay. The rock from which it is taken is an agglutinated, mixture
                    of quartz and this clay. The quartz is separated by washing. Such a rock might
                    probably be converted into most beautiful brick, merely by cutting it out in the
                    proper shape, and subjecting it to the requisite heat; or rather, by kneading
                    the whole into a paste with the requisite quantity of water, moulding it into
                    bricks, and then drying and burning them.</p>

                <p>When the clay proceeds from the decomposition of hornblende, as is likewise often
                    the case, it contains about three parts and a half of silica, one of alumina,
                    one of lime, and about one and a half of oxide of iron. Sometimes the grains of
                    sand which exist in clay consist of fragments of felspar. In such cases the clay
                    may be fused by heat.</p>
                <p>No mixture of alumina and silica, in any proportions whatever, can be fused by
                    the strongest heat which can be raised in our furnaces. Hence such mixtures are
                    best adapted for making fire-bricks, crucibles, and glass-house pots.
                    Stourbridge clay is such a mixture, blackened by coaly matter. It answers these
                    purposes better than any other clay in England. It is a slate clay belonging to
                    the coal formation, and contains interspersed coaly matter. There is a similar
                    bed of clay upon the banks of the Calder, about ten miles east from Glasgow. Mr
                    Bnttray uses it to make the crucibles in which he fuses steel, a process
                    requiring the most intense heat that can be raised in furnaces. Its quality
                    seems fully equal to that of Stourbridge clay. Neither can a mixture of lime and
                    alumina be fused, in whatever proportions the ingredients be mixed. But a
                    mixture of silica, lime, and alumina, is very fusible, and the fusion is most
                    readily effected when we employ two parts of silica to one of lime. The presence
                    of oxide of iron also renders clay fusible, but not unless its proportion be
                    much greater than ever is likely to occur in any clay used for the manufacture
                    of bricks.</p>
                <p>For making common bricks, the most durable mixture ought to be common clay and
                    limestone or chalk. Perhaps the best proportions would be three parts of clay,
                    and one part of limestone or chalk in powder. When such a mixture is exposed to
                    heat, it would experience an incipient fusion, and would thereby be rendered
                    much harder and denser than common bricks. The consequence would be, that it
                    would imbibe much less water, and would therefore be much less liable to crack
                    and fall to pieces in winter, than common bricks. For when water has insinuated
                    itself into the pores of a common brick, and is converted into ice, it undergoes
                    an expansion which dislocates the parts of the brick and reduces it to
                    fragments. This is often conspicuously the case with tyles, which, from their
                    exposed situation, are more liable to be soaked with water than common bricks.
                    Hence also covering the surface of the brick with a coating of paint has a great
                    tendency to preserve them from cracking and breaking. This practice is
                    frequently followed in England.</p>
                <p>It would be foreign to the object of this article to enter into any long details
                    respecting the chemical investigations and the opinions entertained at different
                    periods respecting the nature of clay. At first it was supposed to be a peculiar
                    species of earth, but Hellot demonstrated that it consisted at least of two
                    constituents; for sulphuric acid had the property of destroying its plastic
                    nature, and of rendering it scarcely more adhesive than sand. The portion that
                    remained behind did not effervesce with acids. It was not therefore of a
                    calcareous nature. Mr Pott went a step farther; he showed, in the continuation
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Lithogeognosia,</hi> that sulphuric acid formed, with
                    the por-tion<pb break="no" facs="nls:193736443" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6443-0260"/>
                    of clay which it dissolved, a salt possessing the properties of alum. In the
                    year 1769 Baumé published his <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on Clays,</hi>
                    which he had drawn up in consequence of a premium offered by the Academy of
                    Sciences at Bourdeaux, for the best solution of the following question :—What
                    are the principles and constituents of clay, and the natural changes which it
                    experiences, and what are the methods of rendering it fertile? The academy did
                    not consider Baumé’s solutions as satisfactory. He published his Memoir, in
                    consequence, as a kind of defiance. He had been employed along with Macquer in
                    making numerous experiments on clay, with a view to the improvement of the
                    porcelain manufacture in France. Guided by these experiments, he drew as a
                    conclusion that clay is a mixture of two different substances: 1. Silica in a
                    state of purity; 2. Silica combined with an underdose of sulphuric acid. It was
                    the second of these constituents that gave to clay its fattish and plastic
                    nature. Margraaf had long before (in 1756) demonstrated that the ingredient of
                    clay which Baumé took for a salt, and which he affirmed was soluble in water,
                    was a peculiar species of earth, different from every other, which constitutes
                    the basis of alum, which dissolves in sulphuric acid, but which does not form
                    alum un.ess a portion of potash be added to the solution. Thus, by the labours
                    of Hellot, Pott, Baumé, and Margraaf, the nature of clay was completely
                    developed. It was ascertained to be a mixture of alumina and silica, in variable
                    proportions. It was shown, also, that it sometimes contained sulphuric acid, and
                    not unfrequently potash. Hence the reason why, in some cases, it could be
                    converted into alum by digestion in sulphuric acid, without the necessity of
                    adding any potash to the solution. Modern chemists have added considerably to
                    these facts. They have shown that chalk, felspar, mica, hornblende, oxide of
                    iron, coal, bitumen, &amp;c. are not unfrequently mixed with it; and that these
                    additions alter its qualities considerably, and render it fit or unfit for the
                    different purposes to which clay is usually applied.</p>
                <p>3. Clay intended to be made into bricks ought to be dug out of the earth and
                    exposed to the air and weather for a considerable time before it is employed.
                    The longer this exposure is continued, so much the better will it be fitted for
                    making bricks. This exposure answers a variety of purposes. If the stones, by
                    the decomposition of which the clay has been formed, are not entirely
                    decomposed, this exposure serves to complete the process, by promoting the
                    disintegrating action of the air and rain. The exposure serves likewise to
                    pulverize the clay, which is essential to. the making of good bricks. We have
                    little doubt that the same amelioration in the clay would be produced by simply
                    drying it in the open air, and then grinding it to powder in a mill. By such a
                    process the quality of the bricks would be prodigiously improved. Nor do we
                    conceive that such an addition would greatly enhance the expenses of the
                    brickmaker, at least in those districts where the mill could be driven by
                    water.</p>
                <p>When the clay has been reduced to powder, the next step is to make it into a
                    stiff paste with water. Too much water should not be employed, because it is
                    injurious to the strength of the bricks; and the utmost care should be taken to
                    mix the whole of the clay as equally as possible with the water. If some parts
                    of the paste be moister than others, it will occasion an inequality in the
                    texture of the bricks formed of it, will render them apt to crack, and will
                    greatly injure both their strength and their beauty. Hence the great importance
                    of working the clay for a considerable length of time before moulding it into
                    bricks. It is in this part of the process that we believe British brickmakers in
                    general are most defective. As far as we have had an opportunity of witnessing
                    the process of kneading the clay, as conducted either in the neighbourhood of
                    London or Edinburgh, we have always found a great sparing of labour. Hence we
                    believe the reason why so many of the English bricks appear full of cracks, even
                    when sold to the builder. Such bricks ought never to be purchased, as it is
                    perfectly obvious that they cannot make a durable building.</p>
                <p>The kneading of the clay is performed in some places by men’s feet, in others by
                    the feet of horses, and in others by machinery. The last method is undoubtedly
                    the best; and we conceive likewise that it might be rendered the cheapest. It
                    would be easy to devise machinery for kneading the clay, upon principles similar
                    to those employed in mashing by the London porter brewers. And, if such a
                    machine were driven by water, we conceive that it would not be nearly so
                    expensive as either men or horses.</p>
                <p>When the clay is sufficiently kneaded, it is moulded into the form of a brick, by
                    being put into a very simple wooden mould; and the upper part of the brick is
                    made smooth and even by cutting off the superfluous part with a wooden knife.
                    The process is very simple, and is conducted by the workmen with great rapidity.
                    A good brickmaker would mould about 5000 bricks in a day. He disengages the
                    bricks from the mould by a gentle stroke on the back of the mould; and the wet
                    bricks are at first arranged in rows upon long boards. When sufficiently dry to
                    be handled, they arc turned, and at last piled up in loose walls, which are
                    thatched with straw to keep off the rain. In this position they are allowed to
                    remain till they have become as dry as they can become in the open air.</p>
                <p>In many cases the clay used for brick-making is destitute of the requisite
                    quantity of sand. If such clay were made into bricks, it would shrink so much in
                    their burning, that the bricks would lose their shape, and would probably crack
                    in every direction. To prevent this, it is necessary to add a certain quantity
                    of sand. This sand should not be very fine. It answers best when the particles
                    are of such a size as to be readily distinguished by the naked eye. Even when as
                    large as coriander seeds, it has been found to answer better than very fine
                    sand. The brickmakers in the neighbourhood of London bring their sand from the
                    bottom of the Thames near Woolwich, where it is raised by boats employed for
                    that purpose, and brought up the river for the use of the brick-makers.</p>
                <p>4. No general directions can be given respecting the quantity of sand to be mixed
                    with the clay, because that depends upon the nature of the clay and upon the
                    uses for which the bricks are intended. The more sand is added, the more
                    accurately do the bricks retain their shape, and the less apt are they to crack
                    during the burning, but at the same time their strength is diminished. Chemical
                    lutes are often composed of four parts of sand and one part of clay. Such
                    mixtures do not contract much in burning, and, therefore, are not apt to crack
                    and drop off, which is the reason why chemists employ them. But they have not
                    the adhesiveness of brick after being burned, and would not therefore answer the
                    purposes of the brick-maker. In stone-ware the mixture consists of about four
                    parts of clay and one of fine sand. It burns to a hard cohesive substance,
                    capable of striking fire with steel. Such a proportion, then, in many cases
                    would answer the purposes of the brick-maker.</p>
                <p>The London brick makers make another addition to the clay, which we believe is
                    peculiar to them. They add to every three parts of the clay about one part of
                    the ashes from the fire-places of the city of London. These ashes contain some
                    earthy matter; but they consist in a great measure of small coal unburnt and
                    little altered, which has fallen through the interstices of the grate. The
                    consequence<pb break="no" facs="nls:193736456" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6456-0261"/>
                    is, that such a mixture, when sufficiently heated, takes fire and burns of
                    itself, though very slowly; so that the London bricks are burned in a great
                    measure by means of the fuel mixed with the clay of which they are composed.</p>
                <p>It is essential to dry the bricks thoroughly in the open air before burning them;
                    for when heat is applied to wet clay, the water which it contains being
                    prevented from escaping by the adhesiveness of the mixture, is converted into
                    steam, and cracks, and breaks the mass of clay to pieces. Indeed, after the
                    bricks are rendered as dry as they can become in the open air, they ought to be
                    exposed at first to a gentle heat, which ought to be raised to redness very
                    slowly, and in proportion as the moisture of the brick is dissipated. Water
                    adheres with such obstinacy to clay, that it is never all driven off by the heat
                    at which bricks are burnt. But the portion which remains is so intimately
                    combined with the clay, as to constitute one solid mass, which has no gι <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l</hi> ’ eat tendency to absorb an additional quantity of
                    water.</p>
                <p>Bricks are most commonly burnt in a kiln. This is a very simple structure,
                    usually about thirteen feet long, ten and a half wide, and twelve feet high. The
                    walls are one foot two inches thick, and incline a little to each other as they
                    ascend. The bricks are placed on flat arches, having holes left in them like
                    lattice-work. After the bricks are arranged on the kiln, to the number of about
                    20,000, they are covered with old bricks or tiles. Some brush-wood is then
                    kindled in the kiln, and a moderate fire kept up till the bricks are rendered as
                    dry as possible. The time required for this is two or three days; and the bricks
                    are known to be dry when the smoke (which is at first black) becomes
                    transparent. The mouth of the kiln is then filled up with pieces of brick and
                    clay, leaving only room to introduce a faggot at a time. This structure at the
                    mouth of the kiln is called a <hi rend="italic">shinlog.</hi> The kiln is then
                    supplied with faggots of furze, heath, fern, or whatever vegetable substance can
                    be procured at the cheapest rate, till the arches look white, and the fire
                    appears at the top. The fire is then diminished, and at length allowed to go
                    out, and the kiln is permitted to cool. This burning process usually lasts about
                    forty-eight hours.</p>
                <p>The method of burning bricks in the neighbourhood of London is very different
                    from this; and we do not know whether it be practised anywhere else. It
                    obviously originated from the difficulty of procuring a sufficient quantity of
                    vegetable matter to burn the enormous number of bricks consumed every year in
                    London. If we consider the immense extension of houses which has taken place in
                    London within the last fifty years, and if we consider that this vast city,
                    containing nearly 1,500,000 inhabitants, is almost renewed every century, we may
                    be able to form some notion of the prodigious quantity of bricks which it must
                    consume. In the country round London there is a particular kind of clay, well
                    known by the name of London clay. This clay is almost everywhere covered with a
                    bed of gravel, which varies in thickness according to the elevation of the
                    surface. Hence the whole of the country round London is fit for making bricks.
                    Nothing more is necessary than to dig through the surface of gravel, and get to
                    the clay.</p>
                <p>We have already mentioned, that about a fourth part of the London bricks consists
                    of small coal kneaded up along with the clay. When the bricks are sufficiently
                    dry, they are piled up on each other in parallelopipedons to the intended
                    height. Between each two rows of brick there is strewed a quantity of cinders,
                    amounting to about three inches in thickness. At the distance of about nine feet
                    from each other, perpendicular spaces are left, about a brick wide, which serve
                    the purpose of flues. These are made by arching the bricks over so as to leave a
                    space between each about a brick in width. Over the whole is strewed a pretty
                    thick covering of cinders. The flues are filled likewise with cinders, or, if
                    they cannot be had, with coal. The fire-place is usually at the west end, and is
                    generally three feet high. The fire, when once kindled in the fire-place,
                    propagates itself very slowly <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> through the whole
                    <hi rend="italic">clamp,</hi> as bricks piled in this manner are called. So very
                    slow is the progress, that bricks in the neighbourhood of London take about
                    three months in the burning. The heat is very intense, and, as the fuel is mixed
                    up with the clay itself, every part of the brick is sure to be sufficiently
                    burnt.</p>
                <p>We conceive that the mixture of about one fourth of chalk with the clay of which
                    the London bricks are made, would greatly improve their quality. The consequence
                    would be an incipient fusion, which would render their surface much more compact
                    and solid. The only difficulty would be to proportion the quantity of chalk so
                    as to prevent complete fusion, which would run the bricks into each other, and
                    destroy them entirely. Bricks made of materials which have undergone complete
                    fusion would be greatly superior to common bricks. They .would perfectly resist
                    the action of the weather, and would, therefore, last much longer than common
                    bricks. In Sweden it is customary at some of the iron founderies to cast the
                    scoriae into bricks, which they employ in constructing their furnaces. Such
                    furnaces the writer of this article has seen; and he was assured by the
                    gentleman who had the charge of the works, that they answered fully better than
                    common bricks. It would be easy to make any quantity of such bricks in some of
                    the large iron founderies of Great Britain. We are persuaded that such bricks
                    might be brought into use for a variety of purposes with great advantage, and
                    might even constitute a lucrative article of manufacture. Bricks made from the
                    scoriae of iron and copper founderics would vie in beauty with marble and
                    porphyry, and would possess a lustre of surface to which few marbles could
                    reach.</p>
                <p>Few parts of Great Britain are so well adapted for the making of bricks,
                    according to the London plan, as the neighbourhood of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. There
                    the enormous heaps of small coal, which are of no use whatever, would furnish
                    abundance of fuel at a much cheaper rate than even the London ashes; while the
                    magnesian limestone that occurs in such plenty in the neighbourhood of
                    Sunderland would enable the brickmaker to give the clay the requisite degree of
                    fusibility.</p>
                <p>As bricks form an article of taxation, and furnish a considerable revenue to
                    government, their size has been regulated by act of parliament. They must not be
                    less than eight and a half inches long, two and a half thick, and four inches
                    wide. But, for various purposes, they are nevertheless made of very different
                    and very considerable sizes.</p>
                <p>Fire-bricks are made in the same way as common bricks,' but the materials are
                    different. The best clay for their composition is Stourbridge clay; and, instead
                    of sand, it is usual to mix the clay with a quantity of old fire-bricks, or
                    crucibles, or glass pots, reduced previously to powder. This mixture answers the
                    same purposes as sand, while it does not communicate the tendency to fusion when
                    it comes in contact with various fluxes that are communicated by siliceous
                    sand.</p>
                <p>There is a kind of bricks mentioned by Pliny as used by the ancients, which were
                    so light as to swim in water. “Pitanae in Asia, ct in ulterioris Hispaniae
                    civitatibus Maxilua et Calento, fiunt lateres, qui ciccati non merguntur in
                    aqua.” (Plinii <hi rend="italic">Natur. Histor.</hi> lib. xxxv. c. 14.) Pliny
                    does not mention the part of the world in which the earth employed in the
                    manufactures of these bricks was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736469"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6469-0262"/>found, though in all probability it could not be
                    far from the cities where the bricks are said by Pliny to have been made. He
                    says that the material employed was a kind of pumice stone. But it was quite
                    unknown to the moderns, till, in the year 1791, Fabroni found a substance at
                    Castel del Piano, not far from Santa Fiora, situated between Tuscany and the
                    Papal dominions, which formed bricks capable of swimming in water. This is a
                    white earthy matter, which constitutes a bed in that place, and was known in
                    Italy by the name of <hi rend="italic">Latte di Luria.</hi> In more recent
                    mineralogical books it is distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">farina
                    fossilis (bergmehD.</hi> Iĭaiiy considers it as a variety of talc, and Brochant
                    as a variety of meerschaum. According to the analysis of Fabbroni this substance
                    is composed of</p>

                <p>We see from this analysis that this mineral is neither a variety of talc nor of
                    meerschaum. One would be disposed to consider it as a hydrate of silica; for
                    both the alumina and oxide of iron are present in so small proportions, that we
                    can scarcely consider them as in chemical combination.</p>
                <p>Considering the composition of this earth, it is rather singular that it is
                    capable of being agglutinated by a red heat. We rather suspect that the bricks
                    of Fabbroni, which swim in water, have but very little strength. This, if it be
                    the case, must greatly circumscribe their utility.</p>
                <p>The colour of the London bricks is not red, as is the case with common bricks and
                    tiles, but a light brownish yellow. This colour is more pleasing to the eye than
                    common brick red, and on that account the London bricks are preferred for
                    building houses. The brick-makers assign a curious enough reason for this
                    colour. According to them, their bricks are kept as much as possible from
                    contact with the air during their burning. The consequence of this is, that the
                    iron contained in them is not oxidized to so great a degree as in common bricks.
                    But this mode of reasoning is far from being exact. If air were excluded
                    entirely, the bricks would not be burnt at all, because the fire would be
                    extinguished. But if enough of air be admitted to burn the coal mixed with the
                    clay, which must be the case, that air must also act upon the iron, and reduce
                    it to the state of peroxide. Indeed, there can be no doubt that the iron in the
                    London yellow bricks is in the state of peroxide as well as in the red bricks,
                    for the peroxide of iron gives various colours to bodies, according to
                    circumstances. We find bodies tinged with it red, yellow, and brown, according
                    to the substances with which the oxide is combined. We ascribe the yellow colour
                    of the London bricks to the ashes of the coals, which, by uniting with the
                    peroxides of iron, form a kind of yellow ochre. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    build with bricks, or make brick-work. The London brick-layers form a regular
                    company, which was incorporated in 1568, and consists of a master, two wardens,
                    twenty assistants, and seventy-eight on the livery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ERicκ-Laying,</hi> the art of framing edifices of bricks. Moxon
                    has written a treatise expressly on the art of brick-laying, in which he
                    describes the materials, tools, &lt; and methods of working, used by
                    brick-layers.</p>
                <p>Great care is to be taken that bricks be laid joint on joint in the middle of the
                    walls as seldom as may be; and that good bond be made there as well as on the
                    outsides. Some brick-layers, in working a brick and half wall, lay the header on
                    one side of the wall perpendicular to the header on the other side, and so all
                    along the whole course; whereas, if the header on one side of the wall were
                    toothed as much as the stretcher on the other side, it would be a stronger
                    toothing, and the joints of the headers of one side would be in the middle of
                    the headers of the course they lie upon of the other side. If bricks be laid in
                    winter, they ought to be kept as dry as possible; if in summer, it will save
                    cost to employ boys to wet them, for they will then unite better with the mortar
                    than if dry, and make the work stronger. In large buildings, or where it is
                    thought too much trouble to dip all the bricks separately, water may be thrown
                    on each course after they are laid. If bricks be laid in summer they must be
                    covered; for if the mortar dries too hastily, it will not bind so firmly to the
                    bricks as when left to dry more gradually. If bricks be laid in winter they
                    should also be well covered, to protect them from rain, snow, and frost; which
                    last is a mortal enemy to mortar, especially where it has been wetted just
                    before the frost assaults it. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Building.</hi></p>
