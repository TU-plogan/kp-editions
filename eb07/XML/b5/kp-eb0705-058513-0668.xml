                    physician of considerable reputation, was born in Somersetshire on the 11th of
                    August 1722, and was descended from a respectable and opuĭent Irish family
                    belonging to the sect of Quakers. He received his grammatical education at the
                    acade y of Ballytore, in the north of Ireland, and afterwards pursued his
                    medical studies at Edinburgh and at ⅛‰ <hi rend="subscript"> si</hi> " <hi

                    a fellow, having previously received honorary degrees of doctor in medicine from
                    the universities of Dublin and of Cambridge. The first publication by which he
                    became known to the world was his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Mortality of
                    the Horned Cattle.,</hi> which appeared in 1746, and gained him considerable
                    reputation; and his practice extended itself with that gradual and steady
                    progress which affords the surest prospect of permanent and distinguished
                    success. His benevolent attention to his poorer patients, and the general
                    suavity of his manners, soon brought him into notice, and procured him the
                    esteem of a wide circle of friends, especially among his professional brethren.
                    In consequence of their recommendation of him to Lord Barrington, he was
                    appointed, in 1758, physician to the army; in which capacity he served in
                    Germany during the greater part of the seven years’ war, and in the course of it
                    was chosen physician to the hospitals for British forces. The results of his
                    observations during this period were published in 1764, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Economical and Medical Observations, from</hi> 1738 <hi
                    rend="italic">to</hi> 1763, <hi rend="italic">tending to the improvement of
                    Medical Hospitals,</hi> in one volume octavo. He had already, however, given to
                    the public many proofs of the activity of his mind and the variety of his
                    attainments. The <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Poyal Society</hi> for
                    1747 (vol. xliv.) contain a letter of his on the Indian Poison sent over by Don
                    Antonio de Ulloa; and the succeeding volume for 1747-8 contains a paper on the
                    Poisonous Root lately found mixed with the Gentian. In the Transactions for 1755
                    (vol. xlix.) are inserted his Experiments on the Sensibility and Irritability of
                    the several parts of Animals. He also published, in different volumes of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Medical Observations,</hi> the following papers, namely, the case
                    of a lady labouring under diabetes, in vol. iii.; experiments relative to the
                    analysis of Seltzer water, and case of an encysted tumour in. the orbit of the

                <p>Dr Brocklesby was appointed, by his patron and friend the Duke of Richmond,
                    physician-general to the royal regiment of artillery and corps of engineers; an
                    appointment that connected him much with the laboratory of Woolwich, which he
                    always visited with pleasure. It was by his advice, indeed, that a professorship
                    of chemistry was added to the establishment of the college; and it was also by
                    his recommendation that the celebrated Dr Adair Crawford was nominated the first
                    professor in this new chair.</p>
                <p>The life of a medical practitioner, absorbed in the laborious duties of his
                    profession, is seldom diversified with much incident; and Dr Brocklesby was now
                    arrived at that period when the approaching infirmities of age demanded some
                    relaxation from labour, and an exchange of the anxieties and fatigues of
                    practice for the tranquil amusements of literature and the solace of cheerful
                    society. The frugal use which he had made of means originally slender, but
                    progressively augmenting by the increase of his professional emoluments, by the
                    addition of a pension from the Duke of Richmond, his half pay from the army, and
                    an estate which devolved to him on the death of his father, had placed him in
                    circumstances not only independent, but affluent, and enabled him to derive from
                    retirement all the advantages he had contemplated. His society was courted on
                    all sides; and the circle of his friends comprehended some of the most
                    distinguished literary men of the age. He was during the whole of his life
                    intimate with Burke. His acquaintance with this extraordinary man began at the
                    school where they were both educated, and soon ripened into the warmest and most
                    durable friendship. He was also on terms of close intimacy with Dr Johnson, and
                    attended him in his last illness with the assiduity and kindness of a friend. Dr
                    Brocklesby is characterised in Boswell’s Life of Dr Johnson as a man whose
                    reading, knowledge of life, and good spirits, supplied him with a never-failing
                    source of conversation; and several letters, addressed to him from Dr Johnson,
                    are preserved in that entertaining work. One trait, however, is omitted, which
                    does him great honour. Understanding that Dr Johnson wished, in the latter part
                    of his life, to remove to the Continent for the recovery of his health, Dr
                    Brocklesby immediately made him offer of an annuity of L.100 during the
                    remainder of his life; and, when this offer was declined, pressed him to reside
                    in his house, as more suited to his health than the one in which he then lived.
                    The same generous disposition was manifested in his conduct to Burke, to whom he
                    transmitted L.1000, as a legacy he had intended leaving him, but which he
                    thought would be of more use to him at the present time. Dr Brocklesby was,
                    indeed, the survivor of Burke, though only for a few months; for on his return
                    from a visit which he paid to the widow of his friend at Beaconsfield, after
                    dining with his two nephews, Dr Thomas Young and Mr Beeby, of whose education he
                    had taken the principal charge, he expired suddenly a few minutes after retiring
                    to bed, without the least pain or previous illness. He left his fortune, which
                    was considerable, between his two nephews, with the exception of a few legacies
                    to friends and distant relations. (γ.)</p>
