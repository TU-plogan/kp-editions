                <p>CHAP. I.</p>
                <p>HISTORY OF BREWING.</p>
                <p>No notice is taken of beer or ale in the books of Moses, from which it is
                    probable that they were unknown till after the death of this legislator. All the
                    ancient Greek writers agree in assigning the honour of the discovery of beer to
                    the Egyptians, whose country, being annually inundated by the Nile, was not
                    adapted to the cultivation of vines. Herodotus, who wrote about 450 years before
                    the commencement of the Christian era, informs us that the Egyptians made their
                    wine from barley, because they had no vines. O∕rω δ ’ <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    this liquid in Aegypt was called <hi rend="italic">zythum</hi> (Plinii <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Hat.</hi> lib. xxii. c. 25). The same name was given to it
                    by the inhabitants of Galatia, who, according to Diodorus Siculus, were unable
                    to cultivate grapes on account of the coldness of their climate. Beer was
                    distinguished among the Greeks by a variety of names. It was called oz&gt;ov <hi
                    rend="italic">χξi0wov</hi> (barley wine) from its vinous properties, and from
                    the material employed in its formation. In Sophocles, and probably <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> in other Greek writers, it is distinguished by <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> the name of <hi rend="italic">βρ∙jrov.</hi>
                    Dioscorides describes two kinds of beer, to one of which he gives the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">ζυ0ov,</hi> and to the other x¢uşµ/; but he gives us no
                    description of either sufficient to enable us to distinguish them from each
                    other. (Dioscorides, lib. ii. c. 79 and 80.) Both, he informs us, were made from
                    barley, and similar liquids were manufactured in Spain and Britain from
                    wheat.</p>
                <p>Tacitus informs us, that, in his time, beer was the common drink of the Germans;
                    and from his imperfect description of the process which they followed, it is not
                    unlikely, or rather there can be no doubt, that they were acquainted with the
                    method of converting barley into malt. “Potui humor ex hordeo aut frumento in
                    quandam similitudinem vini corruptus.” <hi rend="italic">(He Moribus
                    German.</hi> c. 23.) Pliny gives us some details respecting beer, though they
                    are by <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> no means satisfactory. He distinguishes it
                    by <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> the name of <hi rend="italic">cerevisia</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">cervisia,</hi> the appellation by which it is always known
                    in modern Latin books.</p>
                <p>This liquid does not appear to have come into general use in Greece or Italy; but
                    in Germany and Britain, and some other countries, it appears to have been the
                    common drink of the inhabitants, at least as early as the time of Tacitus, and
                    probably long before. It has continued in these countries ever since, and great
                    quantities of beer are still manufactured in Germany, in the Low Countries, and
                    in Britain.</p>
                <p>The first treatise published on the subject, as far as we know, was by Basil λ
                    <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> alentine. This treatise, according to Boerhaave,
                    for we ourselves have never had an opportunity of seeing it, is both accurate
                    and elegant. In the year 1585, Thaddeus Hagecius ab Hayek, a Bohemian writer,
                    published a treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">De Cervisia</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193736066" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6066-0231"/><hi rend="italic">ejusque
                    confidendi ratione, natura, viribus et facultatibus.</hi> This little treatise,
                    consisting only of fifty pages, is written with great simplicity and
                    perspicuity, and gives as accurate a description of the whole process of brewing
                    as any treatise on the subject which we have seen. In the early part of the
                    eighteenth century, Mr Combrune, who, we believe, was a practical London brewer,
                    published a book entitled <hi rend="italic">The Theory and Practice of
                    Brewing.</hi> This book has gone through many editions, and, we believe, is
                    still reckoned the standard book on the subject. But the attempts made in it to
                    give a rational theory of brewing are far from being satisfactory. Nor can any
                    stress be laid upon the experiments which it contains on the colour of malt,
                    according to the temperature at which it is dried. The fact is, that malt may be
                    rendered brown, or even black, by exposure to a very low heat; while it may be
                    exposed to a very considerable temperature without losing its colour. The writer
                    of this article has seen malt exposed on the kiln to a heat of 175° without
                    losing its colour, or without being deprived of the power of vegetating when put
                    into the ground; and he has reason to believe that these properties would have
                    remained unaltered had the temperature been raised still higher. It is not the
                    degree of heat applied, but the rapidity with which it is raised, that darkens
                    the colour of malt. If the heat at first does not exceed 100°, and if, after the
                    malt is dried as much as it can be at that temperature, the heat be raised to
                    120°, kept some time at that temperature, and then raised gradually higher, and
                    if we continue to proceed in this manner, the temperature of the kiln may be
                    elevated at least to 175° without in the least discolouring the malt.</p>
                <p>In the year 1784 Mr Richardson of Hull published his <hi rend="italic">Theoretic
                    Hints on Brewing Malt Liquors,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Statical Estimates
                    of the Materials of Brewing, showing the Use of the Saccharometer.</hi> These
                    books are reprehensible, On account of the air of mystery in which the subject
                    is invested, and the avowal of the author, that he conceals certain parts of the
                    processes. If a brewer conceives he knows more of his art than his neighbours,
                    and chooses to keep his knowledge to himself, there is nothing to be said; but
                    if he publish a book upon the subject, and yet persists in his concealment, he
                    deserves no quarter. His book, in such a case, can be looked upon in no other
                    light than as a quack bill to advertise the goodness of his wares. Mr
                    Richardson, however, deserves considerable praise for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >saccharθineter,</hi> which he appears to have been the first to bring under the
                    notice of the brewer. This instrument is of material service, by making brewers
                    acquainted with the strength of their worts, and consequently with the
                    proportion of soluble matter which is furnished by the materials that they
                    employ. Mr Richardson’s <hi rend="italic">saccharometer,</hi> indeed, was not
                    accurate, because it was founded on an erroneous principle. The method which he
                    followed was to determine the weight of a barrel of pure water. The liquid being
                    then converted into wort, a barrel of it was weighed again, and the increase of
                    weight was considered as the matter which the water held in solution. Mr
                    Richardson did not seem to be aware that, when water dissolves the sweet portion
                    of malt, its bulk is altered; and that, for this reason, the specific gravity of
                    it does not indicate the quantity of solid matter which it holds in solution. A
                    set of experiments made on purpose, by dissolving determinate weights of the
                    solid extract of malt in given quantities of water, is necessary to determine
                    the point. The same objection applies to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >saccharometer</hi> of Dring and Fage, and to various others in common use. That
                    of Dicas is nearly correct, having been constructed upon proper principles. But
                    perhaps the best is one constructed about twenty-five years ago by Dr Thomson,
                    and used by the excise officers in Scotland. It indicates the specific gravity
                    of the wort; from which, by means of a sliding rule, which accompanies the
                    instrument, the weight of saccharine matter contained in it is at once
                    determined.</p>
                <p>One of the latest books on the subject which we have seen is entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Practical Treatise on Brewing and Distilling.</hi> This book was
                    published in quarto in the year 1805. The author, whose name is Shannon, appears
                    to have had some practical knowledge of brewing; but he must have been extremely
                    illiterate, as he was totally unable to write either grammar or common sense.
                    The book is a tissue of absurdities from beginning to end; and the
                    impracticability of his proposed improvements is surpassed only by the absurdity
                    of his theory, which consists of scraps and sentences, taken out of chemical
                    books, and tacked together, so as to have no meaning whatever.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II.</p>
                <p>OF THE KIND OF GRAIN USED BY BREWERS.</p>
                <p>Every kind of grain, with perhaps hardly an exception, may be employed for the
                    purposes of the brewer. In America it is not uncommon to make beer with the
                    seeds of Indian corn or zea mais. In order to convert it into malt, it is found
                    necessary to bury it for some time under the ground; and when germination has
                    made sufficient progress, it is dug up and kiln-dried. (See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> vol. xii. p. 1065.) Mr Mungo Park informs us,
                    that, in Africa, the negroes make beer from the seeds of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Holcus spicatus,</hi> and the process employed, as he describes it, seems to
                    differ but little from the one followed in this country. (See Park’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels,</hi> p. 63, 8vo edition. Dioscorides assures us, that in
                    Spain and Britain wheat was employed for the manufacture of beer; and the writer
                    of this article has been informed by a gentleman in the service of the East
                    India Company, that he has made beer from wheat at Madras. We have ourselves
                    seen oats employed for this purpose in Great Britain; and in Germany and the
                    north of Europe we believe that it is not uncommon to employ rye for the same
                    purpose.- But the material which answers best, and which is almost solely used
                    in Great Britain, and we believe in every part of Europe where beer is
                    manufactured, is barley.</p>
                <p>Barley is the seed of the <hi rend="italic">Hordeum vulgare,</hi> a plant which
                    has been cultivated from time immemorial, chiefly for the manufacture of beer.
                    There arc two species of <hi rend="italic">hordeum</hi> under cultivation in
                    Britain. The first is, the <hi rend="italic">Hordeum vulgare,</hi> or barley in
                    which the seeds are disposed in two rows on the spike. This is the species
                    usually cultivated in England and in the southern parts of Scotland. The second
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Hordeum hexastichon,</hi> called in the south of
                    Scotland <hi rend="italic">bear,</hi> and in Aberdeenshire <hi rend="italic"
                    >big.</hi> In this species, the grains are disposed in two rows, as in the
                    other; but three seeds spring from the same point, so that the head of big
                    appears to have the seeds disposed in six rows. Big is a much more hardy plant
                    than barley, and ripens more rapidly. Hence it thrives better than barley in
                    cold and high situations. On this account it is sown in preference in the
                    Highlands and northern parts of Scotland, where the climate is colder than
                    farther to the south. We have been assured that there is a third species of <hi
                    rend="italic">hordeum</hi> cultivated in Scotland, in which the seeds in the
                    spike are arranged in four rows. To this the term <hi rend="italic">bear</hi> is
                    exclusively confined by some. We have not ourselves had an opportunity of seeing
                    this species, nor do we find it noticed by botanists. The trivial name <hi
                    rend="italic">tetrastichon</hi> might be applied to it.</p>
                <p>The grains of barley are much larger than those of big, and the cuticle which
                    covers them is thinner. Indeed the thickness of the skin of barley itself varies
                    according <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736079" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6079-0232"/>to
                    the heat of the climate in which it is cultivated, being always the thinner the
                    warmer the climate. Thus it will be found that the cuticle of Norfolk barley is
                    thinner than that of Berwickshire or East Lothian barley; and if Norfolk barley
                    be sown in Scotland for several successive years, its cuticle will be found to
                    become thicker.</p>
                <p>The specific gravity of barley is rather greater than that of big. The specific
                    gravity of barley, tried in more than 100 different specimens, was found by us
                    to vary from 1∙333 to 1 ’ 250, and that of big from 1'265 to 1'227. The average
                    weight of a Winchester bushel of barley was found to be 50∙7 lbs. avoirdupois,
                    and the average weight of a bushel of big 46∙383 lbs. The heaviest barley tried
                    weighed 52*265 lbs. per bushel, and the heaviest big weighed 48 ’ 586 lbs. The
                    big grew in Perthshire, and the season was peculiarly favourable. It was not
                    absolutely free from a mixture of barley, as was ascertained by sowing a
                    quantity of it, but the proportion of barley was very small. The average weight
                    of a grain of barley is 0∙6688 grain, or very nearly two-thirds of a grain,
                    while the average weight of a grain of big is 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    56l3 grain. The average length of a grain of barley, from many thousand
                    measurements, is 0∙345 inch, while that of a grain of big is 0∙3245 inch. So
                    that the average of both would give us very nearly the third of an inch, which
                    it ought to do, according to the origin of our measures, as commonly stated. The
                    average breadth of a grain of barley is 0Ί45 inch, while the average breadth of
                    a grain of big is 0436 inch. The average thickness of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    grain of barley is 04125 inch, while the average thickness of a grain of big is
                    04055 inch. Thus we perceive that the grain of big is smaller than the grain of
                    barley in all its dimensions.</p>
                <p>To determine the relative weight of the skins of barley and big, we made choice
                    of three parcels of grain, all excellent in their kinds, namely, Norfolk barley,
                    Haddington barley, and Lanark big. The weights of the whole grain, and of the
                    cuticles of each of these, were as follows:</p>
                <table>

                    </row>
                </table>
                <p>From this we see that there is little difference between the weight of the skin
                    of Norfolk and Haddington barley, but a very considerable difference between
                    Haddington barley and Lanark big. Hence it would seem that this difference is
                    not owing to the climate in which the barley vegetates, but rather to the nature
                    of the two species.</p>
                <p>The bulks of these two species of grain with relation to each other are as
                    follows:</p>
                <table>
                    <row cols="1" role="data" rows="1">
                        <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"> Barley </cell>
                        <cell cols="1" role="data" rows="1"> 0Ό0217 cubic inch. </cell>
                    </row>
                    <row cols="1" role="data" rows="1">

                    </row>
                </table>
                <p>These quantities represent the average bulk of a corn of each kind. Thus it
                    appears that a grain of barley is rather more than ⅛th part larger than a grain
                    of big.</p>
                <p>Finally, from a comparison of many thousand corns of each species with each
                    other, it appears that the inequality between the size of different grains of
                    big is greater than that between different grains of barley. Indeed, if we
                    examine an ear of big when nearly ripe, we shall perceive that the corns towards
                    the bottom of the ear are smaller than those towards the summit and about the
                    middle of the ear. Several of these bottom grains are usually abortive, or
                    consist only of skin; but this is not always the case. In an ear of barley, on
                    the contrary, we shall find almost all the grains nearly of a size, though in
                    some cases the grain constituting the upper termination of the spike is rather
                    smaller than the rest.</p>
                <p>These circumstances may strike the reader as too minute and trifling to be stated
                    in such detail; but we shall find afterwards that they will furnish us with an
                    explanation of some anomalous circumstances which occur when these two species
                    of <hi rend="italic">hordeum</hi> are converted into malt. The value of barley,
                    or its produce in alcohol, is rather improved, while big, on the contrary, is
                    deteriorated, by malting it, at least twenty per cent.</p>
                <p>The constituents of the kernel of barley and big, as far' as we are able to
                    ascertain at present, are the same. Bar- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ley has
                    been subjected to an elaborate chemical analysis by Einhoff, who obtained from
                    3840 parts of barley-corns the following constituents:</p>

                <p>The writer of this article has likewise extracted from barley, by means of
                    alcohol, a small quantity of an oily matter, which has an asparagus green
                    colour, and does not burn with the same readiness as an oil. It has very much
                    the appearance of olive oil coagulated, but its consistence is less, and its
                    colour is darker. It has little smell, and its taste resembles the flavour of
                    spirits from raw grain. We have likewise found in big a quantity of nitrate of
                    soda. Hence it is likely that this salt exists as a common constituent of
                    barley. We obtained it by steeping big in water for two days, concentrating the
                    liquid, and setting it aside in a dry place. Many rhomboidal crystals of nitrate
                    of soda gradually make their appearance as the liquid evaporates.</p>
                <p>We shall terminate this chapter by a table, exhibiting the most remarkable
                    properties of a considerable number of specimens of British barley and big, as
                    determined by the writer of this article. The different specimens are
                    distinguished by the name of the county in which they grew. By the <hi

                <p>CHAP. III.</p>
                <p>OF MALTING.</p>
                <p>It is always customary to convert barley into malt before employing it in the
                    manufacture of ale. Not that this conversion is absolutely necessary, but that
                    it adds considerable facility to the different processes of the brewer. The
                    writer of this article has several times tried the experiment of making ale from
                    unmalted barley, and found it perfectly practicable. Several precautions,
                    however, are necessary in order to succeed. The water let upon the ground barley
                    in the mash-tun must be considerably below the boiling temperature; for
                    barley-meal is much more apt to <hi rend="italic">set</hi> than malt, that is,
                    to form a stiff paste, from which no wort will separate. The addition of a
                    portion of the chaff of oats serves very much to prevent this <hi rend="italic"
                    >setting of the goods,</hi> and facilitates considerably the separation of the
                    wort. Care must likewise be taken to prevent the heat from escaping during the
                    mashing, and the mashing must be continued longer than usual; for it is during
                    the mashing that the starch of the barley is converted into a saccharine matter.
                    This change seems to be owing merely to the chemical combination of a portion of
                    water with the starch of the barley; just as happens when common starch is
                    converted into sugar, by boiling it with very dilute sulphuric acid, or any
                    other acid. This method of brewing from raw grain answers admirably for small
                    beer. Some years ago it was practised to a considerable extent by several
                    brewers of small beer in Edinburgh, and their beer was considered as greatly
                    preferable to small beer brewed in the usual manner. The practice was stopped by
                    a decision of the Court of Exchequer,—a decision which, in our opinion,
                    proceeded upon arbitrary grounds, and which was at all events detrimental to the
                    public; for surely it is highly impolitic to prevent ameliorations in the
                    manufactures in order to guard against any deficiency in the produce of the
                    taxes. A wise government would have permitted the improvement, and would have
                    levied the malt-tax in a different manner. In our trials the raw barley did not
                    answer so well for making strong ale as for small beer. The alc was perfectly
                    transparent, and we kept it for several years without its running into acidity;
                    but it had a peculiar flavour, by no means agreeable. Probably a little practice
                    might have enabled us to get rid of this flavour, in which case raw grain would
                    answer in every respect as well for brewing as malt does.</p>
                <p>A duty was first charged upon malt during the troubles of Charles I.’s reign. But
                    it continued very moderate till the war with France recommenced in 1803. It was
                    then raised to the following sums per bushel :—</p>

                <p>But two shillings of this tax were to continue only till the end of the war, and
                    for six months after its conclusion. In consequence of this very heavy tax,
                    several regulations were imposed upon the maltster, with a view to facilitate
                    the levying of the duty, and to prevent him from defrauding the revenue. The
                    most important of these are the two following:—1. The barley must remain in the
                    cistern in which it is steeped with water for a period not less than forty
                    hours. 2. When the malt is spread upon the floor the maltster is not at liberty
                    to sprinkle any water upon it, or to moisten the floor. We shall now describe
                    the process of malting, as it is practised by the best-informed malt-makers in
                    Great Britain.</p>
                <p>Malting consists of four processes, which follow each other in regular order;
                    namely, <hi rend="italic">steeping, conching,flooring,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">kiln-drying.</hi></p>
                <p>1. The steep is a square cistern sunk at one end of the malt barn, lined with
                    stone, and of a sufficient size to hold the whole barley that is to be malted at
                    a time. The barley is put into this cistern with the requisite quantity of pure
                    water to cover it. It is laid as evenly as possible upon the floor of the
                    cistern. Here it must remain at least forty hours; but in Scotland, especially
                    when the weather is cold, it is customary to allow it to remain much longer. We
                    have seen barley steeped in Edinburgh for 112 hours by one maltster, and by
                    another usually ninety-eight or ninety-two hours. It is the common practice to
                    introduce the water into the cistern before the barley, and it is usually once
                    drawn off and new water added during the steeping.</p>
                <p>Three changes take place on the barley while in the steep. 1. It imbibes moisture
                    and increases in bulk. 2. Some carbonic acid gas is evolved, most of which
                    remains dissolved in the steep-water. 3. A portion of the husk or skin of the
                    barley is dissolved, in consequence of which the steep-water acquires a yellow
                    colour, and contracts a peculiar smell, not unlike that of moist straw.</p>
                <p>The quantity of moisture imbibed by the barley varies: according to the goodness
                    of the barley and the length of time during which it is allowed to remain in the
                    steep. But the general average may be stated at 0∙47; or 100 lbs. of barley,
                    steeped the usual time, weigh, newly taken out of the steep and dried, 147 lbs.
                    English barley acquires more weight than Scotch barley, while Scotch barley
                    acquires greater weight than big. But big cannot safely be steeped for so long a
                    time as barley. The swell of the grain in the steep obviously depends upon the
                    quantity of water absorbed; but it is not so great as that absorption, scarcely
                    ever exceeding one fifth of the original bulk of the barley, while the increase
                    of weight amounts to nearly one half of that of the original weight of the
                    grain. The result of a good many trials by the writer of this article gives the
                    bulk of one hundred measures of different kinds] of barley, after steeping, as
                    follows :—</p>

                <p>The greatest swell observed was from 100 to 183, which took place in barley from
                    the county of Suffolk; the smallest was from 100 to 109, which took place in
                    Perth big.</p>
                <p>While the malt is in the steep cistern it is repeatedly gauged by the exciseman,
                    and the duty on the malt is levied by what is called the best gauge, or that
                    which gives the greatest bulk of grain. It is in his power likewise to determine
                    the quantity of malt in the subsequent processes, and, if any of them exceeds
                    the best gauge in the cistern, to levy the duty by it. But these subsequent
                    gauges are not susceptible of the same precision as the gauges in the cistern,
                    when the grain is surrounded on all sides by perpendicular walls.</p>
                <p>That carbonic acid is evolved during the steeping of grain, is obvious from the
                    most simple experiments. If the steep-water be mixed with lime-water, the whole
                    be- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> comes milky, and carbonate of lime is
                    deposited. If the steep-water be agitated, it froths on the surface like ale. If
                    it be heated, it gives out carbonic acid gas, which may be collected over
                    mercury. But we never were able to observe bubbles of gas extricate themselves
                    from the grain during the steep, except once or twice during warm weather, when
                    the steep-water was allowed to remain rather too long without being changed. In
                    these cases, something like a commencement of fermentation, or perhaps of
                    putrefaction, appeared to take place. But in general, there is reason to believe
                    that nearly all the carbonic acid evolved in the steep remains in solution in
                    the water, or <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736118" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6118-0235"
                    />at least is extricated from the water in an imperceptible manner. From the
                    observations of Saussure, it seĉms probable that the formation of carbonic acid
                    in the steep is owing to the oxygen gas held in solution by the steepwater.</p>
                <p>The steep-water gradually acquires a yellow colour, and the peculiar smell and
                    taste of water in which straw has been steeped. At the same time, the barley
                    becomes whiter, showing clearly that the water has absorbed a portion of
                    colouring matter which existed in the husk or skin of the grain. The average
                    quantity of matter dissolved by the water amounts to about <hi rend="subscript">
                    7</hi>- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θth of the weight of the barley. The
                    steep-water becomes much more deeply coloured when big is steeped in it than it
                    does with barley, because big is darker in the colour, and its husk is thicker
                    and contains more colouring matter. The matter of big taken up by the
                    steep-water amounts to about ⅛th of the weight of the whole grain. When this
                    steep-water is evaporated it leaves a matter of a yellow colour and disagreeably
                    bitter taste, which deliquesces in a moist atmosphere. The only salt which it
                    contains in any notable quantity is nitrate of soda.</p>
                <p>Thus the only notable alterations which the kernel of barley undergoes in the
                    steep are the absorption of water and the resulting increase of bulk. The matter
                    taken up by the water seems to proceed only from the skin, and the evolution of
                    carbonic acid may perhaps be owing to some commencement of alteration which this
                    dissolved matter experiences. It can scarcely be ascribed to any change going on
                    within the kernel itself.</p>
                <p>2. When the barley is judged by the maltster to have remained long enough in the
                    steep, which is the case when its two ends can be easily squeezed together
                    between the finger and the thumb, the water is let off and the grain allowed to
                    drain. It is then thrown out of the cistern upon the malt floor, where it is
                    formed into as regular a rectangular heap as possible, which is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">couch.</hi> While in this position it is gauged by the exciseman,
                    and if it measure more than it did in the steep, he is at liberty to charge the
                    duty upon the quantity to which the grain now amounts. But as the barley in the
                    couch cannot be rendered perfectly regular, it requires a good deal of skill and
                    considerable attention to gauge it with tolerable accuracy. On that account the
                    duty we believe is levied from the couch gauge. The grain is allowed to remain
                    in the couch without any alteration for about twenty-six hours.</p>
                <p>3. If we plunge a thermometer into the grain, and observe it from time to time,
                    we shall find that the barley continues for some hours without acquiring any
                    perceptible increase of heat. During this period the moisture on the surface of
                    the corns gradually exhales or is absorbed, so that they do not perceptibly
                    moisten the hand. But at last the thermometer begins to rise, and continues to
                    do so gradually till the temperature of the grain is about ten degrees higher
                    than that of the surrounding atmosphere. This happens usually in about
                    ninety-six hours after it has been thrown out of the steep. It now exhales an
                    agreeable odour, which has some resemblance to that of apples. If we thrust our
                    hand into the heap we shall find that it feels warm, while, at the same time, it
                    has become so moist as to wet the hand. The appearance of this moisture is
                    called <hi rend="italic">sweating</hi> by the maltsters, and it constitutes a
                    remarkable period in the process of malting. We have reason to believe that a
                    little alcohol is at this period exhaled by the grain.</p>
                <p>If we examine the grains in the inside of the heap at the time of sweating, we
                    shall perceive the roots beginning to make their appearance at the bottom of
                    each seed. At first they have the appearance of a white prominence, which soon
                    divides itself into -three rootlets. In big the number of rootlets seldom
                    exceeds three, but in barley it frequently amounts to five or six. These
                    rootlets increase in length with great rapidity, unless their growth be checked
                    by artificial means; and the principal art of the maltster is directed to keep
                    them short till the grain be sufficiently malted. The writer of this article has
                    seen them increase in length nearly to two inches in the course of a single
                    night; and when he purposely favoured the growth, in order to ascertain the
                    effect upon the malt, he has seen them get to the length of three inches or
                    more. In such cases, the heat of the grain rose very rapidly, and on one
                    occasion was little inferior to eighty degrees. Indeed it is probable that, if
                    not checked, the temperature would rise sufficiently high to char the grain, if
                    not to set it on fire.</p>
                <p>The too great growth of the roots, and the too high elevation of temperature, is
                    prevented by spreading the grain thinner upon the floor, and carefully turning
                    it over several times a day. At first the depth is about sixteen inches; but
                    this depth is diminished a little at every turning, till at last it is reduced
                    to three or four inches. The number of turnings is regulated by the temperature
                    of the malt, but they are seldom fewer than two each day. In Scotland the
                    temperature of the grain is kept as nearly as possible at fifty-five degrees;
                    but in England we have generally found the temperature of the grain on the malt
                    floor about sixty-two degrees. It has been generally supposed that the
                    Hertfordshire method of making malt is the best; but, after a very careful
                    comparison of the two methods, we were unable to perceive any superiority
                    whatever in the English mode.</p>
                <p>About a day after the sprouting of the roots, the rudiment of the future stem
                    begins to make its appearance. This substance is called by the maltsters the <hi
                    rend="italic">acrospire.</hi> It rises from the same extremity of the seed with
                    the root, and, advancing within the hűsk or skin, would at last (if the process
                    were continued long enough) issue from the other extremity in the form of a
                    green leaf; but the process of malting is stopped before the acrospire has made
                    such progress.</p>
                <p>While the grain is on the malt floor, it has been ascertained that it absorbs
                    oxygen gas and emits carbonic acid gas; but to what amount these absorptions and
                    emissions take place, has not been ascertained. They are certainly small; for
                    the average loss which the grain sustains when on the malt floor is only three
                    per cent., a considerable portion of which must be ascribed to roots broken off,
                    and grains of barley bruised during the turning. As the acrospire shoots along
                    the grain, the appearance of the kernel or mealy part of the corn undergoes a
                    considerable change. The glutinous and mucilaginous matter in a great measure
                    disappears, the colour becomes whiter, and the texture so loose that it crumbles
                    to powder between the fingers. The object of malting is to produce this change.
                    When it is accomplished, which takes place when the acrospire has come nearly to
                    the end of the seed, the process is stopped altogether.</p>
                <p>At this period, it was formerly the custom in Scotland to pile up the whole grain
                    into a pretty thick heap, and allow it to remain for some time. The consequence
                    is the evolution of a very considerable heat, while, at the same time, the malt
                    becomes exceedingly sweet. But this plan is now laid aside, because it occasions
                    a sensible diminution in the malt, without being of any essential service; for
                    the very same change takes place afterwards, while the malt is in the mash-tun,
                    without any loss whatever.</p>
                <p>The time during which the grain continues on the maltfloor varies according to
                    circumstances. The higher the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736131"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6131-0236"/>temperature at which the grain is kept, the more
                    speedily is it converted into malt. In general, fourteen days may be specified
                    as the period which intervenes in England from throwing the barley out of the
                    steep till it is ready for the kiln; while in Scotland it is seldom shorter than
                    eighteen days, and sometimes three weeks. This, no doubt, is an advantage in
                    favour of English malting, as every thing which shortens the progress, without
                    injuring the malt, must turn out to the advantage of the manufacturer.</p>
                <p>4. The last part of the process is to dry the malt upon the kiln, which stops the
                    germination, and enables the brewer to keep the malt for some time without
                    injury. The kiln is a chamber, the floor of which usually consists of iron
                    plates full of holes, and in the roof there is a vent to allow the escape of the
                    heated air and vapour. Under this room is a space in which fire of charcoal or
                    coke is lighted. The heated air which supplies this fire passes up through the
                    holes in the iron plates, and makes its way through the malt, carrying off the
                    moisture along with it. At first the temperature of the malt is not higher than
                    90°; but it is elevated very slowly to 140°, or even higher. We believe that in
                    many cases it rises at last almost as high as 212°, though we have never
                    witnessed any such high temperature ourselves. But we have seen pale malt dried
                    at a temperature of 175°, without any injury whatever. The great secret in
                    drying malt properly consists in keeping the heat very low at first, and only
                    raising it very gradually as the moisture is dissipated,. For a high temperature
                    applied at first would infallibly blacken, or even char the malt, and would
                    certainly diminish considerably the quantity of soluble matter which it
                    contains. We shall here insert the table drawn up by Mr Combrune, from his own
                    experiments, of the colour of malt dried in different temperatures. ∙</p>

                </table>
                <p>We have given this table, not on account of any information which it contains,
                    but to put our readers on their guard against the false conclusions of this
                    writer. We have taken malt dried at the temperature of 175°, put it into a
                    garden pot filled with soil, and have seen it vegetate apparently as well as raw
                    grain placed in the same situation. Now, this is only one degree lower than that
                    in which Mr Combrune says malt is converted into charcoal, and it is four
                    degrees higher than that in which his malt assumed the colour of burnt coffee.
                    Certainly malt reduced to the colour of burnt coffee by heat would be deprived
                    of the power of vegetating. Mr Combrune’s experiments were made by putting malt
                    into an earthen pan, which he placed over a charcoal fire in a stove, while he
                    kept stirring the malt the whole time of the experiment. The bulb of the
                    thermometer was placed half-way between the upper surface of the malt and the
                    bottom of the vessel. Now the reader will perceive at once that the earthen pan
                    would be much hotter than that part of the malt where the thermometer was
                    placed. By the constant stirring of the malt, the whole of it was gradually
                    exposed to the burning action of the surface of the pan. Had the experiment been
                    made without stirring the malt at all, and had the thermometer been placed near
                    the surface, in that case the changes in the colour of the malt at the surface
                    would have indicated the temperature to which it was exposed. But in the way
                    that Mr Combrune conducted his experiments, the temperatures which he obtained
                    were entirely fallacious. We have not the least doubt that the temperature of
                    the earthen pan, towards the end of his experiment, was above 400°.</p>
                <p>Mr Combrune’s law, however, that the heat of the water in mashing ought to be
                    regulated by the colour of the malt; namely, that the paler the malt is, the
                    lower ought the temperature of the mashing water to be, is founded on accurate
                    observations. The fact is, that boiling water would answer better Ilian any
                    other for mashing, because it would dissolve most speedily the soluble part of
                    the malt. The only reason for not using it is, that the tendency of the malt to
                    <hi rend="italic">set</hi> increases with the temperature of the water. Now the
                    higher the colour of the malt, the less is its tendency to set; but we may
                    nevertheless use water of a higher temperature to mash with it. For the same
                    reason, when raw grain is used, the temperature of the mashing water must be
                    still lower than when malt is employed; because raw grain has a very great
                    tendency to set.</p>
                <p>The old malt-kilns had a bottom of hair-cloth instead of the iron plates full of
                    holes, which constitute a more recent improvement. We have seen the thermometer
                    in such a kiln, when the bulb touched the hair-cloth, rise as high as 186°. In
                    general, the temperature of the maltkiln is very carelessly regulated. We have
                    seen malt for the very same purpose dried at a temperature which never rose
                    higher than 136°; while a portion of the very same malt, put into another kiln,
                    was heated as high as 186°. But such a careless mode of drying malt is
                    reprehensible, and must be more or less injurious to the brewer. In general, the
                    more rapidly malt is dried the more does its bulk increase. This method,
                    accordingly, is practised by those who malt for sale, as is the case with most
                    of the English maltsters; because malt is always sold by measure, and not by
                    weight. The brewers would find it more for their interest to buy malt by weight
                    than by measure. In that case the malsters would dry their malt at as low a
                    temperature as possible. But this would signify very little, or rather would be
                    advantageous to the brewer; because dried malt soon recovers the moisture lost
                    on the kiln when kept for some time in sacks. And when malt is dried at a low
                    temperature, we are sure that none of it is injured by the fire. It will,
                    therefore, go farther in the production of beer. The time of kiln-drying varies
                    considerably, according to the quantity of malt exposed to the action of the
                    heat; but when that quantity is not too great, we may estimate the time of
                    kiln-drying, in general, at two days. After the fire is withdrawn, the malt is
                    allowed to remain on the kiln till it has become nearly cold.</p>
                <p>By the kiln-drying, the roots of the barley, or, as the maltsters call them, the
                    <hi rend="italic">comings</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> arc dried up
                    and fall off. They are separated from the malt by passing it over the surface of
                    a kind of wire screen, which allows the <hi rend="italic">comings</hi> to drop
                    through, while the wires are too near each other to permit the grains of malt to
                    pass.</p>
                <p>If 100 lbs. of barley malted in this manner, with all the ( requisite care, be
                    weighed just after being kiln-dried and; cleaned, they will be found, on an
                    average, to weigh 80ţ lbs. But if the raw grain be kiln-dried at the same tem-
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> perature as the malt, it will lose 12 per cent,
                    of its weight. Hence 12 per cent, of the loss which barley sustains in malting
                    must be ascribed to moisture dissipated by the kiln-drying; so that the real
                    loss of weight which barley <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736144"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6144-0237"/>sustains when malted amounts to eight per cent.
                    This loss, from a great many trials made in the large way, with all the
                    requisite care, we conceive may be accounted for in the following manner:</p>

                </table>
                <p>These numbers were obtained from above thirty different maltings, conducted in
                    four different malting houses, with as much attention to every circumstance as
                    was compatible with practical malting. The matter carried off by the
                    steep-water, which amounts to about γ⅛∙th of the weight of the whole grain, we
                    conceive to be dissolved from the skin or husks. It may, therefore, be left out
                    of view. The waste is owing to grains of malt crushed by the workmen while
                    turning the malt on the floor, and afterwards dissipated or destroyed during the
                    subsequent processes. We were not able to collect these bruised grains and weigh
                    them; the number therefore given for them in the preceding table is
                    hypothetical; but, from a great many circumstances, which it would be too
                    tedious to mention here, we believe that, in our trials, th part of the whole
                    very nearly represents the amount of the crushed grains. Thus the real loss of
                    weight by malting (supposing nothing lost by steeping, and no grains crushed) is
                    only six per cent., and of this loss four per cent, may be safely ascribed to
                    the roots; so that not above two per cent, at most can be assigned to the carbon
                    dissipated by the evolution of carbonic acid on the floor and on the kiln.
                    Indeed we have reason to conclude, from a good many trials, that the greatest
                    part of this loss of two per cent, is sustained on the kiln. For, if malt dried
                    carefully at a low temperature be afterwards kiln-dried, or exposed, as was our
                    method, to the heat of a steam bath, it never afterwards recovers its former
                    weight by exposure to the air. And every time this experiment is repeated, by
                    artificially moistening and drying the same malt, a new loss of weight is
                    sustained. The same observation was made by Saussure, who conceived that the
                    loss was to be ascribed to the formation and dissipation of water in the
                    barleycorn. But we have no proof whatever that any such formation takes place.
                    It is more probable that the loss is owing to the formation and escape of
                    carbonic acid gas..</p>
                <p>Big sustains a considerably greater loss of weight when malted than barley. The
                    average loss of weight in our trials with barley was only eight per cent., while
                    that of big was fifteen per cent., or nearly double. This, we conceive, is owing
                    to the destruction of a much greater number of the corns during the process of
                    malting big than barley. But in all our experiments on big, that grain was
                    manifestly oversteeped. To this, perhaps, a good deal of the difference may be
                    ascribed. Our maltsters had not been in the habit of malting big, and therefore
                    were not likely to do it so much justice as they did to the barley. Hence it
                    would be improper to venture upon any general conclusions from the experiments
                    which we made upon the malting of big.</p>
                <p>The bulk of the malt is usually greater than that of the barley from which it was
                    obtained; but this varies a good deal according to the goodness of the grain and
                    the mode of drying the malt. In our trials, made all in the same way, 100
                    bushpls of the different kinds of grain gave, on an average, the following
                    results:</p>

                </table>
                <p>The greatest quantity in bushels obtained from 100 bushels of English barley was
                    11 lį, the least 106 bushels. The greatest quantity obtained from 100 bushels of
                    Scotch barley was 109, and the least 98 bushels. The greatest quantity obtained
                    from 100 bushels of big was 103 bushels, the least 97 bushels. Hence it appears
                    that, on malting English barley, there is a profit of nine per cent., while big
                    yields scarcely any thing more than its.bulk before malting. The English
                    maltster makes more bushels of malt than he pays duty for; but the maltster of
                    big, on the contrary, obtains fewer.</p>
                <p>We shall subjoin here two tables, which exhibit in one view the result of a
                    considerable number of trials made by the author of this article, on malting
                    different varieties of grain. The barley is distinguished by the name of the
                    county where it grew. To understand the first table, the reader must know that
                    excisemen estimate the quantity of malt by subtracting one fifth from the best
                    or highest gauge in the steep or couch, and charge the duty accordingly.</p>

                <p>Thus it appears that the process of malting is nothing else than causing the
                    barleycorns to germinate, and stoping that process before the green leaf makes
                    its appearance. A quantity of roots are formed, which are afterwards rubbed off
                    and separated, and the weight of which amounts to about four per cent, of the
                    grain malted. The kernel of the grain undergoes a remarkable change by this
                    process. It consists almost entirely of starch; but it was agglutinated in the
                    grain, so as to form a solid and very firm mass; whereas, in the malt, it is
                    quite loose and mealy. Hence it would appear that the glutinous and mucilaginous
                    matter of the barleycorn is chiefly employed in forming the roots; and that this
                    is the purpose for which it was laid up in the grain. How far the starch is
                    altered does not appear. It is probable that it has undergone some change. Malt
                    has a slightly sweet taste, much more agreeable than the taste of the raw grain,
                    without any of that strong and cloying sweetness which distinguishes wort. But
                    the most distinguishing character of the starch of malt is the ease with which
                    it dissolves in hot water; though cold water does not act upon it sensibly.
                    Whether this property be peculiar to the starch of barley, or be induced by the
                    malting, we cannot say. We conceive it probable that barley starch is more
                    easily soluble in water than wheat starch, from the ease with which raw grain is
                    constantly employed by distillers to form their worts. In its other chemical
                    characters, the starch of barley malt agrees with that of wheat starch.</p>
                <p>We should err very much, however, were we to suppose that the whole kernel or
                    starchy part of the malt is dissolved by the hot water used in brewing. At least
                    one half of the malt still remains after the brewing is over, constituting the
                    grains, which are known to constitute a most nourishing article of food for
                    cattle, and therefore to contain much more than the husks or skin of the malt
                    corn. One hundred lbs. of malt from different kinds of grain, after being
                    exhausted as much as usual of the soluble part of the kernel by hot water, were
                    found to weigh as follows :—</p>

                <p>Here also the bulk of the malt differed but little from that of the raw grain.
                    The first of these sets of experiments was made with grain of the best quality,
                    the second with grain of the middling quality, and the third with grain of the

                <p>It is probable that an additional portion of the kernel would be dissolved if the
                    malt were ground finer than it is customary to do. The reason for grinding it
                    only coarsely is to render it less apt to set. But this object might be
                    accomplished equally well by bruising the malt between rollers, which would
                    reduce the starchy part to powder, without destroying the husk. This method,
                    indeed, is practised by many brewers, but it ought to be followed by all.</p>
                <p>CHAP. IV.</p>
                <p>OF BREWING.</p>
                <p>Brewing consists of five successive processes, which are distinguished by the
                    following names: <hi rend="italic">∖. Mashing;</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eoiling;</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">Cooling; ⅛. Fermenting;</hi> 5. <hi
                    rend="italic">Cleansing.</hi> We shall afterwards give a description and view of
                    the utensils employed in a large London porter brewery, where they have been
                    carried to the greatest perfection. But we conceive it better to give a
                    description of the processes themselves, in the first place, without referring
                    them to any specific form of vessels; observing only, that the size of all the
                    utensils must be proportional to the quantity of beer which it is proposed to
                    make at once.</p>
                <p>1. The specific gravity of malt varies a good deal, according to the way in which
                    it is dried upon the kiln but its mean specific gravity may be stated at 1∙201.
                    In general the specific gravity of big malt is rather inferior to that of malt
                    from barley. Let us suppose, for the sake of stating the comparative quantities,
                    that it is our object to employ in a single brewing fifty bushels of malt. The
                    first thing to be done is to grind the malt in a mill, and the best kind of mill
                    for the purpose is that in which the malt is made to pass between two iron
                    rollers.</p>
                <p>We must be provided with a copper boiler capable of containing at least the fifty
                    bushels of malt; or its solid contents must, at the smallest, amount to 382 ale
                    gallons, which are rather more than 107,521 cubic inches or 62; cubic feet. This
                    copper boiler must be placed over brick work upon a furnace, and there must be
                    conveniences for filling it with water, and for letting the water off when
                    sufficiently heated, into the mash-tun.</p>
                <p>The mash-tun is a wooden vessel composed of staves properly fixed by means of
                    iron hoops, and usually placed in the middle of the brew-house. It has a false
                    bottom full of holes at some little height above the true bottom. Its capacity
                    varies according to the extent of the brewery establishment; but a mash-tun
                    capable of mashing fifty bushels of malt must be at least one third larger than
                    the bulk of the malt, or it must be capable at least of containing 75
                    bushels.</p>
                <p>A quantity of water, equal at least in bulk to that of the malt, is to be put
                    into the boiler, and heated up to 190° or 180°, according to the fancy of the
                    brewer and the quality of the malt; but the best brewers, in general, employ the
                    lowest temperature. This water is then to be let into the mash-tun, and the
                    malt, previously ground, is to be let down into if immediately after. It is then
                    mixed with the water and all the clots carefully broken, either by workmen, who
                    use for the purpose very narrow wooden shovels, or, when the capacity of the
                    mash-tun is very great, as in the London breweries, by a machine which is <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193736196" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6196-0241"/> driven by a
                    steam-engine. Great care must be taken to break all the clots, because the whole
                    of the malt within them would otherwise escape the action of the water, and be
                    lost to the brewer. When the water and malt are sufficiently mixed, the mash-tun
                    is covered and left in this state about three hours. But the time varies
                    according to circumstances.</p>
                <p>Though the specific gravity of a malt corn be greater than that of water, yet if
                    it be thrown into that liquid it always swims. The reason is, that between the
                    skin and the kernel there is lodged a quantity of air, which it is not easy to
                    drive away. Accordingly, brewers are in the habit of judging of the goodness of
                    malt by throwing a certain quantity of it into water, and, reckoning the grains
                    which fall to the bottom, these indicate the proportion of unmalted grain which
                    the malt contains. Of course the more of them that exist in any given quantity
                    of malt, the worse must the malt be considered. But though malt, when we
                    consider only single corns, is about a sixth heavier than water, yet a bushel of
                    malt does not weigh so much as one third of a bushel of water. For, on one
                    occasion, the hot water in the mash-tun, before the addition of the malt, stood
                    at the height of twenty-two inches. On adding the malt, it rose to the height of
                    twenty-nine inches. The bulk of the water was fifty-one bushels; that of the
                    malt before grinding, forty-seven and a half bushels. We see from this that the
                    real space occupied in the mash-tun by the forty seven and a half bushels of
                    malt was only seven inches, while the fifty-one bushels of water occupied the
                    space of twenty-two inches; therefore about two thirds of the bulk of the
                    unground malt consisted of interstices filled with air.</p>
                <p>The temperature of the water is considerably lowered when it is mixed with the
                    malt, but we have been unable to determine how much, from the impossibility of
                    thrusting a thermometer down to the centre of the mash-tun, the only place that
                    would give a correct result. But we may state a few out of the many observations
                    which we have made on the subject; fifty-one bushels of water of the temperature
                    192° were mixed with forty-seven and a fourth bushels of malt; after mixture,
                    the temperature at the surface of the mash was 140°. Two hours and a half after,
                    when the wort began to run off, its temperature was 156°, and at that time the
                    surface of the mash was at the temperature of 136°. If we suppose in this case
                    that the whole mash lost four degrees as well as the surface, and take the mean
                    between the bottom and top, we shall have the mean heat of the whole, after the
                    mashing, 150°; so that the water has lost 32° of heat, while the malt (its
                    temperature before mixture was 48°) gained 102°.</p>
                <p>The weight of the water, reckoning it at 51</p>

                <p>This would make the specific heat of the malt 0∙69, which is probably
                    considerably above the truth; for, according to the experiments of Dr Crawford,
                    the specific heat of barley is only 0∙421; so that our supposition, that the
                    mean temperature after mashing was only 150°, is not quite accurate. Were we to
                    suppose the specific heat of malt to be 0∙42, which cannot be very far from the
                    truth, in that case the mean temperature, after mashing, would be 169°, if the
                    water was 192° and the malt 48°, and the weight of each as above stated.</p>
                <p>In another experiment, in which sixty bushels of malt were mashed, the heat of
                    the water was 180°, that of the malt 56°, the temperature, on adding the malt to
                    the wa-water and mixing it well, was at the surface 141°. Four hours after, when
                    the wort began to be drawn off, its temperature was 150°, and that of the
                    surface of the mixture of malt and water in the mash-tun was 138°.</p>
                <p>The bulk of water was 66^- bushels, its weight 5157∙ lbs. The weight of the malt
                    was 2283∙6 lbs.</p>
                <p>Any person may easily, from these data, calculate what the heat of the mixture
                    after mashing ought to be, supposing the specific heat of the malt to be 0∙42.
                    The common formula for the calculation is</p>
                <p>S = w-&gt; ι∏ which S denotes the specific heat</p>
                <p>B × <hi rend="italic">m — b</hi> of the malt, W the weight of water used, <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> its temperature, B the weight of malt used, and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> its temperature, and <hi rend="italic">m</hi> (which in the
                    present case is the quantity sought) the temperature after mixture. We do not
                    think it worth while to give any more examples of these changes of temperature,
                    though we are in possession of abundance of them; because we do not conceive
                    that they can lead to any useful results.</p>
                <p>After the mash has continued for about three hours (or longer or shorter
                    according to circumstances), a stop-cock, placed below the false bottom in the
                    mash-tun, is opened, and the wort allowed to run out into a vessel prepared to
                    receive it, and known by the name of <hi rend="italic">underbach.</hi> At the
                    same time the cover is taken off the mash-tun, and quantities of water of the
                    temperature of 180° are occasionally sprinkled over it from the boiler, which
                    had been again filled with water to be heated as soon as the water for mashing
                    was drawn off. No specific directions can be given respecting the quantity of
                    hot water added in this manner by sprinkling, because that must depend upon the
                    views of the brewer. If he wishes to have ale of very great strength, he will of
                    course add less water; if the ale is to be weak he will add more. The best way
                    is to determine the strength of the liquor as it flows into the underback, by
                    means of a saccharometer, or by taking its specific gravity. When the specific
                    gravity (at 60°) sinks to 1∙04 or 1Ό5, or when it contains only 36⅛ or 46-ļ-lbs.
                    per barrel of solid matter in solution, it would be useless or injurious to draw
                    any more off for making strong ale. But an additional portion may still be drawn
                    off and converted into small beer. We have seen the brewers in Edinburgh
                    continue to draw off small beer from the mash-tun till the liquid indicated only
                    23∣ lbs. per barrel, or even till it indicated 171-lbs. per barrel; that is,
                    till its specific gravity at 60° was reduced to 1Ό27 or 1Ό20. Indeed the
                    strength of small beer is often much weaker than this when it is obtained from
                    malt without drawing off any strong ale wort; but when it is the residue of
                    strong ale, it is necessary to make it stronger, otherwise its quality will be
                    bad. About twenty-five years ago, it was customary with some of the small-becr
                    brewers in Edinburgh to make the small becr of considerable strength; and after
                    the exciseman had determined its quantity, and the duty to be paid on it, they
                    diluted it largely with water, just when they were sending it out of the house.
                    This fraud was easily put in practice, because the small beer is usually
                    disposed of the moment it is mixed with the yeast, and before it has undergone
                    any fermentation whatever. It ferments sufficiently in the small casks in which
                    it is sent to the consumers. In Edinburgh it is customary to bottle this small
                    beer, which makes it clear and very brisk, and consequently very agreeable to
                    the palate.</p>
                <p>Neither can any general rule be laid down for the specific gravity or strength of
                    the wort when it begins to flow from the mash. It will obviously depend upon the
                    goodness of the malt, and upon the quantity of mashing water employed, when
                    compared with the quantity of malt. We have seen it begin to flow from the
                    mash-tun of the specific gravity 1Ό84,1.0805, 1Ό815, 1∙0835, 1∙091, 1∙094, or
                    containing respectively 78∣, 74∣, 7õį, 78, 85, and 87^ lbs. per barrel.</p>
                <p>The wort, as it first flows from the mash-tun, is a transparent<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193736209" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6209-0242"/> liquid of a fine amber
                    colour, a peculiar smell, and a rich, luscious, sweet taste. If it is cloudy, as
                    sometimes happens, it is a proof that the water used for mashing was of too high
                    a temperature. We have seen the wort run cloudy from the mash-tun when the
                    temperature of the water had been as high as 200° or 191°, but never when it was
                    no higher than 180°. This affords an additional reason with the brewers for
                    keeping the temperature of the mashing-water low. But we have some doubts about
                    the accuracy of the reason. For, when the wort is afterwards boiled, it always
                    deposits a copious flocky sediment. The boiling would doubtless render even
                    turbid wort transparent, and would not probably increase the sediment much. At
                    the same time it must be acknowledged, that some obscurity hangs upon this part
                    of the process of brewing. For we have seen wort continue opake during the whole
                    process of boiling, cooling, and fermenting, and requiring ultimately to be
                    clarified, or <hi rend="italic">fined,</hi> as the brewers termed it, by means
                    of isinglass. The substance which rendered the ale in this case turbid seemed to
                    be a variety of starch, or some particular form of that substance, for it was
                    completely precipitated by infusion of nutgalls, and the precipitate was
                    redissolved by the application of a moderate heat.</p>
                <p>The flowing of the wort from the mash-tun takes up six or eight hours. As it
                    advances the colour diminishes, the smell becomes less agreeable, and the taste
                    less sweet. At last the colour becomes nearly opal, and the smell*becomes sour,
                    and somewhat similar to the odour emitted by an infusion of meal and water left
                    till it has become sour. Yet it produces no change on vegetable blue
                    colours.</p>
                <p>If the wort which first comes over be evaporated to dryness, it leaves behind it
                    a yellow-coloured residuum, which has a sweet taste, dissolves readily in water,
                    absorbs water from the atmosphere, and becomes clammy, and similar in appearance
                    to treacle. Its specific gravity is 1∙552. This does not differ much from the
                    specific gravity of common refined sugar, if we take a mean of the experiments
                    of Fahrenheit and Hassenfratz. Fahrenheit found the specific gravity of sugar
                    1∙6065, while Hassenfratz found it 1∙4045, the mean of which is 1∙5055. There
                    can be no doubt that this residue contains a good deal of sugar, precisely the
                    same in its properties with the sugar into which starch is converted by boiling
                    it in a very dilute acid. But it is mixed likewise with a considerable portion
                    of starch, which has become soluble in water, without being converted into
                    sugar. For wort gives a copious precipitate with the infusion of nutgalls, and
                    this precipitate is redissolved by a moderate increase of temperature,
                    properties which characterize starch.</p>
                <p>From the experiments of Saussure, it would appear that starch sugar is nothing
                    else than a combination of starch and sugar. Hence it is probable that, during
                    the mashing, a combination takes place between the starch of the malt and the
                    water, the result of which is the formation of starch sugar. This sugar agrees
                    in its properties with the sugar of grapes. It crystallizes in needles grouped
                    together in the form of small sapericles like granulated honey. In does not go
                    so far in sweetening as common sugar, and, like sugar of grapes, it ferments
                    without the addition of yeast. We have attempted in vain to separate the
                    saccharine part of the residue of wort from the starch. When alcohol is poured
                    over it, no solution takes place; but such is the affinity of the residue of
                    wort for water, that it deprives the alcohol of a portion of its water, just as
                    carbonate of potash or muriate of lime does, and a very viscid liquid,
                    consisting of the residue of malt dissolved in a very small quantity of water,
                    is formed at the bottom of the vessel.</p>
                <p>It is exceedingly difficult to evaporate wort without partly decomposing the
                    extractive residue. The best way is to put it upon a very flat dish, and to
                    apply a heat not greater than 120°. We have charred it completely in a glass
                    vessel, filled with alcohol, without applying heat sufficient to make the
                    alcohol boil. Indeed we never succeeded in obtaining the residue of wort without
                    its colour being a good deal darker than that of the wort from which it was
                    obtained.</p>
                <p>The wort which runs off last contains very little saccharine matter; but some
                    starch and mucilaginous matter may still be detected in it. The flavour and
                    beauty of the ale is increased if we take only the wort that runs first off, and
                    throw away the last drawn worts, or employ them only in the manufacture of small
                    beer.</p>
                <p>2. The next process in brewing is the <hi rend="italic">boiling</hi> of thei
                    wort. The wort is pumped up from the <hi rend="italic">underbach</hi> into <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the copper boiler, where it is boiled for several
                    hours, till it has acquired the degree of strength which is wanted by the
                    brewer.</p>
                <p>It may be proper to give some examples of quantities, to enable the reader to
                    form a better idea of the effect of the boiling.</p>
                <p>From sixty bushels of malt there were obtained 23 ’ 465 barrels of wort, of the
                    strength of 64 ’ 37 lbs. per barrel, or of the specific gravity 1∙0683. It was
                    boiled down to 19∙736 barrels of the strength of 82∙7 lbs. per barrel, or of the
                    specific gravity 1∙089.</p>
                <p>From sixty bushels of big malt there were obtained 23∙8193 barrels of the
                    specific gravity 1∙0648, or of 58∙75 lbs. per barrel of saccharine matter. It
                    was boiled down to 19∙736 barrels of the specific gravity 1Ό78, or of 72⅛ lbs.
                    per barrel of saccharine matter.</p>
                <p>From seventy-two bushels of malt 15∙1388 barrels of the specific gravity 1∙071,
                    or of 60 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 lbs. per barrel, it was boiled down to
                    13⅛ barrels of the specific gravity 1∙1055, or of 98ĵ lbs. per barrel of
                    saccharine matter.</p>
                <p>From fifty bushels of malt 13∙444 barrels of wort were obtained, of the specific
                    gravity 1∙068, or of 63∙125 lbs. of saccharine matter per barrel. It was boiled
                    down to 11∙083 barrels of the specific gravity 1∙1015, or of 9-1Į lbs. per
                    barrel.</p>
                <p>Various contrivances have been fallen upon to economize the boiling process; but
                    these will come under our consideration with more propriety when we proceed to
                    give an account of the utensils in a London brewery.</p>
                <p>The flocky precipitate which forms daring the boiling of the wort, as far as we
                    have been able to determine its properties, approaches nearly to the nature of
                    gluten or vegetable albumen, for these two substances differ very little from
                    each other.</p>
                <p>While the wort is in the boiler, the requisite quantity] of hops are added to
                    flavour the ale, and render it capable of being kept for a considerable length
                    of time without souring. Hops, as is well known, are the seed-pods of the <hi
                    rend="italic">PLumulus lupulus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hop-plant,</hi> which
                    is cultivated in considerable quantities in the south of England, especially in
                    Kent and Hampshire. The seed-pods of this creeping plant are collected when
                    ripe, and dried upon a kiln. They are then packed up in bags, and sold to the
                    brewers. Hops are well known to have a peculiar bitter taste, and a weak
                    aromatic odour, and to possess sedative qualities to a considerable extent. A
                    pillow filled with hops has often been found to induce sleep when every thing
                    else has failed. If they be digested for some days in alcohol, that liquid
                    acquires a slight greenish colour, a peculiar taste, and an odour in which that
                    of the hop can be distinctly perceived. If the alcohol, previously freed from
                    the undissolved matter, be distilled in a retort, there remains behind a solid
                    green-coloured oil. It is to this oil that hops owe their peculiar smell. Its
                    taste is peculiar, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736222"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6222-0243"/>sharp, and scarcely bitter, but putting one in
                    mind of the peculiar flavour of good ale. This oil is the part of the hops which
                    gives ale its distinguishing flavour. It is apt to be dissipated by long
                    boiling. Hence, when hops are too long boiled in wort, the aromatic odour and
                    peculiar flavour are nearly dissipated, and a bitter taste substituted. It is
                    the opinion of brewers, that the intoxicating qualities of ale are to be partly
                    ascribed to the oil of the hop. Indeed it has been pretty common to ascribe
                    intoxicating qualities to bitter-tasted substances in general. Thus, a woman of
                    the name of Johnston, who kept a public-house a little to the south side of the
                    Meadows, near Edinburgh, about the beginning of the last century, was famous for
                    brewing a pleasant and very intoxicating ale; and the last quality was
                    universally ascribed to the broom tops which she employed as a bitter instead of
                    hops. This woman’s name is remembered, because her ale and her house are
                    celebrated in the poems of Allan Ramsay. But the opinion above stated, though
                    very general, does not appear to be founded upon any precise experiments or
                    observations. We are not acquainted with any volatile oil which produces
                    intoxication; though some of them, as oil of turpentine, act with great energy
                    upon the stomach. No infusion of any bitter whatever, not even of hops, is known
                    to produce intoxication; nor is any effect in the least similar to intoxication
                    produced when considerable quantities (2 oz. per day for example) of Peruvian
                    bark are swallowed in substance.</p>
                <p>Besides the volatile oil, hops contain likewise a quantity of bitter principle,
                    which may be easily extracted from them by water. As far as we were able to
                    determine the point, this bitter matter possesses the characters of the bitter
                    principle in perfection. No re-agent that we tried is capable of throwing it
                    down except acetate of lead, a somewhat ambiguous precipitant, because it throws
                    down the greater number of vegetable substances, and because the lead in this
                    salt is partially thrown down by carbonic acid, if it happens to be present in
                    the solution. Nitrate of silver is likewise a precipitant, throwing down the
                    bitter principle of hops in light yellow flocks. But this precipitant is also
                    somewhat ambiguous, for the same reason that renders acetate of lead so. The
                    bitter principle of hops is likewise very soluble, both in water and in
                    alcohol.</p>
                <p>Hops communicate both their flavour and their bitter taste to wort. The quantity
                    employed varies very much, according to the taste of the persons who are to
                    drink the ale. The stronger the ale, the greater is the quantity of hops which
                    it can bear without injury. In general, English brewers employ a much greater
                    quantity of hops than the Scotch brewers. To elucidate the subject, we shall
                    give a few examples of the quantity of hops used in making Edinburgh ale; which
                    is known to be mild, and, in general, is much relished by most of those who are
                    in the habit of drinking ale.</p>
                <p>Sixty bush els of malt yielded 11*75 barrels of strong ale wort, measured at the
                    end of the boiling, and 40 pounds of hops had been mixed with it in the
                    boiler.</p>
                <p>Forty-seven and a quarter bushels of malt furnished 10 ’ 83 barrels of wort,
                    measured after being boiled and cooled, and 36 lbs. of hops had been mixed with
                    it in the boiler.</p>
                <p>Sixty bushels of malt furnished fifteen barrels of wort, measured after boiling
                    and cooling, and 45 lbs. of hops had been mixed with it in the boiler.</p>
                <p>Sixty bushels of malt, from big, furnished 14∙7 barrels of wort, after being
                    boiled and cooled. It was mixed with 40 lbs. of hops in the boiler.</p>
                <p>In another brewing in which 72 bushels of malt, from big, furnished 10^- barrels
                    of wort, 66 lbs. of hops had been added in the boiler.</p>
                <p>In general, when the ale has considerable strength, the Edinburgh brewers are in
                    the habit of adding one pound of hops for every bushel of malt employed.
                    Sometimes, indeed, when they wish their ale to be very superior in flavour and
                    quality, they employ a greater quantity of hops than even this. Thus we have
                    seen 100 lbs. of hops boiled in the strong ale wort extracted from 72 bushels of
                    malt. When the ale is but weak, and consequently cheap, the usual allowance is
                    one pound of hops to a bushel and a half of the malt.</p>
                <p>3. After the wort has been boiled down to the requisite strength, which, in
                    Edinburgh, is commonly between the specific gravities 1∙09 and 1∙10, it is let
                    out into the <hi rend="italic">coolers.</hi> The coolers are floors of wood,
                    surrounded with a wooden ledge, and water-tight, placed in the most airy and
                    exposed situation in the brewery. They are of such a size as to hold the whole
                    of the wort at a depth not exceeding three or four inches; so that, in large
                    breweries, they are of an enormous extent. The object is to cool down the wort
                    as rapidly as possible to the temperature of the atmosphere; because, if it were
                    allowed to remain long hot it would run the risk of becoming sour, which would
                    spoil the whole process. A great deal of the superiority of some breweries over
                    others depends upon the construction of the coolers, or rather, upon their being
                    as well adapted as possible for reducing the temperature of the wort speedily to
                    that of the atmosphere. A free current of air ought to pass over them, and great
                    care should be taken to keep them perfectly clean.</p>
                <p>The wort is either pumped out of the boiler into the coolers, or it is let into
                    them by simply opening a stopcock, according to the construction of the
                    brew-house. It soon spreads itself over all the surface of the coolers, and a
                    very great evaporation is the consequence. This evaporation ought always to be
                    taken into consideration by the brewer; because it both materially adds to the
                    strength of the ale and diminishes its quantity. The amount of it depends upon

                <p>In the first two examples in the above table, the quantity of wort was estimated
                    just when it was letdown into the coolers; in all the others it was estimated in
                    the boiler before it was pumped out. It appears from the preceding table that
                    rather more than one fourth of the whole wort is dissipated by evaporation
                    during the cooling; and, if we had excepted from the general consideration the
                    first two examples, the proportion evaporated would have been still greater.</p>
                <p>When the wort is let out of the boiler into the cooler, the bops still remain,
                    and, as they are soaked with wort, a considerable loss would be sustained if
                    they were thrown away. Thus we found, in one instance, that 45 lbs. of hops
                    retained half a barrel of wort after they were drained so completely that no
                    more wort would drop out. In another case, 35 lbs. of hops retained in the same
                    way 0∙3666 of a barrel, which is rather more than one third of a barrel. To
                    recover this wort it is proper to subject the hops to pressure. We do not know
                    whether this is attended to by the great brewers, though it probably is. By
                    several of the Edinburgh brewers it is, we believe, too much neglected.</p>
                <p>In cold weather, where the brewery is small, and the apartment in which the
                    fermenting vessels are placed, cold, it is proper not to reduce the temperature
                    of the wort as low as that of the atmosphere. From want of attention to this
                    circumstance, we have seen wort refuse to ferment for some time, and the brewer
                    under the necessity of heating it artificially before fermentation could be
                    brought on. In such cases the wort is very apt to be lost altogether by
                    contracting acidity. The temperature, in such cases, ought not to be reduced
                    lower than 56°. But when the apartment in which fermentation is carried on is
                    warm, 51° or 52° is a very good temperature. When the brewer is obliged to make
                    ale in warm summer weather, it is material to reduce the temperature as low as
                    possible. In such cases great advantage would attend cooling the wort in coolers
                    without any roof or covering whatever, but quite open to the sky; because, in
                    clear nights, the wort might be cooled in this way, eight or ten degrees lower
                    than the temperature of the atmosphere. The reason is obvious. It is owing to
                    the rays of heat, which, in such a case, radiate from the wort, and are not
                    returned again by the clear sky. Wort, being a good radiator of heat, would be
                    particularly benefited by this method of cooling. We have no doubt that it might
                    be put in practice with advantage in hot climates; and that, by means of it,
                    good ale or porter might be manufactured in the East and West Indies. Such a
                    manufacture, if successful, would be particularly relished in India, and would,
                    we doubt not, prove a lucrative article of manufacture to an enterprising
                    man.</p>
                <p>While a duty was levied on ale and beer according to their quantity, excisemen
                    were in the habit of gauging the wort while in the boiler and when on the
                    coolers. Not that the duty was levied according to the quantities there found,
                    but to serve as a check upon the more accurate gauges taken in the fermenting
                    tuns. For a certain allowance being made for evaporation while the wort is in
                    the cooler, which the excisemen, from long observation, are enabled to do with
                    some accuracy, they have it in their power, from these checks, to determine
                    whether any of the wort from the coolers has been secreted or carried off with a
                    view to evade the excise laws. In the year 1830 the duty on beer was taken off.
                    The consequence of this is, that the brewer is now entirely freed from the
                    exciseman, and at liberty to improve his processes at pleasure. We doubt not
                    that in a short time this will be followed by considerable improvements in <hi
                    rend="italic">brewing.</hi></p>
                <p>4. When the wort is sufficiently cooled down by exposure on the coolers, it is
                    let down into the fermenting-tuns, or, as the brewers call them, the gyle-tuns,
                    in order to be fermented; by which process it is converted from the luscious
                    sweet-tasted liquor called <hi rend="italic">wort,</hi> to the brisk <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> intoxicating liquor which constitutes <hi
                    rend="italic">ale.</hi> The gyle-tuns are cylindrical wooden vessels, varying in
                    size according to the extent of the brewery. In the London breweries, and in the
                    distilleries, they are of prodigious size; but in private houses they often do
                    not exceed the size of a wine hogshead, or even of a beer barrel. The
                    fermentation is perhaps conducted with the greatest economy in large vessels;
                    but good ale maybe made in comparatively small quantities. How far this is the
                    case with porter, it is more difficult to say. Good porter has scarcely ever
                    been made, except by those who manufacture it upon a large scale.</p>
                <p>The fermenting tuns are not to be filled by the wort, because a considerable
                    increase in bulk takes place during the fermentation, in consequence of which
                    the liquor would run over, unless allowance were made for it.</p>
                <p>The fermentation of ale or beer is never carried to any great length. The object
                    of the brewer is, to retain the flavour and good qualities of the ale or beer,
                    not to develope the greatest quantity of spirits, which can hardly be clone
                    without allowing the wort to run into acidity. The violence of the fermentation
                    depends upon the quantity of yeast added. Brewers, accordingly, mix yeast with
                    their worts only in very sparing quantities, while the distiller adds it in
                    great doses, and repeatedly.</p>
                <p>Yeast is a frothy substance, of a brownish-grey colour and bitter taste, which is
                    formed on the surface of ale or wine while fermenting. If it be put into sacks
                    the moisture gradually drops out, and the yeast remains behind in a solid form.
                    It has very much of the flavour and taste of cheese when in this state; but its
                    colour is still darker. This dried yeast promotes or excites fermentation, but
                    it does not answer quite so well as fresh yeast. At one period some of the
                    Scotch distillers employed considerable quantities of it; but all of them with
                    whom we conversed on the subject affirmed that it was much less profitable than
                    even the bad porter yeast which they were in the habit of bringing down from
                    London. From the resemblance which dried yeast has to cheese, one would be
                    disposed to infer that it is a species or variety of gluten. But if we attempt
                    to induce fermentation in wort by adding the gluten of wheat, we will be
                    unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>When yeast is kept for some time in cylindrical glass vessels, a white substance,
                    not unlike curd, separates and swims on the surface. If this substance be
                    removed, the yeast loses the property of exciting fermentation. This white
                    substance possesses many of the properties of gluten, though it differs from it
                    in others. Its colour is much whiter, it has not the same elasticity, and its
                    particles do not adhere with the same force. In short, it agrees much more
                    nearly, in its properties, with the curd of milk than with the gluten of wheat.
                    We are disposed to consider this substance as the true fermenting principle in
                    yeast, though we were never able to procure a sufficient quantity of it to put
                    its fermenting powers to the test of experiment. We have sometimes seen a
                    similar substance separate in the fermenting tuns in distilleries, when the
                    fermentation was nearly at an end; or, rather, when such a quantity of spirit
                    had been generated as put an end to the fermentin*g process altogether. But we
                    could never learn that the distillers had formed any opinion respecting this
                    curdy substance. It did not interfere with the success of their operations, and,
                    on that account, they bestowed little attention on it. We attempted, once or
                    twice, to collect such a quantity of it as might enable us to try its powers as
                    a ferment, but we did not succeed.</p>

                <p>The only chemist who has attempted to subject yeast to a chemical analysis is
                    Westrumb; but, though this philosopher was distinguished for his accuracy, the
                    task was too difficult for the resources of the science of the time (1796) when
                    he published his <hi rend="italic">Experiments.</hi> From 15,360 parts of fresh
                    beer yeast he obtained the following substances :—</p>

                <p>As yeast may be reduced to a dried state without depriving it of the power of
                    acting as a ferment, it is clear that the carbonic acid, acetic acid, alcohol,
                    and water, are not essential to it. We cannot suppose that either potash, lime,
                    or malic acid, is essential. The saccharine matter, we know, is capable of
                    fermenting of itself; but if it were the essential ingredient, it would be quite
                    unnecessary to add yeast to wort at all, as we know that the wort contains
                    abundance of saccharine matter in solution. We know likewise, from experiment,
                    that neither extractive, mucilage, nor gluten, possesses the property of
                    exciting fermentation. Thus none of the substances found by Westrumb in yeast
                    can be considered as the true fermenting principle. Dobereiner found, that when
                    yeast is steeped in alcohol, it loses the property of acting as a ferment. This
                    may be owing to the alcohol dissolving and carrying off the true fermenting
                    principle. But we are rather disposed to ascribe it to the presence of a portion
                    of alcohol in the yeast. We know that a certain portion of alcohol destroys
                    fermentation. Thus we have found, by a great many trials, conducted on rather a
                    large scale, that the stronger a wort is made, the greater is the quantity of
                    unaltered saccharine matter which remains in it after the fermentation has been
                    carried to the greatest possible length. Hence the present mode of levying the
                    duties on spirits upon the wash is not only very injurious to the goodness of
                    the spirits manufactured, but is attended with a positive and very heavy loss to
                    the community. Distiller’s wash may be fermented a second time, and would in
                    this way yield a considerable additional quantity of spirits. We have frequently
                    seen it made into good small beer. The proper mode of levying the duty would be
                    on the quantity of saccharine matter in the wash. This might easily be
                    determined by a good saccharometer. A certain part of the duty might likewise be
                    levied upon the spirits produced. This would act as a sort of check upon the
                    first estimate, and would considerably diminish the risk of fraud. Indeed, the
                    mode of determining the duty by the quantity of saccharine matter would not be
                    more liable to evasion than the present mode. It could be evaded in no other way
                    than by concealing a portion of the wash, which would be equally efficacious
                    according to the present mode.</p>
                <p>We conceive, therefore, that when yeast is mixed with alcohol, it may retain so
                    much of that liquor as to prevent it from acting as a ferment. When we attempt
                    to wash away the alcohol, we may destroy the yeast by washing away that portion
                    of it which really acts as a ferment, which is probably small in quantity.</p>
                <p>It seems to us not unlikely, that the portion of yeast which really acts as a
                    ferment is a quantity of saccharine matter which it contains, that has begun to
                    undergo the decomposition produced by fermentation, but has not yet completed
                    the change. For nothing more seems to be necessary than to begin the
                    fermentative process in wort; the process then goes on of itself. It would be
                    curious to know whether a high temperature (96° or 100°) might be substituted in
                    distilleries for the great quantities of yeast at present employed. We believe
                    that the reason why such great quantities of yeast are necessary in
                    distilleries, is the very great strength of the wash employed; as they are
                    obliged by law to produce a quantity of proof spirits amounting nearly to one
                    fifth of the whole bulk of the wash. Nothing can be more preposterous than such
                    a method, nor more contrary to the real interest of the community, which
                    obviously must be to produce the greatest quantity of good spirits from a given
                    quantity of grain.</p>
                <p>The quantity of yeast mixed with the wort in the fermenting tuns by brewers is
                    very small, amounting, at an average, to a gallon of yeast for every three
                    barrels of wort. The following table will give the reader an idea of the
                    quantities of yeast really mixed by the Edinburgh brewers with their strong ale
                    worts in different brewings. It is obvious, however, that the quantity of yeast
                    must be regulated in some measure by its goodness.</p>

                <p>The last four brewings, in which the quantity of yeast added was smaller than in
                    the first six, took place during the month of May, when the heat is apt to make
                    the fermentation run to excess. The variation in the quantity, so conspicuous in
                    the first six brewings, is partly to be ascribed to differences in the goodness
                    of the yeast, but chiefly to the carelessness and want of method which
                    distinguished the brewer in question beyond any one we ever met. But we have
                    taken his quantities to show that differences in the quantity of yeast are not
                    material; for all the preceding brewings, except the first, furnished very good
                    ale. The wort in the first brewing had been cooled too much; the consequence
                    was, that it fermented very badly, and finally ran into acidity.</p>
                <p>Soon after the yeast has been mixed with the wort, an intestine motion begins to
                    appear in the liquid; air <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736261"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6261-0246"/>bubbles separate from it, and a froth collects
                    slowly upon the surface. This froth is of a yellowish gray colour. At first it
                    has the appearance of cream; but in a few days it collects in considerable
                    quantities, especially if the weather be warm. At the same time the temperature
                    of the wort increases, and a very considerable quantity of carbonic acid gas is
                    given out by it. The increase of temperature which takes place during the
                    fermenting of ale may be stated, at an average, to amount to 12° or 15°.
                    Sometimes it amounts to 20°, and sometimes does not exceed 5°. But in such cases
                    there is generally some fault in the skill of the brewer. But the following
                    table, exhibiting the highest temperatures of different ales during their
                    fermentation, will satisfy the reader of these changes of temperature better
                    than any general explanation:</p>

                </table>
                <p>From the preceding tables we see that the length of time which elapses before the
                    fermentation reaches its acme, supposing this to be measured by the temperature,
                    varies very considerably. The shortest interval in the table is three days, and
                    the longest nine days; the average of the whole is very nearly six days, which
                    is exactly the mean between the longest and the shortest times. If the reader
                    will glance his eye over the tables, he will perceive that, in general, the
                    higher the temperature of the wort is when let down into the fermenting tuns,
                    the more rapidly does the fermentation come on. As the worts were cooled by
                    exposure to the greatest cold of the night, and as the coolers were screened
                    from the radiation of heat, the temperatures given to the third column of the
                    preceding tables may be considered as measuring very nearly the greatest degree
                    of cold which took place in Edinburgh at the dates contained in the second
                    column. It follows, as might have been expected, that the warmer the weather the
                    more rapid is the fermentation. And hence the advantage of letting down the
                    worts rather warm in cold weather, and cooling them down as much as possible in
                    warm weather. For this purpose we cannot too much recommend coolers which can
                    occasionally be uncovered altogether, and exposed to the unclouded sky. A roof,
                    perhaps, might be contrived, composed of very light materials, which might be
                    easily slid off, or which might turn upon a pivot. For a roof would be
                    occasionally necessary to screen the worts from rain. In warm weather, brewing
                    should be confined to clear and unclouded days, when the cooling process could
                    be carried farthest of all. We have little doubt that wort might easily be
                    cooled down to the freezing point, if requisite, in our warmest summer
                    weather.</p>
                <p>Little can be said about the length of time during which the fermentation of the
                    ale lasts, because it varies very much according to the heat of the weather, and
                    the degree to which the wort has been cooled down. The following table will give
                    some idea of the length of time which elapsed during the fermentations contained
                    in the preceding tables:</p>

                <p>The theory of fermentation has occupied the attention of chemists ever since the
                    manufacture of ale began to be attended to by men of science, but it is only of
                    late that much light has been thrown upon the subject. Lavoisier was the first
                    person who attempted to give any thing like a theory of this intricate process.
                    He attempted to determine the composition of common sugar, a substance which may
                    be fermented just as well as the soluble part of malt, and which yields similar
                    products. He endeavoured, likewise, to determine the constituents of alcohol,
                    the substance formed by fermentation. With these data, and with a knowledge of
                    the composition of water and carbonic acid, he formed a plausible theory, which
                    was valuable as a first approximation, though there can be little doubt that it
                    was erroneous in every particular. Since that time, several experiments on the
                    subject have been made by Thenard. Guy-Lussac and Thenard, and Berzelius, have
                    determined the constituents of sugar with much care; and Theodore de Saussure
                    has made very elaborate, and we believe accurate, experiments on the composition
                    of alcohol. These facts will enable us to form a conception of what takes place
                    during fermentation. We shall first state the general theory, as resulting from
                    experiments on common sugar, and then give some experiments which we ourselves
                    have made on the saccharine matter of malt.</p>
                <p>If a weak solution of sugar in water be kept in a warm place, it will ferment of

                    once, and always successfully, provided the weather was warm. A solution of
                    sugar of grapes in water ferments still more speedily. This is said likewise to
                    be the case with sugar of starch, and, of course, with the saccharine matter of
                    malt. In our general view of fermentation, then, we may leave out of view the
                    small quantity of yeast; because it is not absolutely necessary, but seems
                    merely <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> to render the effect more rapid, and
                    consequently prevent the change of the liquid into acidity, which almost always
                    takes place when the fermentation is slow.</p>
                <p>When the fermentation is complete, the sugar disappears altogether, and two new
                    substances are found in its place, namely, carbonic acid and alcohol. All that
                    happens, then, is the resolution of sugar into the two new substances, carbonic
                    acid and alcohol. It is requisite to know how much of each of these substances
                    is formed from a given weight of sugar.</p>

                <p>This explanation of fermentation, though in some points hypothetical, must be
                    admitted to approach pretty near the experiments made upon the subject. These
                    experiments are attended with so much difficulty, that rigid accuracy cannot be
                    expected. In all likelihood, we can never arrive at the truth by any other
                    method than that which we have followed upon this occasion. Nor will this method
                    be any longer doubtful, as soon as it is ascertained with precision that sugar
                    can be resolved into alcohol and carbonic acid, and as soon as we know the
                    proportions of the two substances evolved. We conceive that both Lavoisier and
                    Thenard have stated the quantity of carbonic acid too low, from not being aware
                    that the whole of the sugar is never decomposed by fermentation. This we
                    conclude from some experiments of our own, made on a large scale, of which we
                    shall now proceed to give an account.</p>

                </table>
                <p>From this table we see that only one of the worts was reduced by fermentation so
                    low as the specific gravity of pure water. As a good deal of alcohol was evolved
                    in each by the fermentation, it is obvious that they must have all contained a
                    certain portion of saccharine matter undecom-posed, notwithstanding the violence
                    of the fermentation, which elevated the temperature of the worts more than 50
                    degrees. On evaporating a portion of the worts of each of these brewings, we
                    obtained a quantity of undecomposed saccharine matter, which amounted, at an
                    average, to one fifth of the quantity originally present. At first they
                    contained, on an average, 45 lbs. per barrel of saccharine matter. The <hi
                    rend="italic">spent mash,</hi> after distillation, contained still 9 lbs. per
                    barrel. This liquor was capable of being fermented a second time, and of
                    yielding more spirits.</p>
                <p>But as these worts were very weak, and as they were fermented in very
                    advantageous circumstances, and in much greater quantities than either Lavoisier
                    or Thenard could have employed in their experiments, we do not conceive that
                    more than four fifths of the sugar which they employed in their experiments
                    could have been decomposed. Now, if to the carbonic acid actually developed in
                    their trials we add a fifth part, the number will approach very nearly to the
                    one which we have deduced from the supposition that sugar is decomposed by
                    fermentation into an integrant part of alcohol and an integrant part of carbonic
                    acid.</p>
                <p>On comparing the quantity of alcohol of 0∙825 obtained in our experiments from
                    the quantity of saccharine matter actually decomposed by fermentation, the
                    result was, that 100 parts of saccharine matter yielded almost exactly 50 parts
                    of such alcohol. This would amount to about 40∙9 parts of real alcohol. There
                    can be no doubt that a portion of the alcohol was lost during the distillation,
                    which was conducted in the rapid way followed some years ago by the distillers
                    in Scotland. If we suppose one fifth to have been lost, which is probably not
                    much beyond the truth, the real produce of alcohol from the saccharine matter of
                    malt would be almost exactly one half of its weight, which it ought to be,
                    according to the preceding supposition, that it is decomposed into alcohol and
                    carbonic acid.</p>
                <p>When the fermentation is languid, it is customary to beat in the yeast which has
                    collected on the top; that is to say, the whole is stirred till the wort and
                    yeast are thoroughly mixed.</p>
                <p>5. The last step of the process of brewing is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >cleansing.</hi> When the violence of the fermentation is over, the head of
                    yeast which covers the top of the fermenting tun diminishes in height by the
                    gradual escape of the carbonic acid gas, which heaved it into bubbles. If the
                    wort were allowed to remain in the gyle-tun after this has happened, the yeast
                    would again mix with it; and the consequence would be a disagreeable bitter
                    taste, known among brewers by the name of <hi rend="italic">yeast bitter.</hi>
                    The fermentation would likewise continue, though in a languid manner, and the
                    ale would soon run into acidity. These accidents are prevented by drawing off
                    the ale into small casks. And this is called <hi rend="italic">cleansing.</hi>
                    The casks are filled quite full, and left with their bungs open. The drawing off
                    of the ale from the gyle-tun lowers its temperature, and, of course, checks the
                    fermentation. On this account the cleansing is sometimes practised in summer,
                    when the elevation of temperature in the wort is at its height.</p>
                <p>We have repeatedly observed a curious circumstance during the cleansing, not very
                    easily accounted for. If we take the temperature of the ale at the upper surface
                    of the gyle-tun, and then observe the temperature of the ale when it flows from
                    the stop-cock at the bottom of the tun, we shall generally find it one or two
                    degrees hotter in this latter place than at the former. We ought naturally to
                    expect the highest temperature at the top of the gyle-tun.</p>
                <p>The ale still continues to ferment after it is put into the small casks; but as
                    these casks are always kept full, the yeast, as it comes to the surface, flows
                    out at the bung, and thus separates altogether from the beer. It is this
                    separation that has induced brewers to distinguish it by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">cleansing.</hi> In these casks, then, the yeast divides itself
                    into two portions. The greatest part rises <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736300"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6300-0249"/>up with the carbonic acid evolved, and flows out
                    at the bung-hole; while another portion subsides to the bottom, and constitutes
                    what is called the dregs of the beer. It is essential to the cleansing that the
                    casks should be always full, otherwise the yeast will not run off, and the beer
                    will not become transparent. This object is accomplished in small breweries by a
                    man constantly going round, and filling up the casks as they <hi rend="italic"
                    >work down.</hi> But in the London breweries there is an ingenious mechanical
                    contrivance which answers the purpose perfectly.</p>
                <p>When the fermentation has subsided, the beer will in general be found
                    transparent. It is bunged up in the casks and preserved for sale; or in London,
                    where the quantity is too great for this, the beer is removed into large stone
                    vats, capable of holding several thousand barrels, from which it is gradually
                    distributed to the consumers.</p>
                <p>In London, where the beer is usually sent to the publichouses as soon as the
                    fermentation is over, and before it has had time to become fine, it is usual to
                    send along with it a quantity of <hi rend="italic">finings,</hi> as it is
                    called; that is, a solution of isinglass in weak sour beer, made from a fourth
                    mash of the same malt. The publican puts a certain quantity of this into every
                    cask. It forms a kind of web at the surface of the liquid; and, gradually
                    sinking to the bottom, carries with it all the flocculent matter, and leaves the
                    beer transparent.</p>
                <p>We shall terminate this chapter with a table exhibiting the results obtained by
                    brewing with malt made from a considerable number of different varieties of
                    barley and big.</p>

                <p>CHAP. V.</p>
                <p>OF ALE AND BEER.</p>
                <p>The English word <hi rend="italic">ale</hi> is obviously the same with the
                    Swedish word <hi rend="italic">ol,</hi> which is applied to the same kind of
                    fermented liquor; while the word <hi rend="italic">beer</hi> is synonymous with
                    the German word <hi rend="italic">Her.</hi> These two words in Great Britain are
                    applied to two liquors obtained by fermentation from the malt of barley; but
                    they differ from each other in several particulars. Ale is light-coloured,
                    brisk, and sweetish, or at least free from bitter; while beer is darkcoloured,
                    bitter, and much less brisk. What is called <hi rend="italic">porter</hi> in
                    England is a species of beer, and the term porter at present signifies what was
                    formerly called <hi rend="italic">strong beer.</hi> The original difference
                    between these two liquids was owing to the malt from which they were prepared.
                    Ale malt was dried at a very low heat, and consequently was of a pale colour;
                    while beer or porter malt was dried at a higher temperature, and had of
                    consequence acquired a brown colour. This insipient charring had developed a
                    peculiar and agreeable bitter taste, which was communicated to the beer along
                    with the dark colour. This bitter taste rendered beer more agreeable to the
                    palate, and less injurious to the constitution, than ale. It was consequently
                    manufactured in greater quantities, and soon became the common drink of the
                    lower ranks in England. When malt became high priced in consequence of the heavy
                    taxes laid upon it, and the great increase in the price of barley which took
                    place during the war of the French revolution, the brewers found out that a
                    greater quantity of wort of a given strength could be prepared from pale malt
                    than from brown malt. The consequence was, that pale malt was substituted for
                    brown malt in the brewing of porter and beer. We do not mean that the whole malt
                    employed was pale, but a considerable proportion of it. The wort of course was
                    much paler than before, and it wanted that agreeable bitter flavour which
                    characterized porter, and made it so much relished by most palates. The porter
                    brewers endeavoured to remedy these defects by several artificial additions.
                    They prepared an artificial colouring matter, by heating a solution of coarse
                    sugar in an iron boiler till it became black, and was reduced to the consistency
                    of treacle. The smoke issuing from it was then set on fire, and the whole was
                    allowed to burn for about ten minutes, when the flame was extinguished by
                    putting a lid on the vessel. This substance was mixed with a certain quantity of
                    water before it was cold. The porter is coloured by adding about two pounds of
                    this colouring matter for every barrel of wort while in the gyletun. Some
                    brewers make their colouring matter with infusion of malt instead of sugar; and
                    in 1809 M. de Roche took out a patent for preparing the colouring matter from
                    the husks of malt, by burning them like coffee, and then infusing them in water.
                    We believe that all these colouring matters are of the same nature; of course
                    the brewer ought to employ that one of them which is cheapest.</p>
                <p>To supply the place of the agreeable bitter which was communicated to porter by
                    the use of brown malt, various substitutes were tried. Quassia, cocculus
                    indicus, and we believe even opium, were employed in succession; but none of
                    them were found to answer the purpose sufficiently. Whether the use of these
                    substances be still persevered in we do not know, but we rather believe that
                    they are not, at least by the London porter brewers.</p>
                <p>It was this change in the use of the malt which occasioned the great falling off
                    in the London porter, which has been so much complained of, and ascribed to so
                    many causes. We do not believe that the schemes of Mr Jack-</p>
                <p>son, of notorious memory, though they enriched himself, produced the injurious
                    effects upon the London breweries that have been ascribed to them. This man,
                    whose character was notorious, kept an apothecary’s shop on Tower-Hill; and
                    speculating on the means of amassing a speedy fortune, he hit upon the idea of
                    brewing beer from various drugs instead of malt and hops. But instead of
                    commencing practical brewer himself, he struck out the more profitable trade of
                    teaching his process to the London brewers. Mrs Piozzi informs us, that even
                    from one great brewer he contrived to realize an ample fortune. His methods must
                    have been practised upon a considerable scale for some time; but we have no
                    doubt that they have been all abandoned long ago. It was the French war, and the
                    enormous tax upon malt, that was the real cause of the deterioration of the
                    quality of London porter. Nor will it ever recover its former good qualities,
                    till the tax on malt is reduced to its former rate; or unless the price of
                    porter be greatly enhanced, which is not likely to happen. We have sometimes
                    thought that if quassia were reduced to powder, and burnt like coffee, it might
                    probably be employed with great advantage, both as a colouring matter of porter,
                    and as likely to furnish the agreeable bitter, at present considered as peculiar
                    to brown malt.</p>
                <p>The quantity of malt employed annually in Great Britain, in brewing ale and beer,
                    may be easily deduced from the annual statements of the amount of the malt tax,
                    printed by order of the House of Commons.</p>
                <p>In the year 1813 the gross produce of the malt tax for England was L.4,188,450.
                    6s. 9d. Now, as this duty is; levied at the rate of four shillings and fourpence
                    per bushel, it follows that the quantity of malt made in England, and charged
                    with duty, amounted to 2,416,384*81 quarters. If we admit that the quantity of
                    malt actually made exceeds by five per cent, what is charged with duty, in that
                    case the whole malt actually made in England during the year 1813 was 2,537,204
                    quarters.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the actual receipts during the year 1813 were L.134,106. 12s. 0∣d.
                    This, at the rate of three shillings and eightpence and half a farthing per
                    bushel, which is the rate of the duty for Scotland, makes the number of the
                    quarters of malt made in that kingdom during the year 1813 amount to 91,436∙32.
                    We cannot here make the allowance of five per cent, for the increase of bulk
                    from malting, because we do not know what portion of this malt was made from
                    English and what from Scotch barley. But as the duty in the Highlands of
                    Scotland is lower than in the Lowlands, and as it cannot be doubted that a very
                    considerable proportion of the barley malted in Scotland is the growth of
                    England, perhaps we shall not err very far if we reckon the whole of the malt
                    actually made in Scotland in 1813 at 100,000 quarters, which is only one
                    twenty-sixth part of the whole malt made in Great Britain. Hence it follows that
                    four times as much beer is consumed in England as in Scotland, in proportion to
                    the population of the two countries. This is a prodigious advantage in favour of
                    Scotland; for there cannot be a doubt that beer is inferior in salubrity to
                    plain water as a beverage, and that, if the money spent by the common people in
                    England on beer were employed to buy food, they would be much more healthy,
                    stout, and happy, than they are at present.</p>
                <p>In the year 1814 the gross receipts of the malt tax in England amounted to
                    L.4,772,332. 5s. 5⅜d. This, at the rate of four shillings and fourpence per
                    bushel, indicates 2,753,26S∙6 quarters of malt; and, making an allowance of five
                    per cent, it follows that the whole malt made in England in 1814 amounted to
                    2,890,932 quarters.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, during the same year, the gross receipts <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193736352" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6352-0253"/>on the malt duty amounted to
                    L.125,787. 7s. 10^d. which, at the rate of three shillings and eightpence one
                    eighth per bushel, indicates 85,521∙18 quarters of malt. We may increase this on
                    account of the increase of malt not reckoned in the tax, and on account of the
                    tax in the Highlands being lower than in the Lowlands, to 90,000 quarters of
                    malt, which is a tenth less than the quantity malted in 1813, while, in England,
                    the quantity malted had increased considerably. Thus it appears that the whole
                    quantity of malt made in Great Britain during the year 1814 was 2,980,932
                    quarters.</p>

                <p>But this consumption of barley, enormous as it is, by no means gives us the whole
                    of that grain consumed annually in Great Britain in the manufacture of
                    spirituous liquors. For the distillers employ at least two thirds of the barley
                    which they use in the state of raw grain. Now this quantity does not pay any
                    malt tax, and, of course, is not included in the preceding estimate. It might be
                    possible to form an idea of this quantity from the duty levied upon spirits,

                <p>To form a proper estimate of the quantity of porter contained in this table, it
                    is necessary to know that the London barrel contains thirty-six gallons.</p>
                <p>The usual limits of the wort of strong ale in this country may be stated at from
                    60 to 120 pounds per barrel, or from the specific gravity 1Ό64 to 1∙11275 at the
                    temperature of 60°. The highest-priced ales also are not always the strongest,
                    because the price depends in a great measure on the reputation of the brewer.
                    The fermentation of ale is not carried far; and the consequence is, that a
                    considerable portion of the saccharine matter still remains in the liquid,
                    apparently unaltered. By means of the infusion of nut-galls, too, traces of
                    starch may be still detected in strong ale, even after it has been kept for some
                    time in bottles. The annexed table exhibits the original strength of the wort
                    before the fermentation began, and likewise the diminution of specific gravity
                    produced by the fermentation, or the <hi rend="italic">attenuation.,</hi> as
                    this diminution is termed by brewers and distillers.</p>

                </table>
                <p>As a certain quantity of alcohol is evolved in the ale by the fermentation, it is
                    obvious that the last column is not quite accurate. The real quantity of
                    saccharine matter in each of these also must be greater than what is indicated
                    in that column, because the effect of the saccharine matter, in increasing the
                    specific gravity of the ale, is counteracted by the alcohol, which tends to
                    diminish that specific gravity. By casting the eye over the preceding table, it
                    will be seen that the attenuation does not follow the ratio of the strength. It
                    was greatest of all in the third, and least in the first brewing. These brewings
                    being the same with those given in the fourth chapter, in order to illustrate
                    the quantity of yeast used in fermenting, the reader, by comparing the two
                    tables together, will be able to form some conclusions respecting the effect of
                    different quantities of yeast, and different temperatures upon the attenuation
                    of strong ale,</p>
                <p>Porter is much weaker than strong ale. The average specific gravity of porter
                    wort, according to Shannon, as deduced by the saccharometer, is 1∙0645, which
                    indicates 60 pounds per barrel of saccharine extract. Hence the reason why it is
                    so much less glutinous and adhesive than strong ale. The fermentation which
                    porter undergoes is, we believe, much less than that of ale; but we have no very
                    accurate information on the subject. According to the experiments of Mr Brande,
                    brown stout, which is the strongest porter made in London, contains 6∙8 per
                    cent, by measure, of alcohol of the specific gravity 0 ’ 825. If he had given us
                    the specific gravity of this porter before distillation, it would have enabled
                    us to determine in some measure the error in the attenuation, as indicated by
                    the saccharometer.</p>
                <p>The porter brewers in London use three kinds of malt; namely pale malt, amber
                    malt, and brown malt. These three are mashed separately, and the worts from each
                    are afterwards mixed together in the same fermenting vessel. In some breweries,
                    as in that of Barclay and Perkins in the Borough, there are three separate
                    mash-tuns. In other breweries, the custom is to mash one kind of malt the first
                    day, another kind the second day, and a third kind the third day. The first
                    day’s wort is put into the fermenting vessel, and mixed with yeast; and the
                    other two worts are added to it successively as they are formed. Hence it is
                    very difficult to determine with accuracy the strength of the worts in the
                    London breweries. It could only be done by knowing the quantity of wort from
                    each malt, and its specific gravity when let into the fermenting vessel. We have
                    had an opportunity of determining the strength of the porter wort in all the
                    principal breweries in London. The average specific gravity of brown-stout wort
                    is 1∙0624. The wort of the best common porter is of the specific gravity 1∙0535,
                    that of the worts of the weakest is as low as 1∙0374. The average specific
                    gravity deduced from twenty brewings was 1∙0500. Such wort contains about 46∙4
                    lbs. per barrel of saccharine matter. Judging from the taste of some of the
                    worts, quassia seems to be employed in considerable quantity by some of the
                    brewers, and much more sparingly, if at all, by others. The fermentation of
                    porter is carried on with considerable rapidity, so that it is over in two or
                    three days. The specific gravity of the porter is usually brought down to 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 0l3 or 1∙017. The specific gravity of the best
                    brown-stout, after standing some months in the bottle, is I∙0106. The proportion
                    of pale and brown malt used in the different houses varies. One of the best
                    brewers in London uses nearly two parts pale malt to one part brown. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(l.)</hi></p>
                <p>EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.</p>
                <p>Figs. 1 and 2, Plate CXXX., explain the arrangement of the utensils and machinery
                    in a porter brewery on the largest scale; in which, however, it must be observed
                    that the elevation, fig. 1, is in a great degree imaginary as to the plane upon
                    which it is taken; but the different vessels are arranged so as to explain their
                    uses most readily, and at the same time to preserve, as nearly as possible, the
                    relative positions which are usually assigned to each in works of this
                    nature.</p>
                <p>The malt for the service of the brewery is stored in vast granaries or
                    malt-lofts, usually situated in the upper part of the buildings. Of these, we
                    have only been able to represent one at A, fig. 1; the others, which are
                    supposed to be on each side of it, cannot be seen in this view. Immediately
                    beneath the granary A is the mill, in the upper floor of which are two pair of
                    rollers for bruising or crushing the grains of the malt. (An enlarged
                    representation of the rollers is given at figs. 3 and 4.) In the floor beneath
                    the rollers are the mill-stones <hi rend="italic">b b,</hi> where the malt is
                    sometimes ground, instead of the simple bruising which it receives by passing
                    between the rollers.</p>
                <p>The malt, when prepared, is conveyed by a trough into a chest, <hi rend="italic"
                    >d,</hi> from which it can be elevated by the action of a spiral screw <hi
                    rend="italic">e (see</hi> also figs. 5 and 6) into the large chest or binn B,
                    for ground malt, situated immediately over the mashing-tun D. The malt is
                    reserved in the binn <pb break="no" facs="nls:193736378"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-6378-0255"/>till wanted, and it is then let down into the
                    mashing-tun, where the extract is obtained by hot water supplied from the copper
                    G.</p>
                <p>The water for the service of the brewery is obtained from the well E, by a
                    lifting pump worked by the steamengine; and the forcing-pipe <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> of this pump conveys the water up to the large reservoir or water-back
                    F, placed at the top of the engine-house. From this cistern iron pipes are laid
                    to the copper G, and also every part of the establishment where cold water can
                    be wanted for cleaning and washing the vessels. The copper G can be filled with
                    cold Water by only turning a cock; and the water, when boiled therein, is
                    conveyed by the pipe <hi rend="italic">g</hi> into the mashing-tun D. It is
                    introduced beneath a false bottom, upon which the malt lies, and, rising up
                    through the holes in the false bottom, it extracts the saccharine matter from
                    the malt; a greater or less time being allowed for the infusion, according to
                    circumstances. The instant the water is drawn off from the copper, fresh water
                    must be let into it, in order to be boiled ready for the second mashing; because
                    the copper must not be left empty for a moment, otherwise the intense heat of
                    the fire would melt the bottom. For the convenience of thus letting down at once
                    as much liquor as will fill the bottom of the copper, a pan or second boiler is
                    placed over the top of the copper, as seen in fig. 3, Plate CXXXI.; and the
                    steam rising from the copper communicates a considerable degree of heat to the
                    contents of the pan, without any expense of fuel. This will be more minutely
                    explained hereafter.</p>
                <p>During the process of mashing, the malt is agitated in the mash-tun, to expose
                    every part to the action of the water. This is done by a machine contained
                    within the mash-tun, and put in motion by the horizontal shaft H, leading from
                    the mill. The mashing-machine is shown in fig. 1, Plate CXXXI. When the mashing
                    is finished, the wort or extract is drained down from the malt, into a vessel I,
                    of similar dimensions to the mash-tun, and situated immediately beneath, from
                    which it is called the underback. Here the wort does not remain longer than is
                    necessary to drain off the whole of it from the tun above. It is then pumped up
                    by the three-barrelled pump A, into the pan at the top of the copper, by a pipe
                    which cannot be seen in the plate.</p>
                <p>The wort remains in the copper pan until the water for the succeeding mashes is
                    discharged from the copper. But this waiting is no loss of time, because the
                    heat of the copper, and the steam arising from it, makes the wort, which had
                    become cooler, ready for boiling. The instant the copper is empty, the wort is
                    let down from the pan into the copper, and the second wort is pumped up from the
                    underback into the copper pan. The proper proportion of hops is thrown into the
                    copper through the near hole, and then the door is shut down, and screwed fast,
                    to keep in the steam, and cause it to rise up through pipes into the pan; and by
                    bubbling up through the wort in the pan, it communicates so much heat that it is
                    soon ready for boiling in its turn; for it is to be observed, that the different
                    worts follow each other through all the different vessels with the greatest
                    regularity, so that there is no loss of time, but every part of the apparatus is
                    constantly employed. When the boiling of the wort has continued a sufficient
                    time to coagulate the grosser part of the extract and to evaporate part of the
                    water, the contents of the copper are run off through a large cock into the
                    jack-back K, which is a vessel of sufficient dimensions to contain it, and
                    provided with a bottom of cast-iron plates, perforated with small holes, through
                    which the wort drains and leaves the hops. The hot wort is drawn off from the
                    jack-back through the pipe <hi rend="italic">h</hi> by the three-barrelled pump,
                    which throws it up to the coolers L, this pump being made with different pipes
                    and cocks of communication, to serve all the purposes of the brewery except that
                    of raising the cold water from the well. The coolers L are very shallow vessels,
                    built over one another in several stages; and that part of the building in which
                    they are contained is built with open lattice-work on all sides, to admit the
                    free current of air. When the wort is sufficiently cooled to be put to the first
                    fermentation, it is conducted in pipes from all the different coolers to the
                    large fermenting vessel or gyle-tun M, which, with another similar vessel behind
                    it, is of sufficient capacity to contain all the beer of one day’s brewings.</p>
                <p>When the first fermentation is concluded, the beer is drawn off from the great
                    fermenting vessel M into the small fermenting casks or cleansing vessels N, of
                    which there are a great number in the brewery. They are placed four together,
                    and to each four a common spout is provided to carry off the yeast, and conduct
                    it into the troughs <hi rend="italic">u</hi> placed beneath. In these cleansing
                    vessels the beer remains till the fermentation is completed, and it is then put
                    into the store-vats, which are casks or tuns of an immense size, where it is
                    kept till wanted, and is then drawn off into barrels and sent away from the
                    brewery. The store-vats are not represented in the plate, but are of a conical
                    figure, and of different dimensions, from fifteen to forty feet diameter, and
                    usually twenty feet in depth. The steam-engine which puts all the machinery in
                    motion is explained by the figure. On the axis of the large flywheel is a
                    bevelled cog-wheel, which turns another similar wheel upon the end of a
                    horizontal shaft, which extends from the engine-house to the great horse-wheel,
                    which it turns by means of a cog-wheel. The horse-wheel puts in motion all the
                    pinions for the mill-stones 6Z&gt;, and also the horizontal axis which works the
                    three-barrelled pump <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> The rollers <hi rend="italic"
                    >aa</hi> are turned by a bevelled wheel upon the upper end of the axis of the
                    horse-wheel, which is continued for that purpose; and the horizontal shaft H,
                    for the mashing engine, is driven by a pair of bevelled wheels. There is
                    likewise a sack-tackle, which is not represented. It is a machine for drawing up
                    the sacks of malt from the court-yard to the highest part of the building,
                    whence the sacks are wheeled on a truck to the maltloft A, and the contents of
                    the sacks are thrown in.</p>
                <p>The horse-wheel is intended to put in horses occasionally if the steam-engine
                    should fail; but these engines are now brought to such perfection that it is
                    very seldom any accidents occur with them.</p>
                <p>Fig. 2, Plate CXXX., is a representation of the fermenting-house at the brewery
                    of Messrs Whitbread and Company, Chiswell Street, London, which is by far the
                    most complete in its arrangement of any work of the kind, and was erected after
                    the plan of Mr Richardson, who conducts the brewing at those works. The whole of
                    fig. 2 is to be considered as devoted to the same object as the large vessel M
                    and the casks N, fig. 1. In fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the pipe which
                    leads from the different coolers to convey the wort to the great fermenting
                    vessels or squares M, of which there are two, one behind the other;
                    /'/represents a part of the great pipe which conveys all the water from the well
                    E, fig. 1, up to the water cistern F. This pipe is conducted purposely up the
                    wall of the fermenting-house, fig. 2, and has a cock in it, near r, to stop the
                    passage. Just beneath this passage a branch-pipe <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    proceeds and enters a large pipe <hi rend="italic">xx</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> y</hi> which has the former pipe <hi rend="italic">r</hi> withinside
                    of it. From the end of the pipe a?, nearest to the squares M, another branch <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> «.proceeds, and returns to the original pipe/ with a cock
                    to regulate it. The object of this arrangement is to make all, or any part of,
                    the cold water flow through the pipe <hi rend="italic">x x, so</hi> as to
                    surround the wort-pipe r, which is only made of thin copper, and lower the
                    temperature of the wort passing through the pipe <hi rend="italic">r,</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193736391" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6391-0256"/>until, by the
                    thermometer, it is found to have the exact temperature which is desirable before
                    it is put to ferment in the great square Μ. By means of the cocks at <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the quantity of cold water
                    which shall pass in contact with the surface of the pipe <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> can be regulated at pleasure, so as to have a command of the heat of the
                    wort when it enters into the square.</p>
                <p>When the first fermentation in the squares M is finished, the beer is drawn off
                    from them by pipes marked <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> and conducted by its
                    branches <hi rend="italic">w</hi> to the different rows of fermenting-tuns
                    marked NN, which fill all the building. Between every two rows are placed large
                    troughs to contain the yeast which they throw off. The plate shows that the
                    small tuns are all placed on a lower level than the bottom of the great vessels
                    M, so that the beer will flow into them, and, by standing in them all, will fill
                    them to the same level. When they are filled, the communication-cock is shut;
                    but as the working off of the yeast diminishes the quantity of beer in each
                    vessel, it is necessary to fill them up again. For this purpose the two large
                    vats 00 are filled from the great vessels M before any beer is drawn off into
                    the small casks N, and this quantity of beer is reserved at the higher level for
                    filling up. The two vessels OO are in reality placed between the two squares M,
                    but we have been obliged to place them so that they can be seen. Near each
                    filling-up tun <hi rend="italic">o</hi> is a cistern í, with a pipe of
                    communication from the tun 0, and this pipe is closed by a float-valve. The
                    small cisterns <hi rend="italic">t</hi> have always a communication with the
                    pipes which lead to the small fermenting vessels N, and therefore the surface of
                    the beer in all the tuns and in the cisterns will always be at the same level;
                    and as this level subsides by the working off of the yeast from the tuns, the
                    float sinks and opens the valve, so as to admit a sufficiency of beer from the
                    filling-up tuns <hi rend="italic">o</hi> to restore the surfaces of the beer in
                    all the tuns, and also in the cistern <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> to the original level. In order to carry off the yeast which
                    is produced by the fermentation of the beer in the tuns 00, an iron dish or
                    vessel is made to float upon the surface of the beer which they contain; and
                    from the centre of this dish a pipe o descends and passes through the bottom of
                    the tun, being filled through a collar of leather so as to be tight, at the same
                    time that it is at liberty to slide down as the surface of the beer descends in
                    the tun. The yeast flows over the edge of this dish, and is conveyed down the
                    pipe to a trough beneath.</p>
                <p>Beneath the fermenting house are large arched vaults P, built with stone, and
                    lined with stucco. Into these the beer is let down when sufficiently fermented,
                    and is kept till wanted. These vaults are used at Mr Whitbread’s brewery instead
                    of the great store-vats of which we have before spoken, and are in some respects
                    preferable, because they preserve a great equality of temperature, being beneath
                    the surface of the earth.</p>
                <p>Figs. 3 and 4, Plate CXXX., represent the malt-rollers, or machine for bruising
                    the grains of malt. A is the hopper into which the malt is let down from the
                    malt-loft above, and from this the malt is let out gradually through a sluice or
                    sliding-shuttle <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and falls between the rollers BD.
                    These rollers are made of iron, truly cylindrical, and their pivots are received
                    in pieces of brass let into iron frames, which are bolted down to the wooden
                    frame of the machine. A screw E is lapped through the end of each of these iron
                    frames; and by these screws the brasses can be forced forwards, and the rollers
                    made to work closer to each other, so as to bruise the malt in a greater degree.
                    G is the shaft by which one of the rollers is turned, and the other receives its
                    motion by means of a pair of equal cog-wheels FI, which are fixed upon the ends
                    of the pivots, at the opposite ends of each of the rollers: <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> is a small lever, which bears upon the teeth of one of these cogwheels,
                    and is thereby lifted up every time a cog passes. This lever is fixed on the
                    extremity of an axis, which passes across the wood frame, and in the middle of
                    it has a lever c, fig. 3, bearing up a trough <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which
                    hangs under the opening of the hopper A. By this means the trough <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> is constantly jogged, and shakes down the malt regularly
                    from the hopper A, and lets it fall between the rollers: <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> is a scraper of iron plate, which is always made to bear against the
                    surface of the roller by a weight, to remove the grains which adhere to the
                    roller.</p>
                <p>Fig. 5 is the screw by which the ground or bruised malt is raised up, or conveyed
                    from one part of the brewery to another. K is an inclined bar or trough, in the
                    centre of which the axis of the screw FI is placed; and the spiral iron plate or
                    worm, which is fixed projecting from the axis, and which forms the screw, is
                    made very nearly to fill the inside of the box. By this means, when the screw is
                    turned round by the wheels EF, or by any other means, it raises up the malt from
                    the box <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and delivers it at the spout G.</p>
                <p>The screw is equally applicable for conveying the malt horizontally in the trough
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> as inclined; and similar machines are employed in
                    various parts of breweries for conveying the malt wherever the situation of the
                    works require.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1, Plate CXXXI., is the mashing-machine. WW is the tun, made of wood staves,
                    hooped together. In the centre of it rises a perpendicular shaft NN, which is
                    turned slowly round by means of the bevelled wheels KI at the top. RR are two
                    arms projecting from the axis, and supporting the short vertical axis S at the
                    extremities, so that, when the central axis is turned round, it will carry the
                    axle S round the tun in a circle. The axis S is furnished with a number of arms
                    T, which are shown in fig. 2, and have blades placed obliquely to the plane of
                    their motion. When the axis is turned round, these arms agitate the malt in the
                    tun, and give it a constant tendency to rise upwards from the bottom.</p>
                <p>The motion of the axis S is produced by a wheel Q on the upper end of it, which
                    is turned by a wheel P fastened on the lower end of the tube 0, which turns
                    freely round upon the central axis N. On the upper end of the same tube O is a
                    bevelled wheel M, receiving motion from a wheel L, which is fixed upon the end
                    of the horizontal axis F, which gives motion to the whole machine. This same
                    axis has a pinion G upon it, which gives motion to the wheel H, fixed upon the
                    end of a horizontal axle, which at the opposite end has a bevelled pinion I
                    working the wheel K, before mentioned. By this means the rotation of the central
                    axis N will be very slow compared with the motion of the axis S, for the latter
                    will make seventeen or eighteen revolutions on its own axis in the same space of
                    time that it will be carried once round the tun by the motion of the axis N. At
                    the beginning of the operation of mashing, the machine is made to move with a
                    slow motion; but, after having wetted all the malt by one revolution, it is made
                    to revolve quicker. For this purpose the ascending shaft A, which gives motion
                    to the machine, has two bevelled wheels BC fixed upon a tube X, which is fitted
                    upon the shaft. These wheels actuate the wheels D and E upon the end of the
                    horizontal shaft F; but the distance between the two wheels B and C is such,
                    that they cannot be engaged both at once with the wheels D and E; but the tube
                    X, to which they are fixed, is capable of sliding up and down on the axis A
                    sufficiently to bring either wheel B or C into action with its corresponding
                    wheel E or D upon the horizontal shaft; and as the diameters of BE and CD are of
                    very different proportions, the velocity of the motion of the machine can <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193736404" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6404-0257"/> be varied at
                    pleasure by using one or other: <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> are two levers, which are forked at the ends, and embrace collars at the
                    ends of the tube X; and the levers being united by a rod, the handle <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> gives the means of moving the tube X and its wheels BC up
                    or down to obtain the action of the different wheels.</p>
                <p>Figs. 3 and 4 represent a large close copper. AA is the copper, and B the pan
                    placed over it. The copper has a large tube E rising up from the dome of it, to
                    convey the steam; and from the top of this four inclined pipes R descend, the
                    ends being immersed beneath the surface of the water or wort contained in the
                    pan. By this means the steam which rises from the copper issues from the ends of
                    the pipes R, and rises in bubbles through the liquor in the pan, so as to heat
                    it. In the centre of the copper is a perpendicular spindle <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> which, at the lower end, has arms <hi rend="italic">dd</hi> fixed
                    projecting from it, and is turned round by a cog-wheel <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    at the upper end. From the arms <hi rend="italic">dd</hi> chains are hung in
                    loops, which drag round upon the bottom of the copper when the axis is turned;
                    and this motion stirs up the hops to keep them from burning at the bottom: <hi
                    rend="italic">fg</hi> is a chain and roller to draw up the spindle <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> when the rowser is not wanted; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ee</hi> are iron braces proceeding from the outside of the copper, to retain
                    the axis <hi rend="italic">a</hi> firmly in the centre of the copper. D is the
                    waste-pipe for carrying off the steam into the chimney when it is not required
                    to heat the liquor in the pan. The copper represented in the drawing is made in
                    the same manner as usual; but the fire is applied beneath it in a manner very
                    different from the common brewing-coppers. The method was devised with a view to
                    the burning or consuming of the smoke, and was employed in the brewery of Messrs
                    Meux and Company, London, about the year 1803.</p>
                <p>The fire-place is divided into two by a wall extended beneath the bottom of the
                    boiler, as shown by Z in the plan, fig. 4, where the dotted circle A represents
                    the bottom of the copper, and the circle X its largest part. The section in fig.
                    3 shows only one of these fire-places, of which C is the fire-grate. The raw
                    coal is not thrown in through the fire-door in the manner of common furnaces,
                    but is put into a narrow inclined box of cast-iron A, built in the brick-work,
                    and shaped like a hopper. The coals contained in this hopper fill it up, and
                    stop the entrance of the air so as to answer the purpose of a door; and the
                    coals at the lowest part or mouth of the hopper are brought into a state of
                    ignition before they are forced forwards into the furnace, which is done by
                    introducing a rake or poker at <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> just beneath the lower
                    end of the hopper <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and forcing the coals forwards upon
                    the grate bars C. Immediately over the hopper <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> a narrow
                    passage is left to admit a stream of fresh air along the top of the hopper to
                    pass over the surface of the fuel which is burning at the lower end of the
                    hopper A. By this means the smoke rising from that portion of fuel is carried
                    forwards over the burning coals upon the grate C, and is thereby consumed.
                    Beyond the grate bars <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> a breast wall S is erected, to
                    direct the flame upwards against the bottom of the boiler A, and thence
                    descending under the bottom, the flame is received into the flues, which make
                    each a half turn round the lower part of the copper, as shown in the plan at <hi
                    rend="italic">tt,</hi> and then enter the chimney or perpendicular flue W at the
                    same point; the entrance being regulated by a damper to make the draught more or
                    less intense. There is also a sliding door or damper E, which closes up the
                    lower part of the chimney; and by means of these two dampers the fire under the
                    copper can be regulated to the greatest precision; for by opening the damper F
                    it admits the cold air to enter immediately into the chimney W, and thus take
                    off the rapidity of the draught; and at the same time, by closing the dampers
                    from the flues into the chimney, the intensity of the draught through the fire
                    is checked, which is very necessary to be done when the contents of the copper
                    are drawn off. Immediately over the fire-grate c, an arch of fire-bricks or
                    stone s is placed beneath the bottom of the copper, to defend it from the
                    intense heat. The chimney is supported on iron columns RR. Behind the fire-grate
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is a cavity <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> for the reception
                    of the masses of scoriae which are always formed in so large a fire. They are
                    pushed back off the grate into this receptacle with an iron hook as fast as they
                    accumulate. The bottom of this receptacle is formed of sliding iron doors, which
                    can be opened by drawing them out, and in this way the clinkers are discharged;
                    or the whole of the fire may be driven back off the grate into this cavity, and
                    will then fall through into the ash-pit and be removed into the copper, which is
                    very necessary to be done when the copper is to be cooled, so that men may
                    descend into it to clean out the sediment which is left after boiling the wort.
                    For a more particular description of this method of setting boilers, see <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine,</hi> vol. xvii.</p>
                <p>Fig. 6 represents one of the sluice-cocks which are used to make the
                    communications of the pipes with the pumps or other parts of the brewery. BB
                    represents the pipe in which the cock is placed. The two parts of this pipe are
                    screwed to the sides of a box CC, in which a slider A rises and falls, and
                    intercepts at pleasure the passage of the pipe. The slider is moved by the rod
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>-which passes through a stuffing-box in the top, the
                    box which contains the slider, and has the rack <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    fastened to it. The rack is moved by a pinion fixed upon the axis of a handle
                    <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and the rack and pinion is contained in a frame <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> which is supported by two pillars. The frame contains a
                    small roller behind the rack, which bears it up towards the pinion, and keeps
                    its teeth up to the teeth of the pinion. The slider A is made to fit accurately
                    against the internal surface of the box C, and it is made to bear against this
                    surface by the pressure of a spring, so as to make a perfectly close
                    fitting.</p>
                <p>Fig. 5 is a small cock to be placed in the side of the great store-vats, for the
                    purpose of drawing off a small quantity of beer, to taste and try its quality. A
                    is a part of the stave or thickness of the great store-vat; into this the tube B
                    of the cock is fitted, and is held tight in its place by a nut <hi rend="italic"
                    >aa</hi> screwed on withinside. At the other end of the tube B a plug <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> is fitted, by grinding it into a cone, and it is kept in by
                    a screw. This plug has a hole up the centre of it, and from this a hole proceeds
                    sideways and corresponds with a hole made through the side of the tube when the
                    cock is open; but when the plug <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is turned round, the
                    hole will not coincide, and then the cock will be shut. D is the handle or key
                    of the cock, by which its plug is turned to open or shut it; this handle is put
                    up the bore of the tube (the cover E being first unscrewed and removed), and the
                    end of it is adapted to fit the end of the plug of the cock. The handle has a
                    tube or passage bored up it to convey the beer away from the cock when it is
                    opened, and from this the passage <hi rend="italic">f</hi> through the handle,
                    leads to draw the beer into a glass or tumbler. The hole in the side of the plug
                    is so arranged, that when the handle is turned into a perpendicular direction
                    with the passage <hi rend="italic">f</hi> downwards, the cock will be open. The
                    intention of this contrivance is, that there shall be no considerable projection
                    beyond the surface of the tun; because it sometimes happens that a great hoop of
                    the tun breaks, and, falling down, its great weight would strike out any cock
                    which had a projection; and if this happened in the night much beer might be
                    lost before it was discovered. The cock above described being <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193736417" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6417-0258"/>almost wholly withinside, and
                    having scarcely any projection beyond the outside surface of the tun, is secure
                    from this accident.</p>
                <p>Fig. 7 is a small contrivance of a vent peg, to be screwed into the head of a
                    common cask when the beer is to be drawn off from it, and it is necessary to
                    admit some air to allow the beer to flow. AA represents a portion of the head of
                    the cask into which the tube B is screwed. The top of this tube is surrounded by
                    a small cup, from which project the two small handles CC, by which the peg is
                    turned round to screw it into the cask. The cup round the upper part of the tube
                    is filled with water, and into this a small cup D is inverted; in consequence,
                    the air can gain admission into the cask when the pressure within is so far
                    diminished that the air will bubble up through the water, and enter beneath the
                    small cup D.</p>
