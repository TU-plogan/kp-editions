                    hypostases of the Hindu mythology, the creator of the world under Brahm, and the
                    author of the sacred books called Vedas.</p>
                <p>The Brahmins constitute the first or highest of the four <hi rend="italic"
                    >tchadi</hi> or castes into which the Hindu nation continues to be divided, as
                    it has been from a very remote antiquity. The origin of this singular division
                    or classification, which prevailed in ancient Egypt as it still does in the
                    peninsula of India, and which was based upon nearly the same principles in both,
                    is hid in the obscurity of ages. Each caste has its peculiar privileges, duties,
                    and laws, all of which are incommunicable and unalienable. The more honourable
                    the caste is, the more numerous are the restrictions to which its members are
                    subjected, and the higher the prerogatives they enjoy. The fourth caste has the
                    fewest observances to follow, but it has also the least portion of respect, and
                    is the most limited in its rights and privileges. Every individual remains
                    invariably in the caste in which he is born; practises its duties as prescribed
                    in the laws relative thereto; and is precluded from ever aspiring to a higher,
                    whatever may be his genius, his virtue, his patriotism, or his courage. The law
                    which determines every man’s position in society is immutable; and dreadful are
                    the penalties which await him who ventures to dispense with even the most absurd
                    rules laid down in it. To this point of honour the Hindu patiently sacrifices
                    not only health, but life itself; degradation and infamy await him who
                    transgresses its dictates; yet, although the code of which this constitutes part
                    has been in force for a long series of ages, the people have never (perhaps for
                    this very reason) thought of moderating its rigour or mitigating its
                    oppression.</p>
                <p>The leading castes among the Hindus are, as we have already observed, four. These
                    are, first, the Brahmins; secondly, the Kshatriyas, or soldiers, including the
                    princes and sovereigns, and hence sometimes called the caste of Rajahs or
                    Rajeputras; thirdly, the Vaisyas, consisting of agriculturists and shepherds;
                    and, fourthly, the Sudras or labourers. It is with the first of these, however,
                    namely the Brahmins, that we are at present exclusively concerned. This is the
                    sacred or sacerdotal caste, the members of which have maintained an authority
                    more exalted, comprehensive, and absolute, than the priests of any other people,
                    excepting perhaps those of ancient Egypt before the Persian invasion under
                    Cambyses. According to the received Brahminical tradition, that priesthood
                    originally proceeded from the mouth of Brahma, which is the seat of wisdom, and
                    thus, by the mere fact of their genesis, became invested with an undoubted
                    superiority over the other castes, which sprung from inferior organs or members
                    of the hypostatical creator; as the Kshatriyas from his heart, the Vaisyas from
                    his belly, and the Sudras from his feet. Of the Brahmins there are seven
                    subdivisions, which derive their origin from the seven Rishis or Penitents, the
                    most sacred personages acknowledged by the Hindus. The Rishis are of high
                    antiquity, being mentioned in the Vedas; and they are believed to have
                    occasionally exercised a salutary superintendence over the gods themselves,
                    visiting with their holy displeasure such of the divine impersonationsas had
                    been guilty of any irregularity. Their residence was fixed in the remote and
                    elevated regions of the north; and hence the Brahmins of the north are esteemed
                    as the noblest, from their proximity to the great fountain. The Gymnosophists,
                    or Brahmins of antiquity, lived much more secluded than those of modern times,
                    who mingle to a considerable extent in secular concerns. But the latter have
                    made almost no change in their rules of abstinence, their ablutions, and
                    multiplied ceremonies. Their great prerogative consists in being the sole
                    depositaries and expounders of the Vedas or sacred books, four in number, for
                    each of which there is a separate class or branch of the Brahmins. This
                    prerogative they guard with the most jealous care, affirming, that if a Sudra or
                    other profane person were to attempt to read even the title of these books, his
                    head would instantly cleave asunder; and a Brahmin bold enough to exhibit the
                    sacred volumes to profane eyes would incur the penalty of irretrievable
                    expulsion from his caste. Yet, with much judgment, they make an exception as to
                    the miracle in favour of Europeans; nor has it been found expedient to enforce
                    the law of caste against such Brahmins as may have indulged them with a perusal
                    or even with copies of the Vedas.</p>
                <p>The great body of the Brahmins profess to pay equal veneration to the three
                    hypostases of the godhead, Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva. But some attach themselves
                    exclusively to one of these impersonations; while others, admitting the divine
                    emanation of three, exhibit only a preference in their homage, founded on
                    certain fanciful distinctions. Thus Vishnu and Siva, though nominally
                    co-ordinate with Brahma, have long been objects of partiality with individuals
                    who, in virtue of such preference, arc formed into sects, distinguished by the
                    name of the hypostasis to which their chief homage is paid. The worshippers of
                    Vishnu are denominated Namadhari, from bearing in their foreheads the mark
                    called Nama, consisting of three perpendicular lines, crossed at the lower
                    extremity by a horizontal one, so as to form a sort of trident; and their dress
                    is of a deep orange colour. The devotees of Siva are denominated Lingamhari,
                    from wearing the Lingam stuck in their hair, or attached to the arm in a tube of
                    gold or silver. The former are notorious for intemperance, and on that account
                    disliked by the people; the latter, for the most part, observe great moderation
                    both in eating and drinking. The devotees of Vishnu account as sacred the
                    monkey, the garuda, and the cobra capella; and any of their number who
                    inadvertently kills one of these animals is obliged to expiate his supposed
                    crime by a farcical sacrifice, in which it is pretended that a human victim is
                    immolated and brought to life again. The mummery of this mock expiation is
                    abundantly ridiculous. A little blood is drawn from a superficial wound in the
                    thigh, inflicted with a knife; the victim is then supposed to be slain, and
                    remains motionless until the farce of resuscitation is performed, when he of
                    course comes to life again. This is performed with immense ceremony, in the
                    presence of a great concourse of spectators, who are commonly feasted on the
                    fine levied from the culprit; and a similar punishment is 'sometimes inflicted
                    for other offences. The worshippers of Vishnu and Siva, though separated by a
                    very thin wall of partition, are continually at variance, each sect not only
                    striving to exalt their own divinity, but to revile that of their adversaries.
                    The former consider the wearing of the Lingam as the most heinous of all sins;
                    the latter, on the other hand, maintain that all who bear the Nama will, after
                    death, be tormented in hell with a three-pronged fork, resembling that tridental
                    mark. But these sectarian notions are less prevalent among the Brahmins than the
                    other castes. Brahmins of the Vishnu faith are only to be found in the provinces
                    situated to the south of the Krishna, and they are regarded with contempt by
                    their more tolerant brethren, who, in consequence, refuse to admit them to their
                    tables or to their ceremonies, and anxiously exclude them from any public
                    employments which happen to be at their disposal. The sects of the Nama and the
                    Lingam are further split into subdivisions, which dispute warmly on the subjects
                    of their differences, but are ever ready to unite when the general interests of
                    the order are concerned.</p>
                <p>There are four stages in the life of a Brahmin. The first commences at the age of
                    from seven to nine, when <pb break="no" facs="nls:193735364"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-5364-0177"/>. he is invested with the triple cord, which is
                    suspended ' from the left shoulder, and forms the badge of his order.</p>
                <p>The youth thus initiated is denominated Brahmachari. At this stage he is occupied
                    in learning to read and write; in committing to memory portions of the Vedas,
                    and the efficacious forms of prayer called the Mantras; and in acquiring other
                    knowledge. It is his duty to abstain from the use of betel, to put no ornaments
                    in his hair, to bathe daily, and to offer the sacrifice called Homam twice a
                    day; but subjects so young seldom observe the rules strictly. A certain
                    proficiency, indeed, is enjoined in committing to memory the sacred books; but
                    neither in this nor in the acquisitions which are deemed scientific is there
                    much emulation. They are not slack, however, in learning to understand the
                    privileges belonging to their caste, which are great and various. One of these
                    is a right to ask alms, which they do not in the style of mendicants, but in
                    that of confident yet not insolent claimants; another is, an exemption from
                    taxes of all kinds, whether general or local; and a third consists in an
                    immunity from capital, and generally from corporal punishment, however heinous
                    the crimes they may commit, imprisonment being the only penalty to which they
                    are liable. At this stage also they learn the different points of bodily purity
                    which, as good Brahmins, it is necessary for them to observe through life. These
                    are so numerous as to be excessively burdensome, and to impose on them the duty
                    of constant and jealous vigilance. Not only are they defiled by touching a dead
                    body, but even by attending a funeral. Childbirth and constitutional changes
                    render females impure; and certain ablutions and forms of prayer are necessary
                    to remove the stain. An earthen vessel, if it has been used by a profane person,
                    or applied to certain specified purposes, becomes so polluted that it cannot be
                    used again, and must be broken; but metallic vessels may be purified by washing.
                    Leather and all kinds of skins, except those of the tiger and antelope, are held
                    to be excessively impure; and the boots and gloves of Europeans are to them the
                    most disagreeable of all articles of dress. Brahmins, in walking or sitting,
                    must take care they do not touch a bone, a broken pot, a rag, or a leaf from
                    which any one has eaten; in drinking, they must pour the liquid from above,
                    without touching the vessel with their lips; and they are forbidden to touch the
                    greater part of animals, particularly the dog, which is accounted the most
                    polluting. The water which they drink must be carefully drawn, though never by a
                    Sudra; and if two Brahmins draw water together, their pitchers must not come in
                    contact, otherwise one or both must be broken. Animal food of all kinds is
                    strictly prohibited; and among the Lingam branch of the order the prohibition is
                    most rigidly observed, notwithstanding which this class or sect has always been
                    remarkable for great slovenliness in their external habits. The Brahmins are
                    also taught to entertain a horror of spiritual defilement, resulting from
                    perversity of will, or the actual commission of sin; and although the different
                    modes in which it is contracted are but obscurely indicated, the rules for
                    purification by means of ablutions, penances, and ceremonies, are very fully and
                    distinctly laid down.</p>
                <p>The second stage of a Brahmin’s life is the state of Grihastha, which takes place
                    when he is married, and has children; both these circumstances being essential
                    to its constitution. Marriage is an important object to a Brahmin, inasmuch as
                    it insures him consideration and respectability in society. Hence, when he
                    becomes a widower, he falls from his station, and is consequently under a moral
                    necessity of re-entering the married state. But the case is quite different with
                    widowed females, who are not permitted to marry a second time. The Sunnvassis,
                    however, probably in imitation of the ancient Rishis, lead lives of celibacy;
                    and the acting priests, called Gurus, also live in a state of single
                    blessedness, although their morality in this particular is sufficiently relaxed.
                    When a Brahmin, therefore, takes his wife home and has children by her, he
                    enters his second state, or that of Grihastha. His daily duties and ceremonies
                    now become more multiplied and imperative; and every act of his life must be
                    performed according to certain rules, some of them sufficiently repugnant to
                    European notions of propriety. These observances, which from their number and
                    incessant recurrence would seem burdensome and oppressive, become so habitual
                    from daily practice that they are not felt as galling or irksome. On the
                    contrary, the Brahmins perform all of them cheerfully, and no innovation is ever
                    proposed. Some Hindu writers, indeed, have turned them into ridicule, and joked
                    at the expense of a ritual which they nevertheless continued in practice to
                    observe. But, from all that we can learn, the authors who have indulged in this
                    license were never Brahmins, but generally Sudras, or men of the lowest caste,
                    who had been contaminated by association with Europeans. Vemana, Agastya,
                    Pata-natupulai, and Tiruvaluven, a Pariah, the principal scoffers, answer to
                    this description; they are all modern, and either Sudras or men of no caste
                    whatever. If any ancient authors wrote in the same strain, their names and their
                    works have equally perished. At the same time, although speculative scepticism
                    be but rarely avowed, practical transgressions are secretly indulged in,
                    especially in large towns, where concealment is easy and temptation strong.</p>
                <p>Nor is this all. Many Brahmins habitually engage in Transactions and employments
                    which appear altogether at variance with their professions and pretensions. They
                    are commonly the political functionaries or agents of the native princes, and of
                    the Mahommedan governments, which find it convenient to employ these hereditary
                    ministers of religion, from the influence they possess over the minds of the
                    people. Some of them, particularly in Gujerat, embark in commercial
                    speculations, and become merchants, bankers, or general agents. Others, again,
                    carry messages between distant places, or are sent as vakeels on difficult and
                    important missions; the veneration in which they are universally held securing
                    them from molestation in the discharge of such tasks. A third class act as
                    coolies or porters, in which character they alone are exempt from the demands of
                    the tax-gatherer. Many of them enter the Company’s native army, and often rise
                    to the rank of sub-adhar. In a word, they are as much alive to selfish
                    considerations and interests as any other tribe or caste, and ready, on all
                    occasions, to avail themselves to the uttermost of the privileges and immunities
                    belonging to their order. Their rapacity, in fact, is only exceeded by their
                    cunning; nor is there to be found in any country a set of more artful impostors.
                    The Hindus are all expert in disguising the truth; but thq Brahmins, in this
                    respect, possess an unquestioned superiority. They are supple, insinuating,
                    false; acute in discerning, and skilful in taking advantage of the foibles of
                    others; naturally vindictive and proud, yet, from habit and cunning, patient and
                    submissive; evincing on all occasions the most perfect self-command, and ever
                    ready to profit by the indiscretion, weakness, or simplicity of those with whom
                    they may have to do.- One of their prime resources is flattery, which they
                    lavish with unbounded profusion on any person whom they wish to cozen or hope to
                    conciliate; experience having convinced them, that even those who pretend to
                    repudiate their adulation nevertheless lay a portion, at least, of the grateful
                    unction to their souls. In matters of religious opinion they are upon the whole
                    tolerant; they almost never anathematize Moslemins, Christians, and others of
                    different creeds; nor <pb break="no" facs="nls:193735377"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-5377-0178"/>do they seem to be at all actuated by the fierce
                    spirit of proselytism and persecution. But this forbearance may perhaps he the
                    consequence, not of any virtue in the Brahmins, but of the low estimation in
                    which they hold the objects of their own worship; for, undoubtedly, they
                    sometimes treat the latter with an indifference bordering on contempt, and in
                    their adorations arc influenced by their secular interests rather than by the
                    spirit of devotion, flattering those divinities whose functions they connect
                    with their worldly affairs, and giving themselves no concern about the
                    others.</p>
                <p>The distance at which they keep themselves from Europeans, and the unwillingness
                    they evince to admit the latter to their temples or their ceremonies, may seem
                    inconsistent with what has just been advanced. But their conduct in this respect
                    arises solely from the unclcan-ness which they attach to our habits; and were
                    Europeans to conform a little more to their manners and practical prejudices,
                    there can be no doubt that the consequence would be a closer intimacy and
                    unbounded toleration. This was fully experienced by the Abbé Dubois, who having
                    carefully studied the manners of the Hindus, and uniformly treated their habits
                    with respect and tenderness, was often invited by the Brahmins of his
                    acquaintance to enter their temples and join in their ceremonies. Among the
                    sacerdotal order of India it is a prevalent sentiment that different religions
                    are formed for different nations, and that each serves every necessary purpose
                    to the souls of its believers and professors. But in their attachment to their
                    civil institutions the Brahmins arc less liberal and conciliating, considering
                    every thing different from these or opposed to them as the product of absolute
                    barbarism. The Moors they hate for their arrogance, and despise for their
                    ignorance of some branches of mathematical science known to themselves, such as
                    those connected with the construction and explanation of the almanack. In the
                    European masters of India, they admire their humanity in war, the moderation and
                    impartiality of their government, the general uprightness of their conduct in
                    the intercourse of life, and the benevolent generosity of their dispositions;
                    but these favourable impressions are apt to be forgotten when they think of the
                    grossness and hatefulness of their prevailing habits, such as eating animal
                    food, and admitting the detested Pariahs into their domestic service. Such
                    things are pre-eminently odious to Hindus, and both, we think, might have easily
                    been avoided. No extraordinary effort of self-denial would have been necessary
                    to enable Europeans to abstain from the use of beef, which is an insipid food in
                    India; and, with regard to the Pariahs, although it would undoubtedly be wrong
                    to countenance the Brahmins in their barbarous treatment of the inferior castes,
                    and of those who are considered as of no caste, yet regulations might have been
                    adopted by which men of high caste would have been spared the gross insults they
                    are at present exposed to, and every humane purpose at the same time
                    attained.</p>
                <p>The third state of a Brahmin is denominated Vanaprastha, or that of inhabitants
                    of the desert. The order of Brahminical anchorites prevailed at a former period,
                    but it is now scarcely to be found, and appears to be very nearly, if not
                    altogether, extinct. The members of it were usually styled Rishis, or Penitents.
                    They were honoured by kings, and respected by the gods, who, on account of the
                    odour of their sanctity, seem to have considered them as in some degree their
                    superiors. They practised self-denial according to certain rigid rules, and
                    performed peculiar sacrifices and religious observances. Their pious acts and
                    intentions were often thwarted by giants, and even by gods, who seem to have had
                    no relish for the severe discipline of the order; but in the end the Penitents
                    always prevailed, and sometimes took the gods roundly to task for their
                    misdeeds. They were the depositaries of the more sublime doctrines of theology,
                    and practised magical incantations.</p>
                <p>The fourth state of a Brahmin is called Sunnyassi, and is reckoned so
                    pre-eminently holy that, in a single generation, it imparts a greater stock of
                    merit than could be accumulated during ten thousand in any other sphere of life.
                    As a natural consequence, when a Sunnyassi dies, he is believed to pass at once
                    into the region of Brahma or Vishnu, exempt from the penalty of being re-born on
                    earth, or animating in succession different bodies, conformably to the
                    metempsychosis of the Hindu mythology. In preparation for this state, a Brahmin
                    performs all the rites of the λ <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> anaprastha, and
                    in addition renounces every worldly connection, takes up the profession of
                    mendicity, and lives solely by alms. He must previously, however, have devoted
                    several years to the married and paternal state, and thus discharged the debt
                    which he owed to his forefathers. When duly qualified and disposed for entering
                    the holy state of Sunnyassi, he is installed as such with many Mantras and other
                    ceremonies. His duties now increase in number and severity. He must every
                    morning rub his whole body over with ashes, restrict himself to one meal a day,
                    give up the use of betel, avoid looking at women, shave his beard and head every
                    month, and wear wooden clogs on his feet; in travelling, he must carry his
                    seven-knotted bamboo staff in the one hand, his gourd in the other, and the
                    antelope skin under his arm, in other words, display the three badges of his
                    order; and he must erect a hermitage on the bank of a river or a lake.
                    Contemplation, and a supposed communion with the Deity, amounting in its highest
                    form to a participation of the divine essence, constitute the ulterior duties of
                    this class of devotees. Need we wonder that, being thus privileged to indulge in
                    all manner of extravagances, and to give full swing to an excited imagination,
                    their practices should be in the highest degree preposterous, and their
                    fantasies equally wild and ridiculous? In fact, the tricks which they perform
                    are endless. The highest act of merit among them is “to subdue all sensation,
                    and retain the breath with such determined perseverance, that the soul, quitting
                    the body, bursts through the crown of the head, and flies to re-unite itself
                    with the Great Being, or Para-Brahma.” Accordingly <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi>, one of their fantastical exercises consists in suppressing their breath
                    as long as possible, till they almost swoon away, and bring on most profuse
                    perspiration. Another consists in putting themselves in the most irksome and
                    ridiculous postures, and remaining so for a considerable length of time, indeed
                    till exhaustion or decrepitude ensue. To stand on one leg till it swells and
                    ulcerates; to stand on the head till the brain becomes disordered, and delirium
                    ensues; to keep one arm extended aloft in the air till the muscles become rigid,
                    and the power of withdrawing it is lost for ever; such are among the most
                    approved practices of the Sunny <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> assis. But still
                    the most extravagant and fatal efforts of these extraordinary devotees seem to
                    have been confined to former times. We may add, that the Sunnyassis are not,
                    like the Vana-prasthas, burned when they die, but interred. This is the case
                    with the Lingamhari, or worshippers of Siva; but a Sunnyassi, even although he
                    had, during life, attached himself to the worship of ∖ <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> ishnu, is interred when dead, and the ceremony is both pompous and
                    expensive.</p>
                <p>From the classes of Vanaprastha and Sunny ’ assi have sprung numerous sects of
                    fanatics, such as the Djogis, who seek to propitiate the Deity by mutilating
                    their bodies, or braving the force of fire and the inclemency of the seasons;
                    the Panduris, who carry about small figures of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193735390" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5390-0179"/>most indecent description, as
                    provocatives to devotion; and the Vairagis, who form a kind of mixed order of
                    monks and nuns, consecrated to the god Krishna and his mistress Rada, whose
                    history they celebrate in songs, accompanied with the tinkling of cymbals. It is
                    also said that some of the Brahmins, under the denominations of Pa-shandia and
                    Sarwagina, maintain libertine and atheistical opinions; and it is probable that
                    the number of those who secretly cherish such sentiments is much greater than
                    that of the class or sect which openly avows them. Superstition, when sustained
                    neither by fanaticism nor enthusiasm, is the natural parent of that infidelity
                    by which it is ultimately undermined.</p>
                <p>From what has been stated in the course of this exposition, some idea may be
                    formed of the general character of the sacerdotal caste in India. According to
                    the best authorities on the subject, the number of Brahmins who are respectable
                    for their knowledge and their virtue is exceedingly small; whilst the great
                    majority of these hereditary priests is completely devoted to ambition,
                    intrigue, and voluptuousness, and disgraced by an avarice, a meanness, and a
                    cruelty, which inspire strangers with no sentiments towards them but those of
                    contempt and aversion. The charity which they place so high in the scale of
                    duties and virtues, being equally confined by the law of caste, and the
                    operation of that intense selfishness by which the whole tribe is characterised,
                    has no human beings except Brahmins for its objects. Towards the other castes
                    they cherish no feeling of humanity, and cautiously abstain from any
                    reciprocation of kindness; they exact every thing in virtue of their rank,
                    functions, and pretended sanctity, but take care to give nothing in return.
                    Instead of the retired and contemplative life which appears to have been
                    observed by the order in ancient times, and to which they still profess to
                    devote themselves, they are immersed, as we have already seen, in pursuits the
                    most foreign to and inconsistent with the duties and character of a priesthood;
                    and, accordingly, they have declined alike in dignity, in reputation, and in
                    knowledge. Yet their influence as a body still remains unshaken; neither the
                    violence of conquest, nor the shock of revolution, nor even the power of time
                    itself, appears to have sensibly impaired their dominion over the minds of the
                    other castes. The institutions to which they owe their ascendancy, and by which
                    it will in all probability be maintained for ages yet to come, have struck their
                    roots so deeply, and become so intimately identified with the genius, character,
                    habits, sentiments, feelings, prejudices, and daily usages of the people, as to
                    resist the operation of all those natural, moral, and political causes which
                    bring about changes in other countries, and, amidst all the evils incident to
                    convulsions and innovations, ultimately contribute to the general advancement.
                    In India, society appears to have been arrested at a particular stage of its
                    natural progress, and re-constituted so as never to exceed the limit which it
                    had attained before its onward tendencies were paralyzed, and the characteristic
                    of immutability firmly established. Hence it may be considered as forming what
                    the schoolmen would probably have denominated a political <hi rend="italic">nunc
                    stans;</hi> as standing to other communities of men in nearly the same relation
                    that eternity bears to time: and hence, also, the permanency of an influence
                    which the possessors of it take no means to extend or improve, in the conviction
                    that it can never be materially abridged.</p>
                <p>1he authenticity as well as the antiquity of the sacred books of the Brahmins has
                    been alternately asserted and denied, with equal zeal and pertinacity. Without
                    entering into this question, however, it may be satisfactory to show of what
                    materials these writings really consist; for if they are utterly worthless and
                    contemptible in themselves, as indeed seems to be the case, it matters but
                    little to inquire whether they be genuine or spurious, of ancient or
                    comparatively modern origin. And, on this subject, we prefer citing authorities
                    to delivering any opinion of our own. “The sacred writings of the Brahmins,”
                    says an able writer in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> “have been
                    long mentioned with those phrases of solemn wonder, which would still have
                    misled the public, if the translations and extracts of them which have
                    successively appeared had not discovered their puerility and imposture. It is
                    therefore important that the Sanscrit books, which have been held up as so
                    sacred and so ancient, and which some of our learned Orientalists obviously
                    prefer to the Jewish historian, should be given to Europe in the languages
                    familiar to every one; that we may not be blinded by the erroneous admiration of
                    credulous and misjudging enthusiasts, but be enabled to criticise fairly, and
                    judge impartially for ourselves.” (Vol. ii. p. 68.) Mr Mill, speaking of
                    Sanscrit poetry generally, pronounces a judgment still stronger than that
                    delivered by the Reviewer. “These fictions,” says he, “are not only more
                    extravagant and unnatural, less correspondent with the physical and moral laws
                    of the universe, but are less ingenious, more monstrous, and have less of any
                    thing that can engage the affection, awaken sympathy, or excite admiration,
                    reverence, or terror, than the poems of any other, even the rudest people, with
                    whom our knowledge of the globe has yet brought us acquainted. They are
                    excessively prolix and insipid. They are often, through long passages, trifling
                    and childish to a degree which those acquainted with only European poetry can
                    hardly conceive. Of the style in which they are composed, it is far from too
                    much to say, that all the vices which characterise the style of rude nations,
                    and particularly those of Asia, they exhibit in perfection. Inflation, metaphors
                    perpetual, and those the most violent and strained, often the most unnatural and
                    ridiculous, obscurity, tautology, repetition, verbosity, confusion, incoherence,
                    distinguish the Mahabharat and Ramayan.” <hi rend="italic">{History of British
                    India,</hi> vol. ii. p. 46.) The following passage, extracted from a most
                    masterly article which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgli. Review</hi>
                    (vol. xv. p. 175), is, if possible, still more to our present purpose. “It may
                    be said,” the Reviewer observes, “that in a country of which the actual
                    condition is so imperfectly known, investigation should first be directed to the
                    existing state of society, which admits of being accurately ascertained, and may
                    lead to practical conclusions highly beneficial to the community, before we
                    attempt to explore the obscure paths of remote antiquity, by the feeble lights
                    afforded by a few mutilated or suspicious documents. The Indian nations, it may
                    be contended, have no claim to any extraordinary attention, either from the
                    philosopher or the historian: their boasted civilization has rather been
                    asserted than proved; neither their literature nor their arts indicate any
                    considerable progress in the pursuits which refine and adorn mankind; and some
                    of their customs betray a ferocity scarcely to be found amongst the most savage
                    nations. But, even admitting that it would be desirable to trace the remote
                    revolutions which this people have undergone, the little probability of
                    attaining any deductions which may be relied on with confidence ought to induce
                    us to relinquish so hopeless a task. The Puranas appear to be extravagant
                    romances, which, however amusing as poetical compositions, can furnish no
                    additions to authentic history, whatever portion of it they may be supposed
                    incidentally to contain. When we find gods and heroes mingling in doubtful
                    fight; events natural and supernatural succeeding each other indifferently; a
                    fact probably historical, followed by another evidently allegorical; the only
                    rational conclusion is to consider the whole of these poems <pb break="no"

                    to appreciate their merits by the rules applicable to similar compositions
                    amongst other nations. But if such be the judgment we must pass on the Puranas,
                    the Hindu compositions of a later date are not better entitled to attention,
                    unless with respect to poetical excellence: and it probably may be affirmed that
                    the Hindus cannot produce a single historical composition; whilst the
                    Mahommedans of the same country have amply, and even ably, illustrated all the
                    events subsequent to their entrance into Hindustan.”</p>
                <p>Such are the judgments which have been pronounced by some of the ablest writers
                    of our time, respecting the sacred writings of the Brahmins, and the
                    impossibility of deducing any sound or rational conclusions from these fanciful
                    and extravagant compositions. But, on the other hand, it has been contended,
                    with much plausibility and some degree of justice, that an indiscriminate
                    accumulation of facts is no object with the philosopher, and only a subordinate
                    one with the historian; that in proportion to the peculiarity and reputed
                    antiquity of the religious and civil institutions subsisting amongst any people,
                    it is natural to feel curiosity as to their origin; that the minute
                    peculiarities which discriminate the nations of Europe scarcely produce any
                    sensible modification of character, or exhibit to our observation any beings
                    whose manner of thinking and acting is materially different from our own; that,
                    in order accurately to appreciate the efficacy of religious dogmas and civil
                    institutions in modifying the character of a people, our observation should be
                    particularly directed to those nations which, in these respects, differ most
                    widely from ourselves; that to this source may be traced much of the instruction
                    as well as amusement derived from a perusal of the classic compositions of
                    antiquity; that, from the same cause, the manners of savage tribes have
                    attracted and deserved the attention of the philosopher, although these are in
                    general extremely uniform, and little modified by any other circumstance than
                    the greater or less facility of obtaining food; that, nevertheless, it is not
                    amidst a people in such a stage of society that the influence of moral
                    impressions can be accurately ascertained; that a nation must have advanced some
                    steps in civilization, must have cultivated the arts, and been tinged with
                    science, before it becomes susceptible of that indelible stamp which defies the
                    efforts of time; and that if, upon these grounds, the peculiarities of the Hindu
                    institutions, opinions, and manners, deservedly render them the object of
                    philosophic research, the gradations by which such a state of society was
                    attained must be highly interesting, and can only be discovered through the
                    medium of such literary monuments as are still extant among them. Their sacred
                    books, therefore, must ever possess a value, independent of all that may be said
                    of their contents, or objected to the antiquity claimed for them. They embody
                    evidence of the existence of peculiar modes of thinking, and forms of belief, as
                    well as of the effects produced by peculiar institutions, civil and religious;
                    and, as such, they can never cease to be regarded with interest, both by the
                    philosopher and the historian.</p>
                <p>Of ancient Brahminical science the principal remains are their astronomical
                    tables and trigonometrical methods, both of which have given occasion to
                    frequent and learned discussion in this and other countries of Europe. At
                    present, however, we can only refer the reader to the works of Bailly, Playfair,
                    and Delambre, in which he will find the subject treated with equal learning,
                    ingenuity, and scientific precision, though in opposite views, and with very
                    different aims. As to the science of the modern Brahmins, it seems, as we have
                    already remarked, to be confined to the construction and explanation of the
                    almanack; and even this scanty amount of knowledge is the portion of but few of
                    their number. They have indeed fallen from the proud eminence which was occupied
                    by their order when the sages of Greece travelled into India to learn wisdom in
                    that great storehouse of knowledge, and afterwards to carry it back to their own
                    country, inorder to plant there the first seeds of civilization. But there is
                    one species of learning for which they have always evinced a singular aptitude
                    and inclination; we mean metaphysical speculation, which possesses many
                    attractions to men remarkable alike for the indolence of their habits and the
                    extreme subtilty of their genius. In this department of research they had
                    accordingly explored the whole cycle of systems, distinctions, classifications,
                    refinements, and doubts, long before the western world had emerged from primeval
                    barbarism; and in India the human mind had exhausted itself in endeavouring to
                    detect the laws which regulate its own operations, when the philosophers of
                    Greece were only beginning to enter within the precincts of metaphysical
                    inquiry. Nor is it by any means certain that the latter are entitled to the
                    credit they have received on the score of originality; that they did not borrow
                    rather then invent; and that to the Gymnosophists of India belongs the honour of
                    framing those systems which have been, perhaps too hastily, attributed to their
                    disciples. It is even doubtful whether Aristotle himself did not derive both the
                    materials and the arrangement of his system of logic from the same source. In a
                    Mahommedan history, quoted by Sir William Jones, it is expressly mentioned that
                    Callisthenes, having procured a regular treatise on logic, somewhere in the
                    Punjab, transmitted it to Aristotle; and although this doesnot certainly prove
                    that the Greek philosopher adopted as his own the system which had been sent him
                    by his pupil, it at least warrants a conjecture that he might have done so; more
                    especially as the syllogistic method was undoubtedly known in India long before
                    his time, and as the fact must have been discovered by the numerous learned and
                    accomplished men who accompanied Alexander’s expedition. But be this as it may,
                    one thing is pretty certain, that there is scarcely a hypothesis advanced by
                    metaphysicians in ancient or modern times, which may not be found in some of the
                    Brahminical writings. In these we meet with materialism, atomism, pantheism,
                    Pyrrhonism, idealism, and every other fanciful variety of opinion which has yet
                    been imagined or promulgated respecting God, the world, and the human soul. The
                    Brahmins could boast of their Spinozas, their Berkeleys, and their Humes, long
                    before Alexander dreamt of passing the Indus, and erecting a throne on the banks
                    of the sacred stream. That Pythagoras borrowed from them the greater part of his
                    mystical philosophy, his notions respecting the properties of numbers as
                    expressive of physical laws, his doctrine of the transmigration of souls, and
                    the arguments by which he inculcated the unlawfulness of eating animal food,
                    seems to admit of no doubt whatever; for all these thingsareof the very essence
                    of Brahminism, and are to this hour taught and enforced by the sacred order in
                    India.</p>
                <p>Egypt and India, as we have already observed, are the only two countries in which
                    the institution of castes has obtained in its most rigid form. This identity is
                    of itself sufficiently remarkable; but there are other points of resemblance
                    which we think even more striking. In ancient Egypt the cow was a principal
                    object of religious adoration, and as such accounted peculiarly sacred; and we
                    need scarcely add that, in India, the same superstition has prevailed to an
                    equal, if not greater extent, ever since the introduction of the Brahminical
                    religion. The Egyptians worshipped Apis or the sacred bull, and the figure of
                    this animal formspart of every hieroglyphical inscription, either as a symbol or
                    a phonetical character. In some of their festivals the Brahmins exhibit the same
                    species of idolatry.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193735416" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5416-0181"/>
                <p>with rites and observances exactly similar to those anciently practised in the
                    country of the Pharaohs; and, judging by the inscriptions on their monuments,
                    this type of animal worship must have prevailed in India from the earliest
                    times. The astronomical character of the Egyptian mythology is well known to
                    those who have studied its details; it seems to have been merely a reflex image
                    of Tsabaism, or the worship of the host of heaven, the form of idolatry which
                    first obtained among “the world’s gray fathers” in the regions of the East. But
                    the same thing, in the same sense, may be predicated of the Hindu mythology, in
                    its purest form, before it was overlaid with the monstrous and fantastical
                    inventions of a juggling priesthood. What inference, then, ought we to deduce
                    from these and numerous other facts of a similar description which might be
                    mentioned? Did Egypt derive its superstitions from India, or has India borrowed
                    its mythology from Egypt, or have both drawn from a common source? Which is the
                    original and which the copy, or are both merely copies from an original no
                    longer extant? These are questions to which, in the present state of our
                    knowledge, it is difficult, if not impossible, to give a satisfactory answer;
                    although speculation has been busy on the subject, some contending in favour of
                    Egypt, others in favour of India, and others, again, seeking a common source in
                    that intermediate region, which formed as it were the cradle of the human race.
                    We have no intention whatever to enter into these disputations, or to hazard
                    conjectures respecting a subject in regard to which no safe or certain data have
                    as yet been obtained. We may nevertheless be permitted to observe, that the
                    question is chiefly one of pure chronology; that on this subject much still
                    remains to be done before we can arrive at any well-founded conclusion
                    respecting the comparative antiquity of these ancient nations; but that, in as
                    far as we are at present able to see our way, the balance of probability appears
                    to incline pretty decidedly in favour of the country of the Pharaohs.</p>
