                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    rend="italic">John,</hi> one of the translators of the Bible in the reign of
                    James I. was son of William Bois, rector of West Stowe, near St Edmundsbury,
                    Suffolk, and born at Nettlestead in Suffolk on the 3d of January 1560. He was
                    taught the first rudiments of learning by his father; and his capacity was such,
                    that at the age of five li£ was able, it is said, to read the Bible in Hebrew.
                    He went afterwards to Hadley school; and at fourteen was admitted of St John’s
                    College, Cambridge, where he distinguished himself by his skill in Greek.
                    Happening to catch the small-pox when he was elected fellow, he caused himself
                    to be carried for admission in blankets, in order to preserve his seniority. He
                    applied himself for some time to the study of medicine; but, fancying himself
                    affected with every disease he read of, he quitted that science. He was during
                    ten years principal Greek lecturer in his college, and read every day. He
                    voluntarily read a Greek lecture for some years at four in the morning, in his
                    own chamber, which was frequented by many of the fellows. On the death of his
                    father, he succeeded to the rectory of West Stowe. At the age of thirty-six he
                    married the daughter of Mr Holt, rector of Buxworth, in Cambridge-shire, whom he
                    succeeded in that living in October 1596. On his quitting the university, the
                    college gave him L.100. But his young wife, who had been bequeathed to him with
                    the living, which was an advowson, having proved a bad economist, and he himself
                    being wholly addicted to his studies, he soon became so much involved in debt
                    that he was obliged to sell his choice collection of books, consisting of almost
                    every Greek author then extant. When a new translation of the Bible was directed
                    to be made, Mr Bois was elected one of the Cambridge translators. He performed
                    not only his own, but also the part assigned to another, with great reputation.
                    He was also one of the six who had met at Stationers’ Hall to revise the whole;
                    which task they performed in nine months, having each, from the company of
                    stationers, during that time, thirty shillings a week. He afterwards assisted
                    Sir Henry Savile in publishing the works of St Crysostom. In 1615 Dr Lancelot
                    Andrews, bishop of Ely, bestowed on him, unasked, the prebend in his church. He
                    died on the 14th of January 1643, in the eighty-fourth year of his age, and left
                    a great many manuscripts behind him, particularly a Commentary on almost all the
                    books of the New Testament. When Bois was a young student at Cambridge, he
                    received from the learned Dr Whitaker three rules for avoiding those distempers
                    which usually attend a sedentary life, to which he adhered with equal constancy
                    and success. The first was, To study always standing; the second, Never to study
                    in a window; and the third, Never to go to bed with his feet cold.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Boyse,</hi><hi rend="italic">Samuel,</hi> a man remarkable
                    for the fineness of his genius, the lowness of his manners, and the wretchedness
                    of his life. He was born in 1708, and received the rudiments of his education at
                    a private school in Dublin. When he was but eighteen years old, his father, a
                    non-conformist clergyman, sent him to the university of Glasgow, that he might
                    finish his education there. But he had not been a year at the university, when
                    he fell in love with the daughter of a tradesman in that city, and was imprudent
                    enough to interrupt his education by marrying her before he had entered into his
                    twentieth year. The natural extravagance of his temper soon exposed him to want;
                    and as he had now the additional charge of a wife, his reduced circumstances
                    obliged him to quit the university, and go over with his wife (who also carried
                    a sister along with her) to Dublin, where they relied on the old clergyman for
                    support. Young Boyse was of all men the farthest removed from the character of
                    gentleman. He had no graces of person, and still fewer of manners or
                    conversation. Never were three people of more libertine habits than young Boyse,
                    his wife, and his sister-in-law; yet the two women wore such amaskof decency
                    before the old non-conformist gentleman, that his fondness was never abated. The
                    estate which he possessed in Yorkshire was sold to discharge his son’s debts;
                    and his means were utterly wasted, so that, when seized with his last sickness,
                    he was entirely supported by presents from his congregation, and at length
                    buried at their expense. We have no further account of Boyse till we find him
                    soon after his father’s death at Edinburgh. At this place his poetical genius
                    raised him many friends, and some patrons of eminence. He published a volume of
                    poems in 1731, to which are subjoined 7‰ <hi rend="italic">Tablature of
                    Cebes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A Letter upon Liberty,</hi> inserted in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dublin Journal,</hi> 1726, by which he obtained considerable
                    reputation. These poems arc addressed to the Countess of Eglintoun. This amiable
                    lady was the patroness of all men of wit, and greatly distinguished Boyse <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193735260" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5260-0169"/> while he resided
                    in Scotland. Upon the death of the Viscountess Stormont, Boyse wrote an elegy,
                    which was much applauded by her ladyship’s relations. This elegy he entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Tears of the Muses,</hi> as the deceased lady was a woman of
                    the most refined taste in the sciences, and a great admirer of poetry. The Lord
                    Stormont was so much pleased with this mark of attention paid to the memory of
                    his lady, that he ordered a handsome present to be o∙iven to Boyse by his
                    attorney at Edinburgh. The notice which Lady Eglintoun and the Lord Stormont
                    took of our poet recommended him likewise to the patronage of the Duchess of
                    Gordon, who was so solicitous to raise him above necessity, that she employed
                    her interest in procuring the promise of a place for him. She gave him a letter,
                    which he was next day to deliver to one of the commissioners of the customs at
                    Edinburgh. But it happened that he was then some miles distant from the city;
                    and th&lt; ’)t the morning on which he was to have proceeded to town with her
                    Grace’s letter of recommendation proved rainy. This slender circumstance was
                    enough to discourage Boyse, who never looked beyond the present moment. He
                    declined going to town on account of the rainy weather; and thus letting slip
                    the opportunity, the place was bestowed upon another, which the commissioner
                    declared he kept for some time vacant in expectation of seeing a person
                    recommended by the Duchess of Gordon. Having defeated all the kind intentions of
                    his patrons towards him, Boyse at last fell into contempt and poverty, which
                    obliged him to quit Edinburgh. He cointnunicated his design of going to London
                    to the Duchess of Gordon, who, having still a high opinion of his poetical
                    abilities, gave him a letter of recommendation to Mr Pope, and obtained another
                    for him to Sir Peter King, the lord chancellor of England. Lord Stormont
                    recommended him to the solicitor general his brother, and many other persons of
                    the first fashion. Upon receiving these letters he quitted Edinburgh with great
                    caution, despised by all, and regretted by none but his creditors. Upon his
                    arrival in London, he went to Twickenham in order to deliver the Duchess of
                    Gordon’s letter to Mr Pope; but that gentleman not being at home, Mr Boyse never
                    gave himself the trouble to repeat his visit. He wrote poems; but these, though
                    possessing some intrinsic merit, were lost to the world, by being introduced
                    with no advantage. He had so great a propensity to low company, that his
                    acquaintance were generally of such a cast as could be of no service to him; and
                    those in higher life he addressed by letters, not having sufficient breeding or
                    common good manners to converse familiarly with them. Thus unfit to support
                    himself in the world, he was exposed to a variety of distresses, from which he
                    could invent no means of extricating himself except by writing mendicant
                    letters. Yet this man, of so abject a spirit, was voluptuous and luxurious; he
                    had no taste for any thing elegant, but was to the last degree expensive. Often
                    when he had received a guinea in consequence of a supplicating letter, he would
                    go into a tavern, order a supper to be prepared, drink of the richest wines, and
                    spend all the money that had just been given him in charity, without having any
                    one to participate the regale with him, and whilst his wife and child were
                    starving at home.</p>
                <p>About the year 1740, Boyse, reduced to the last extremity of human wretchedness,
                    had not a shirt, a coat, nor any kind of apparel, to put on; the sheets in which
                    he lay were carried to the pawn-broker’s, and he was obliged to be confined to
                    his bed with no other covering than a blanket. He had little support except what
                    he got by writing letters in the most abject style; and he remained for six
                    weeks in the situation we have described. During this time he had some
                    employment in writing verses for the Magazines. PIe sat up in bed with the
                    blanket wrapt about him, through which he had cut a hole large enough to admit
                    his arm, and placing the paper upon his knee, scribbled in the best manner lie
                    could the verses he was obliged to write; whatever he got by these, or by
                    begging letters, being barely sufficient for the preservation of life. And
                    perhaps he would have remained much longer in this distressful condition, had
                    not a compassionate gentleman, upon hearing the circumstance related, ordered
                    his clothes to be taken out of pawn, and enabled him to appear abroad again.</p>
                <p>About the year 1745 Boyse’s wife died. He was then at Reading, and pretended much
                    concern when he heard of her death. His business at Reading was to compile a
                    review of the most material transactions at home and abroad during the war; and
                    in this he has included a short account of the rebellion. Upon his return from
                    Reading, his behaviour was more decent than it had ever been before; and hopes
                    were entertained that a reformation, though late, might be wrought upon him. He
                    was employed by a bookseller to translate <hi rend="italic">Fenelon on the
                    Existence of a God;</hi> and during the time he was occupied in this he married
                    a second wife, a woman in low circumstances, but well enough suited to his
                    taste. He now began to live with more regard to character, and supported a
                    better appearance than usual; but whilst his circumstances were mending, and his
                    irregular appetites losing their hold, his health visibly declined. While
                    suffering from a lingering illness, he had the satisfaction to observe a poem of
                    his, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Deity,</hi> recommended by two writers of
                    very opposite principles and talents, Mr Fielding the novellist, and the
                    Reverend James Harvey, author of <hi rend="italic">The Meditations.</hi></p>
                <p>Boyse’s mind was often religiously disposed; he frequently talked upon this
                    subject, and probably suffered a great deal from remorse of conscience. The
                    early impressions of his education were never entirely obliterated; and his
                    whole life was a continued struggle between his reason and his passions, as he
                    was always violating the dictates of the one, while he fell under the dominion
                    of the other. It was in consequence of this war in his mind that he wrote his
                    poem entitled <hi rend="italic">The Recantation.</hi> In May 1749 he died in
                    obscure lodgings near Shoe-lane, under the influence, it is believed, of
                    sentiments very different from those in which he had spent the greater part of
                    his life. An old acquaintance of his endeavoured to collect money to defray the
                    expenses of his funeral, and spare his remains the dishonour of being buried by
                    the parish; but his efforts were vain, and the corpse of this son of the Muses
                    was, with very little ceremony, hurried away by the parish-officers.</p>
                <p>Never was a life spent with less grace than that of Boyse, and never were good
                    abilities given to less purpose. His genius was not confined to poetry alone. He
                    had a taste for painting, music, and heraldry; with the last of which he was
                    very well acquainted. His poetical pieces, if collected, would form six moderate
                    volumes. Many of them are scattered in <hi rend="italic">The Gentleman s
                    Magazine,</hi> marked with the letter <hi rend="italic">Y,</hi> and the
                    signature <hi rend="italic">Akens.</hi> Two volumes were published in London.
                    Anode of his in the manner of Spenser, entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Olive,</hi> was addressed to Sir Robert Walpole, which procured him a present of
                    ten guineas. He translated a poem from the High Dutch of Van Haren, in praise of
                    peace, upon the conclusion of that of Aix-la-Chapelle; but the poem which
                    procured him the greatest reputation was that upon the attributes of the Deity.
                    He was employed by Mr Ogle to translate some of Chaucer’s tales into modern
                    English, which he executed with great spirit, and received at the rate of
                    threepence a line for his, trouble. Mr Ogle published a <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">Canterbury Tales modernized',</hi> and Boyse’s name is put to such
                    tales as were done by him. In 1743 Boyse published, without his name, an ode on
                    the battle of Dettingen, entitled <hi rend="italic">Albion’s Triumph.</hi></p>
