                <p><label type="entry">BRAHE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Tycho</hi></label>, a celebrated
                    astronomer, descended of an illustrious family, originally of Sweden, but
                    settled in Denmark, was born on the 14th December 1546, at Knudstorp, in the
                    county of Schonen. He was taught Latin when seven years old, and studied five
                    years under private tutors. His father dying, his uncle sent him, in April 1559,
                    to study philosophy and rhetoric at Copenhagen. The great eclipse of the sun, on
                    the 21st of August Í560, happening at the precise time the astronomers had
                    foretold, he began to look upon astronomy as something divine, and purchasing
                    the Ephemerides of Stadius, gained some notion of the theory of the planets. In
                    1562 he was sent by his uncle to Leipsic to study law; but astronomy wholly
                    engrossed his thoughts, and he employed all his pocket-money in purchasing books
                    on that science. Having procured a small celestial globe, he used to wait till
                    his tutor went to bed, in order to examine the constellations and leârn their
                    names; and when the sky was clear, he spent whole nights in viewing the stars.
                    In 1565 a difference arising between Brahe and a Danish nobleman, they fought,
                    and the former had part of his nose cut off, which defect he so artfully
                    supplied with one made of gold and silver, that it was scarcely perceptible. It
                    was about this time that he began to apply to chemistry, proposing nothing less
                    than the discovery of the philosopher’s stone. In 1571 he returned to Denmark,
                    and was favoured by his maternal uncle Steno Belle, a lover of learning, with a
                    convenient place at his castle of Herritzvad, near Knudstorp, for making his
                    observations, and building a laboratory. But having married a country girl
                    beneath his rank, this occasioned such a violent quarrel between him and his
                    relations, that the king was obliged to interpose in order to reconcile them. In
                    1574, by his majesty’s command, he read lectures upon the theory of comets at
                    Copenhagen; and the year following he began his travels through Germany, and
                    proceeded as far as Venice. He then resolved to remove his family, and settle at
                    Basel; but Frederick II. king of Denmark being informed of his design, and
                    unwilling to lose a man who was capable of proving such an ornament to his
                    country, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193735338" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5338-0175"
                    />promised to enable him to pursue his studies, to bestow ' upon him for life
                    the island of Huen in the Sound, to erect an observatory and laboratory there,
                    and to defray all the expenses necessary for carrying on his designs. Tyeho
                    Brahe readily embraced this proposal; and accordingly the first stone of the
                    observatory was laid on the 8th of August 1576. The king also gave him a pension
                    of two thousand crowns out of the treasury, a fee in Norway, and the canonry of
                    Roschild, which brought him in a thousand more. James VI. of Scotland,
                    afterwards raised to the crown of England, going to Denmark in order to marry
                    the Princess Anne, paid a visit to our author in his retirement at Uranienburg,
                    made him several presents, and with his own hand wrote a copy of verses in his
                    praise; but soon after the death of King Frederick he was deprived of his
                    pension, fee, and canonry; upon which, finding himself incapable of bearing the
                    expenses of his observatory, he went to Copenhagen, whither he brought some of
                    his instruments, and continued his astronomical observations in that city, till
                    Valkendorf, chamberlain to the household of Christian IV., by the king’s order,
                    commanded him to discontinue them. He then removed his family to Rostock, and
                    afterwards to Holstein, in order to solicit Henry Ranzou to introduce him to the
                    emperor; and that gentleman complying with his request, he was received by the
                    emperor at Prague with the utmost civi-lity and respect. That prince gave him a
                    magnificent house till he could procure one for him better fitted for
                    astronomical observations; assigned him a pension of three thousand crowns; and
                    promised, upon the first opportunity, a fee for him and his descendants. But he
                    did not long enjoy his good fortune; for, on the 24th of Oetober 1601, he died
                    of a retention of urine, in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and was interred in
                    a very magnificent manner in the principal church at Prague, where a noble
                    monument was erected to his memory. His skill in astronomy is universally known,
                    and he is famed as the inventor of a new system, which he endeavoured, though
                    without success, to establish upon the ruins of that of Copernicus. He was
                    verycredulous with regard to judicial astrology and presages. If he met an old
                    woman when he went out of doors, or a hare upon the road in a journey, he used
                    to turn back immediately, persuaded that it was a bad omen. When he lived at
                    Uranienburg, he had in his house a madman, whom he placed at his feet at table,
                    and fed with his own hands. As he imagined that every thing spoken by mad
                    persons presaged something, he carefully observed all that this man said; and
                    because it sometimes proved true, he imagined it might always be depended on. A
                    mere trifle put him in a passion; and against persons of the first rank, with
                    whom it was his duty to keep on good terms, he openly discovered his resentment.
                    He was very apt to rally others, but highly provoked if the same liberty was
                    taken with himself. His principal works are, 1. <hi rend="italic">Progymnasmata

                    His observations were collected by his disciples, and published in 1666 in <hi

                <p>It was the friendship of Tyeho which formed Kepler, and directed him in the
                    career of astronomy. Without this friendship, and without the numerous
                    observations of Tycho, of which Kepler found himself the depositary alter the
                    death of his master, he would never have been able to discover those great laws
                    of the system of the world which have been called Kepler’s laws, and which,
                    combined with the theory of central forces discovered by</p>
                <p>Huygens, conducted Newton to the grandest discovery which has ever been made in
                    the sciences, namely, that of universal gravitation.</p>
