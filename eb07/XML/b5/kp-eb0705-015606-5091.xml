                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BOWYER, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, the most
                    learned printer of his age, was born at Whitefriars, in London, on the 17th
                    December 1699. His father, whose name was also William, had been eminent in the
                    same profession; and his maternal grandfather, Icabod Dawks, was employed in
                    printing the celebrated Polyglot Bible of Bishop Walton. At a proper age he was
                    placed for grammatical education under the care of Mr Ambrose Bonwicke, a
                    nonjuring clergyman of piety and learning, who then lived at Headly, near
                    Leatherhead, in Surrey. Here Mr Bowyer m∑ιde great progress in literature, and a
                    firm attachment commenced betwixt him and his master. On the 30th of January
                    1713 the whole property of the elder Mr Bowyer was destroyed by fire, on which
                    occasion Mr Bonwicke generously undertook the education of his pupil for a year.
                    In 1716 young Mr Bowyer was admitted a sizar at St John’s College, Cambridge,
                    where Dr Robert Jenkin was at that time master. He continued at the college
                    under the tuition of the reverend Dr John Newcombe till June 1722, during which
                    period he probably took his degree of bachelor of arts; and he appears to have
                    been desirous of obtaining a fellowship, though it is not certain that he ever
                    stood a candidate for that honour. Soon after this he had an opportunity of
                    repaying the kindness which Mr Bonwicke had shown him, by officiating some time
                    after his death in the capacity of schoolmaster for the benefit of his
                    family.</p>
                <p>Mr Bowyer now entered into the printing business along with his father. One of
                    the first books which received the benefit of his correction was the complete
                    edition of Selden, in three volumes folio, by Dr David Wilkins. This edition was
                    begun in 1722, and finished in</p>
                <p>1726; and Mr Bowyer’s great attention to it appeared in his drawing up an epitome
                    of Selden <hi rend="italic">de Synedriis,</hi> as he read the proof sheets. In
                    1727 he drew up an excellent sketch of William Baxter’s Glossary of Roman
                    Antiquities, called “A view of a book entitled <hi rend="italic">Peliquice
                    Baxtxrianae,</hi> in a letter to a friend.” By this first public proof of Mr
                    Bowyer’s abilities, Dr Wotton and Mr Clarke were highly pleased; but as it was
                    never published, and a very few copies printed, it is seldom found with the
                    glossary. In</p>
                <p>1727 Mr Bowyer lost his mother. In October 1728 he married Miss Ann Prudom, his
                    mother’s niece, a very accomplished lady, by whom he had two sons, William and
                    Thomas; the former of whom died in nonage, and the latter survived his father.
                    In 1729 Mr Bowyer published a treatise, entitled “A Pattern for young Students
                    in the University, set forth in the Life of Ambrose Bonwicke, some time scholar
                    of St John’s College, Cambridge;” but although this treatise was generally
                    ascribed to Mr Bowyer, it was in reality the production of Mr Ambrose Bonwicke
                    the elder. About this time Mr Bowyer appears to have written a pamphlet against
                    the Separatists, though neither the title nor the occasion of itare now
                    remembered. The same year, through the friendship of the Right Honourable Arthur
                    Onslow, he was appointed printer of the votes of the House of Commons; which
                    office he held under three successive· Speakers for near fifty years. In 1731 Mr
                    Bowyer published, and, it is believed, translated, Voltaire’s Life of Charles
                    XII. This year also his wife died. He remained a widower till 1747, when he
                    married a very benevolent and worthy woman, Mrs Elizabeth Bill, by whom he had
                    no children. In 1733 he published a piece in two sheets 4to, entitled “The Beau
                    and the Academic,” being a translation from a Latin poem recited that year at
                    the Sheldonian theatre; and in 1736 he was admitted into the Society of
                    Antiquaries, where he became an active and useful member. In 1737 Mr Bowyer lost
                    his father. In 1742 he published a translation of Trapps Latin Lectures on
                    Poetry, in which he was assisted by Mr Clarke, though the latter had a
                    contemptible opinion of the performance.</p>
                <p>In 1749 Mr Bowyer, along with Dr Burton, was virulently attacked by Dr King, in a
                    piece entitled <hi rend="italic">Elogmnι famoe inserviens Jacci Etonensis sive
                    Gigantis,</hi> or the praises of Jack Eaton, commonly called Jack the Giant.
                    This abuse was probably occasioned by Mr Bowyer’s having hinted in conversation
                    some doubts concerning the doctor’s skill in Latin. He, however, drew up some
                    strictures in his own defence, which he intended to insert at the end of a
                    preface to Montesquieu’s Reflections; but by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193735104"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-5104-0157"/>Mr Clarke’s advice they were omitted. In 1750 a
                    prefatory critical dissertation and some notes were annexed by our author to
                    Kuster’s Treatise <hi rend="italic">De usu Verborum mediorum;</hi> a new edition
                    of which, with further improvements, appeared in 1773. He likewise wrote, about
                    the same time, a Latin preface to Leede’s <hi rend="italic">Veteres Poetae
                    citatì.</hi> Being soon after employed to print an edition of Colonel Bladen’s
                    translation of Caesar’s Commentaries, that work received considerable
                    improvements from Mr Bowyer’s hands, with the addition of notes signed <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Typogr.</hi> In the subsequent editions of this work, though
                    printed by another person during Mr Bowyer’s lifetime, the same signature was
                    unjustly retained. In 1751 he wrote a long preface to Montesquieu’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Reflections on the Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire;</hi>
                    translated the dialogue between Sylla and Socrates; and made several corrections
                    on the work from the Baron’s <hi rend="italic">Spirit of Laws,</hi> improving it
                    with notes of his own. A new edition, with many new notes, was printed in 1759.
                    In 1751 he also published a translation of Rousseau’s paradoxical oration, which
                    gained the prize at the academy of Dijon in 1750, and first announced that
                    singular genius to the attention and admiration of Europe. On the publication of
                    the third edition of Lord Orrery’s <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the Life and
                    Writings of Dr Swift,</hi> in 1752, Mr Bowyer wrote and printed, but never
                    published, “Two Letters from Dr Bentley in the Shades below, to Lord Orrery in a
                    Land of Thick Darkness.” The notes signed B, in the ninth quarto volume of
                    Swift’s works, are extracted from these letters. In 1753 he endeavoured to allay
                    the ferment occasioned by the Jews’ Bill; and with this view he published, in
                    quarto, “Remarks on the Speech made in Common Council, on the Bill for
                    permitting persons professing the Jewish religion to be naturalized, so far as
                    prophecies are supposed to be affected by it.” This little tract was written
                    with spirit, and well received by those who were superior to narrow prejudices.
                    Its design was to show, that, whatever political reasons might be alleged
                    against the bill, Christianity was in no danger of being prejudiced by the
                    protection promised to the Jews. The same year some of Mr Bowyer’s notes were
                    annexed to Bishop Claton’s translation of “A Journal from Grand Cairo to Mount
                    Sinai and back again.” In 1754 Mr Bowyer, with a view of lessening his fatigue,
                    entered into partnership with a relation; but some disagreement arising, the
                    connection was dissolved in three years. On the death of Mr Richardson in 1761,
                    Mr Bowyer succeeded him as printer to the Royal Society, through the favour of
                    the Earl of Macclesfield; and, under the friendship of five successive
                    presidents, he enjoyed that office till his death.</p>
                <p>In 1763 Mr Bowyer published an excellent edition of the Greek Testament, in two
                    vols. 12mo. It appeared under the following title: <hi rend="italic">Novum
                    Testamentum Groecum; ad fidenι Graecorum solum Codicum MSS. nunc primum
                    impressum, adstipulante Joanne Jacobo Wetstenio, juxta Sectiones Jo. Alberti
                    Rengelii divisum; et nova interpretatione surplus illustratum: Accessere in
                    altero volumine, Emendationes Conjecturales virorum doctorum undecunque
                    collectoe.</hi> This sold with great rapidity. The Conjectural Emendations were
                    well received by the learned, and are thought to be a valuable work. The
                    president and fellows of Havard College in Cambridge expressed their approbation
                    of this edition in very high terms, in a letter to Mr Bowyer, written in the
                    year 1767. “This work,” say they,</p>
                <p>“though small in bulk, we esteem as a rich treasure of sacred learning, and of
                    more value than many large volumes of the commentators.” A second edition of the
                    Conjectures on the New Testament, with very considerable enlargements, was
                    separately published in one volume vo in 1772. Bishop Warburton having censured
                    a passage in the former edition, Mr Bowyer sent him a copy of this book, with a
                    conciliatory letter. Dr λVarburton’s Divine Legation had received very
                    considerable advantage from Mr Bowyer’s corrections, and this even in an edition
                    which was necessarily given to another press. In 1761 he was employed to print
                    his lordship’s Doctrine of Grace. A second edition being soon wanted, and Mr
                    Bowyer not having been intrusted with the care of it, he prepared a series of
                    letters to the bishop in his own defence; and of these, together with a few he
                    had formerly received from that great writer, he afterwards printed <hi
                    rend="italic">twelve copies,</hi> of which <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> were
                    subsequently destroyed. However, there is the best authority for asserting, that
                    notwithstanding any little altercations which happened, Dr λVarburton always
                    retained a sincere regard for our typographer. In 1765, at the request of Thomas
                    Hollis, Esq. Mr Bowyer wrote a short Latin preface to Dr Wallis’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Grammaticae Lingu&lt;B Anglicanoe.</hi> He wrote also a large
                    English preface for the same work, which, however, was not printed. In 1766 he
                    entered into partnership with Mr Nichols, who had been trained by him to the
                    profession, and had for several years assisted him in the management of his
                    business. The same year Mr Bowyer wrote a Latin preface to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Joannis Harduini, Jesuitoe, ad Censuram Scriptorum veterum Prolegomena.</hi> In
                    1767 he was appointed to print the journals of the House of Lords and the rolls
                    of Parliament. This year he printed Mr Clarke’s excellent and learned work on
                    <hi rend="italic">The Connection of the Roman, Saxon, and English Coins,</hi>
                    and wrote some notes upon it, which are interspersed throughout the volume with
                    those of the author. Part of the Dissertation on the Roman sesterce was likewise
                    Mr Bowyer’s production; and the index, which is an uncommonly good one, was
                    drawn up by him entirely.</p>
                <p>In January 1771 Mr Bowyer lost his second wife. In the Philosophical Transactions
                    of this year was printed a very ingenious <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the
                    Value of the ancient Greek and Roman Money,</hi> by Mr Matthew Raper. But his
                    opinions not coinciding with those of Mr Bowyer, the latter printed a small
                    pamphlet, entitled <hi rend="italic">Remarks occasioned by a late Dissertation
                    on the Greek and Roman Money.</hi> In 1773 three little tracts were published by
                    him, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Select Discourses,</hi> treating, 1.
                    Of the correspondence of the Hebrew months with the Julian, from the Latin of
                    Professor Michaelis; 2. Of the Sabbatical years, from the same; 3. Of the years
                    of Jubilee, from an anonymous writer in Masson’s <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    Critique de la République des Lettres.</hi> In 1774 he corrected a new edition
                    of Schrevelius’s Greek Lexico; to which he added a number of words, which he
                    himself had collected in the course of his studies. Considerable manuscript
                    additions were also made by him to the lexicos of Hederic and Buxtorf, the Latin
                    ones of Faber and Littleton, and the English Dictionary of Bailey; and he left
                    behind him many other proofs of his critical skill in the learned languages. In
                    1774 was published <hi rend="italic">The Origin of P∣ inting, in two
                    Essays.</hi> The original idea of this valuable tract was Mr Bowyer’s, but it
                    was completed by Mr Nichols.</p>
                <p>Although our author, during the last ten years of his life, had been afflicted
                    with the palsy and stone, he not only preserved a remarkable cheerfulness of
                    temper, but was enabled to support the labour of almost incessant reading; and
                    he regularly corrected the learned works, especially the Greek books, which came
                    from his press. This he continued to do till within a few weeks of his death,
                    which happened in November 1777, when he had nearly completed his seventy-eighth
                    year. For more than half a century Mr Bowyer was unrivalled as a learned
                    printer, and many of the most masterly productions of this kingdom issued from
                    his press. To his literary and professional abilities he added an excellent
                    moral charge-ter<pb break="no" facs="nls:193735117" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5117-0158"
                    />; and he was particularly distinguished by his inflexible probity, and an
                    uncommon alacrity in relieving the necessitous.</p>
