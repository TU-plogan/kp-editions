                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BRAMAH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph</hi></label>, a practical
                    engineer and machinist, was born at Stainborough, in Yorkshire, on the 13th of
                    April 1749. His father rented a farm on the estate of Lord Strafford; and, being
                    the eldest of five children, he was intended for the same employment. He
                    exhibited at a very early age an unusual talent for the mechanical arts, and
                    succeeded, when he was quite a boy, in making two violoncellos, which were found
                    to be very tolerable instruments; as well as in cutting a single block of wood
                    into a violin, chiefly by means of tools which were forged for him by a
                    neighbouring smith, whom, at a subsequent period of his life, he induced to
                    assist him in London as one of his principal workmen. Notwithstanding the
                    ingenuity which he had thus displayed, his destination in life might have
                    precluded its further cultivation, had he not, fortunately for himself and for
                    the public, been incapacitated, when he was about sixteen, by an accidental
                    lameness in his ancle, for the pursuit of agricultural labour. He was then
                    apprenticed to a carpenter and joiner, who seems, however, to have contributed
                    but little towards his improvement in mechanical knowledge.</p>
                <p>When the term of his engagement had expired, he obtained employment for some time
                    in the workshop of a cabinet-maker in London, and soon after established himself
                    as a principal in that business. Another accidental confinement left his mind at
                    liberty for a time to occupy itself with reflection and invention; and he
                    employed his involuntary leisure in the improvement of some of the most humble,
                    but not the least useful, of domestic conveniences. He obtained a patent for his
                    inventions, and established a manufacture of these and other similar articles in
                    Denmark Street, Soho, where he continued to simplify and improve the arrangement
                    of the pumps and pipes subservient to his principal purpose. He procured in 1783
                    a patent for a water-cock, intended to allow the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193735429" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5429-0182"/>fluid a more uninterrupted
                    passage through it than was practicable in the ordinary construction. He
                    afterwards removed to Piccadilly, and established the various branches of his
                    manufactory in some extensive premises at Pimlico.</p>
                <p>In 1784 Mr Bramah took out a patent for his improvement in locks, which certainly
                    appear to be of very material importance. Their peculiar character depends on
                    the arrangement of a number of levers or sliders, in such a manner as to
                    preserve, when at rest, a uniform situation, and to be only pressed down by the
                    key to certain unequal depths, which nothing but the key can ascertain; the
                    levers not having any stop to retain them in their required situation, except
                    that which forms a part of the key. The construction is more particularly
                    detailed in the specification of the patent <hi rend="italic">(Repertory of
                    Arts,</hi> vol. v. p. 217), as well as in the inventor’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertation on Lochs,</hi> 8vo; and some additional modifications, allowing
                    the key to be varied at pleasure, are described in a patent, dated in 1798. It
                    is not easy to say why the application for an act of parliament to prolong the
                    privilege proved unsuccessful, unless it was supposed that the inventor had been
                    already sufficiently remunerated for the share of ingenuity which his
                    contrivance exhibited; but the report, that one of these locks had been readily
                    opened, before a committee of the House of Commons, by means of a common quill,
                    was a gross misrepresentation of the fact; the quill having in reality been
                    previously cut into the required shape from the true key. The experiment, in
                    fact, only served to show the perfection of the workmanship, so little force
                    being required to overcome the resistance when properly applied.</p>
                <p>For different modifications of pumps and fire-engines Mr Bramah took out three
                    successive patents, the two last being dated in 1790 and 1798. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Repertory,</hi> vols. ii. iii.) His “rotative principle” consists in making
                    the part which acts immediately on the water in the form of a slider, sweeping
                    round a cylindrical cavity, and kept in its place by means of an eccentric
                    groove; a construction which was very possibly suggested by his own inventive
                    mind, but which had been before described, in a form nearly similar, by Ramelli,
                    Cavalleri, Amontons, Prince Rupert, and Dr Hooke. The third patent related
                    chiefly to the attachment of a considerable reservoir of water to the
                    fire-engine in a cylindrical form, and to the furnishing of it with wheels of
                    its own, of a proper size and strength to allow it to be conveniently
                    worked.</p>
                <p>There was somewhat more of originality in the idea of applying practically, to
                    the purpose of a press, the well-known principle of the hydrostatic paradox, by
                    which, as by a lever with arms capable of infinite variation, the smallest
                    imaginable weight is made capable of holding in equilibrium a force incomparably
                    greater. Mr Bramah’s patent for the invention is dated in the year 1796 <hi
                    rend="italic">(Repertory,</hi> vol. vi. p. 289), and it has been one of the most
                    successful of his numerous speculations. He added to it, in a subsequent patent,
                    the contrivance of a “retainer,” for keeping goods in a constant state of
                    pressure for an unlimited time after their removal from the press. The apparatus
                    has certainly a considerable advantage in the great steadiness with which the
                    force can be applied, in the facility with which it can be regulated, and the
                    convenience with which it can be continued without alteration; and it has been
                    extensively applied, both on a small and on a large scale, for copying writings,
                    for pressing gunpowder, for proving cables and chains, for raising weights of
                    various kinds, and for drawing piles, and pulling up trees by the roots.</p>
                <p>A simple but a very convenient arrangement of little pumps and pipes has been
                    very generally employed in public-houses under the name of the beer-machine: for
                    this Mr Bramah took out a patent in 1797, describing it as part of an apparatus
                    for retaining, drawing, and clarifying liquors <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Repertory,</hi> vol. ix. p. 361). He prefaces his specification with some
                    general observations on the right of an inventor to a property, both in the
                    objects which he selects for his improvements, and in the means which he employs
                    for the attainment of them; and demands of the public justice an ample security
                    for both these rights, grounding this claim on his resolution to make a clear
                    and unreserved disclosure of all his inventions. Besides the method of pumping
                    up the liquors from the various casks through flexible pipes, without the
                    necessity of entering the cellar, he describes a mode of converting every cask
                    into a forcing pump, excluding the air, and raising the liquor to any part of
                    the house, by a load on its head, which is to be converted into a piston. He
                    mentions also a filtering machine, a vent peg, a method of making pipes, and a
                    new form of stop-cocks.</p>
                <p>In 1801 he obtained a patent for some improvements in the construction of
                    steam-engines, particularly relating to the boilers; and in 1802, one for a very
                    elaborate and accurate machine for producing smooth and parallel surfaces on
                    wood and other materials. The tools of different kinds employed in this machine,
                    such as gouges, spokeshaves, and planes, are carried with a considerable
                    velocity by a rotatory motion, and come successively in contact with the wood,
                    which is placed on a movable carriage gradually advancing. The centre or gudgeon
                    of the axis or shaft, instead of a common step, is supported by a barrel of oil,
                    to which it is fitted by a collar; and this arrangement not only diminishes the
                    friction very considerably, but allows the height of the shaft also to be very
                    easily and accurately regulated by means of a small forcing pump. The inventor
                    thinks this liquid support likely to be as permanent as it is advantageous; but
                    it may be apprehended, that the constant friction of such a collar would cause
                    it to require frequent repairs, in order to prevent the escape of the oil so
                    powerfully compressed. The machine has been erected on a large scale in the
                    arsenal at Woolwich, and is employed with perfect success. The specification
                    includes the description of a mode of turning spherical surfaces, either convex
                    or concave, by the simple contrivance of a tool, movable on an axis precisely
                    perpendicular to that of the lathe; and of cutting out concentric shells, by
                    fixing, in the same manner, a curved tool, nearly of the same form as that which
                    is employed by the common turners for making wooden bowls.</p>
                <p>An improvement in the processes for making paper, with the assistance of new
                    machinery, in large sheets, was secured to the inventor by a patent in 1805 <hi
                    rend="italic">(Repertory,</hi> second series, vol. viii. p. 1). The description
                    is accompanied by that of a mode of drying the paper on sliding frames, hung on
                    lines like sashes, and of keeping it in a state of compression by retainers
                    adapted to the hydrostatic press; but Mr Bramah had not leisure to introduce
                    these arrangements into actual practice, although he had been at a considerable
                    expense in preparing the apparatus.</p>
                <p>His next invention was, however, very effectually carried into execution in a
                    particular department, notwithstanding its unpromising appearance, as generally
                    stated in the specification of the patent, which he obtained in 1806 <hi
                    rend="italic">(Repertory,</hi> second series, vol. x. p. 329). He proposes to
                    facilitate the process of printing by means of a roller, composed of a number of
                    circular plates, closely fitted together, and turning on the same axis, each
                    bearing twenty-six letters, with figures, spaces, and various marks, either
                    engraved or projecting, and capable of being shifted at pleasure, so as to
                    express any single line by a proper combination of the plates. This is described
                    as a substitute for common printing, copperplate engraving, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193735442" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5442-0183"/>and calico printing; and the
                    ink is intended to be supplied by a trough fixed above, and in contact with the
                    cylinder. Now it is obvious that such a machine would be insufferably tedious
                    and inconvenient for every purpose of common printing, which it would be
                    scarcely possible to perform by its means; but when we discover that the
                    inventor had probably in view the apparatus which he constructed the next year
                    for the Bank of England, for numbering and dating their, notes, we shall be
                    aware that the means were admirably adapted to the end; a single line only being
                    here wanted at once, in which a single figure was to be changed at each step,
                    and that in a regular order. In fact, during the immense temporary circulation
                    of one and two pound notes, the Bank has been able, by this machinery, under the
                    management of about twenty clerks, to perform the labour of 120, who were before
                    required for the purpose.</p>
                <p>Mr Bramah procured a patent in 1809 for a mode of making and holding pens for
                    writing, calculated to save the substance of the quill, by cutting a number of
                    pens out of it, instead of a single one; and those who are not in the habit of
                    making their own pens may often find a convenience in the portable form in which
                    this and other similar “pterophori” are arranged. In 1812 he brought forward his
                    patent for the construction of main pipes, to be carried through the principal
                    streets of a metropolis, of sufficient thickness to withstand a great force, to
                    which the water within them is intended to be subjected, by proper pumps,
                    furnished with air-vessels; so that the water may not only be ready for the
                    immediate extinction of fires, without the necessity of bringing an engine to
                    the spot, but may also furnish a convenient moving power for various mechanical
                    purposes, such as raising weights, by means of tubes sliding out of each other,
                    like those of a telescope. He observes that he has frequently had occasion to
                    employ a hydrostatic pressure, in many of his operations, equivalent to that of
                    a column of water 20,000 feet high, which is about four tons for every square
                    inch. He also asserts that he can form 500 tubes, each five feet long, capable
                    of sliding within each other, and of being extended, in a few seconds, by the
                    pressure of air forced into them, to a length of 2500 feet; and, with a power of
                    this kind, he seems to have imagined that he could raise wrecks, and regulate
                    the descent of weights of various descriptions.</p>
                <p>His improvements in wheel-carriages, for which he obtained a patent in 1814,
                    consisted in fixing each wheel to a separate movable axis, having its bearings
                    at two distinct points of its length, but loosely inclosed between these points
                    in a cylinder filled with oil; and, in some cases, he proposes to fix the
                    opposite wheels to the same axis, though with a power of turning very stiffly
                    round it, in order to lessen the lateral motion of the shafts in very rough
                    roads. He also suggests the use of pneumatic springs, formed by pistons, sliding
                    in cylinders, as a substitute for common springs of metal.</p>
                <p>The purpose of Mr Bramah’s last patent was the prevention of the dry rot, by
                    laying on the timber meant to be preserved from it, a thin coat of Parker’s
                    Roman cement, much diluted with water; but he does not appear to have pursued
                    this experiment, having transferred his right in the invention to other
                    hands.</p>
                <p>In addition to the seventeen patents which have been mentioned, he took out two
                    or three others of less importance, at different times; besides a variety of
                    contrivances, which he did not think it necessary to appropriate to himself by a
                    legal privilege. Mr Nicholson has mentioned a double plunger for a forcing pump,
                    as described to him by Mr Bramah <hi rend="italic">(Nich. Jour.</hi> vol. vii.
                    p. 50), which, m the form he has delineated, is certainly possessed of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> no</hi> particular advantage, producing only with a large
                    apparatus the effect of a much smaller. Mr Bramah had erected, in the latter
                    years of his life, some large machines at the Thames bank for sawing stones and
                    timber; he had begun to devise some improvements in bridges and in locks for
                    canals; and he had at one time been actually employed in the execution of some
                    water-works belonging to the department of the civil engineer, which lie
                    completed with ability and with success. His great and various exertions appear
                    in some measure to have exhausted the strength of his constitution; and his last
                    illness was immediately occasioned by a severe cold, taken in the prosecution of
                    his experiments on the tearing up of trees, made in Holt Forest. He died in his
                    sixty-sixth year, on the 9th of December 1814.</p>
                <p>Mr Bramah was a sincere believer in the doctrines of the Christian religion; and,
                    notwithstanding his diversified avocations, he left several manuscript essays on
                    religious subjects. In his moral character he was cheerful, benevolent, and
                    affectionate; in his habits he was neat and methodical; and he knew well how to
                    temper liberality with economy. He often kept his workmen employed more for
                    their sake than his own, when the stagnation of trade deprived him of the means
                    of disposing of the products of their labour. It is surely on the characters of
                    such individuals that the wealth and prosperity of the British empire most
                    essentially depend; an inventive imagination controlled by a sound judgment, an
                    incessant activity of mind and body, a head that can direct, and a heart that
                    can feel, are the genuine sources of that practical superiority which is well
                    known to distinguish the productions of our national industry. <hi rend="italic"
