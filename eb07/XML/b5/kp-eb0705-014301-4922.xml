                <p><label type="entry">BOUGAINVILLE</label>, Louis <hi rend="smallcaps">Antoine
                    de,</hi> a celebrated circumnavigator, was born in Paris in 1729. His father was
                    a notary and one of the sheriffs of the city of Paris. The parents of young
                    Bougainville wished him to practise as a lawyer, and, for this purpose, he was
                    received advocate in the parliament of Paris; but his own inclination was averse
                    to the profession, and he entered into the army in the corps of musketeers.</p>
                <p>He associated much with Clairaut and D’Alembert, who happened to live in his
                    neighbourhood; and from this intercourse he derived his knowledge of algebra and
                    fluxions. At the age of twenty-five he published his treatise on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Integral Calculus,</hi> intended as a supplement and continuation
                    of L'Hôpital’s treatise <hi rend="italic">Des infiniment petits.</hi>
                    Bougainville, in his preface, declares that all he has done in this work is to
                    place in a systematic order the formulae of different mathematicians.</p>
                <p>He was raised to the rank of major in the Picardy regiment. He went to London as
                    secretary to the French embassy, and was chosen a member of the Royal Society.
                    In 1756 he went to Canada as captain of dragoons, and having distinguished
                    himself in the war against England, was rewarded with the cross of the order of
                    St Louis.</p>
                <p>After the peace, the French government having conceived the project of planting a
                    colony on the Falkland Islands, Bougainville undertook to begin this
                    establishment at his own expense. The Falkland Islands, to which Bougainville
                    gave the name of Malouines (that is, St Malo Islands), are in 51° south
                    latitude, and 10° of longitude to the east of the meridian of Cape Horn. Fish is
                    abundant on their shores, and there is peat or turf for fuel, but no wood.
                    Bougainville began the settlement by landing some families of French Canadians.
                    The number of settlers was increased afterwards to 150.</p>
                <p>This colony excited the jealousy of the Spanish government; and the government of
                    France agreed that it should be given up to the Spaniards, the Spanish
                    government undertaking to indemnify Bougainville for the expense he had been at
                    in forming the establishment.</p>
                <p>As a consolation to Bougainville for the loss of his colony he was appointed to
                    command the frigate <hi rend="italic">La Boudeuse</hi> of twenty-six eight
                    pounders, and the transport <hi rend="italic">EEtoile,</hi> to go on a voyage of
                    discovery round the world. He took with him Commerçon as naturalist, and Verron
                    as astronomer.</p>
                <p>This was the first voyage round the world performed by the French. Since the
                    first circumnavigation by Magellan under the Spanish government in 1519, and
                    that of Drake under Queen Elizabeth in 1577, eleven other circumnavigations of
                    the world had been performed, part of them by the Dutch and part by the English,
                    and also several voyages of discovery had been made in the Pacific Oeean without
                    circumnavigation.</p>
                <p>The expedition commanded by Bougainville was at Buenos Ayres at the time of the
                    seizure of the Jesuits of Paraguay. The missions on the river Araguay, in the
                    province of Paraguay, contained a population of 300,000 Indians, divided into
                    parishes, and governed solely by the Jesuit parish priests. No other Europeans
                    but the Jesuits were admitted into the country, in order that the work of
                    conversion might not be frustrated by bad example. The produce of the labour of
                    the Indians was delivered into the hands of the Jesuits, who furnished them with
                    food and clothing. For this purpose the Jesuits bad warehouses filled with
                    European and American merchandise, and also a number of slaves. They had schools
                    for instructing the Indians in musie, painting, and other arts. The Spanish
                    government having determined on the suppression of the Jesuits, took every
                    precaution to prevent their being informed of the intended measure; and they
                    were arrested and sent to Europe without any attempt at resistance on their
                    part.</p>
                <p>Bougainville passed the Straits of Magellan, and anchored for a week at Otaheite,
                    where the English navigator Wallis had touched eight months before. A young man
                    of Otaheite joined the expedition, and was taken to Paris, where he staid
                    thirteen months. On his way back to his native country he died of the
                    small-pox.</p>
                <p>The numerous rocks and other dangers made Bougainville turn off to the
                    north-east, and prevented him from continuing a westerly course, so as to pass
                    through the channel which separates New Holland from New Guinea. These two
                    islands, in his general chart, are laid down as forming one, although he
                    possessed some information of the existence of the channel. Two years after,
                    namely in 1770, Captain Cook sailed through this channel, so dangerous by its
                    eoral reefs.</p>
                <p>The expedition having now crossed all the meridians of the Pacific Ocean, and
                    suffering from the seurvy in consequence of Scarcity of food, came to anchor in
                    the Gulf of Cajeli, a settlement of the Dutch East India Company in the
                    agreeable island of Borou, one of the Moluccas. The governor liberally supplied
                    the wants of the expedition. He lived splendidly in a house built in the Chinese
                    style, and judiciously adapted to the warmth of the climate; his wife and
                    daughters wore the Chinese dress. “Sa maison etoit la notre,” says Bougainville;
                    “à toute heure on y <pb break="no" facs="nls:193734935"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-4935-0144"/>trouvoit à boire et à manger, et ce genre de
                    politesse en vaut bien un autre pour qui surtout se ressentoit encore de la
                    famine.” It was the beginning of September, and the expedition shortened their
                    stay at Borou, in order to take advantage of the latter part of the easterly
                    monsoon, which carried them to Batavia; from thence they proceeded to the Isle
                    of France. Commerçon remained at the Isle of France that he might thence proceed
                    to examine the botany of Madagascar, as did Verron for the purpose of observing
                    the transit of Venus.</p>
                <p>In 1769 the expedition arrived at St Malo, after a voyage of two years and four
                    months, with the loss of only seven men out of upwards of 200.</p>
                <p>Bougainville’s account of the voyage is written with simplicity, and in a temper
                    which inclined him to view objects on the humorous side. His courage, the good
                    humour with which he maintained subordination, and his attention to the health
                    and comforts of the crew, are everywhere conspicuous.</p>
                <p>The art of making astronomical observations at sea was not so much improved as it
                    is now, and the methods for ascertaining the longitude especially were very
                    defective. In consequence of this, Bougainville’s charts are erroneous,
                    particularly in the longitudes. Neither did he remain long enough in any place
                    to make particular surveys.</p>
                <p>Bougainville’s life was an active one, so that little of it could be devoted’to
                    study. On his return to France his time was passed in the company of the highest
                    circles in Paris. He had the command of a ship under De Grasse and D’Estaing;
                    and, in April 1781, when the French fleet was beaten, he rallied some of the
                    beaten ships, and brought them into St Eustachio. After the peace, by which the
                    independence of the United States of America was secured, Bougainville returned
                    to Paris. The Academy of Sciences was at that time composed of pensioned
                    members, and of associates who had no salary; Bougainville solicited and
                    obtained the place of associate of the academy.</p>
                <p>He had a project of making a voyage of discovery towards the north pole. As this
                    did not meet with support from the French government, he sent his plan to
                    Admiral Phipps; Phipps, however, followed a different course from that proposed
                    by Bougainville, but he only got to the 80th degree of north latitude.</p>
                <p>Recourse was had to Bougainville in order to repress the mutinous disposition of
                    the sailors in the French navy before the breaking out of the Revolution; but
                    his efforts were ineffectual. He had the rank of vice-admiral in 1791. In 1792
                    he escaped almost miraculously from the massacres of Paris, and went to live on
                    his estate in Normandy. He was much attached to the government, which was then
                    falling. He lived on his estate for some time; it was the only part of his
                    fortune that the Revolution had left him. He was chosen a member of the
                    Institute at its first formation, and, in consequence, returned to reside in
                    Paris. He succeeded Borda as member of the Board of Longitude. In his old age,
                    under the government of Bonaparte, he enjoyed the dignity of senator, and was
                    created a count and member of the Legion of ,Honour.</p>
                <p>He retained his good-humoured liveliness and his mental faculties to the last,
                    and died in 1811, aged eighty-two. He was married, and had three sons who served
                    in the French army. He was always eager to promote science; and he conducted
                    himself during the Revolution in such a manner as to obtain the respect of all
                    parties. His éloge is written by Delambre, in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    the Institute.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(b. b.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
