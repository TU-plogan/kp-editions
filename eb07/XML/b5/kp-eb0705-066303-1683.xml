                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> art of building comprises the practice of civil
                    architecture, or the mechanical operations necessary to carry the designs of the
                    architect into effect. It is not unfrequently called practical architecture; but
                    the adoption of this term would have tended only to confuse, by rendering it
                    difficult to make the distinction generally understood between architecture as a
                    fine or liberal art, and architecture as a mechanical art. The execution of
                    works of architecture necessarily includes building; but building is frequently
                    employed when the result is not architecture: a man may be a competent builder
                    without being an architect; but no one can profess himself a complete architect
                    unless he be competent to specify and direct all the operations of building. A
                    scientific knowledge of the principles of masonry, carpentry, joinery, &amp;c.
                    and of the qualities, strength, and resistance of materials, though of the
                    utmost importance to an architect, is not sufficient of itself, without a minute
                    acquaintance with a great variety of less ambitious details. Such are those
                    which relate to the arrangement of a plan for the greatest possible degree of
                    convenience on the smallest space, and at the least expense; its transference to
                    the ground; the preparation and formation of foundations; the arrangement and
                    construction of drains, sewers, and cess-pools; the varieties of walling with
                    stone, and of bonding bricks in brick-work; the merit of the various modes of
                    bonding and tying walls with timber and otherwise; the arrangement of gutters on
                    roofs, to get sufficient fall, and to lead the water to the least inconvenient
                    places for placing trunks to carry it down; the arrangement and formation of
                    flues; the protection of walls from damps, of timbers from moisture and stagnant
                    air, and of metals generally from exciting causes; the cost of materials and
                    labour, and the quantity of each required to produce certain effects. Together
                    with these, it is important to be practically acquainted with all the modes of
                    operation in all the trades or arts required in building. Every thing must be
                    clearly understood, or it will be impossible properly to specify beforehand, in
                    detail, every thing and every operation to be done and performed; and minutely
                    to estimate, beforehand also, the absolute cost involved in the execution of a
                    proposed structure. The power to do the latter necessarily involves that of
                    measuring work, and ascertaining quantities after it is done. These things may
                    certainly be referred to the surveyor or measurer, but they are not the less
                    incumbent on the architect, who cannot be said to be thoroughly master of
                    building, or the practice of his profession, unless he be skilled in these
                    operations.</p>
                <p>The architect having furnished the specification and working drawings of his
                    design, the first operation is the preparation of the foundation. (See article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Stone-Masonry,</hi> sect. 60.) Much in this particular, it
                    is evident, must depend on localities. It is not of so much importance that the
                    ground be hard, or even rocky, as that it be compact, and of similar consistence
                    throughout; that it be so constituted as to resist entirely and throughout, or
                    yield equally to the superincumbent weight. In the latter case, however, there
                    must be some contrivance to generalize the pressure, or the piers would sink
                    away from the parts above and below the apertures. This danger is obviated, ií
                    the soil be tolerably consistent, by turning inverted arches, as we shall show
                    in its place; or, the soil being too soft to offer resistance<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193741696" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1696-0664"/> in the space occupied by a
                    brick, by planking with timber or cast-iron frames, by laying one or more
                    courses of strong thick paving stones, as wide at least as the whole extent of
                    the footings of the walls, and each stone as large as may be; or, what in most
                    cases is by far the best, by laying a compact mass of concreted rubble, sand,
                    and quicklime, which will harden into a solid unbroken bed.</p>
                <p>No foundation is more ineligible for a heavy structure than one that is rocky,
                    especially if the rocks are in small masses, or, if a sufficient surface is
                    offered of one mass, in strata which dip considerably: in the former case, from
                    the rottenness of the soil in which rocks are generally bedded, and which
                    consists for the most part of their detritus; and in the latter, from the
                    liability of stratified rock to crack and slip, against which no precaution is
                    available. Dry gravelly soils, again, are not only loose and infirm, but arc
                    exceedingly liable to vacuities of various extent, which are hardly sufficiently
                    provided against by piling: wet gravel is generally more compact, and may be
                    better trusted both with and without piles, or with the concretion before
                    mentioned. A deep compacted sand will be found firm if a sufficient surface of
                    it be embraced by the footings, which should be wider in that than most other
                    cases. In large and deep beds of alluvial deposits the heaviest building may be
                    laid with security, if the precaution before suggested be attended to for the
                    equal distribution of the pressure throughout. The city of New Orleans, in a
                    delta at the mouth of the Mississippi, rests on a bed of mud, which is held
                    together by a bonding of trunks and arms of trees, but on a broad level bed
                    below. Here the only precaution taken in erecting a structure of the greatest
                    magnitude is to make the trenches for the walls wide and level, and to floor the
                    whole of their surface with thick planks properly bonded: on these the footings
                    are laid, and if any settlement occurs, it is of the whole edifice, and no
                    injury accrues to any part of it at any time. Clayey and chalky soils are
                    generally understood to form the best natural foundations: in these, under
                    ordinary circumstances, no preparation is required, though for very heavy and
                    unequallypressing works, such as bridges, which are placed on piers made as
                    small as they possibly can be, piling has been considered a necessary
                    precaution. Indeed, except perhaps on an extensive horizontal bed of firm
                    compact rock, no foundation can be considered better than that afforded by
                    piling in a deep clay. (For the process of <hi rend="smallcaps">Piling,</hi> see
                    the article under that head.)</p>
                <p>In the ordinary processes of building, however, the artificial preparation of
                    foundations hardly need be considered. Common prudence would refer it to
                    professional management, when such is found necessary; and a work of this kind
                    cannot contain sufficient information and instruction to qualify a man to act
                    professionally on any subject, and more particularly on those subjects which
                    demand initiatory practice and experience. We therefore proceed to the ordinary
                    routine of practice.</p>
                <p>The artificers whose trades come within the immediate range of the builder’s
                    business are the following: Digger or excavator, bricklayer, mason, slater,
                    sawyer, carpenter, joiner, plasterer, modeller, carver and gilder, plumber,
                    smith, glazier, painter and decorator. Paving is done by the bricklayer or
                    mason, as it may be of brick or stone, and tiling by the bricklayer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bigger or Excavator.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The digger
                    works with a pickaxe and a spade or shovel. With the pick-axe he breaks down the
                    soil if it be hard or very stiff, and throws it out with the shovel; but
                    compacted sand and alluvial soil is spitted and thrown out with the spade alone,
                    without previous breaking down. In the former case, the digger works onward, or
                    with his work before him, and in the latter backward, or standing on the part to
                    be thrown out, as a gar-</p>
                <p>1 dener does. When rock occurs in a foundation, the assist-! ance of the
                    quarryman is requisite to cut through or blast: it, as the occasion may require.
                    The digger must be care; ful to produce a perfect level in every direction, and
                    es-</p>
                <p> pecially in trenches for walls; nor may this be done by pla-</p>
                <p> cing again loose matter, but the level must be produced on the solid or
                    undisturbed bed.</p>
                <p>: Digger’s work is valued by the cubic yard, and is gene rally made to include,
                    besides excavating, the removal of the soil and rubbish. The price per yard is
                    therefore necessarily contingent on the stiffness of the soil, the depth to
                    which the excavations may reach below the surface, and the.distance the stuff is
                    to be removed; so that it is impossible to determine what, the cost maybe,
                    without reference to each and all of these particulars, most of which must be
                    different in every different place; and all are again affected by the local cost
                    of labour or wages. A good excavator will dig and throwout, of common soil, into
                    a basket or wheel-barrow, eight or ten yards per diem; but of stiff clay or firm
                    gravel, not more than six yards. If the soil is to be carted away from the site
                    of the proposed building, it may be more advantageously basketed out of the
                    foundation, and deposited at once in the cart, whereby the labour of throwing or
                    shovelling a second time is avoided; but if the soil is to be deposited in the
                    immediate vicinity of the site, or thrown into a barge, wheeling is the quicker
                    and more economical operation. The quantity of digger’s work is ascertained by
                    multiplying the length of the excavation by its breadth, and their result by the
                    mean depth for cubic feet: these divided by 27 will give the amount in cubic
                    yards.</p>

                    for information on the subject; and in the same manner the components and merits
                    of mortars and cements will be found in sections 20 <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seqq.</hi> of the article under the head <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Stone-Masonry.</hi> A few observations on the composition of mortar for
                    bricklaying will nevertheless be necessary here.</p>
                <p>Particular attention must be paid to cleansing the sand to be used for mortar, of
                    every particle of clay or mud that may adhere to or be mixed up with it. Sea
                    sand is objectionable for two reasons: it cannot be perfectly freed from a
                    saline taint, and the particles are moreover generally rounded by attrition,
                    caused by the action of the sea, which makes it less efficient for mortar than
                    if they retained their natural angular forms. Lime should not be slaked until
                    the moment it is to be mixed up with the sand in mortar, but the sooner that is
                    done after it is burnt the better. The proportion of lime to sand is generally
                    taken at one third or one fourth of the whole mass; but if both the materials be
                    of good quality, that is, if the lime slake freely, and become a fine pungent
                    impalpable powder, perfectly clear from argillaceous or any other foreign
                    matter, and the sand clean and sharp, and of variously sized particles, one
                    sixth of lime to sand is quite enough: more is injurious. The ingredients should
                    be well mixed and beaten in a pug-mill, and as little water used as will suffice
                    to make the compound consistent and paste like. Rain, or any other soft water,
                    should be used for the purpose of making mortar, and not spring or hard water,
                    though any other may be preferred to what is brackish even in the slightest
                    degree. When mortar is made, if not immeuι-ately used it should be put into a
                    close pit or case, and kept from the air, in which manner it will improve rather
                    than deteriorate, though it be for weeks or even months: if however, the
                    moisture be allowed to exude, it will set and be spoiled. When taken out to be
                    worked up, it should be again well beaten, and wetted sufficiently to work
                    freely, but no more: nor should it be re-made in this manner <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193741709" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1709-0665"/>in larger quantities than are
                    required for immediate or daily use. A quick-setting cement, such as that which
                    is most commonly used in building in this country, and known as Parker’s or
                    Roman cement, can only be mixed or gauged as it is required for use. A
                    bricklayer will keep a labourer fully employed in gauging cement for him alone.
                    It is mixed with sand in the same manner that lime is in common mortar, in the
                    proportion of about three or four of sand to one of cement, according to the
                    quality of the latter; and the labourer, as he gauges on one board, supplies the
                    mixture to the bricklayer fit for use on another board, a spadeful at a time: it
                    must then be applied within half a minute, or it sets and is spoiled.</p>
                <p>The average size of bricks in this country is a fraction under nine inches long,
                    four and a half wide, and two and a half inches thick; and as their magnitude is
                    limited by law, or rather by the duty imposed by law, the variation cannot be
                    great. In consequence of this uniformity of size, a wall of this material is
                    described as of so many bricks in thickness, or of the number of inches which
                    result from the multiplying of nine inches by any number of bricks; a nine inch
                    or one brick wall; a fourteen inch wall, or of one brick and a half (13⅛ inches
                    would be more correct, in fact; for although a joint of mortar must occur in
                    this thickness, yet the fraction under the given size of the brick is enough to
                    form it); eighteen inch or two bricks, and so on. A half-brick wall is not, or
                    ought not to be, known, except in partitions to fill in between quartering or
                    upright timbers, when it is called brick-nogging; and then not more than six
                    courses are laid without being bonded by a piece of wood, called an intertie,
                    skew-nailed at each end to the quarters: brick-nogging is either flat or on
                    edge, as the partition may be 4∣ or 2^ inches thick.</p>
                <p>The great art in bricklaying is to preserve and maintain a bond, to have every
                    course perfectly horizontal, both longitudinally and transversely, and perfectly
                    plumb; which last, however, may not mean upright, though that is the general
                    acceptation of the term, for the plumb-rule may be made to suit any inclination
                    that it is wished the wall may have, as inward against a bank, for instance, or
                    in a tapering tower; and also to make the vertical joints recur perpendicularly
                    over each other: this is vulgarly and technically called keeping <hi
                    rend="italic">the perpends.</hi> By bond in brickwork is intended that
                    arrangement which shall make the bricks of every course cover the joints of
                    those in the course below it, and so tend to make the whole mass or combination
                    of bricks actas much together, or dependently one upon another, as possible. The
                    object of this will be understood by reference to the diagram, fig. 1. Here it

                    f</hi> and so throughout the structure. But this forms a longitudinal bond only,
                    which cannot extend its influence beyond the width of the brick; and a wall of
                    one brick and a half or two bricks thick, built in this manner, would, in
                    effect, consist of three or four half-brick-thick walls, acting independently of
                    each other, as shown in the plan at <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> in the diagram,
                    under fig. 1. If the bricks were turned so as to show their short sides or ends
                    in front, instead of their long ones, certainly a compact wall of a whole brick
                    in thickness would be produced; but the longitudinal bond would be shortened
                    one-half, as at <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">c h,</hi> and a wall
                    of any greater thickness, in the same manner, must be composed of so many
                    independent one-brick walls, as at <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> in the plan before
                    referred to. To obviate this, to produce a transverse, and vet preserve a aood
                    longitudinal, bond, the bricks are laid in alternate courses of headers and
                    stretchers, or of ends and sides, as shown in fig. 2, thus combining the
                    advantages of the two modes of arrangement <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g c</hi><hi

                    >b</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> fig. 2. Each brick in fig. 2 showing its long
                    side in front, or being a stretcher, will have another lying parallel to it, and
                    on the same level, on the other side, to receive the other ends of the bricks
                    showing as headers in front, which in their turn bind, by breaking the joint
                    between them, as shown in the end of such a wall at <hi rend="italic">d.</hi>
                    Thus a well-bonded nine-inch or one brick wall is produced. The end elevations
                    of the same wall at <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> show
                    how the process of bonding is pursued in walls of one and a half and two bricks
                    thick, the stretcher being abutted in the same course by a header; thus, in a
                    fourteen-inch wall inverting the appearance on the opposite sides, as seen at
                    <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> and producing the same appearance in an eighteen-inch
                    wall, as at <hi rend="italic">f</hi> In the diagram under fig. 2, at <hi
                    rend="italic">g,</hi> is the plan of a fourteen-inch wall, showing the headers
                    on one side and the stretchers on the other, and at <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is
                    the plan of the course immediately above it, in which the headers and stretchers
                    are inverted; at <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> are
                    shown, in the same manner, the plans of two courses of an eighteen-inch wall.
                    This is called English bond. Thicker walls are constructed in the same manner by
                    the extension of the same principle.</p>
                <p>But a brick being exactly half its length in breadth, it is impossible,
                    commencing from a vertical end or angle, to make a bond with whole bricks, as
                    the joints must of necessity fall one over the other. This difficulty is
                    obviated by cutting a brick longitudinally into two, or transversely into four,
                    equal parts, making half headers. One of these is placed next to a whole header,
                    inward from the angle, and forms with it a three-quarter length between the
                    stretchers above and below, thus making a regular overlap, which may then be
                    preserved throughout: these half headers are technically termed closers. (See
                    the joints in the heading courses next the upright angle of the wall fig. 2, and
                    the first joints inwards from the square ends by the headers in the plans at <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h.)</hi> A three-quarter stretcher is
                    obviously as available for this purpose as a half header, but the latter is
                    preferred, because, by the use of it, uniformity of appearance is preserved, and
                    whole bricks are retained on the quoins or angles. In walls of almost all
                    thicknesses above nine inches, to preserve the transverse, and yet not destroy
                    the longitudinal bond, it is frequently necessary to use half bricks; but it
                    becomes a question whether more is not lost in the general firmness and
                    consistence of the wall by that necessity, than is gained in the uniformity of
                    the bond. It may certainly be taken as a general rule, that a brick should never
                    be cut if it can be worked in whole, for a new joint is thereby created in a
                    construction, the difficulty of which consists in obviating the debility arising
                    from the constant recurrence of joints. Great attention should be paid to this,
                    especially in the quoins of buildings, in which half bricks most readily occur;
                    and there it is not only of consequence to have the greatest degree of
                    consistence, but the quarter bricks used as closers are already admitted, and
                    the weakness consequent on their admission would only be increased by the use of
                    Other bats, or fragments of bricks.</p>
                <p>Another mode of bonding brick-work, which may be supposed to have arisen from the
                    appearance of the ends of a wall according to the former mode of arrangement
                    (see e and/ fig. 2), instead of placing the bricks in alternate courses of
                    headers and stretchers, places headers and stretchers alternately in the same
                    course, fig. 3. The plans below this at c and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> are of
                    two courses of a fourteen-inch wall,· with their bond, showing in what manner
                    the joints are broken in the wall horizontally as well as vertically on its
                    face. This is called Flemish bond. Closers are used <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193741722" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1722-0666"/>equally to English and
                    Flemish bond, in the same manner, and for the same purpose; half bricks also
                    will occur in both, but what has been said with reference to the use of them in
                    the former applies even with more force to the latter, for they are more
                    frequent in Flemish than in English, and its transverse tie is thereby rendered
                    less strong. Their occurrence is a disadvantage which every care should be taken
                    to obviate. The arrangement of the joints, however, in Flemish bond, presenting
                    a neater appearance than that of English bond, it is generally preferred for
                    external walls when their outer faces are not to be covered with stucco, or
                    plaster composition of any kind; but English bond should have the preference
                    when the greatest degree ofstrength and compactness is considered of the highest
                    importance, because it affords, as we have already noticed, a better transverse
                    tie than the other, and transverse tic is even more important than
                    longitudinal.</p>
                <p>It has been attempted to improve the bond in thick walls, by laying raking
                    courses in the core between external stretching courses, and reversing the rake
                    when the course recurs. This obviates whatever necessity may exist of using half
                    bricks in the heading courses, but it leaves triangular interstices to be filled
                    up with bats, as the diagram fig. 4 shows. This represents the plan of a
                    thirty-six inch or three-brick wall with raking courses at «, between external
                    rangesof stretchers, and lyingon a complete course of headers, and at 6 a wall
                    of the same thickness herring-bonecl; courses of headers would bed and cover
                    this also, and, in the second course above, the raking or herring-boning would
                    be repeated, but the direction of the bricks inverted. It will be seen that the
                    latter demands, in addition to the triangular filling-in bats at the outer ends
                    of the diagonally placed bricks, half bricks to fill up the central line of
                    interstices, rendering herring-boning more objectionable in that particular,
                    though it has some advantages over simply raking, or thorough diagonal courses,
                    in some other points. Neither mode should, however, be recurred to for walls of
                    a less thickness than three bricks, and that indeed is almost too thin to admit
                    of any great advantage from it.</p>
                <p>Skilful and ingenious workmen are well aware of the necessity of attending to the
                    bond, and are ready both to suggest and to receive and practise an improvement;
                    but generally the workmen themselves are both ignorant of its importance and
                    careless in preserving it, even according to the common modes. Their work should
                    therefore be strictly supervised as they proceed with it; for many of the
                    failures which are constantly occurring may be referred to their ignorance or
                    carelessness in this particular.</p>
                <p>Not second in importance to bonding in brick-work is, that it be perfectly plumb,
                    or vertical, and that every course be perfectly horizontal, or level, both
                    longitudinally and transversely. The lowest course in the footings of a brick
                    wall should be laid with the strictest attention to this latter particular; for
                    the bricks being of equal thickness throughout, the slightest irregularity or
                    incorrectness in that will be carried into the superimposing courses, and can
                    only be rectified by using a greater or less quantity of mortar in one part or
                    another, so that the wall will of course yield unequally to the superincumbent
                    weight, as the work goes on, and perpetuate the infirmity. To save the trouble
                    of keeping the plumb-rule and level constantly in his hands, and yet to insure
                    correct work, the bricklayer, on clearing the footings of a wall, builds up six
                    or eight courses at the external angles (see fig. 5), which he carefully plumbs
                    and levels across, and from one to the other. These form a gauge for the
                    intervening parts of the courses, a line being tightly· strained from one end to
                    the other, resting on the upper and outer angles of the gauge bricks of the next
                    course to be laid, as at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and Z&gt;, fig. 5, and with
                    this he makes his work range. If, however, the length be great, the line will of
                    course sag; to prevent which, it is carefully set and propped at sufficient
                    distances. Having carried up three or four courses to a level, with the guidance
                    of the line, the work should be proved with the level and plumb rule, and
                    particularly with the latter at the returns and reveals, as well as on the face:
                    a smart tap with the end of the handle of the trowel will generally suffice to
                    make a brick yield what little it may be out, while the work is so green, and
                    not injure it. Good workmen, however, take a pride in showing how correctly
                    their work will plumb without tapping. To work which is circular on the plan,
                    both the level and the plumb-rule must be used, together with a gauge-mould or a
                    ranging trammel, to every course, as it must be evident that the line cannot be
                    applied to such in the manner just described. To every wall of more than one
                    brick thick, two men should be employed at the same time, one outside and the
                    other in: one man cannot do justice from one side, even to a fourteen-inch wall.
                    Inferior workmen and apprentices are generally employed as inside men, though
                    the work there is of quite as great importance as exteriorly, except for
                    neatness, and for that only if the brickwork is to show on the outside.</p>
                <p>In the operation of bricklaying, the workman holds the trowel in his right hand,
                    and with the left he takes up the bricks from the scaffold, and lays them in
                    their places. Spooning or shovelling up mortar from the board with the trowel,
                    he throws it on the course last laid, and with the point strews it over the
                    surface to form a bed for that which he is about to set; whatever bulges or
                    projects over the outer edge of the work below is struck off, and being caught
                    on the flat face of the trowel, is put against the side or edge of the last
                    brick laid in the new course. Then taking up a brick, he presses it down in its
                    place until its upper and outer angle comes exactly to the line; and if this be
                    not readily effected by the hand, a slight drawing blow with the obtuse point of
                    the edge of the trowel does it, or a tap with the end of the handle both draws
                    it and settles it down farther than the hand can press it. The small quantity of
                    mortar that is pressed out in front, by this operation, being struck off, the
                    joints are neatly drawn by compressing the mortar with the point of the trowel,
                    and thus producing a fine smooth surface,—that is, if the work is to be seen;
                    for if it is to be plastered, the rough face is left that the plastering may the
                    more readily attach itself, and the joint is not drawn at all, but the workman
                    proceeds in the same manner with the next brick in advance along the course, or
                    to fill in behind the one he has laid in front to meet the work of his mate on
                    the other side of the same wall. This is the common mode of <hi rend="italic"
                    >laying</hi> bricks. They should not however be merely <hi rend="italic"
                    >laid;</hi> every brick should be rubbed and pressed down in such a manner as to
                    force the slimy matter of the mortar into the pores of the bricks, and so
                    produce absolute adhesion. Moreover, to make brick-work as good and perfect as
                    it may be, every brick should be made damp, or even wet, before it is laid,
                    otherwise it immediately absorbs the moisture of the mortar, and, its surface
                    being covered with dry dust, and its pores full of air, no adhesion can take
                    place; but if the brick be damp, and the mortar moist, the dust is enveloped in
                    the cementitious matter of themortar, which also enters the pores of the brick,
                    so that when the water evaporates, their attachment is complete, the retention
                    and access of air being thus altogether precluded. 1θ wet the bricks before they
                    were carried on to the seallo would, by making them heavier, add materially to
                    tιθ labaur of carrying: in dry weather they would, moreover, become dry again
                    before they could be used; and for t ae bricklayer to wet every brick himself
                    would be an unne <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741735"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1735-0667"/>cessary waste of his time: boys might therefore be
                    advantageously employed to dip the bricks on the scaffold, and supply them in a
                    damp state to the bricklayer’s hand. A watering pot with a fine rose to it
                    should also be used to moisten the upper surface of the last laid course of
                    bricks, preparatory to strewing the mortar over it. In bricklaying with quick
                    setting cements these things are of even more importance; indeed, unless the
                    bricks are quite wet to be set with cement, it will not attach itself to them at
                    all.</p>
                <p>As mortar is a more yielding material, used in brick-work merely for the purpose
                    of making the detached portions of the staple adhere, by filling up their
                    interstices and producing exhaustion, and the object being to produce as
                    unyielding and consistent a mass as possible, as much of it should be used as is
                    sufficient to produce the desired result, and no more. No two bricks should be
                    allowed to touch, because of their inaptitude to adhere to each other; and no
                    space between them should be left unoccupied by mortar which may produce
                    adhesion. When the bricks are a fraction under two and a half inches thick, no
                    four courses of bricks and mortar, or brick-work, should exceed eleven inches in
                    height; and if they are fully that thickness, four courses should not reach
                    eleven and a half inches. The result of thick beds of mortar between the bricks
                    is, that the mortar is pressed out after the joint is drawn, on the outside, in
                    front; and being made convex instead of slightly concave, the joints catch every
                    drop of rain that may trickle down the face of the wall, and are thus saturated;
                    the moisture freezes, and in thawing bursts the mortar, which crumbles away, and
                    creates the necessity which is constantly recurring, of pointing the joints to
                    preserve the , wall. The diagram shows the section of a nine-inch wall, with the
                    joints on the side <hi rend="italic">a</hi> as drawn, and on the side <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> as bulged, in consequence of the quantity of mortar in them
                    yielding to the weight above. This, too, is in addition to the inconvenient
                    settling, which is the consequence of using too much mortar in the beds.</p>
                <p>In practice, bricklayers lay the mortar on the course last finished, and spread
                    it over the surface with the trowel, without considering, or caring for it, that
                    they have put no mortar between the bricks of that course, except in the
                    external edges of the outside joints; that the mortar is not, or ought not to
                    be, so thin as to fall into the joints by its own weight; and that unless they
                    press it down, half the height of the space between the bricks remains in every
                    case unoccupied, and the wall is consequently hollow, incompact, and necessarily
                    imperfect. To obviate this, it is common to have thick walls grouted in every
                    course; that is, mortar made liquid, and called grout, is poured on to, and
                    spread over the surface of the work, that it may run in and fill up the joints
                    completely. This, at the best, is but doing with grout what should be done with
                    mortar; and the difference between the two consisting merely in the difference
                    in the quantity of water they contain, mortar must be considered the best; for
                    the tendency of grout is, by hydrostatic pressure, to burst the wall in which it
                    is employed; and, moreover, it must, by taking a much longer time to dry and
                    shrink than the mortar of the beds and external joints, make and keep the whole
                    mass unstable, and tend to injure rather than benefit it. Filling or flushing up
                    every course with mortar is therefore far preferable, and may be done with very
                    little additional exertion on the part of the workmen.</p>
                <p>It is a very common thing for two sorts of mortar to be used in the same wall, a
                    finer and whiter for the outside, and a coarser for the inside work; the former
                    made of cleaner and finer sand, and a greater quantity of lime, than the latter,
                    with the intention of exposing a better looking and more durable material to the
                    view and the weather. The sand, we have already shown, ought to be as clean as
                    it can be made for mortar under all circumstances; therefore there should be no
                    possibility of making a difference in that particular; and the addition of a
                    greater quantity of lime than is necessary to make good mortar makes it less
                    durable, and occasions a sacrifice in an important quality for the sake of an
                    unimportant advantage. Moreover, the mortar which contains the greater quantity
                    of lime will yield or settle more than that which has the greater proportion of
                    sand.</p>
                <p>All the walls of a building that are to sustain the same floors and the same roof
                    should be carried on simultaneously; under no circumstances should more be done
                    in one part than can be reached from the same scaffold, until all the walls are
                    brought up to the same height, and the ends of the part first built should be
                    racked back, as at <hi rend="italic">α b,</hi> fig. 2, and not carried up
                    vertically with merely the toothing necessary for the bond, as at <hi
                    rend="italic">a b,</hi> fig. 3.</p>
                <p>Brick-work should never be carried on in frosty weather, nor even when it is
                    likely that frost will occur before the walls can be covered in and become so
                    dry as not to be affected by frost. Covering an unfinished wall with a thick
                    layer of straw, when frost may supervene, is a very useful precaution; on the
                    straw, weather boarding should be laid, to prevent access of moisture from rain
                    or snow. Merely wet weather may be guarded against by following the directions
                    given above as to flushing every course of the work well up with mortar, so that
                    no interstices be left into which water may insinuate itself, and by covering
                    the walls with boards to act as a coping when the men are not actually at work
                    on them; the joints in the face of a wall that is not to be plastered in any way
                    should be protected in this manner with great care.</p>
                <p>In ordinary practice the bricklayer’s scaffolds are carried up with the walls,
                    and are made to rest on them. Having built up the walls as high as he can
                    conveniently from the ground, and from a scaffold on trestles perhaps, he plants
                    a row of poles, which vary in height from thirty to forty and even fifty feet,
                    parallel to and at a distance of about four feet six inches from the walls, and
                    from twelve to fourteen feet apart. To these, which are called standards, are
                    attached by means of ropes other poles called ledgers, horizontally and on the
                    inside, with their upper surface on a level with the highest course of the wall
                    yet laid; and on the ledgers and wall short transverse poles called putlogs or
                    putlocks are laid as joists to carry the floor of scaffold boards. These
                    putlocks are placed about six or seven feet apart, according to the length and
                    strength of the scaffold boards; and the ends which rest on the walls are
                    carefully laid on the middle of a stretcher, so as to occupy the place of a
                    header brick, which is inserted when the scaffolds are struck after the work is
                    finished. On the floor of the scaffold thus formed the bricklayer stands, and
                    the materials are brought to him by labourers, in hods, from the ground below,
                    or they are hoisted up in baskets and buckets by means of a pulley wheel and
                    fall. The mortar is placed on ledged boards of about three feet square, placed
                    at convenient distances along the scaffold; and the bricks are strewn on the
                    scaffold between the mortar boards, leaving a clear way against the wall for the
                    workmen to move along unob-structedly. The workman then recommences the
                    operation of bricklaying, beginning at the extreme left of his course, and
                    advancing to the right until he reaches the angle or quoin in that direction, or
                    the place where his fellow-workman on the same side may have begun. Thus he goes
                    on with course after course until the wall is as high as he can conveniently
                    reach from that scaffold, when another ledger is tied to the poles, another row
                    of putlocks laid, and the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741748"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1748-0668"/>boards are removed up to the new level. The ledger
                    and most of the putlocks, however, remain to give steadiness to the temporary
                    structure, and so on to the full height of the wall, piecing out the poles by
                    additional lengths as may be required. If a scaffold be very much exposed, and
                    run to a great height, it must be braced. This is done by tying poles diagonally
                    across on the outside to the standards and ledgers, and it may be further
                    secured by tying the ends of some of the putlocks to the ledgers; but an outside
                    scaffold should never be attached in any way to the building about which it
                    stands. A scaffold should never be loaded heavily, as well on account of the
                    work as of the scaffold itself; for the putlocks resting, as they do, on single
                    bricks, in a green wall, they exert an injurious influence on it, which every
                    additional pound weight on the scaffold must necessarily increase. A constant
                    and steady supply of bricks and mortar on the part of the labourers, without
                    overloading the scaffold at any one time, should be strictly required. It would
                    indeed be an advantage if every scaffold were made with a double row of poles
                    and ledgers, one being on the inside, within a few inches of the wall. This
                    would obviate the necessity of resting the putlocks on the walls, and do away
                    with putlock holes; but the inner row of poles would be constantly in the way of
                    the bricklayer, who could not either set the bricks or draw the joints so well
                    as if he were unobstructed. Access is given to scaffolds by ladders, and by
                    inclined planes; the former are more commonly used externally, and the latter
                    internally.</p>
                <p>Arches in brick-work are plain, rough, cut, or gauged. Plain arches are built of
                    uncut bricks, and the bricks being parallelopipedons, an arch built of them must
                    be made out with mortar; that is, the difference between the outer and inner
                    periphery of the arch requiring the parts of which an arch is made up to be
                    wedge-formed, as at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which the brick is not, the
                    difference must be made in mortar, as at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> so that the
                    inner or lower angles of bricks used for this purpose should absolutely touch,
                    and the mortar should be more consistent than that used in ordinary walling; nor
                    should the centre on which an arch of this kind is set or built be struck or
                    removed until the work is absolutely dry, or rather all such arches should be
                    set in cement which will dry immediately. In consequence of this inherent defect
                    m uncut-brick arches, in extensive continuous works, such as sewers, tunnels,
                    vaults, &amp;c. it is advisable to make them in thin independent rings of
                    half-brick or one brick thick, as the case may be; that is, a nine-inch arch
                    should be in two half-brick arches, as at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 6, and
                    an eighteen-inch arch in two one-bricks, as at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> each
                    arch in the latter case being bonded in itself as in a common nine-inch wall
                    with headers and stretchers. It is evident that, by this mode of structure, a
                    greater quantity of the solid material comes into the back or outer ring or arch
                    than into the lower one; and it they had been bonded together into one arch, as
                    at <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> all that difference must have been made up with
                    mortar. Moreover, whatever pressure comes on the outer ring is carried by it
                    directly to the inner or lower, from whose joints, however, the mortar cannot
                    escape or be pressed out, the inner angles of the bricks, by meeting, preventing
                    it below, and the bricks themselves of the upper arch, which conveys the
                    pressure, are themselves opposed to the back of the same joints, so that its
                    power of resistance is made equal to that of the bricks themselves, except at
                    the ends; which, in such works as we have supposed, are remote, and may be
                    protected by the use of cement in their joints, whilst mortar is used in the
                    rest.</p>
                <p>Rough arches are those in which the bricks are roughly cut with an axe to a wedge
                    form, and are used over openings, such as doors and windows, when the work is to
                    be plastered on the outside, or in plain back fronts, cuthouses, garden-walls,
                    &amp;c. when, however, they are neatly pointed with what is called a tuck or
                    tucked joint Semicircular and elliptical arches are generally made plain, or
                    without cutting the bricks; but arches composed of a smaller segment of a circle
                    (vulgarly and technically called <hi rend="italic">scheme</hi> arches), if not
                    gauged, are cut or axed. Very flat arches are technically distinguished from the
                    quicker segment, or scheme, by the term camber, from the French word <hi
                    rend="italic">cambrer</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> to round like an
                    arch. It is arches of this kind which are generally employed over windows and
                    doors in external work, and they too are either cut or gauged.</p>
                <p>Gauged arches are composed of bricks which are cut and rubbed to gauges and
                    moulds, so as to form perfectly fitting parts, as in masonry. Gauging is equally
                    applicable to arches and to walling, as it means no more than the bringing every
                    brick exactly to <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> certain form, by cutting and rubbing,
                    or grinding it to a certain gauge or measure, so that it will exactly fit into
                    its place, as in the finer works of masonry. Gauged brick-work is set in a putty
                    instead of common mortar, but it is seldom used except for arches in the fronts
                    of houses, &amp;c. which are to be neatly finished. These are for the most part
                    straight, and are generally from eleven to twelve inches in depth, or the height
                    of four courses of brick-work. Their value as arches will be best understood by
                    reference to the diagram, fig. 7, by which it appears that all the material
                    between the soffit of the straight arch or head of the opening <hi rend="italic"
                    >b c,</hi> and the dotted line <hi rend="italic">b f</hi> c, is useless, the
                    intrados or soffit of the really efficient part of the arch being at that dotted
                    line itself. This is the arc of an angle of 60°; its chord, the width of the
                    opening, being the base of an equilateral triangle constructed on it, and the
                    joints are the radii of a circle whose centre is at <hi rend="italic">a. b
                    d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c e,</hi> the continuations of the sides of the
                    triangle or radii <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a c,</hi> are
                    technically termed the skew-back of the arch. Sometimes the arc is made that of
                    a more acute angle, in which case the skew-back is less, that is, the external
                    angles <hi rend="italic">c b d,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b c e,</hi> are less
                    obtuse; a smaller inavailable portion of the arch is thus left between the arc
                    and its chord, but that portion is less securely retained under the flatter
                    segment, because the joints or radii diverge less, or are more nearly parallel.
                    These gauged arches being, as they for the most part are, but a half brick in
                    thickness, and not being tied by a bond to anything behind them—for indeed
                    almost the whole, if not the whole, of their height, is occupied behind by the
                    reveal and the wooden lintel—require to be executed with great care and nicety.
                    It is a common fault with workmen to rub the bricks thinner behind than before,
                    to insureavery fine joint in front, which must tend to make it bowoutwards: it
                    should rather be inverted, if it be done at all, though the best work is that in
                    which the bricks are gauged to a perfect parallel in their lateral thickness.
                    Fig. 8 is a transverse section of fig. 7, and the gauged arch, lintel, &amp;c.
                    in it showing the total disconnection of the gauged arch with any surrounding
                    brick-work to which it might be bonded. The absurdity of constructing arches
                    circular on the plan, especially in a thin unbonded shell of bricks, is so clear
                    as hardly to require notice.</p>
                <p>Gauged facing to a wall is exceedingly objectionable, unless the bricks used for
                    the gauged work be originally a little larger than those which are to be worked
                    in behind, whose size should be their gauge, otherwise no bond can be kept
                    between the bulk of the wall and its face; and the same mortar or putty should
                    be used throughout, of equal consistence, and with joints of equal thickness, or
                    the work cannot be sound and compact.</p>
                <p>Everything relating to the construction of niches, groins, domes, &amp;c. may be
                    referred to the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Arch, Bridge?</hi><pb break="no"

                    >Stone-Masonry</hi>; the difference between stone and brick, as far as the
                    principle is concerned, being only in the comparative magnitude of the parts;
                    for to make perfect arches, &amp;c. it is clear that the bricks must be cut to
                    the same forms that are required in stone.</p>
                <p>It is generally held that nothing but its own components should be admitted into
                    a brick wall, except what is absolutely necessary for its connection with the
                    other parts of a building, such as wall-plates and wood-bricks (and that these
                    should be avoided as much as possible), templates, lintels, &amp;c. Wall-plates
                    are required to receive the ends of the joists, and distribute the weight of the
                    floor to which they belong equally along the walls. If the joists tailed singly
                    on the naked bricks, their thin edges would crush those immediately under them,
                    and the rest of the brickwork would escape immediate pressure altogether.
                    Wallplates may be superseded by the use of templates; but this involves the
                    necessity of framed floors, which are carried by a few large beams, under whose
                    ends stout pieces of timber three or four feet in length are placed. These are
                    intended, like a wall-plate, to distribute the weight over a considerable part
                    of the wall, and prevent the necessity of placing the beam on the naked friable
                    bricks, and are called templates. Lintels are used over square-headed windows
                    and doors, instead of arches in brick-work. They are useful to preserve the
                    square form and receive the joiner’s fittings, but they should always have
                    discharging arches over them, and should not tail into the wall at either end
                    more than a few inches, that the discharging arch be not wider than is
                    absolutely necessary. If, however, discharging arches be not turned over them,
                    the lintels should tail in at each end considerably, and have small templates or
                    wood bricks placed transversely under them, as shown in the diagram, fig. 9.
                    This indicates the elevation of the inside of part of an external wall with a
                    window in it, and shows the lintel over the latter, with a discharging arch over
                    it, and wood bricks under its ends, on the jambs of the opening. Discharging
                    arches should be turned over the ends of beams, and templates also, as in fig.
                    10. They may generally be quadrants of a circle, or even flatter, and should be
                    turned in two or more half bricks over doors and windows, and other wide
                    openings, but over the ends of beams they need not be in more than one half
                    brick.</p>
                <p>Wood bricks are used to prevent the necessity of driving wedges into the joints
                    of brick-work to nail the joiner’s work to. They are pieces of timber generally
                    cut to the size and shape of a brick, and worked in as bricks in the inner face
                    of a wall, where it is known the joiners have occasion for something of the
                    kind. This is principally in the jambs of the windows and doors for their
                    fittings, and along the walls, at proper heights, for the skirtings or
                    wainscotting, as the case may be.</p>
                <p>The use of bond timber in brick walls is objectionable, because of its liability
                    to shrink and swell, to decay, and to be consumed by fire, in any of which cases
                    the structure to which it belongs is either injured, endangered, or absolutely
                    destroyed. It is, however, valuable to tie the angles of walls, and to
                    distribute the various weights equally throughout the walls, thus tending to
                    prevent irregular settlements, whether arising from any defect in a foundation,
                    or from an extraordinary imposition of weight in any particular part. The
                    objections to bond timber depend on contingencies against which it may be in a
                    great degree protected by care and judicious management. If the timber be of a
                    durable sort, sound and well seasoned, neither shrinking nor swelling need be
                    feared if it be not placed in a damp situation, or where moisture can gain
                    access to it; nor will it decay if it be entirely incased in any thing, t <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> the total exclusion of the external atmosphere. If
                    timber be laid in the heart of a wall, it should be well imbedded in, and
                    flushed round and over with mortar, as we have shown that bricks should be for
                    other reasons; and if it be laid in the face of a wall, it should be only where
                    its exposed face can be effectually protected from access of moisture, as when
                    it is covered by the plasterer. Damage by fire is a remote contingency; and as
                    it may be confidently asserted that bond timber was never the-part of a
                    structure in which a fire commenced, except perhaps from some gross misplacement
                    of it, it is moreover the last combustible part that a fire could reach, and
                    therefore, when it is arrived at, almost all the damage that can be done has
                    already accrued. Bond timber certainly may be, and constantly is, exposed to all
                    the cited contingencies; but they generally arise from circumstances which it
                    may be in a greater or less degree protected from. Flat wrought-iron bars have
                    been recommended as ties in lieu of bond timber; but besides the equal liability
                    of that metal to decay if it be exposed to damp or to a confined atmosphere,
                    bars of it cannot be properly worked up or combined with brick-work; and its
                    susceptibility of changes of temperature renders it far more unfit than timber
                    to be compounded with materials whose greatest merits are firmness, and an
                    inaptitude to change under any circumstances. The frangibility of cast iron
                    makes it also exceedingly objectionable as a bond or tie in brick walls.</p>
                <p>It will be generally found that a brick wall built with mortar and faced with
                    ashlar has settled inward to a greater or less extent, as the work has been more
                    or less carefully performed. Indeed in the nature of things it cannot be
                    otherwise, unless the brick backing be worked in some cement which sets and
                    hardens at once; for the outer face is composed of a layer of unyielding
                    material, with few and very thin joints, which perhaps do not occupy a fiftieth
                    part of its extent, while the back is built up of an infinity of small parts,
                    with fully one eighth its height of joints, which are composed of material that
                    must both yield to pressure and shrink in drying. Some part of the ill effect
                    attendant on this is obviated by the bond-stones, which tail in or run through
                    the wall, and tend to keep the discordant materials together; but still much of
                    it remains: and besides this, the internal or cross walls, which have no stone
                    in them, will either settle down and shrink away from the external walls, or
                    drag them inward, as they happen to be well or ill bonded or tied. For these
                    reasons, brick-work built in this manner with masonry should be executed with
                    exceedingly well-tempered mortar, made with no more lime than is absolutely
                    necessary to cement the particles of sand together, and the sand again to the
                    bricks, worked as stiff as it can be, and laid in as thin courses as may be to
                    answer the purpose required of it. Above all, work of this kind must not be
                    hurried, but allowed time to dry and shrink as it goes on.</p>
                <p>Discharging arches over vacuities having been disposed of incidentally, we have
                    now only to speak of them under openings, in which situation their use is to
                    distribute the superincumbent weight equally over the substructure, or along the
                    foundation, as the case may be. For this purpose the arch is inverted, as shown
                    in the diagram, fig. 14, and by means of it the weight brought down by the piers
                    is carried along the footings, which are thus equally borne upon throughout
                    their whole length. Arches of two half bricks are indicated here, that being
                    sufficient for ordinary purposes, and to develope the principle; in large and
                    heavy works, arches of three half bricks, and even greater, may be judged
                    necessary. Any arc between a quadrant and a semicircle may be used with
                    advantage; but an arc of less than 45° cannot be recommended for the inverted
                    discharging arch under piers. If it should so happen that an old well or
                    cess-pool, that cannot without great inconvenience and expense be filled up with
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741774" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1774-0670"/> sound
                    walling, or in some other efficient manner, or other irremediably bad place,
                    occur in a foundation, and fall under a pier, the ground being sound on either
                    side of it, a second discharging arch may be formed under the pier and over the
                    unsound part, resting its legs on, or springing from, the inverted arch under
                    the opening, and on the sound ground, as indicated by the dotted arch in the
                    last quoted diagram, fig. 14.</p>
                <p>Not the least important part of the bricklayer’s art is the formation of chimney
                    and other flues. Great tact is required in gathering over properly above the
                    fire-place, so as to conduct the smoke into the smaller flue, which itself
                    requires to be built with great care and precision, that it be not of various
                    capacity in different parts, in one place contracted to a narrow strait, and in
                    another more widely expanded, and so on. With the present imperfect means of
                    cleaning chimney flues, it is absolutely necessary that they be of a certain
                    magnitude, which should be carefully maintained throughout; but it would be
                    better that they were made oval, or with the angles taken off at least, than
                    parallelograms in plan, as the practice is. Chimney flues are plastered or
                    pargetted with a mortar in which a certain proportion of cow-dung is mixed,
                    which prevents it from cracking and peeling off with the heat to which it is
                    exposed. Experiment has proved that a tapering and nearly cylindrical flue of
                    much smaller bore than is now required is the best for carrying away smoke; and
                    with a more humane and more efficient mode of cleaning, such a one would be
                    unexceptionable. Of course, too, the bore should be regulated by the size of the
                    fire-place, or rather by the quantity of smoke to which it is required to give
                    vent.</p>
                <p>Sewers and drains which are not cylindrical should be built with concave bottoms,
                    although the sides be parallel and the covering horizontal. The concave channel
                    keeps the stream more together, and enables it the better to carry its
                    impurities along with it; whereas a flat-bottomed drain offers a large surface
                    for the particles of soil to attach themselves to, and the stream of water,
                    being more scattered, is less efficient in force. All drains in houses and in
                    other places where it may be necessary to open them at any time, should be of
                    the form of which <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                    fig. 11, is a section, with a flat covering of stone paving, or large, strong,
                    paving tiles, set and jointed with cement. Gunbarrel drains, as at 6, are the
                    best in exposed situations, because they are the strongest; but as there is no
                    mode of cleaning but by breaking them up, if they are too long to be raked, they
                    should not be employed except with a considerable fall, and a frequent or
                    constant stream of water through them, as from a pump-trough, rain-water trunks,
                    &amp;c. They are constructed on a barrelled centre, which the bricklayer drags
                    on as he advances with his work, finishing as he goes. Large sewers, which are
                    accessible from the ends by men to clear or remove any accidental obstructions,
                    are best circular or elliptical; the latter of the two is generally preferred,
                    because, in proportion to its capacity, its height is greater; but most
                    frequently the sides of large sewers are made vertical and parallel, with a
                    flat, inverted arch below, and a semicircular head, as at c. This form, however,
                    it is evident, is disqualified to resist lateral pressure to any extent; nor
                    indeed is the circular or elliptical sewer secure in its arched form, unless the
                    weight above is sufficient to counteract any force the sides may be subjected
                    to. No drain should have an inclination or fall of less than one quarter of an
                    inch to a foot; and where the stream is infrequent and dull, as much more would
                    be a great advantage. In building drains it is of great importance that proper
                    traps should be constructed to prevent the return of smelR and the passage of
                    vermin. At every sink there should be a bell-trap, and a well-trap within that,
                    or near the hither end of the drain. Suppose a drain of the form of that shown
                    at ö, fig. 11, nine inches wide and nine inches deep, leading from a kitchen or
                    scullery to the common sewer of the house, in which it meets that which comes
                    from the water-closet and other places. The bell-trap in the sink itself will
                    prevent the return of smell when it is constantly in use, but it is liable to be
                    broken and otherwise injured by the ignorance and impatience of servants and
                    others, or it may become dry by evaporation in some situations; it is therefore
                    necessary to have a trap not so liable to contingencies. Let a well be made
                    eighteen inches or two feet in diameter, square or round, and two feet six
                    inches or three feet deep, across and below the level of the drain, as shown in
                    the plan, fig. 12, and longitudinal section of the same, fig. 13; it must be
                    built around with brick, in cement, and be plastered on the inside with the same
                    material, which will make it capable of retaining fluids. Uprightly across this
                    well, and in the transverse direction of the drain, must be placed a sound piece
                    of paving stone, so long that its ends maybe inserted in the sides of the well,
                    as shown in fig. 12, and so wide that its upper edge shall touch the covering of
                    the drain, and that its lower may reach six or nine inches down into the well
                    below the bottom of the drain. Mortar or cement must prevent the passage of air
                    between the upper edge of this trap-stone and the cover of the well and drain,
                    and the trap is complete. The water coming from the sink flows along the drain
                    from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (fig. 13), where it
                    falls into the well, and filling it up to that level, it flows on again from c
                    in the direction of <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> to the cess-pool or common sewer,
                    from which, however, no smell can return; for the trap-stone <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi> the lower half of which is thus immersed in water, completely bars the
                    passage. It is evident, however, that if the well should leak, the water in it
                    may fall below the lower edge of the stone, and the efficiency of the trap be
                    destroyed; but if it be made perfect in the first instance, there can be no
                    danger of any inconvenience that a bucket of water thrown in at the sink will
                    not cure. It is from the drying up of the water in these well-traps (vulgarly
                    called <hi rend="italic">stink-traps')</hi> that uninhabited houses are so
                    frequently offensive. It must be clear, moreover, that these traps form an
                    effectual bar to vermin, and they may therefore be advantageously placed at the
                    entrance of water-closet drains, to prevent rats from getting at the soilpipes,
                    which they will gnaw and destroy if they can get access to them. Internal
                    drains, or those which go through a house, should always pass under the doorways
                    if possible, and above the inverted arch, which should be always found under
                    them, in external walls at least. If, however, circumstances should render it
                    absolutely necessary to take a drain through a wall, an arched ring or bull’s
                    eye should be made for it to pass by.</p>
                <p>Cess-pools should be made cylindrical, and be bricked round; but whether they are
                    made to retain fluids or not, can seldom be a matter of consequence, as they are
                    generally put in secluded places, where, if the object benot to get rid of the
                    waste, there is seldom, at least, any desire to retain it. In towns and cities
                    where the common sewerage is as complete as it should be, and water-closets are
                    used instead of privies, cess-pools are unnecessary, as the soil becomes so much
                    diluted by the water that goes down with it, that it flows readily enough
                    through the private drains to the common sewer, and so on with the rest, to the
                    common receptacle. Sometimes, indeed, it may be found necessary to clean out the
                    well-traps, but this cannot often occur.</p>
                <p>The construction of ovens and furnaces, and well-steen-ing, are certainly within
                    the range of the bricklayers art, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741787"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1787-0671"/>but as they are not immediately connected with our
                    present subject, they do not come within the scope of this article.</p>
                <p>Brick and the paving is performed by the bricklayer. Brick paving is either flat,
                    or on edge, in sand, or in mortar or cement. Brick flat paving in sand, that is,
                    with the bricks laid on their broadest surfaces, and bedded in and on dry sand,
                    is very slight and fragile, and brick flat paving set and bedded in mortar is
                    very little better; for if the soil on which the paving is laid be light and
                    sandy, the bricks are easily displaced by being pressed unequally; and if it be
                    clayey it will probably be moist, and the thin porous brick absorbing the
                    moisture, will generally become saturated, and present a damp, unwholesome
                    floor. Paving with bricks on their edges, however, forms a much better floor,
                    and is preferable to a stone paving, if the latter be laid on the ground without
                    the intervention of footings. Brick-on-edge paving in sand is generally used in
                    beer cellars, pantries, dairies, stables, &amp;c. as its numerous open joints
                    allow wasted or discharged fluids readily to escape; and it is both cool and dry
                    under ordinary circumstances. In mortar or cement, bricks on their edges form a
                    sound, dry floor; the smallness of the surface exposed by each brick in this
                    manner leaves them of course less susceptible of partial pressures, and the
                    depth from the soil to the surface is such that damp rarely shows through. The
                    paving brick differs from the common brick only in thickness, its dimension in
                    that direction being rather less than two inches instead of two inches and a
                    half, and in being rather harder and more compact. Dutch clinkers are paving
                    bricks, smaller and much harder than the English; they are six inches long,
                    three inches wide, and one inch and a half thick, and are always set on edge and
                    herringboned; that is, instead of being placed in parallel lines, they are set
                    at right angles to each other thus,—with nevertheless a perfectly even face.
                    Paving tiles are made nine inches and a half and eleven inches and a half
                    square, though they are called ten inch and twelve inch or foot tiles
                    respectively, the former being one inch, and the latter one inch and a half
                    thick; they are set in courses, as stone paving would be. Paving tiles make a
                    neater, but not so sound and durable a pavement, as brick on edge.</p>
                <p>Tiling being much less in vogue than formerly, in consequence of the better
                    appreciation of the superior qualities of slate for covering roofs, and the
                    moderate cost at which slates are now furnished to the builder, it no longer
                    maintains its separate artificer, but is performed, when it is required, by the
                    bricklayer. It consists, for the most part, of two sorts—plain tiling and pan
                    tiling. Plain tiles are simple parallelograms, generally about ten inches and a
                    half in length, six inches wide, and five eighths of an inch thick; and each
                    tile has a hole pierced through it near one end, to receive the wooden pin by
                    which it is hooked on to the lath. The tiles are laid in mortar on the laths,
                    which in this country are of oak or fir, with an overlap of six, seven, or eight
                    inches. The greatest overlap or smallest gauge makes the securest work, though
                    it does not present so good an appearance externally as a longer gauge does; and
                    it requires, moreover, a greater number of tiles and laths, thereby adding
                    materially both to the weight and the cost. The great overlap and the mortar are
                    both necessary, nevertheless, to prevent the rain and snow from driving in
                    between and under the tiles. Plain tiling requires the pitch of the roof to be
                    at an angle of at least fiθ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>, and is one of the
                    heaviest coverings that can be used, though it is at the same time one of the
                    warmest. The tiles, however, readily and rapidly absorb moisture, which they
                    communicate to the laths and rafters under them, to the serious injury of both
                    the latter; and the mortar in which they are set requires to be frequently
                    pointed, the constant atmospheric changes to which it is exposed occasioning it
                    to crumble and fall away in a very short time.</p>
                <p>Pan tiles are parallelograms of irregular surface, straight in the direction of
                    their length, which is thirteen inches and a half, but twisted to this form in
                    the trans verse section. Measuring the whole surface across, a tile is nine
                    inches wide, but in a right line from point to point not more than seven, and
                    its thickness is half an inch; a small tongue or lip is bent down at one end,
                    from its flatter convexity, on the under side, to hook it on to the lath by,
                    instead of a wooden pin through it, as in a plain tile. Pan tiles are set dry or
                    in mortar, on laths. They are not laid side by side, but overlapping laterally,
                    thus; consequently all the overlap they have longitudinally is three or four
                    inches only, or enough to prevent rain and snow from driving up under the upper,
                    over the end of the lower tile; and thence pan tiling is but little more than
                    half the weight of plain tiling. It is nevertheless a much less warm covering
                    for houses, and is more liable to be injured by violent gales or gusts of wind,
                    than the latter is; but again, it presents a far more pleasing appearance to the
                    eye. Pan tiling will not bear a much flatter pitch than the other, but it is
                    greatly improved by being pointed on the inside with lime and hair; sometimes
                    indeed the whole of the work is, as we have said, set in mortar; but this mode
                    has disadvantages to which pointing internally is not liable, and its
                    superiority in other respects is questionable. To both pan and plain tiling
                    there is a large concave tile used to cover the hips and ridges of a roof. These
                    are not generally made to overlap each other in any situation, but are set in
                    mortar, and fastened with nails and hooks fitted for the purpose.</p>
                <p>When the top of a brick wall is not protected by a roof, it must be covered or
                    coped in some manner, or it will soon be destroyed by the weather. Sometimes
                    this is done by means of a course of bricks set across it on their edges in
                    cement, and called a barge course, but it is a very imperfect covering, for
                    water will trickle down the face of the wall on both sides, as the coping brick
                    can be no longer than the thinnest wall is in thickness. Two double courses of
                    plain tiles may be put side by side under the barge course, making a projection
                    over either face of about one inch and a half; thus,—</p>
                <p>This is much better than the barge course alone: but still the covering possesses
                    no inclination outwards to throw the water off; the upper surfaces are all
                    horizontal. The same objection exists to foot-paving tiles, which are also used
                    as a coping; but none of these methods is available for any wall above nine
                    inches in thickness. Stone coping, therefore, which may be made of sufficient
                    width, and be both weathered and throated, is much to be preferred.</p>
                <p>One of the greatest faults in the modern practice of building, both
                    architecturally as a matter of taste, and practically as a matter of prudence,
                    is, that these copings, and cornices which serve as such, do not project
                    sufficiently to protect the face of the wall on which they may be placed, from
                    the weather. A bold, massive, and well-projected cornice on a wall serves as a
                    roof or pent-house to it, and, besides imparting great beauty to the plainest
                    structure, protects the wall from the premature decay of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193741800" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1800-0672"/>its upper part especially,
                    and of the joints generally, if it be unplastered brick-work, which thereby
                    calls for the constant repetition of pointing. Effective and pleasing cornices
                    and blocking courses may be formed with uncut bricks alone; and these, set in
                    cement, would, with judicious management, add materially both to the appearance
                    and durability of brick-work, without the foreign aid of the plasterer or
                    mason.</p>
                <p>From the injury which accrues to· the joints of brickwork through bad management
                    in its execution, and imperfect protection when executed, arises the necessity
                    so frequent at the present day of pointing.</p>
                <p>Sometimes frost will have supervened before the surfaces of the joints in a wall
                    are dry; consequently the mortar bursts and peels away, and the whole then
                    requires to be pointed. Preparatory to this operation the scaffold, if it has
                    been struck, must be re-erected, the mortar raked out of the joints to a depth
                    of about three eighths of an inch, or deeper if the injury have reached further
                    ;—this can be done by a labourer ;—a brick-layer then goes over the whole with a
                    hard hair-brush and water to cleanse and moisten the joints; and then, with
                    mortar prepared for the purpose, he carefully fills them all up, and neatly
                    draws them with his trowel. This mortar must be of the best quality; it is
                    generally compounded with a certain proportion of forge ashes, which gives it a
                    blue tinge, and greatly aids its power of resisting the action of the weather.
                    Cement is sometimes used instead of this blue mortar. If the wall to be pointed
                    be a front or other important one, in which peculiar neatness is required, every
                    joint is marked with a narrow parallel ridge of a fine white putty, in the
                    composition of which bone lime forms a principal ingredient. The former is
                    called flat-joint, and the latter tuck-pointing. If it be an old wall that
                    requires pointing, a scaffold must be erected before it; and where the putlocks
                    cannot be rested on window sills and the like, half bricks are generally drawn
                    from the wall to make rests for them, and restored again when the work is done.
                    The former process is then gone through with a common wall; but if it require
                    tuck-pointing, the whole surface is well washed, and then coloured, to look like
                    new, before the pointing is done. The gauged arches over the windows and doors
                    are always coloured, and the joints drawn with peculiar neatness. If in the
                    original building of the wall the perpends have not been preserved, that is, if
                    the vertical joints have not been made to fall perpendicularly in the
                    alternately recurring courses, the workman in pointing stops up the old joints,
                    which are irregular, with putty of a brick colour, and forms false new ones in
                    the proper places.</p>
                <p>The tools and implements mostly employed by the bricklayer are the trowel, the
                    plumb-rule, the level, the square, the bevel, line-pins and lines, the raker,
                    and the hammer, together with a hod and spade for his labourer. Besides these
                    there are sundry others used in cutting and gauging bricks, and some which are
                    peculiar to tiling and paving; but the most material operations can be performed
                    with those enumerated here. A pug-mill and screens for mixing and tempering
                    mortar are also auxiliaries of great importance. ’</p>
                <p>Brick-work is valued by the rod. A rod of brick-work is a quantity whose
                    superficies is 272∣ feet (taken in practice at the round number 272 without the
                    fraction), and thickness one brick and a half. Reckoning the one brick and a
                    half at thirteen inches and a half,—its average extent,— the cubic foot is to
                    the reduced superficial foot as eight to nine, so that a <hi rend="italic"
                    >cubic</hi> rod of brick-work consists of 306 feet, the result of 272 multiplied
                    by nine and divided by eight. The reduced superficial rod, however, is that
                    commonly used in practice; and the process of measuring, to ascertain the
                    quantities and bring them to a standard, is as follows :—</p>
                <p>The exact superficies of so much of a wall as may be of the same thickness is
                    taken, and the number of bricks it is in thickness placed marginally; all the
                    different portions or parts being of the same thickness are taken in like
                    manner, and then deductions, as of window openings and doorways, are taken as
                    such, in superficies, with their respective thicknesses placed marginally also.
                    The dimensions, on being squared, are abstracted in half bricks, the deductions
                    made of like thicknesses from like thicknesses, and the whole reduced by
                    multiplying each quantity by the number of half bricks in the thickness of the
                    parts of the wall which the margin expresses, and dividing the product by three
                    (the number of half bricks in one brick and a half, the standard), the reduced
                    quantity which results, divided again by 272, the number of feet in a rod, gives
                    the quantity of rods and feet in the wall; as, for example,—The frontwall of a
                    house is thirty-five feet in length on the ground floor. (Fig. 14.) It has a
                    basement story twelve feet high from the top of the footings to the level of the
                    ground floor, and two and a half bricks thick, which is a half brick more than
                    the wall above. The footings are three spreading courses high, each course a
                    half brick thicker than the one above it. In the basement wall there are a door
                    and two windows, the former seven feet by three feet six inches between the
                    reveals, and the latter five feet by three feet nine inches between the reveals
                    also. The measurement of thus much will show how all the rest must be done.</p>
                <p>The footings consisting of three equally spreading courses, the extent of the
                    middle one both in length and breadth will be an average of them all, so that
                    they may be taken in one height. To the length of the ground floor, thirty-five
                    feet, must be added twice three sets-off of one fourth of a brick at each end of
                    the basement, and of the two first courses of footings for the length of the
                    second of them; this is equal to three half bricks, or thirteen and a half
                    inches, which, added to thirty-five feet, makes thirty-six feet one and a half
                    inch the dimension of length for the footings, by nine inches, their height;
                    their average thickness, to be placed in the margin, is three and a half bricks,
                    the highest course being three bricks, the second three and a half, and the
                    third or lowest four bricks. That is the first quantity. The next is of the wall
                    above. The length (one half brick, for the two sets-off, added to thirty-five
                    feet, gives) thirty-five feet four and a half inches, by the height twelve feet,
                    two and a half bricks thick. The deductions are seven feet by three feet six
                    inches in one brick for the door, between the reveals, and seven feet four and a
                    half inches by four feet three inches in one and a half brick behind the
                    re-Ýeals, the rest of the thickness of the wall, an addition of one half brick
                    being made to the height, and of two half . .</p>
                <p>bricks to the width, because of the reveals. The windows are taken in exactly the
                    same manner, with the same additions; but as the two are of the same size, their
                    number</p>

                <p>is marked against the one dimension. The dimensions are now to be squared, and
                    the squaring is done by duodecimals, or cross-multiplication. 36 feet 11 inches
                    × ∙9 inches = 27 feet 1 inch; 35 feet 4⅜ inches × 12 feet is =424 feet 6 inches,
                    and so on with the rest. An abstract is then made of these quantities in two
                    columns, the first is marked “one half brick,” and the second “deductions in
                    that thickness.” In the first column is placed the first quantity, multiplied by
                    seven, the number of half bricks in three and a half, which stands marginally to
                    it; 24 feet 6 inches × 7 = 189 feet 7 inches. The second dimension follows in
                    the same column, multiplied by five, the number of half bricks in its thickness;
                    the next quantity is a deduction, that is placed in the second column,
                    multiplied by two, the thickness of the part deducted being one brick, and the
                    rest in the same manner. The abstract being completed, the columns are added,
                    and the amount of the second deducted from that of the first, and the difference
                    divided by three, which brings it to the reduced standard. Dividing now by 272,
                    the number of rods and feet in the given wall appears to be 2 rods, 185 feet, 8
                    inches. The quantities are more generally abstracted in one-brick and one and a
                    half brick columns, with deductions in other parallel columns, to which
                    thicknesses they are all readily brought. The single column in one half brick
                    is, however, assumed here as the more simple and the more easily explained.</p>
                <p>It must be remembered, that in taking the return or end walls, the thickness of
                    that which has been already taken in front is to be deducted from their length,
                    or the anglepier or quoin will be taken twice. Work which is circular on the
                    plan may be taken separately, and charged at a higher price altogether, or it
                    may be measured as plain, and an extra taken at so much the superficial foot.
                    Chimney breasts are taken as additional quantities, with the thicknesses they
                    project, and the opening for the fireplace is deducted; but the flucs are
                    measured as solid, the extra labour and mortar in forming and pargetting them
                    being fully equal in value to the bricks saved.</p>
                <p>A rod of brick-work will consume about 4500 bricks, though the number will be a
                    few more or less than this, as the bricks happen to be below or above the
                    average size, and as the joints are made thicker or thinner. The quantity of
                    mortar, it is evident, will be affected by the latter consideration also; but in
                    London it is generally reckoned at from ninety to a hundred striked bushels, or
                    from four to four and a half cart loads, each containing about one cubic yard,
                    to the rod. The labour on a rod of brick-work may be taken on an average at the
                    wages of a bricklayer, and his assistant or labourer, for four days; this,
                    however, does not include making and beating the mortar, nor scaffolding, which
                    latter must be separately considered. Many things will, however, affect the time
                    in which the work may be performed, both of the bricklayer and his labourer; the
                    former can do one fourth as much more, at the least, in walls which are to be
                    plastered, as in those in which he has to keep the perpends and draw the joints,
                    &amp;c., and more in thick walls than in thin ones; and the capability of the
                    latter will depend, inversely, on the rate at which the former can proceed, on
                    the distance he may have to carry the bricks and mortar to the foot of the
                    ladder, and mainly on the height he has to carry the materials up the ladder. In
                    great heights, however, the materials should always be hoisted.</p>
                <p>Gauged arches are taken at so much per foot superficial, in addition to being
                    measured in as brick-work. Both the vertical and horizontal surfacer are
                    measured to obtain the superficies of the arch, or rather of the work upon it.
                    Rough arches are also taken as an extra superficial quantity; but plain arches
                    in vaults, &amp;c. and discharging arches, are not considered extras, though an
                    allowance is made for cutting to moulds, for inverted discharging arches, at per
                    foot run.</p>
                <p>If a wall be faced with bricks of a more costly sort than that of which the bulk
                    is composed, or worked in a peculiar manner, it is calculated by the foot
                    superficial, also in addition to its measurement as brick-work. It should be a
                    matter of previous agreement whether or not there shall be an extra charge for
                    plumbing quoins and reveals. Under ordinary circumstances no allowance is made
                    for it; but oblique vertical angles, both internal and external, which require
                    to have bricks neatly cut to form them, are taken at so much per foot running
                    measure. External oblique angles are technically termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >squint-quoins,</hi> and internal, <hi rend="italic">birds-mouth.</hi> Oblique
                    angles within a building are taken as run of cut splay. Cuttings to rakes or
                    inclined straight lines are taken by the running foot also, but with reference
                    to the thickness of the wall. Cuttings to ramps or concave lines are measured
                    and valued in the same manner. Sailing or projecting courses, preparations for
                    plaster cornices, and brick cornices themselves, are all taken at so much per
                    foot run, according to the labour and materials involved in working them, over
                    and above the regular charge for the brick-work by the rod.</p>
                <p>Every thing, indeed, which adds to the labour of executing brick-work, and
                    consumes more than the ordinary quantity of materials, is taken in addition,
                    either by the foot superficial, or by the foot running, or in numbers, as the
                    setting of chimney-pots, bedding and pointing door and sash-frames, &amp;c.
                    Bond-timbers, lintels, and wallplates, are generally measured in with the
                    brick-work, on account of the trouble of bedding them, and the delay generally
                    occasioned to the bricklayer in setting them. If they are not included with the
                    brick-work, bedding them is an extra charge, at so much per foot run; and then
                    filling in between the ends of the joists and beams generally requires to be
                    taken also.</p>
                <p>Brick-nogging is measured by the superficial yard, including the quarterings and
                    interties, and making no deductions but for openings. Drains and sewers are
                    measured by the foot run, according to their form and capacity. The quantity of
                    materials consumed, and labour required in constructing them, maybe readily
                    obtained by calculating the one, and observing the quantity a man with a
                    labourer can execute under the circumstances, whatever they may be, within a
                    given time.</p>
                <p>Paving is measured by the superficial yard of nine feet; tiling by the square of
                    one hundred feet ;—eaves courses, ridges, and hips, being extra charges, by the
                    foot run. Pointing, whether to old or new work, is measured by the superficial
                    foot; and the scaffolding for it, when scaffolding is required, is either
                    included in the price per foot for pointing, or a charge is made for the use of
                    it, together with the cost of carting, and the men’s time in setting up and
                    removing it.</p>

                    It will, however, be necessary to give a few particulars here on masons’ work,
                    as it has to do with other artificers’ works in the process of building, and
                    especially with reference to various species of walling, or modes of
                    constructing walls of stone.</p>
                <p>From the regular and determined form of bricks, modes or systems for setting or
                    arranging them may be formed, and any workman, by habit and an exertion of
                    memory merelv, may become competent to build a brick wall as well as it can be
                    built; but it is not so with stone used in common masonry walling. The workman
                    in this material has for the most part to do with masses of all forms and of all
                    sizes, and a continual exercise of the judgment is <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193741826" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1826-0674"/>required from him beyond the
                    tact or skill which may be acquired by practice. For this reason workmen are
                    generally less to be trusted to themselves, or to their own discretion, in stone
                    than even in brick-laying or walling. The best or highest sort of stone walling
                    is the easiest to set; it is that in which the stones are all tooled and gauged
                    in regular parallelogramic figures, to range in courses and suit the thickness
                    of the wall to which they are to belong; and the most difficult to execute
                    properly is that in which amorphous stones are used,—the mason being allowed
                    merely to dress them roughly with his hammer or axe, and fit them in as he best
                    can to form the most compact mass: this is called rubble walling.</p>
                <p>From the brittle nature of stone, great tact is required in setting, to prop or
                    bear up the longer pieces in every part, or they will break across, and thus
                    occasion more injury than could accrue if their whole mass bad been made up of
                    small pieces. Very long lengths, therefore, should be avoided, even in regular
                    tooled courses, with which the bearing is or should be perfectly even, and a
                    settling down of the work itself is hardly to be feared. There is a certain
                    medium which may be preserved; and although the object is obviously, in stone as
                    in brick walls, to form a compact mass, as unbroken into parts as possible, a
                    mason will act more judiciously in breaking a long stone into two or more
                    shorter ones, and working them in in that state, though he thus makes two or
                    more additional joints, well knowing that he has the power of counteracting to a
                    certain extent the ill effect of joints made by himself, but that those made by
                    accident are irremediably injurious.</p>
                <p>The observations made in the section of this article on bricklaying, on the use
                    of mortar, will apply here also. Of whatever quality the stone may be of which a
                    wall is to be built, it should consist as much of stone and as little of mortar
                    as possible. If it be inferior in durability and power of resisting the action
                    of the atmosphere, &amp;c. to the mortar, besides the certain fact that the
                    mortar will yield until it has set hard, and so far act injuriously, no ulterior
                    good is gained; and if the stone be the more durable material, the more of it
                    that enters into the wall the better. Indeed, in rough walling, if the stones be
                    pressed together until the more prominent angles on their faces come into actual
                    contact, the interstices being occupied by mortar, it will be better than if a
                    thick yielding mass were allowed to remain between them. Absolute contact,
                    however, should not be permitted, any more than in brick-work, lest the
                    shrinking of the mortar in drying leave the stones to such unequal bearing as
                    the prominent parts alone would afford. Stone being generally of a less
                    absorbent nature than brick, it is not a matter of so much importance that it be
                    wetted before setting; nevertheless, adhesion on the part of the mortar is more
                    certain and more complete if the stones be worked in in at least a damp state.
                    What bond is, and the necessity for it, have also been shown in the preceding
                    section; and bond is of not less importance in stone walling than in
                    bricklaying. We have also hinted above at the greater difficulty of
                    understanding, forming, and preserving it in the former, and can now only add a
                    few observations in addition that can be of any use, and these with reference to
                    rubble walling particularly. Instead of carefully making the joints recur one
                    over the other in alternate cours <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> es, as with
                    bricks and gauged stones, the joints should as carefully be made to lock, so as
                    to give the strength of two or three courses or layers between a joint in one
                    course, and one that may occur vertically over it in another. In bonding through
                    a wall, or transversely, it is much better that many stones should reach two
                    thirds across, alternately from the opposite sides, than that there should be a
                    few thorough stones, or stones extending the whole thickness of the wall.
                    Indeed, one of the many faults of stone-masons is that of making a wall consist
                    of two scales or thin sides, with thorough stones now and then laid across to
                    bind them together, the core being made up of mortar and small rubble merely.
                    This is a mode of structure that should be carefully guarded against. There is
                    no better test of a workman’s tact and judgment in rubble walling than the
                    building of a drywall, or a wall without mortar, affords ;—walls are frequently
                    built with mortar that without it would have fallen down under their own weight
                    in a height of six feet, in consequence of their defective construction;—thus
                    rendering it evident that they are only held together by the tenacity of the
                    mortar, which is very seldom an equivalent for a proper bond of stone. Masons
                    are very apt to set thin broad stones on their narrow edges to show a good face,
                    by which the wall is injured in two ways; it tends to the formation of a mere
                    case on the surface of a wall, and it for the most part exposes the bed of the
                    stone to the atmosphere, as a stone is more likely to be broad in the direction
                    of its bed than across it.</p>
                <p>Rubble walling is either coursed or uncoursed. In the latter sort, fig. 15, the
                    work is carried on with stones of any sizes, as they may occur, and without
                    reference to their heights, somewhat in the manner of the Cyclopaean walling of
                    antiquity; the interstices of the larger being filled up with smaller stones.
                    For this work the mason uses no tool but the trowel to lay on the mortar, the
                    scabling hammer to break off the most repulsive irregularities from the stones,
                    and the plumb-rule to keep his work perpendicular. The line and level are
                    equally unnecessary, as the work is independent of considerations which are
                    affected by them. An attentive and intelligent workman will, however, make a
                    sound wall with this species of construction, by fitting the stones well
                    together and packing them with as little mortar as possible, yet filling every
                    crevice with it, and carefully bonding through to secure compactness,
                    transversely at the least.</p>
                <p>In coursed rubble walling, fig. 16, the line and level are used, the work is laid
                    in courses, each course being carefully brought up to the same level in itself,
                    though no attention is paid to uniformity in the heights of the different
                    courses. For this species of walling the stones are generally roughly dressed by
                    the workman in the gross before he begins building. He is careful to get
                    parallel beds to them, and he brings the best face of each stone to a tolerably
                    even surface at right angles to the beds; the ends, too, receive some little
                    attention, and for this purpose he uses an axe in addition to his scabling
                    hammer. The quoins in coursed rubble walling are generally built with peculiar
                    neatness and precision, and they are set to serve as gauge courses for the rest.
                    This, when well executed, makes a sound and excellent wall. It presents,
                    however, rather a rough and homely appearance, and in finer works must be
                    covered with stucco or cement, or faced with ashlar.</p>
                <p>Ashlar is an external rind of gauged stones in equal courses, having tooled or
                    closely-fitting joints to give a wall a neat and uniform appearance; it is axed,
                    tooled, or rubbed, as may be thought most in character with the structure, or
                    that part of it to which it is to belong. Ashlar stones, or ashlars as they are
                    commonly called, are made of various sizes on the surface, as the character or
                    the edifice may require or convenience demand, and vary in thickness from five
                    to eight or nine inches. Some o the ashlar stones must, it is clear, be used
                    transversely as bond stones, or the facing, having nothing to connect it with
                    the wall behind, would soon totter and fall, born stones are generally put in
                    alternate courses, with the backing to the jambs of openings, such as windows,
                    an oftener, if these do not recur within a length of five or six <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193741839" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1839-0675"/>feet; the bond stones
                    themselves, too, should not fall in the same vertical chain, except when they
                    are in the jambs of openings, but break in their alternate courses. Ashlar is
                    commonly set in a fine mortar or in putty. It is generally recommended that
                    ashlars should not be made regular parallelopipedons, but run back irregularly
                    to tooth in with the backing, the vertical joints being left open from about an
                    inch within the face of the wall, and the upper surface or bed of the stones
                    made narrower than, though perfectly parallel to, the lower. These things may
                    exert a slightly beneficial influence under some circumstances; but the mode of
                    construction involved is so radically bad, that unless the backing is set in a
                    quick-setting cement, or be so well packed as to be proof against its general
                    tendency to settle away from the ashlar facing, no means of the kind can
                    materially improve it. A well-compacted wall of coursed rubble, the courses
                    being frequently made up of whole stones and faced with ashlar, may be made
                    tolerably sound and trust-worthy. Brick backing, with ashlar facing, cannot be
                    considered as good, though it has the advantage of not requiring battening and
                    lathing for inside plastering, as the stone-backed wall does. Uncoursed rubble
                    with ashlar has all the disadvantages of both the preceding, with nothing to
                    recommend it above either of them.</p>
                <p>There are, besides, many sorts of walling or modes of structure arising from the
                    nature of the materials furnished in various localities. That of most frequent
                    occurrence, perhaps, is a manner in which either broken or rounded flints are
                    used. These depend almost entirely on the mortar with which they are compacted,
                    and on a coursed chain, which is commonly introduced at short intervals of
                    larger stones or bricks, to act as a bond; the quoins, too, in this species of
                    structure are generally constructed of dressed stones or brick.</p>
                <p>Whatever objections lie against bond timber in brickwork apply with equal force
                    at least to the use of it in stone walls; and it is of less importance generally
                    as a tie in the latter than in the former, because a chain may be made by means
                    of metal cramps and dovetails of wood or cast iron. A chain of this kind does
                    not distribute pressure, however, as well as a chain of timber bond does,
                    because of the liability of the material to fracture when it is borne upon
                    unequally, and therefore may not be considered an equivalent for wall-plates or
                    templates.</p>
                <p>Discharging arches, it must be evident, are as necessary in and to stone walls as
                    to walls of brick, and they may be treated much in the same manner.</p>
                <p>Rubble walls are scaffolded with single, and ashlar fronted or other gauged stone
                    walls with double fronted scaffolding, the former tailing one end of the
                    putlocks in on the wall, and the other having an inner row' of standard poles
                    and ledgers parallel to the outer, making the scaffold entirely independent of
                    the wall. In some places, however, it is the custom to dispense altogether with
                    an external scaffold in building stone walls, particularly with gauged stones.
                    With light and plain work this may be done without much inconvenience or
                    retardation; but if the work be heavy or delicate, considerable delay and
                    incorrectness result. Sometimes the finer work, such as that to mouldings,
                    flutes, and foliate or other enrichments, is merely boasted or roughed out
                    before the stones are set, and finished afterwards. This can be done well only
                    from a secure floor or scaffold, on which the workman may move freely.</p>
                <p>When walls are not entirely of masonry, in the ordinary course of economic
                    building, stone is frequently used lor copings, cornices, string and blocking
                    courses, sills, landings, pavings, curbs, steps, stairs, hearth-stones and
                    slabs, and chimney-pieces; to these may be added, quoins and architectural
                    decorations, or dressings for windows, doors, &amp;c., though both the former
                    and latter are not unfrequently executed in plaster composition, or cements.
                    Copings (see Glossary to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Architecture)</hi> to
                    cover walls, parapets, &amp;c., are worked with a plain horizontal bed, two
                    vertical faces, and an inclined or weathered back or upper surface; either
                    forming an acute angle with the outer and wider, and an obtuse angle with the
                    inner and narrower face, to throw the water off, as shown at <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> fig. 19; or to both sides from the middle, as at <hi rend="italic"
                    >b;</hi> the latter is technically termed saddle-back coping. In both cases they
                    arc made to project over the wall or parapet on both sides; and in the projected
                    part of the bed under the edge or edges towards which the inclination is given,
                    a channel or groove, called a throat, is cut, to intercept the water in its
                    inclination to run inwards to the wall. On gables or other inclined planes the
                    coping is neither weathered nor throated, as the water is necessarily impelled
                    along its course to the lower end, and not over the-sides. To protect the
                    separate stones of a coping course from the danger of being displaced by high
                    winds or other accidental cause, and to form a chain through its wholé length,
                    the stones are linked together by cramps of copper or iron let into their backs
                    and run with lead. These metals, however, especially the iron, for the most part
                    act very injuriously, from their exceeding susceptibility of atmospheric
                    changes, and their greater or less tendency to oxidation; indeed, the stone
                    invariably suffers more than the work benefits from the metal cramps. Tenons,
                    dowels, joggles or dovetails of stone, or of hard wood or cast iron, applied so
                    as to be protected from the weather, would be far better, and would answer every
                    desirable purpose sufficiently. Cornices <hi rend="italic">(vide ut sup.)</hi>
                    are but ramified copings, and are or may be subjected to the same general laws.
                    Care must be taken, however, in arranging them, that their centre of gravity be
                    not brought too far forward, in the anxiety to project them sufficiently, lest
                    they act injuriously on the wall by pressing unequally, and their own safety be
                    also endangered. String courses <hi rend="italic">(vide ut slip.)</hi>
                    economically, in contradistinction to architecturally, are meant to protect a
                    set-off in a wall, by projecting over its lower face in the manner of a coping
                    (see fig. 17, at c); the beds are worked parallel, and the outer face vertical
                    or at right angles to them, but so much of the upper surface is weathered or
                    sloped off as protrudes from the upper part of the wall to carry the water off;
                    and, for the reason above stated with regard to copings, the lower bed just
                    within the outer face is throated. A stone string course, cramped or dove-tailed
                    as above, forms an excellent chain round a brick wall; but the part of it in the
                    wall should be of the exact thickness of one, two, or more courses of brick. A
                    blocking course <hi rend="italic">(vide</hi> wt’ <hi rend="italic">sup.)</hi> is
                    either a very thick string projecting over or flush with the face of the lower
                    part of the wall, or it is a range of stone over a crowning cornice to bring the
                    centre of gravity more in on the wall than it otherwise would be; in the former
                    case it is treated exactly as a string, excepting that, if it be flush below,
                    there is no occasion for a throat; and in the latter it has a horizontal bed,
                    parallel vertical sides, and a weathered back or upper surface. Sills <hi
                    rend="italic">(vide ut slip.)</hi> are weathered and throated like the parts of
                    a string course (see fig. 17, at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >b)</hi>; they are laid across the feet or bases of window openings, &amp;c. to
                    receive the sash-frame, and carry the water off from the wall below; distinct
                    sills in the same line may, indeed, be considered as an intercepted string
                    course. In the ordinary practice of building, window sills are seldom set in
                    brick-walls until they are absolutely required to set the sash-frames on; or
                    they are set but not bedded, except at the ends. The object of this is to
                    prevent any settlement that may occur in the piers <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193741852" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1852-0676"/>from breaking the sills
                    across on the unyielding part of the wall under the windows. A necessity for
                    this, however, can only arise from bad construction; for with inverted arches
                    under the openings, and a good bond in the brick-work, all would settle
                    together, and the sills might be completely bedded across at once. Landings are
                    platforms of stone, either over an area before a door, at the head of a flight
                    of stairs, or as the floor of a balcony. They are made four, five, six, or eight
                    inches in thickness, according to their extent and bearing; if not of one piece
                    of stone, they are of nicely jointed pieces joggled and plugged together, and
                    are worked on the face and edges just as their situation may demand. Stone
                    pavings are of various kinds, and are prepared, shaped, and laid in various
                    ways. Stone paving that is not exposed to the sun and air, if next the ground,
                    should be laid on footings of brick or stone, or it will be constantly damp if
                    the soil be close and clayey; but in yards, open areas, &amp;c. it may be laid
                    on the ground, bedded in sand, and jointed with mortar or cement. Stone paved
                    floors are either on brick arches, or on a timber floor prepared for the
                    purpose: the latter is a very bad mode of supporting paving, as the impression
                    derived from the presence of the latter is, that the floor is incombustible; but
                    if it be bedded on combustible material, the danger to human life in the event
                    of fire is greater than if the stone paving did not exist at all. It is worked,
                    cut, and set more or less expensively, according to circumstances. A curb is a
                    range or course of thicker and stronger stone to bound a pavement, and is either
                    flush with the paving, showing as a step on its outer edge, or raised above it
                    to receive a balustrade, and shows on the outer side as a blocking course; in
                    the latter situation it is generally joggled and plugged in the joints. The term
                    step or steps alone is generally understood to mean external steps, whether
                    arranged in long or short flights, or the single step in a doorway into which
                    the door frame is tenoned. A step should have a plain horizontal bed, and a very
                    slightly weathered tread or upper surface; the front or riser worked plain and
                    vertical, or with a moulded nosing, and the back sunk with a joggle or
                    bird’s-mouth joint to receive the step or landing above or behind it. Stairs are
                    but a flight or combination of steps used internally; the principles upon which
                    they arc constructed will be found under the heads <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Stone-Masonry</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Joinery.</hi> Hearths are the stone
                    flooring of fire-places; and a slab is that part of the floor of a room which
                    lies immediately before the fire-place and along the extent of its front. This
                    slab is supported by a flat brick arch called a brick trimmer, which is turned
                    from the chimney-breast under the hearth on one side, to the trimmer joist on
                    the other. (See a section of all these at fig. 18.) Chimney-pieces consist
                    simply of mantle and jambs; that is, the vertical sides, and the architrave or
                    transverse covering with its shelf or cornice. The parts of a chimney-piece are
                    generally put together with an adhesive plaster or cement, and affixed to the
                    wall or chimney-breast behind with cramps, hold-fasts, and plugs. The material
                    of which chimneypieces are composed varies from the coarsest stone to the finest
                    marble; and thelabouron them varies to a still greater extent. Quoin-stones are
                    gauged and wrought blocks with parallel beds and vertical faces, placed on the
                    angles of buildings with the intention of adding to their beauty and strength;
                    they are used either with brick or stone walls, and are generally made to
                    project before the face of that to which they are attached, mostly with a
                    weathered angular joint, or with a rectangularly grooved or moulded one. The
                    quoins are coursed with the rest of the wall if it be of stone, and are made to
                    occupy the exact space of a limited number of courses of brick in a brick wall.
                    (See fig. 17.)</p>
                <p>Masonry to receive architectural decorations is generally worked into the walls
                    as they are carried up; but as thcy are seldom homogeneous either in matter or
                    construction, the result is mostly the converse of what it purports to be, for
                    the work is more frequently weakened than strengthened by the decorative
                    masonry. Stones of which columns are to be composed, whether each column is to
                    be of one stone or more, are generally roughly boasted out before they are set,
                    and are finished afterwards to traversing moulds and templets with a plumb-rule,
                    whose sides are cut to the diminution, whatever it may be. Flutes are cut at the
                    same time and in the same manner. The beds of the joints in columns should be
                    worked with the greatest precision, that they may fit firmly and closely
                    together; they must not, however, be worked hollow to make a close joint
                    externally, or the arrises will chip off. It is considered a good plan to put a
                    piece of thin milled lead between the beds, cut circular, and extending to
                    within a short distance of the surface, and that the rest be filled with a fine
                    adhesive putty, made as nearly of the colour of the stone as possible. This
                    makes a solid bed, and protects the arrises effectually; but it will not do so
                    well for slight columns, because it narrows the bed so materially. A joggle or
                    dowel of hard wood or cast iron let into the core might be a sufficient
                    counteraction, and it would certainly add to the stability of a polylithic
                    shaft. The other parts of a columnar composition maybe sufficiently cramped and
                    joggled together with wood and metals, according to the situation, though it may
                    be again remarked, that neither the one nor the other should be used, except
                    where they can be protected from the access, even, of the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Stone walling is generally measured by the perch of twenty-one feet superficial,
                    at a standard of eighteen inches in thickness, or a cubic quantity of thirty-one
                    feet six inches. Sometimes it is taken by the rod of 272 feet, like brick-work,
                    but at the eighteen inch standard instead of the fourteen inch, or a brick and a
                    half, as in the latter species of walling. The perch, however, as first stated,
                    is the standard of this country. The quantities may be ascertained in the same
                    manner that they are in measuring brick-work, the number of inches the wall is
                    in thickness being substituted in the margin for the number of brick lengths. In
                    abstracting, the superficial quantities may be taken out in columns under the
                    different thicknesses; the amount of each column being multiplied by the
                    thickness in inches, and divided by eighteen, gives the reduced quantity; but if
                    the work be taken in cubic quantities, it is evident that the three dimensions
                    of every part multiplied together brings the whole at once to cubic feet, and no
                    further process is necessary, unless it be required to bring the total quantity
                    into reduced perches, which may be done by dividing it by thirty-one and a
                    half.</p>
                <p>The custom being different in different places with regard to the double
                    measurement of quoins or angle piers, and as to whether openings, such as
                    windows and doors, shall or shall not be deducted, because of the greater care
                    and trouble required in setting and plumbing quoins and reveals, these
                    particulars should be made matter of previous agreement. Perhaps the best way is
                    to take the quantities exactly, and allow a running measurement extra on the
                    parts requiring more than the usual quantityorlabour, or, the nature of the work
                    being of course obvious beforehand, the price per perch, per rod, or per foot
                    cube, on the exact quantity, may be made to include the proposed extras. In the
                    same manner, chisel-dressing (that is, facing the stones neatly and truly with
                    the chiseD, whether plain or sunk, may or may not be charged extra, according to
                    agreement, or, in the absence or a previous agreement, to the custom of the
                    place. <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193741865"

                    every thing that enters into some fixed quantity on the spot must be calculated,
                    for almost every thing connected with it varies in almost every place. The
                    original price of the stone at the quarry; the expense of carrying it from
                    thence to the place where it is to be worked up; its texture or comparative
                    hardness, which will materially affect the quantity of walling a mason may
                    execute in a certain time; the cost on the spot, of lime and sand, and the
                    height to which stones must be carried or hoisted from the ground; must all be
                    ascertained and considered, as well as the wages of masons and labourers, and
                    the sort of walling proposed to be executed.</p>
                <p>Stone used in string and blocking courses, sills, copings, cornices, steps,
                    quoins, columns, entablatures, &amp;c. is measured by the foot cube, and the
                    work on it is taken as plain, sunk, or moulded, by the foot superficial. The
                    dimensions for the cubic quantities are taken on the unreduced block, or rather
                    on the greatest breadth and thickness which the finished work exhibits; for
                    instance, the string course, which appears in section at <hi rend="italic"
                    >c,</hi> fig. 17, would be taken as of the thickness throughout which it holds
                    in the wall; and in the same manner, the thickness of the sill at <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> would be taken under the wooden sill of the sash frame,
                    which must have been the original thickness of the whole scantling. Stone sawed
                    into thin slabs for paving, chimney pieces, &amp;c. is taken by the superficial
                    foot, at a certain thickness, the value being ascertained from the cubic
                    quantity and the cost of sawing on the surface, whilst some articles, being of a
                    fixed breadth and thickness fitting them to peculiar purposes, are taken by the
                    running foot; but both these latter modes suppose labour included.</p>
                <p>Plain work is the even surface produced on stone by the chisel, without the
                    necessity of taking away more than the mere inequalities, and is equivalent to
                    what the joiner calls trying-up, that is, making the surfaces perfectly straight
                    both longitudinally and transversely, and so that it shall be quite cut of
                    winding, which indeed is a term to express the result of trying-up. Sunk work
                    arises from the necessity of chiseling or hacking away below the level surface
                    of the plain work, such as the weathering of copings, string courses, cornices,
                    &amp;c.; and mouldings cut in stone produce what is called moulded work. Sunk
                    and moulded work are either straight or circular; circular plain work is
                    certainly spoken of, but incorrectly, for every flexure in stone must be
                    produced by sinking. The joints and beds, that is, the upper and lower
                    horizontal sides, and the vertical ends of stones, arc taken as plain work, as
                    well as their faces and edges, if they have been wrought with the chisel to
                    produce the surface; or their superficies are taken as sawing or half plain
                    work, if the surfaces are as the saw left them. An extra charge is made on plain
                    work for rubbing to produce a smooth unchannelled surface; and again, a higher
                    charge is made for plain work if it be equally channelled or furrowed in
                    vertical lines over the surface; this latter operation is technically termed
                    tooling. Whenever any two surfaces meet in an oblique angle, one of them may be
                    taken as sunk work, and it will generally be that which is not parallel to its
                    opposite side. It is valued at about two sevenths more than plain work; and
                    circular sunk work, that is, circular in the direction of its length, at about
                    one sixth more than straight sunk. Moulded work is measured by girding the
                    moulding or mouldings with a cord or tape, carrying it into all the quirks, and
                    round all the arrises; the dimension thus given is multiplied by the length for
                    the superficial quantity. This is valued at about one fifth more than sunk work,
                    and circular moulded at about one half more than straight. Narrow jointings,
                    groovings, throatings, jogglings, &amp;c. are taken by the foot run. Mortises,
                    holes, notches, cramps, dovetails, &amp;c. arc numbered and charged at so much a
                    piece, according to the labour and cost involved in making them. The common
                    pavings, landings, copings, sills, and steps generally used in London for
                    ordinary purposes, are of a laminated stone from Yorkshire, and they are for the
                    most part worked to size and shape in the quarry, so that there can be very
                    little labour on them beyond the mere fitting and setting, making mortises,
                    fitting coal-plates, traps, &amp;c. when such are required, unless they be
                    rubbed, which occasions, of course, an extra charge. York pavings and landings
                    are taken by the superficial foot, at such a thickness; and copings, sills,
                    steps, &amp;c. by the foot run, according to their size.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plasterer, &amp;;c.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> No art in the
                    economy of building contributes more to produce internal neatness and elegance,
                    and no one is less absolutely important, as far as the use and stability of a
                    structure are concerned, than that of the plasterer. Its very general
                    application, too, is of comparatively late date; for wainscotted walls, and
                    boarded or boarded and canvassed ceilings, or naked joists alone, are frequently
                    found in houses of even less than a century old, both in this country and on the
                    Continent.</p>
                <p>The plasterer, as the term imports, works in plastic, adhesive compositions,
                    which are laid on walls, both internally and externally, to stop crevices,
                    reduce inequalities, and produce an even, delicate surface, capable of receiving
                    any decoration that may be applied to it, either in colour or otherwise. These
                    compositions are as various as the modes of applying them, the rudest being a
                    compost of loam, a marly clay, and lime; this is used only for the commonest
                    purposes, and being laid on in one coat, is washed over with a thin mixture of
                    lime and water, which process is termed white-washing; the highest work of the
                    plasterer is the making an imitation of marbles and other costly stones, of the
                    purest calcined gypsum, mixed with a solution of gum and isinglass, and
                    colouring matter to produce the required imitation. For the more common
                    operations of plastering, however, comparatively few tools and few materials are
                    required. The plasterer is attended by a labourer, who supplies his boards with
                    mortar, and by a boy on the scaffold with him to feed his hawk; he is
                    necessarily furnished with a lathing hammer, a laying-on trowel, a hawk, floats,
                    brushes, jointing trowels and rules, moulds and straight edges, together with a
                    screen, spade, rake, and hod, for his labourer, and a feeding-spade or server
                    for his hawk-boy. The lathing hammer is chequered on the face with indented
                    lines, to make it less liable to slip over the head of the nail; the upper or
                    back part of the hammer is made like a hatchet, but very narrow, and on its
                    inner side or edge there is sometimes a square nick or groove, by means of which
                    the workman is enabled to draw a nail that has gone awry. The laying-on trowel
                    is a thin plate of hardened iron or steel, ten inches long and two and a half
                    inches wide, rounded at one end and square at the other end or heel; it is very
                    slightly convex on the face; and to the back, about the middle of it, the
                    spindle or handle is rivetted in at right angles, which, returning in the
                    direction of the heel parallel to the tool, fits into a rounded wooden handle,
                    by which the workman grasps it. The plasterer is obliged to keep this implement
                    particularly clean and dry when he is not actually using it, lest it rust in the
                    slightest degree, as it is clear that the brown oxide of iron would sadly
                    discolour his finer work on touching it again with the trowel. The hawk is a
                    piece of wood about ten inches square, to receive a small portion oř mortar on,
                    for the convenience of carrying it readily up to the wall or ceiling, to be
                    there delivered and spread by the trowel. The hawk is traversed across the back
                    by a clove-tailed piece, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741878"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1878-0678"/>into which the wooden handle is fixed at right
                    angles, and by this the workman holds it in his left hand. A hand-float is a
                    piece of board shaped something like a plastering trowel, with a ledge-handle to
                    it, and is used to rub over the finished work, to produce a hard, smooth, and
                    even face. A quirk-float is of wood also, and is angularly shaped to work in
                    angles; and a derby is a long two-handed float, which is that principally used
                    in forming the floated coat of lime and hair. The plasterer s brush is broad and
                    thin, with a stout or slight row of coarse or fine hair, as it may be required
                    for rough or fine work. Jointing trowels are thin plates of polished steel, of
                    triangular shape, the point being a very acute angle; the handle is adapted to
                    the heel or base of the tool. They are of three or four different sizes, and are
                    principally used in making good cornices, and joining them at their internal and
                    external angles, which is called mitering. Jointing rules are auxiliary to the
                    jointing trowel. Moulds are pieces of hard wood cut to the contour of cornices
                    or separate mouldings, to assist the workmen in forming them readily. For work
                    of any importance the moulds are cut in copper plates, which are inserted in the
                    wooden stock, and narrow pieces of wood are fixed to the moulds transversely, to
                    guide and steady them along the screeds. A straight edge is a board of
                    considerable length, shot perfectly straight on one edge, to bring the
                    plastering on a wall or ceiling to a perfectly even surface, by traversing itin
                    every direction. A screen is a large parallelogramic wooden frame, on which
                    metal wires are fixed at regulated distances from each other, to act as a sieve.
                    This is propped up in nearly a vertical direction by a counter-frame hinged to
                    it like a common step ladder, and the coarser materials which enter into the
                    composition of plastering mortar are thrown against its outer face, to separate
                    the particles which are too large for the purpose from the finer. The sand and
                    lime, too, are mixed much more efficiently and completely by screening them
                    together than in any other manner. The spade and hod are like those of the
                    bricklayer’s labourer. The rake is used to separate the hair used in the mortar,
                    and distribute it throughout the mass. The hawk boy’s server is about the size
                    and shape of a common garden hoe, but the handle is in the direction of the
                    instrument. With it the boy rebeats the mortar on the board, to destroy any set
                    it may have taken, and delivers it in small pats or portions on to the
                    plasterer’s hawk.</p>
                <p>The plasterer’s materials are laths and lath nails, lime, sand, hair and plaster,
                    of which are formed coarse stuff or lime and hair, fine stuff, gauge stuff,
                    &amp;c.; and besides these, a variety of stuccoes and cements, together with
                    various ingredients to form colouring washes, &amp;c. are more or less in
                    request.</p>
                <p>Laths are narrow strips of some straight grained wood (in this country they are
                    generally of fir, though oak laths are sometimes used), in lengths of three and
                    four feet, or to suit the distances at which the joists or quarterings are set,
                    and in thickness a quarter and three eighths of an inch; those of the former
                    thickness are called single, and those of the latter lath and a half. Lath nails
                    are either wrought, cut, or cast, and of course vary in length to the thicker
                    and thinner laths; cast nails are in common use in this country with fir laths.
                    Coarse stuff is composed of ox or horse hair from the hide, in addition to the
                    lime and sand mortar of the bricklayer and mason; this is intended to act as a
                    sort of bond to net or tie it together, by being distributed throughout the
                    whole mass, and in single hairs if it were possible. The hair should be as long
                    as it can be procured, and free from grease and filth of every kind. Road drift
                    is unfit to be used for mortar, unless it be completely cleansed from all animal
                    and vegetable matter, and of all mud and clay. Loamy or argillaceous earths are
                    constantly used in the composition of this mortar, as its quality is thought
                    unimportant, so that it can be made to hang together. The presence of clayey
                    matter making the mortar unctuous and tenacious, they are used without or with
                    very little hair; the consequence is, that the slightest injury affects the work
                    made with them. The mortar thus composed readily absorbs and retains moisture,
                    bursts, and crumbles away; and if it be effectually protected from injury of
                    that kind, it becomes rotten in a comparatively short space of time, and
                    frequently is the means of decay in the laths, and even in the larger timbers.
                    Nothing but clean sharp sand should be used with the lime and hair in the
                    composition of this, any more than of brick mortar. Fine stuff is a mortar made
                    of fine white lime, exceedingly well slaked with water, or rather macerated in
                    water to make the slaking complete; for some purposes a small quantity of hair
                    is mixed up with this material. Fine stuff very carefully prepared of the finest
                    powdered lime macerated so completely as to be held in solution by the water,
                    thus forming a mere paste, which is then allowed to evaporate until it is of a
                    sufficient consistence for working, is called putty. Gauge stuff is composed of
                    about three fourths of putty and one fourth of calcined gypsum or plaster of
                    Paris; this may be mixed only in small quantities at a time, as the plaster or
                    gauge renders it liable to set very rapidly. Bastard stucco is made of two
                    thirds fine stuff', without hair, and one third of very fine and perfectly clean
                    sand (the cleanliness or purity of sand may be determined by the facility with
                    which it may, when in a moist state, be struck off from the hand without leaving
                    a soiD; and common stucco is composed of about three fourths of clean sharp sand
                    and one fourth of the best lime, well incorporated. This must be protected from
                    the air from the time it is made until it is required to be laid on the walls.
                    The cement best known and most commonly used in this country is called Parker’s,
                    or Parker’s Roman cement. This material, when of good quality, with fine clean
                    sharp sand, in the proportion of about three of the former to one of cement, and
                    well executed, forms an admirable external coating for walls, and is generally
                    preferable to any other with which we are acquainted.</p>
                <p>The various coatings of plastering are thus designated: On laths, plastering in
                    one coat simply is said to be laid, and in two coats, laid and set. In
                    three-coat plastering on laths, however, the first is called the pricking up,
                    the second is said to be floated, and the third set. On brick or stone walls,
                    without the intervention of laths, plastering in one plain coat is termed
                    rendering; with two coats, a wall is said to be rendered and set; and in three,
                    rendered, floated, and set. Before the plasterer begins to lath a ceiling, he
                    proves the under face of the joists, to which he has to work, by the application
                    of a long straight edge, and makes out any slight inequalities in them, when the
                    work is not to be of a very superior description, by nailing on laths or slips
                    to bring them as nearly even as he can. When the inequalities are great, or if
                    the work is to be of fine quality, he recurs to the carpenter, who takes oft
                    inordinate projections with his adze, and nails on properly dressed slips where
                    the joists do not come down low enough, and thus brings the whole to a perfect
                    level. This operation is called firring, that is, putting on pieces of fir,
                    though it is vulgarly termed and frequently spelt <hi rend="italic"
                    >furrmll∙</hi> If it be a framed floor of ceiling joists the plasterer has to
                    work to, it is tolerably sure to be straight; but the carpenter must have firred
                    down on the beams or binders to the level of the ceiling joists, from end to end

                    panels, the projecting or depending portions must be bracketed or cradled down
                    to receive the laths. It is an important point to be attended to in plastering
                    on laths, and in ceilings particularly, that the laths should be attached to as
                    small a surface of timber as possible, because the plastering is not supported
                    or upborne by its adhesion or attachment to the wood, but by the keying of the
                    mortar itself, which passes through between the laths, and bends round over
                    them. If then the laths are in constantly recurring contact with thick joists
                    and beams, the keying is as constantly intercepted, and the plastering in all
                    such places depends entirely on the portions between them which are properly
                    keyed. Under a single floor, therefore, in which the joists are necessarily
                    thick, a narrow fillet should be nailed along the middle under the whole length
                    of them all, to receive the laths and keep them at a sufficient distance from
                    the timber, to allow the plastering to kcy under it; and thus too the surface
                    might be made more perfectly even, by blocking out the fillets, and
                    contrariwise, as it is in single floors that inequalities mostly occur. This
                    being all arranged, the plasterer commences lathing. The laths should be
                    previously sorted, reserving the crooked and knotty, if there be such, for
                    inferior works, and selecting the best for the work of most importance, so that
                    the workman shall find none to his hand that is not fit to be brought in. Taking
                    a lath that will reach across three or four openings, he strikes a nail into it
                    on one of the intermediate joists, at about three eighths of an inch from the
                    one before it, and then secures the ends of that and the one that it meets of
                    the last row with one nail, leaving the other end of the lath he has just set to
                    be secured in the same manner with that which shall meet it of the next bay in
                    continuation. It is of importance also that he pay attention to the bonding of
                    his work, either by using longer and shorter laths in bays or squares, and in
                    breaking the headings, or with laths of the same length, the first and last
                    courses or bays only having the bond formed by half laths. In lathing on
                    quartering partitions and battened walls, the bonding is not a matter of much
                    importance; nor is the thickness of the timbers behind the latter of so much
                    consequence as in a ceiling, because the toothing which the thickness of the
                    lath itself affords to the plastering is enough to support it vertically; but,
                    nevertheless, the more complete the keying, even in works of this kind, the
                    better, as the toothing above will not protect it from any exciting cause to
                    fall forwards, or away from the laths. The thinner or weaker sort of lath too is
                    generally considered sufficiently strong for partitions, whilst the stronger is
                    used for ceilings. Thin weak laths, if used in a ceiling, are sure to produce
                    inequalities, by sagging with or yielding to the weight attached to them. A
                    chance one or two weak ones in a ceiling of otherwise strong laths may be the
                    ruin of the best piece of work. Care should be taken therefore not to allow a
                    thin lath, or one of unequal thickness, to go on to a scaffold with thicker and
                    more equable ones, lest the workman should, through carelessness or otherwise,
                    put it up with the rest. When the lathing is completed, the work is either laid
                    or pricked up, according as it is to be finished with one, two, or three coats.
                    Laying is a tolerably thick coat of coarse stuff or lime and hair brought to a
                    tolerably even surface with the trowel only; for this the mortar must be well
                    tempered, and of moderate consistence,—thin or moist enough to pass readily
                    through between the laths, and bend with its own weight over them, and at the
                    same time stiff’ enough to leave no danger that it will fall apart, a
                    contingency, however, that in practice frequently occurs inconsequence of badly
                    composed or badly tempered mortar, or bad workmanship, sufficient force not
                    having been used with properly consistent mortar to force it through and form
                    keys. If the work is to be of two coats, that is, laid and set, when the laying
                    is sufficiently dry, it is roughly swept with a birch broom to roughen its
                    surface, and then the set, a thin coat of fine stuff, is put on. This is done
                    with the common trowel alone, or only assisted by a wetted hog’s bristle brush,
                    which the workman uses with his left hand to strike over the surface of the set,
                    while he presses and smooths it with the trowel in his right. If the laid work
                    should have become very dry, it must be slightly moistened before the set is put
                    on, or the latter, in shrinking, will crack and fall away. This is generally
                    done by sprinkling or throwing the water over the surface from the brush. For
                    floated or three-coat work, the first, or pricking up, is roughly laid on the
                    laths, the principal object being to make the keying complete, and form a layer
                    of mortar on the laths to which the next coat may attach itself. It must, of
                    course, be kept of tolerably equal thickness throughout, and should stand about
                    one quarter or three eighths of an inch on the surface of the laths. When it is
                    finished, and while the mortar is still quite moist, the plasterer scratches or
                    scores it all over with the end of a lath in parallel lines from three to four
                    inches apart. The scorings should be made as deep as possible without laying
                    bare the laths; and the rougher their edges are the better, as the object is to
                    produce a surface which the next coat will readily attach itself to. When the
                    pricked up coat is so dry as not to yield to pressure in the slightest degree,
                    preparations may be made for the floating. Ledges or margins of lime and hair,
                    about six or eight inches in width, and extending across the whole breadth of a
                    ceiling or height of a wall or partition, must be made in the angles or at the
                    borders, and at distances of about four feet apart throughout the whole extent;
                    these must be made perfectly straight with one another, and be proved in every
                    way by the application of straight edges: technically these ledges are termed
                    <hi rend="italic">screeds.</hi> The screeds are gauges for the rest of the work;
                    for when they are ready, and the mortar in them is a little set, the interspaces
                    are filled up flush with them; and a derby float or long straight edge being
                    made to traverse the screeds, all the stuff that projects beyond the line is
                    struck off, and thus the whole is brought to a straight and perfectly even
                    surface. To perfect the work, the screeds on ceilings should be levelled, and on
                    walls and partitions plumbed. When the floating is sufficiently set and nearly
                    dry, it is brushed with a birch broom as before described, and the third coat or
                    set is put on. This for a fine ceiling that is to be whitened or coloured must
                    be of putty; but if it is to be papered, ordinary fine stuff, with a little hair
                    in it, will be better. Walls and partitions that are to be papered are also of
                    this latter, or of rough stucco; but for paint the set must be of bastard stucco
                    trowelled. This coat must be worked of exactly the same thickness throughout, to
                    preserve to the external surface the advantage that has been obtained by
                    floating. For all but this last mentioned, the set on floated work, the trowel
                    and brush are considered sufficient to produce fine and even work; but trowelled
                    stucco must moreover be hand-floated. In this operation the stucco is set with
                    the trowel in the usual manner, and brought to an even surface with that tool to
                    the extent or two or three yards. The workman then takes the handfloat in his
                    right hand, and rubs it smartly over the surface, pressing gently to condense
                    the material as much as possible. As he works the float he sprinkles the surface
                    with water from the brush in his left hand, and eventually produces a texture as
                    fine and smooth almost as that of polished marble. The process of plastering on
                    the naked brick or stone wall differs but little, except in names, from.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741904" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1904-0680"/>
                <p>that we have described as the mode on lath. The single coat, or equivalent for
                    laying, on lath, is rendering, and it need differ only in the quantity of hair,
                    which may be less than is necessary for laying, and in the consistence of the
                    mortar, which may be made more plastic, to work easier, and because in a moister
                    state it will attach itself more firmly to the wall: the wall, however, must
                    itself be wetted before the rendering is applied. The set is the same, and is
                    put on in the same manner as to two-coat work on lath. For three coat, or
                    floated work, the first or rough rendering should be made to fill up completely
                    whatever crevices there maybe in the work behind it, and be incorporated with it
                    as much as possible. As its name imports, its surface may, indeed should, be
                    rough; but it is not scratched or lined as the similar coat on lath is: for
                    this, too, the wall must be previously wetted, that the mortar may the better
                    attach itself to it. For the floating, screeds must be formed as before
                    described, and the consecutive process is exactly the same as on lath, both for
                    the floated and for the set coat. In almost every case in which plastering is to
                    be floated, the workman finds a guide for the feet of his wall screeds in the
                    narrow grounds which the joiner has previously fixed for his skirtings; from
                    these lie plumbs upwards, and makes his work perfectly flush with them.</p>
                <p>Mouldings and cornices, as large combinations of mouldings and flat surfaces are
                    called, in the angles of rooms, immediately under their ceilings, are formed
                    with running moulds, and are generally executed before the setting coat is put
                    on the walls and ceiling. If the cornice do not project more than about an inch
                    and a half, or two inches, from the ordinary work, a backing of lime and hair
                    will be sufficient; and if any one part only happen to be more than ordinarily
                    protuberant, a row of nails from six to twelve inches apart stuck into the wall
                    or ceiling in the line of that part will give it sufficient support. But if the
                    general mass of the cornice be more than that amounts to, and extend above six
                    or eight inches along the ceiling, it must be bracketed out, and the bracketing
                    lathed and pricked up, as for ordinary work. This pricking up, or other
                    preparation, must of course be perfectly set before the cornice is run; and
                    there should be one fourth of an inch at least of clear space between the
                    preparation and the mould in the nearest part. A wooden screed or parallel
                    straight edge is tacked with brads on to the wall, and another on the ceiling,
                    if the cornice be large and heavy, as guides or gauges for the mould, whose
                    rests are chased to fit them; and then one man laying on gauge stuff in an
                    almost fluid state with an angular trowel, another works the mould backwards and
                    forwards over it, which strikes off what is superfluous, and gives the inverse
                    of its form to the rest. The mould is never taken down from the work at right
                    angles to the line of it, but is drawn off at the end, so that none of the parts
                    of the moulding or cornice is injured or torn by it, which must otherwise
                    frequently be the case, from the peculiar forms at times given to the details.
                    If a cornice be too large and heavy to be executed at once, it may be done in
                    the same manner at two or more times, in so many parts; and if any part or parts
                    of a moulding or cornice is to be enriched, the space for it is left vacant by
                    the mould, and the enrichment is afterwards supplied. As a cornice cannot be
                    completed up to the angles by the mould, it is worked by hand in those
                    situations to a joint. The joinings are termed mitres, and in forming them the
                    plasterer uses the jointing tools we have already described. Models for
                    enrichments arc made by the modeller, according to the design or drawing
                    submitted to him, and from them the plasterer makes wax moulds, or, as in
                    ordinary practice, the modeller supplies the moulds in which the ornament is
                    cast in plaster of Paris. If the ornament be in recurring lengths or parts, as
                    is usually the case, only one length or part is modelled, and casts of as many
                    as are required are taken from the mould; some single ornaments, again, which
                    are very large, require to be moulded and cast in parts, which are put together
                    by means of cement. WTιen the cast ornaments are sufficiently dry the pieces are
                    scraped and trimmed, the joints made clean and even, and they are set in the
                    cornice with plaster of Paris, with white lead, or with a composition called
                    iron cement, as the case may require. If the castings have something in the
                    cornice to rest upon, the first will do; but if there is nothing to retain or
                    attach them but the cement, one of the two latter must be used. Flowers and
                    other ornaments in ceilings which are too large and heavy to be trusted to
                    adhesive matter alone, must be screwed on to wooden cradling behind and above
                    them.</p>
                <p>In plastering a wall with common stucco, and its use is mostly for outside work,
                    the first thing to be done is to remove the dust from it by brushing, and then
                    wetting it very completely with water; if the wall to be stuccoed be an old one,
                    or one of which the joints have been drawn, the mortar of the joints must be
                    chipped or even raked out, and the bricks picked, to expose a new and porous
                    surface to the plastering before brushing and wetting. The wall is then covered
                    with stucco in a fluid state, applied with a broad and strong hog’s bristle
                    brush, like common white-washing. When this is nearly dry the stucco must be
                    laid on as in common rendering, unless the work is to be floated, when the
                    process is nearly similar to that in floated plastering. Screeds must be formed
                    at the highest and lowest extremities of the wall, or of that part of the wall
                    which is in the same vertical line, and is not intercepted by string courses,
                    and be returned at the angles, putting the whole surface into a sort of frame.
                    These must be made perfectly straight and plumb, so as to be quite out of
                    winding, by the careful application of the plumb-rule and straight edge. Inner
                    vertical screeds must then follow at three or four feet apart across the whole
                    surface, and be made to range exactly with the outer ones, and then the
                    interstices must be filled in as before. As the work is made good it must be
                    well rubbed with the hand-float, as in the execution of trowelled stucco
                    internally, to compress the material, and produce a hard, even, and glossy
                    surface. Preparations for cornices and other projections from the straight
                    surface of the work must have been previously made in or on the brick or
                    stone-work, by the protrusion of bricks, tiles, or whatever may be best suited
                    to form a core, and the mouldings and cornices are run with moulds, in the
                    manner described for the same things internally, only that in work of this kind
                    no plastic material but the stucco itself is used; that is, there is no
                    preparation of any softer material than the stucco itself put under it. In
                    running cornices in this material, workmen are very apt to mix a little plaster
                    of Paris with the stucco to make it set under the mould, and thus give sharpness
                    and fulness to the mouldings; but this should not be permitted; for the plaster
                    is not qualified to stand the weather as the stucco is, and, if mixed with it,
                    will produce premature decay. (For information concerning the various modes of
                    preparing it, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Stucco).</hi> V hen the
                    stucco is perfectly dry, it may be painted in oil colours, or be coloured in
                    distemper; and in either case it is generally ruled over the surface with a lead
                    point, to give it the appearance of gauged stone-work.</p>
                <p>Rendering in Roman cement is executed almost exactly in the same manner as stucco

                    surface with a solution of the material. The same process, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193741917" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1917-0681"/>too, is followed in floating
                    this cement, and with the same exceptions; and as, in addition to its superior
                    hardness and capacity for duration, it is a quick-setting cement, it is far
                    preferable to any of the common stuccoes for running cornices, mouldings,
                    &amp;c. Roman cement, or, as it is vulgarly called by most persons concerned in
                    the operations of building, compo, a contraction of composition, may, like
                    stucco, be painted in oil or coloured; but instead of a size colour, which is
                    used for almost every other purpose in plastering, the colour for this
                    composition is mixed with diluted sulphuric acid. This too may be lined and
                    tinted to imitate stone and stone-work of any description.</p>
                <p>It may not be amiss here to refer to the causes of the premature decay which
                    takes place in stuccoes and cements when used externally as a coating to walls.
                    The primary cause is the presence of muddy earth and decayed animal and
                    vegetable matter in the sand used with the lime and cement. To this may be added
                    frequent impurities in the limes and cements themselves, particularly of
                    argillaceous matter in the former, and sometimes to the too great proportions of
                    lime or cement to sand. These things might, however, remain quiescent for a long
                    time, if the work were well protected from access of moisture, which is the
                    grand exciting cause. The paint, or distemper wash, on the surface, is generally
                    sufficient to prevent the rain which may beat against a vertical face from
                    penetrating, especially if the work have been well hand-floated and trowelled,
                    to make it close and compact; but the evil arises from exposure above, and from
                    the numberless horizontal unfloated surfaces which are constantly presented.
                    These receive and collect the water, and convey in streams over the vertical
                    surfaces what is not immediately absorbed; and the work thus becoming saturated,
                    frost seizes and bursts it, or warmth calls the vegetative powers of the
                    impurities in it into action, and the whole is covered with a green sward. Let
                    the sand of which a plaster composition is to be formed, whether with lime or
                    cement, be washed until it no longer discolours clean water, and be well
                    compounded with cementitious matter free from the impurities with which it is so
                    frequently charged; let the work be well hand-floated and trowelled,
                    particularly on the backs or upper horizontal surfaces of projections, and
                    protected above by projecting eaves or otherwise; and the work, with common care
                    and attention to paint or distemper at intervals, will last as long as any thing
                    of the kind can be expected, or is found, to last anywhere.</p>
                <p>A cheap and useful covering for external walls which are protected by projecting
                    eaves, in plain buildings, is rough cast. This is executed in the following
                    manner. The surface is first roughed in, or rendered with lime and hair; and
                    when that is set dry, another coat of the same material is superadded, laid as
                    evenly as it can be without floating, and as soon as a piece of two or three
                    yards in extent is executed, the workman lays on it an almost fluid mixture of
                    fine clean gravel and strong lime, which have been well mixed together. This is
                    immediately washed with any ochreous colour that may be desired, and the whole
                    dries into one compact mass.</p>
                <p>In renovating and repairing plastering, the whole surface is first well washed to
                    remove the dirt which may have attached itself, and as much of the earthy matter
                    of the previous coat of whitening or colouring as will come away; any injuries
                    the work may have received, such as cracks and fractures, are then repaired; and
                    when the new stuff is quite dry, the joinings are scraped to produce an even
                    surface, and the whole is again whitened, or coloured once or twice, or oftener,
                    as may be required, to make it bear out well. Stuccoed walls which have been
                    painted must be well rubbed with pumice stone, to take off the old paint as much
                    as possible before they are newly painted. <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi></p>
                <p>Plastering is measured in feet and inches, and valued by the yard superficial of
                    nine square feet. It is taken under separate heads according to the nature and
                    description of the work, such as, rendered; rendered and set; rendered, floated,
                    and set; and with lath, for the lathing and plastering are valued together;
                    lathed and laid; lathed, laid, and set; and lathed, plastered, floated, and set.
                    Whitening and colouring are taken under separate heads, and the quantities of
                    them are reduced to yards also. Work done in narrow slips, such as to the jambs
                    and soffits of doorways and other openings, is measured by the foot superficial,
                    and so are the backs of niches, niche-heads, &amp;c. Arrises, or external angles
                    and quirks, are taken extra by the running foot, and beads and other very small
                    mouldings are measured in the same manner. Larger mouldings, however, and
                    cornices, whether plain or enriched, are taken by the foot superficial, and the
                    quantity is ascertained by multiplying the length, minus once the projection, by
                    the girth, of the moulding or cornice, which is best determined by measuring its
                    mould with a tape or cord. Enrichments are either numbered or taken at so much
                    the running foot, making the modeller’s an extra charge, if the design was
                    original and required special modelling and moulding; and mitres are taken at so
                    much a piece beyond a limited number. This number, in an ordinary room, is
                    generally the four which necessarily occur in its four angles, making those
                    which are usually occasioned by the projection of the chimney-breast extra; but
                    it is not an uncommon practice to bring them within the limit, and count only
                    all that may occur above eight, for no difference is made between internal and
                    external angles. Circular work, whether it be convex or concave, of every kind,
                    may be charged about one fourth higher than straight. Stuccoes and other
                    compositions are also valued by the yard, and according to the description of
                    the work, with almost similar exceptions to those mentioned with regard to
                    common plastering. Used externally, however, all the arrises or external angles,
                    throatings, grooves, chamfers, &amp;c. are taken as extra by the running foot at
                    such a width.</p>
                <p>In the practice of measuring plasterer’s work, it is customary to take the whole
                    surface at first, and then whatever deductions there may be. Thus the side of a
                    room is measured over all, from the upper edge of the skirting grounds up to the
                    cornice. The windows and doors are deducted by taking to the outside of their
                    framed grounds for the width, and from the skirting grounds up to the top of
                    those of the door or window for the height. If there be more than one of each,
                    or either of them, to deduct, of course the same dimension will serve for all,
                    multiplied by as many times as each deduction occurs. A ceiling also is
                    generally taken over the whole surface, from cornice to cornice, a
                    chimney-breast or other projection being made a deduction. It is a moot point
                    whether the plasterer should not be allowed that part of the ceiling and wall
                    which is covered by the cornice, as he has actually finished the whole except
                    setting. When the cornice is bracketed, however, he may fairly claim up to the
                    brackets.</p>
                <p>Scaffolding is not generally made an extra charge with new work; but with old
                    work it is, if scaffolding be necessary; for, under ordinary circumstances, the
                    plasterer is enabled to wash, stop, and whiten the ceilings and walls of rooms
                    from trestles, with boards laid across them. In lofty saloons and halls,
                    churches, &amp;c. scaffolding.is indispensable, and must then be charged. A
                    scaffold is necessary, too, to a front that is to be plastered in any way; but
                    it may be afterwards washed, repaired, and coloured, from a ladder, without the
                    intervention of a scaffold.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Slater.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The principle on which
                    slates are laid is that which is employed in plain tiling. To a roof with
                    projecting eaves, a wide board is placed over the rafters feet; but when the
                    eaves tail into gutters, the gutter-board is made wide enough to receive the
                    eaves-course. For light slating it is necessary to board a roof all over. This
                    is done by the carpenter, and is called sound-boarding; but for strong heavy
                    slates, fillets or battens are better; and these are laid by the slater himself,
                    to suit the length of his slates. Three inches wide and one inch thick is a
                    sufficient size for them, if the rafters be not more than twelve inches apart.
                    Against gable or party-walls, a feather-edged board called a tilting fillet is
                    laid to turn the water from the wall.</p>
                <p>Before he begins to work on a roof, the slater shapes and trims the slates on the
                    ground. With a large knife or chopper called a saixe, sax, or zax, he strikes
                    off the unevennesses on one side of a slate, making it as nearly straight as he
                    can; he then runs a gauge along it, marking the greatest width the slate will
                    bear, and, cutting to that line, makes it perfectly parallel. He next, with a
                    square, brings the thickest and best end to right angles with the sides,
                    generally by chopping, but sometimes by sawing; and then marking upward from the
                    squared foot or tail, makes two nail holes, where, by calculating the gauge the
                    slate in hand will bear, he knows the fillet must come. All the slates being
                    thus ganged to width, dressed, and sorted in lengths, they are then carried on
                    to the roof by the labourers in rotation, beginning with the longest and largest
                    for the lowest courses. The first course the slater lays is little more than
                    half the length of that which is intended to cover it, and is necessary to break
                    the joints at the eaves. This is called the doubling eaves-course; and the
                    covering eaves-course is brought to the same footline, completely to cover it.
                    Then to ascertain the gauge: From the length of the slate deduct the bond, which
                    should never be less than two inches, and need not be more than three and a half
                    inches, and the half of what remains will be the gauge. Thus, if the bond be
                    fixed at three inches, and the slate is two feet three inches in length, the
                    gauge will be one foot. This gauge or margin is set up from the foot of the
                    eaves-course at each end, and a line strained to mark it along the whole length,
                    and so on, to the ridge or top, where another half-course is required to
                    complete the work, and that is in its turn secured by a covering of sheet lead.
                    To a hipped roof care is taken to complete every course up to the angle, by
                    cutting slates to fit its inclination; and these are also covered by an overlap
                    of sheet lead. In nailing a slate, it must not be strained or bent in the
                    slightest degree, or it will certainly fly in some sudden atmospheric change, to
                    which it is of course constantly liable, even if it escape fracture., from being
                    trodden on by the workmen themselves or by others. Copper, being less liable to
                    oxidize from exposure to common causes than any other metal that will answer the
                    purpose, is generally used for slate nails. Zinc is also used for the purpose;
                    and iron tinned and painted nails are sometimes substituted by dishonesty on the
                    part of the workman or builder, or bad economy on that of the proprietor.
                    Slating should be well pointed on the inside, or torched, as the operation is
                    sometimes termed, with lime and hair, to keep out the wind, and prevent snow
                    from driving in, which it will do in an almost incredible manner if it be not
                    thus hindered. Particular attention should be paid to this, as the neglect of it
                    occasions more damaged ceilings than even broken slates, and more catarrhs than
                    arise from broken panes of glass.</p>
                <p>A very light and neat covering is produced, by laying wide slates side by side,
                    and covering their joints with narrow slips bedded in putty, the overlap at the
                    ends being no more than the bond is with the usual mode. It is known as patent
                    slating, and was introduced by the late Mr Wyatt, though he never obtained a
                    patent for it. Indeed it is in principle the mode which was adopted in ancient
                    Greece in covering the roofs of temples. Neither boards nor fillets are used,
                    the slate bearing from rafter to rafter, and to the rafters the slates are
                    screwed. The covering slips are also screwed, as well as bedded in putty.
                    Slating of this kind may be laid at no greater elevation than ten degrees;
                    whereas, for slating in the ordinary way, the angle should never be much less
                    than twenty-five degrees, though large slates with a three and a half inch bond,
                    carefully laid and well pointed, may perhaps be trusted at a rise of twenty
                    degrees.</p>
                <p>The mode above described of ascertaining the gauge or margin by the bond, is
                    equally applicable to every sort of roof-covering that is made up of small
                    inflexible parallelogramic slabs or tablets; and it should be borne in mind that
                    the greater the angle is at which the rafters rise, or, in technical language,
                    the higher the pitch of the roof, the less the bond may be, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> With slabs or tablets that vary in length, too,
                    as slates generally do in this country as they are brought to market, it is the
                    bond which it is of importance to observe; but if they are of an invariable
                    length, as tiles are, it is sufficient that the gauge or margin be attended
                    to.</p>
                <p>The best slate this country produces is from the quarries of Bangor in
                    Caernarvonshire, and of Kendal in Westmoreland. Good slate is also procured in
                    the neighbourhood of Tavistock in Devonshire, and in some parts of Scotland. The
                    scantlings of slate are cut in the quarries to set sizes, and these are split
                    into tablets, thicker or thinner according to the size of the slab and the
                    capacity of the slate, for the inferior qualities are neither so compact in
                    material, nor so clearly laminated or schistose, as the superior, and will not
                    therefore rend so freely. The sizes of slates best known in the British market
                    are distinguished by the names of ladies, countesses, duchesses, and queens.
                    Ladies measure fifteen inches by eight, countesses twenty inches by ten,
                    duchesses twenty-four inches by twelve, and queens thirty-six inches by
                    twenty-four; and they are esteemed in proportion to their magnitude. Besides
                    these, there is a slate which equals the queen in extent of surface, but is of
                    very much greater thickness; this is called Welsh rag. A smaller slate, again,
                    which is less indeed than the lady, and is cut from the refuse of large
                    scantlings, is called a double. In size it does not often exceed twelve inches
                    by six. Westmoreland slates are thick and heavy like the Welsh rag, but do not
                    generally run so large.</p>
                <p>The best slate is of a bluish-grey colour, and breaks before the zax like
                    well-burnt pottery, and will ring in the same manner on being struck. Whitish or
                    light greycoloured slate is for the most part stony: dark blue or blackish
                    slate, on the other hand, cuts very freely; but it absorbs moisture, and decays
                    rapidly.</p>
                <p>Slater’s work is measured by the square of a hundred superficial feet. In a
                    parallelogramic piece of slating, as in a gabled roof with projecting eaves, the
                    length along the eaves by the breadth or height from that to the ridge, with the
                    addition to the latter dimension of the gauge or margin for doubling the eaves,
                    will give the quantity of one side. Projections for chimney-shafts or breasts,
                    skylights, &amp;c. must be deducted; but an addition must be made of the run
                    round them by six inches, for cutting and waste. In a hipped roof the length
                    from point to point of the eaves on one of the long sides of a quadrilateral
                    roof, by the breadth or height, with the addition as before, will give that side
                    and half of each of the <hi rend="superscript"> en s,</hi> The other side will,
                    of course, in the same manner, indu e <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741943"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1943-0683"/>the other halves of the ends. The length of the
                    hips taken as a superficial dimension in feet, or by twelve inches, is added for
                    cutting and waste, and valleys are taken and added in the same manner when they
                    occur.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carpenter.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> For the scientific
                    principles of carpentry we must refer the reader to the article under that head,
                    and to the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Roof, Strength</hi> of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Materials,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Timber.</hi> Here we
                    have merely to speak of the practical details of carpenters’ work in the
                    operations of building,— indeed, of <hi rend="italic">carpentering,</hi> or the
                    practice of carpentry, considering it as a mechanical art.</p>
                <p>The carpenter works in wood, which he receives from the sawyer in beams,
                    scantlings, and planks, or boards, which he cuts and combines into bond-timbers,
                    wall-plates, floors, and roofs. He is distinguished from the joiner by his
                    operations being directed to the mere carcass of a building,—to things which
                    have reference to structure only. Almost every thing the carpenter does in and
                    to an edifice is absolutely necessary to its stability and efficiency, whereas
                    the joiner does not begin his operations until the carcass is complete; and
                    every article of joiners’ work might at any time be removed from a building
                    without undermining it or affecting its most important qualities. Certainly, in
                    the practice of building, a few things do occur which it is difficult to
                    determine to whose immediate province they belong; but the distinction is
                    nevertheless sufficiently broad for general purposes. The carpenter, with the
                    bricklayer or mason, and some of the minor artificers, constructs the frame or
                    hull; and the joiner, with the plasterer and others, decorates and rigs the
                    vessel: on the former the actual existence of the ship depends, and on the
                    latter depends her fitness for use.</p>
                <p>The carpenter frames or combines separate pieces of timber by scarfing, notching,
                    cogging, tenoning, pinning, and wedging; and the tools he uses are the rule, the
                    axe, the adze, the saw, the mallet, hammers, chisels, gouges, augers, hook-pins,
                    a square, a bevel, a pair of compasses, and a gauge, together with the level and
                    plumb-rule; besides these, planes, gimlets, pincers, a sledge hammer, a maul or
                    beetle, wedges, and a crow-bar, may be considered useful auxiliaries, though
                    they are not absolutely necessary to the performance of works of carpentry.</p>
                <p>To scarf is to cut away equally from the ends, but on the opposite sides, of two
                    pieces of timber, for the purpose of tying or connecting them lengthwise. This
                    is done to wall-plates and bond-timber, and especially to beams when they are
                    required of greater length than can be procured without joining. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Carpentry.)</hi> The usual mode of scarfing bond and
                    wall-plates is by cutting about three fifths through each piece on the upper
                    face of the one and the under face of the other, about six or eight inches from
                    the end, transversely, making what is technically termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >calf</hi> or <hi rend="italic">herf,</hi> and longitudinally from the end, from
                    two fifths down on the same side, so that the pieces lap together with a sort of
                    half dovetail. The heavy supervening weight of the wall and joists renders it
                    impossible that they should be drawn apart without tearing the fibres asunder or
                    lifting the weight. (See fig. 20.) Nevertheless these joints are generally
                    spiked, and it is always required that they be made to fall in or under a pier.
                    Notching is either square or dovetailed: it is used in connecting the ends of
                    wall-plates and bond-timber at the angles, in letting joists down on beams or
                    binders, purlines on principal rafters, &amp;c. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, fig. 21,
                    show varieties of notches applied as we have described. No. 1 is a simple square
                    notch or halving of the ends of bond-timbers or wall-plates at a right angle;
                    No. 2, a dovetailed notch. No. 3, the notch most commonly used: it is similar to
                    No. 1, but that the ends are allowed to run on so that the one piece grasps the
                    other, and each forms a cog to the other. No. 4 is an oblique-angled, dovetailed
                    notch; and No. 5 shows how joints are notched or let dow n on beams and binders,
                    and purlines on principal rafters. A notch is cut into the under edge of the
                    joist or purline an inch or an inch and a half in depth, and considerably
                    shorter than the beam, binder, or rafter is in thickness. Notches are also cut
                    down on the upper angles of the bearing pieces as long as the rider is thick, as
                    deep as the notch before described of the latter is, and so far in as to leave a
                    thickness on its own edge equal to the length of the notch in the riding joist
                    or purline. In the diagram one joint is indicated in its place let down in the
                    notch, and another indicates the notch in its own edge, and leaves exposed the
                    notches in the binder. Cogging, or cocking as it is vulgarly termed, is the
                    last-mentioned species of notch extended on one side, and leaving a narrow tooth
                    or cog alone in the bearing-piece flush with its upper face, No. 1, fig. 22. It
                    is used principally in tailing joists and beams on wall and tern-plates, and the
                    cog is here made narrower, because the end of the joist or rider coming
                    immediately beyond the plate, that part which forms the shoulder of the notch
                    would be liable, on being strained, to be chipped off or torn away, if it were
                    not kept as long as possible; and it is not of so much importance to guard
                    against weakening a wall-plate which is supported along its whole length, as a
                    beam, binder, or principal rafter, which rests on distant points alone. No. 2 of
                    the same diagram shows another mode of tailing on joists and beams by a dovetail
                    notch, which, to distinguish it from the flat notches, Nos. 2 and 4, fig. 21, is
                    called cocking, or cogging also, though the operation decidedly is not cogging.
                    This is a good mode if the timber be so well seasoned as not to be likely to
                    shrink more; but it would be improved by allowing the rider to take a bearing in
                    a notch like that to No. 1 before the dovetail commenced, as at No. 3, for in
                    the ordinary mode it is weakened in a point of great importance.</p>
                <p>Tenoning implies mortising also, as a matter of course. They are the names of the
                    two operations necessary to one result,—that of producing a connection between
                    two pieces by inserting part of the end of one into a hole of similar size cut
                    in the side or edge of the other. A tenon is formed by cutting in on each side
                    or edge of a piece of timber, near its end, transversely, to a certain depth, or
                    rather, leaving a certain part of the breadth or depth uncut, and then cutting
                    in longitudinally from the ends as far from each edge as the transverse cuts
                    have been made in depth, thus removing two square prisms and leaving a third
                    undivided. This is the tenon. An excavation in the side of a piece of timber, of
                    a certain depth, in the direction of its thickness, parallel to its edges, and
                    bounded lengthwise by lines at right angles to them, is a mortise. Tenons and
                    mortises are made of exactly corresponding size, and are most frequently at
                    equal distances from one or the other side or edge of the two pieces to be
                    conjoined; and for the most part, too, every angle formed in the process of
                    tenoning, both internal and external, is a right angle. Tenons are called
                    joggles in sonic situations, when they are not intended to be borne upon; and
                    their use is merely to keep the piece of timber to which they belong steadily in
                    its place, without being liable to slight accidents from lateral pressure or
                    violence. In combining timbers by means of mortises and tenons, to produce as
                    great a degree of strength as possible, it must be obvious that the object to be
                    kept in view is to maintain the end or tenon of the one as large and efficient
                    as it may be, and weaken the other as little as possible in forming the mortise.
                    For the efficiency of the mortised piece in a horizontal bearing, it is clear
                    that as much of its thickness should be below the mortise as possible, as at <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 23; for if it be put low, as at <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> the superincumbent weight on <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741956"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1956-0684"/>the tenon would more readily split or rend it in
                    the direction of the grain, as indicated; but the case is inverted with the
                    tenoned pieces. With the mortise at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the tenon could
                    only have the efficacy of so much of the piece to which it belongs as there is
                    of it above its under surface, which is a very small part of its depth; whereas
                    with the tenon at <hi rend="italic">b</hi> it would command the power of the
                    greatest part of the piece. To guard as much as possible against the danger of
                    too great a mortise and too small a tenon on one side and the other, and to
                    obviate the difficulty arising from the efficiency of one or the other of the
                    two pieces being affected by putting the tenon too high or too low, a compound,
                    called a tusk tenon, is used for almost all horizontal bearings of any
                    importance, especially to joists and binders, to trimmers, beams, girders,
                    brestsummers, &amp;c. The body of the tenon in this is a little above the middle
                    of the end, and it runs out two, three, or four inches, or more, as the case may
                    require. Below it the tusk protrudes, and above it the shoulder is cut down at
                    an obtuse angle with the horizontal line, giving the strength of the whole depth
                    of the timber above the under tusk to the tenon, and giving it a bearing in a
                    shallow mortise, whilst a greater depth of the mortised piece than the tusk
                    rests on receives the body of the tenon, and so protects its comparatively
                    narrow margin from undue pressure. The diagram No. 1, fig. 24, shows the tusk
                    tenon, with the section of a beam into which it is mortised; and No. 2 indicates
                    perspectively the appearance of the mortise in front. See also <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Carpentry.</hi></p>
                <p>Pinning is the insertion of nearly cylindrical pieces of wood or iron through a
                    tenon, to detain it in the mortise, or prevent it from being drawn out by any
                    ordinary force. For this purpose the pin is inserted either in the body, or
                    beyond the thickness, of the mortised piece, as indicated at <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> fig. 24, or at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 25. Wedging (see <hi
                    rend="italic">bb,</hi> No. 2, fig. 25) is the insertion of triangular prisms,
                    whose converging sides are under an extremely acute angle, into or by the end of
                    a tenon, to make it fill the mortise so completely, or bind it so tightly, that
                    it cannot be easily withdrawn. The wedging of tenons also assists in restoring
                    to the mortised piece of timber much of the strength it had lost by the excision
                    of so much of its mass, which indeed the tenon itself does if it fit closely in
                    every direction; but the assistance of the wedge renders the restoration more
                    perfect than the tenon could be made to do of itself, by compressing the fibres
                    of both, longitudinally to those of the one, and transversely to those of the
                    other, thus removing the tendency of the mortised piece to yield in any degree
                    in the weakened part, though it cannot make up the loss in its tenacity
                    occasioned by the section of its fibres.</p>
                <p>In scarfing, cogging, and notching, the shoulders are always cut in with the saw;
                    but the cheek is for the most part struck out with the mallet and chisel, or
                    adze, as may be most convenient. Tenons should be made entirely with the saw:
                    mortises are generally bored at the ends with an auger whose diameter equals
                    their thickness; the intervening part is taken out with a wide chisel, cutting
                    in the direction of the fibre; and the ends are squared down with a chisel whose
                    breadth just equals the thickness of the mortise. Wood pins must be rent to
                    insure the equal tenacity of their whole mass. Wedges are cut with the saw, but
                    straight grained stuff is always preferred for them.</p>
                <p>Bond-timbers and wall-plates should be carefully notched together at every angle
                    and return, and scarfed at every longitudinal joint. The scarf shown at fig. 20
                    is sufficient for the purpose; and the notch at No. 3, fig. 21, may be preferred
                    where notching is required; neither pinning nor nailing, however, can be of
                    great use to either the notch or the scarf. Bond-timbers are passed along and
                    through all openings, and are not cut out until such openings are to be
                    permanently occupied, that is, windows with their sash-frames, &amp;c. because
                    they assist in preventing irregular settlements, by helping to carry the weight
                    of a heavy part along the substruction generally, instead of allowing it to
                    press unduly upon the part immediately under it.</p>
                <p>Whatever notches and cogs for beams and joists are required in wall and
                    tern-plates, should be made before they are set on or in a wall; for, as they
                    are always bedded in mortar, any thing that may break the set must be
                    avoided.</p>
                <p>It is incumbent on the carpenter to supply the bricklayer or mason with wood
                    bricks in sufficient quantity, and to direct him where they should be placed to
                    receive the joiner’s fittings, or the battening, which the carpenter himself may
                    have to put up for the plasterer.</p>
                <p>The framed quartering partitions which may be required should be set up in every
                    story before the beams and joists of the floors are laid, that their horizontal
                    timbers may be notched on to the wall-plates, and that the joists or binders may
                    be notched on to them if occasion require it; but they should be fixed rather
                    below than above the level of the wall-plates, because they are not liable to
                    settle down so much as the walls, though even that will depend in a great degree
                    on the nature of the walling, and its liability to yield.</p>
                <p>The carpenter makes and fixes or sets centres of all kinds, whether for single
                    arches, vaults, or drains. The striking out of the centres, in the first
                    instance, is necessarily contingent on the arches to be turned on theiŉ, for the
                    forms of which the carpenter must look to the bricklayer or mason, whose
                    instructions for describing arches will be found under the head <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Stone-Masonry.</hi> Large centres are framed in distinct ribs,
                    and are connected by horizontal ties; whilst small ones are made of mere boards
                    cut to the required sweep, nailed together, and connected by battens notched
                    into or nailed on their edges. Precision and stability are nevertheless equally
                    and absolutely necessary, as it is impossible for an arch to be turned or set
                    correctly on an incorrect or unstable centre.</p>
                <p>The timbers or frame-work of floors is called naked flooring, and it is
                    distinguished as single, double, and framed. Of these the first, under ordinary
                    circumstances, is the strongest. Single flooring (see No. 1 and 2, fig. 29)
                    consists of one row or tier of joists alone, bearing from one wall or partition
                    to another, without any intermediate support, receiving the flooring boards on
                    the upper surface or edges of the joists, and the ceiling, if there be one, on
                    the lower. Joists in single floors should never be less than two inches in
                    thickness, because of their liability to be split by the brads or nails of the
                    boards if they are thinner; and they should never be much more, because of the
                    keying of the ceiling, which is injuriously affected by great thickness of the
                    joists. Twelve inches from joist to joist is the distance generally allowed;
                    that dimension, however, from centre to centre of the joists would be better.
                    Strength to almost any extent may be given by adding to the depth of the joists,
                    and diminishing the distance between them; and they may be made firm, and be
                    prevented from buckling or twisting, by putting struts between them. These
                    struts are short pieces of batten, which should not be less than an inch, and
                    need not be more than an inch and a half thick, and three or four inches wide,
                    placed diagonally between the joists, to which they are nailed, in a double
                    series, or crossing, as indicated by the full and dotted lines in the diagram,
                    fig. 26; and they should be made to range in a right line, that none of their
                    effect may be lost; and these ranges or rows should be repeated at intervals not
                    exceeding five or six feet. The struts should be cut at the ends with exactly
                    the same inclination or bevel, to fit closely. Great care should be taken, too,
                    not to split the struts in nailing; but the trouble of boring <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193741969" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1969-0685"/>with a gimlet is saved by
                    making a slight nick or incision with a wide-set saw for each nail, of which
                    there should not be less than two at each end; and the nails used should be
                    clasp-nails. If the struts were notched into the joists, it would add very
                    materially to their efficiency, but perhaps not in proportion to the additional
                    labour it would involve. This strutting should be done to single flooring under
                    any circumstances, as it adds materially to its firmness, and indeed to its
                    strength, by making the joists transmit any stress or pressure from one to
                    another. The efficiency of single flooring is materially affected by the
                    necessity which constantly occurs in practice of trimming round fire-places and
                    flues, and across vacuities. Trimming is a mode of supporting the end of a joist
                    by tenoning it into a piece of timber crossing it, and called a trimmer, instead
                    of running it on or into the wall which supports the ends of the other joists
                    generally. A trimmer requires for the most part to be carried or supported at
                    one or both of its ends by some of the joists, which are called trimming joists,
                    and are necessarily made stouter than if they had to bear no more than their own
                    share of the stress. Commonly it is found enough to make the trimmers and
                    trimming joists from half an inch to an inch thicker than common joists. In
                    trimming, tusk tenons should be used; and the long tongue or main body of the
                    tenon should run not less than two inches through, and be draw-pinned, and
                    wedged, moreover, if it do not completely fill the mortise in the direction of
                    the length of the latter. The principal objection, however, to single flooring
                    is, that sound readily passes through, the attachment of the boards above and of
                    the ceiling below being to the same joists throughout. Another objection, and
                    one already referred to, is the necessity of making the joists so thin, not to
                    injure the ceilings, that they with difficulty receive the flooring brads in
                    their upper edges without splitting. A partial remedy for both thesê
                    disadvantages is found in a mode sometimes adopted of making every third or
                    fourth joist an inch or an inch and a half deeper than the intervening joists;
                    and to these, ceiling joists are notched and nailed, or nailed alone, as shown
                    in the diagram, fig. 26. This, by diminishing the number of points of contact
                    between the upper and lower surface, for the ceiling joists must be carefully
                    kept from touching the shallower joists of the floor, is less apt to convey
                    sound from one story to another, and allows conveniently thin joists to be used
                    for the ceiling without affecting those of the floor. It clearly, however,
                    involves the necessity of cogging the deeper joists down so much more on the
                    wallplates on which their ends rest.</p>
                <p>Double flooring (see sections No. 1 and 2, fig. 27, and plan No. 3, fig. 29)
                    consists of three distinct tiers of joists, which are called binding, bridging,
                    and ceiling joists. The binders in this are the real support of the floor; they
                    run from wall to wall, and carry the bridging joists above and the ceiling
                    joists below them. Binders need not be less and should not be much more than six
                    feet apart, that is, if the bridging or flooring joists are not inordinately
                    weak. The bridging joists form the upper tier, and are notched down on the
                    binders with the notch shown at No. 5, fig. 21. The ceiling joists range under
                    the binders, and are notched and nailed as shown at No. 1, fig. 27; but the
                    notch must be taken entirely out of the ceiling joists, for the lower face or
                    edge of the binder may not be wounded by any means or on any account, and
                    moreover no good would be gained in any other respect by doing so. VVhen it is
                    an object to save height in the depth or thickness of this species of floor, the
                    ceiling joists may be tenoned into the binders, instead of being nailed on to
                    them; in this case the latter must be chase-mortised on one side, tor the
                    convenience of receiving the former when they are themselves set and fixed. A
                    chase is a long wedge-formed groove of the breadth or thickness of the mortise,
                    of which it is indeed an elongation, so that the tenon at one end of a ceiling
                    joist being inserted in the regular mortise in the binder prepared for it, that
                    at the other end is driven along the chase up to its place in the mortise in the
                    next binder. When ceiling joists are thus chase-mortised, their lower or under
                    faces are allowed to come a little below the under face of the binders, and the
                    space across is firred down by slips not wider than the ceiling joists are
                    thick. No. 2, fig. 27, shows a transverse compartment, or bay, of a floor in
                    this manner; but it is not so good a one as the preceding; for, besides
                    weakening the binders, by cutting so many mortises and chases in them, it is
                    almost impossible to give the ceiling floor the degree of firmness and
                    consistency it possesses in the other way, besides requiring the firring down on
                    the binders. The same space would be better gained by cutting the bridging
                    joists so much lower down; as they may, with the sort of notch indicated above,
                    be let down fully half their depth without great injury to either bridging
                    joists or binder, for they can always be made to fit tightly or firmly, and very
                    little more labour is involved in notching deeply than slightly.</p>
                <p>Flooring is said to be framed when girders are used together with binding,
                    bridging, and ceiling joists. (See sections No. 1 and 2, fig. 28, and plan No.
                    4, fig. 29.) Girders are large beams, in one or more pieces, according to the
                    length required, and the size and strength of which timber can be procured. They
                    are intended for longer bearings than mere binders may be trusted at, and may be
                    strengthened to almost any extent by trussing; but to be efficient, the height
                    of the truss must always be greater than the depth of the beam itself, and the
                    strength is increased by extending that height as the space or bearing
                    increases. A truss is indeed a wooden arch, whose lateral thrust will of course
                    be greater the smaller the angle subtended by it, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> It has been a commonly received opinion, that a truss within the
                    depth of a girder adds materially to its strength; but experiments have proved
                    that very little advantage is gained by such a one when executed in the best
                    manner, and that, badly executed, the beam or girder is weaker with the truss
                    than without it. Binders are made dependent on the girders by means of double
                    tusk tenons, and on and to them the bridging and ceiling joists are attached in
                    the manner before described. No. 1, fig. 28, shows the transverse section of a
                    compartment or bay of a framed floor; No. 2 the same longitudinally of the
                    girder, and of the bridging and ceiling joists, and transversely of the binders.
                    No. 1, fig. 29, is the plan of a single floor of joists tailing in on wall
                    plates with two chains of struts, and trimmed to a fireplace. No. 2 is a floor
                    similar to No. 1, with ceiling joists nailed to deeper flooring joists at
                    intervals, as shown in fig. 26. No. 3 is the plan of a double floor; and No. 4
                    is that of a framed floor of joists, bays of which are shown in section at fig.
                    27 and 28.</p>
                <p>Partitions of timber are called quartering partitions, and they are generally
                    framed. Common quartering partitions which rest on a wall or floor, and have
                    nothing to carry, consist merely of a sill, a head, and common uprights to
                    receive the lath for plastering: these last may be simply joggled or tenoned
                    into the head and sill, in the manner shown at <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> fig.
                    23, and stiffened by struts or stretching pieces put between them and nailed.
                    When, however, a quartering partition is over a vacuity·, or rests only on
                    certain points, and has, moreover, to sustain a weight, a floor perchance, it is
                    framed and trussed with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741982"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1982-0686"/>king or queen posts and braces, on the principle
                    of a roof; and the filling in of common uprights or quarters for the laths is
                    generally performed by joggling them at one end into either head or sill, and
                    nailing them securely to the raking braces. In the diagram No. 1, fig. 30, it is
                    supposed that an opening or doorway is to be made in the partition, so that the
                    timbers of the truss are placed around it with queen-posts, and a small internal
                    truss is put over the doorhead to prevent it from sagging, and to carry the long
                    part of the partition, which we suppose required to bear a floor, so that the
                    partition acts also, in fact, the part of a trussed girder in the most available
                    form. No. 2 presents another method of framing a similar partition.</p>
                <p>Shoring or propping up walls 'or floors, shoring for sewers, &amp;c. is done by
                    the carpenter. In appearance it is a simple operation, and under ordinary
                    circumstances it really is so; but nevertheless it often demands the exercise of
                    considerable skill and tact to determine and to counteract the tendency the part
                    or thing to be supported has in one direction or another.</p>
                <p>Pugging floors, firring down joists, and bracketing and cradling for plastering,
                    and some other things, are operations performed indifferently by the carpenter
                    or joiner, for they are not necessarily connected with the one more than the
                    other of these two mechanical arts.</p>
                <p>The labour of carpenter’s work is valued by the square of one hundred superficial
                    feet whenever it will admit of being so measured, and the timber is as generally
                    valued by the cubic foot. It is customary for the carpenter’s work to be
                    measured at the same time with the walls and roof covering, or when the carcass
                    of a building is completed, and before the joiner and plasterer commence their
                    operations; for then it is all still exposed, and may be correctly and certainly
                    measured, whereas much must be taken on trust if the measurement be deferred
                    until the works are completely finished.</p>
                <p>Bond timber, wood bricks, and wall and tern-plates, are taken under the same
                    head, and are reduced to cubic feet of timber at so much per foot, including the
                    labour of every kind on it. The naked flooring is taken on the surface from wall
                    to wall, with a description of the nature of it, whether it be single, double,
                    or framed—if trimmed to chimneys, party walls, stairs, or to any thing else—if
                    notched or cogged to wall-plates and partition heads—the number and size of the
                    large timbers, ceiling joists as notched and nailed to wall-plates, and as
                    framed or notched and nailed to binders or common joists; and every thing indeed
                    that affects the quantity of labour required in forming it. The superficial feet
                    are reduced to squares for the labour and nails involved and used in forming and
                    fixing or setting the floors. The timbers of which the flooring is composed are
                    then taken in detail and in cubic quantities, and are said to be without labour,
                    or with no labour. Roofing is measured in the same manner, by the superficial
                    square, for labour and nails, taken on the common rafters from ridge to heel;
                    the length of a rafter by the length of the roof for one side of a common span,
                    and repeated or doubled for the other, noting also a description of the roof,
                    whether it be lean-to or shed roofing, if on purlines and with struts; common
                    span-roofing; curb roofing; span roofing with purlines and collar beams,
                    strutted or otherwise, from walls or partitions; span roofing with framed
                    principals, tie-beams, king-posts or queenposts, straining beam, straining sill,
                    struts, purlines, poleplates, and so on or as the case may be, and this too for
                    labour and nails. All the timbers are then taken, measuring every one to the
                    extent of any tenon or tenons at its ends, in cubic quantities also, and as
                    without labour. Bolts, bars, straps, stirrups, &amp;c. are taken separately, and
                    their dimensions noted ‘from which to ascertain their weight. Gutter-boards and
                    bearers are measured and valued by the foot superficial, according to the
                    thickness of the former. Rough boarding for lead on flats, and sound boarding
                    for slates or lead, are taken superficially, and reduced into squares. Centring
                    to vaults is measured on the periphery of the arch, or round back of the centre,
                    for the breadth, by the length, and is valued by the square; to apertures in the
                    thickness of walls, by the foot, and to camberarches, by number, so much a
                    piece. Quartering partitions are measured by the square for labour and nails,
                    and the material is taken by the cubic foot. Battening to walls is also measured
                    by the square, but the stuff is generally included with the labour, as in
                    boarding. Cradling and bracketing is valued by the foot superficial, and with
                    reference to the quantity of stuff required or worked up. Any planing that may
                    have been necessary, and it will happen at times on beams, joists, &amp;c. when
                    it is not intended to have a ceiling under the floor, is charged by the foot on
                    the surface, and any beading or other moulding by the foot running.</p>
                <p>It sometimes happens that a superficial quantity for labour and nails on framed
                    timber cannot be obtained; in that case the timber is measured by the cubic foot
                    as framed, or with the labour of framing included with its own cost, &amp;c. In
                    this case, however, it is necessary to make a distinction between one quantity
                    and another, as the labour employed upon an equal quantity of stuff in framing
                    some parts of a roof is much greater than is required in most floors. Many
                    things, such as strong door and window frames, that are to be worked into the
                    walls, story-posts, brestsummers, &amp;c. are always taken as framed timber,
                    with any addition that may occur of wrought, rebated, beaded, &amp;c. as the
                    case may be.</p>
                <p>The price or value to be attached to the varieties of carpenter’s work depends
                    almost as much on the texture or hardness of the timber employed, as on its
                    cost. What the timber itself should be charged at may be thus determined. To its
                    price in the gross at the timber merchant’s must be added the cost of carriage
                    to the spot where it is to be employed, which will be so much the load of fifty
                    cubic feet, or so much per foot; then to the cost of each cubic foot of timber
                    add the price of four superficial feet of sawing, which will form a fair average
                    for the variously sized scantlings, and one eighth of the increased amount to it
                    as an allowance for waste in cutting up and working. This gives the actual cost,
                    to the builder, of the timber as it is worked up; and if it is to be charged as
                    with no labour, his profit and a remuneration for his own labour of
                    superintending, &amp;c. alone remain to be included. If, however, labour of any
                    kind is to be charged with the stuff, it should be added first, and the
                    builder’s profit, &amp;c. taken on both, or on the increased amount for the
                    price per foot. The cost of labour depends so much upon such a. variety of
                    circumstances, that it is impossible to aid the inquirer materially in
                    apportioning prices for the various operations. In this, as in other things, it
                    is well, when the parties are not otherwise qualified to determine a scale of
                    charges, to observe the time a man or a certain number of men are employed in
                    executing so much work of a certain description, and compare the quantity by
                    measurement with the time employed in executing it, or rather with the wages of
                    the workmen for the time. In fixing a price for labour in carpenter’s work, the
                    size of the timbers, and the heights they have to be hoisted, together with such
                    scaffolding and machinery for hoisting as may be fount necessary, if the timbers
                    be heavy, and the height and expense great, must be considered. As the timber
                    used in shoring is not consumed, a charge is made for use and was e to the
                    amount of one third of its value if it be much cut up, and one fourth if but
                    little, in addition to the labour of s£ ' ting up and taking down, whatever that
                    may be.</p>

                    also will be found in an article under that head in another part of this work;
                    here we have merely to do with the modes of operation, and the tools employed by
                    the workman, together with the manner of estimating or determining the value of
                    his work.</p>
                <p>The distinction between the operations of the carpenter and the joiner is shown
                    in the commencement of the preceding section on the trade of the former. A man
                    may be a good carpenter without being a joiner at all; but he cannot be a joiner
                    without being competent, at least, to all the operations required in carpentry.
                    It is, indeed, very truly remarked in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Joinery,</hi> “that the rough labour of the carpenter renders him in some
                    degree unfit to produce that accurate and neat workmanship which is expected
                    from a modern joiner ;” but it is no less true that the habit of neatness and
                    the great precision of the joiner, make him a much slower and less profitable
                    workman than the practised carpenter, in works of carpentry.</p>
                <p>The joiner operates on battens, boards, and planks, with saws, planes, chisels,
                    gouges, hatchet, adze, gimblets and other boring instruments, which are aided
                    and directed by chalked lines, gauges, squares, hammers, mallets, and a great
                    many other less important tools; and his operations are principally sawing and
                    planing in all their extensive varieties, setting out, mortising, dovetailing,
                    &amp;c. A great range of other operations, none of which can be called
                    unimportant, such as paring, gluing up, wedging, pinning, fixing, fitting, and
                    hanging, and many things besides which depend on nailing, &amp;c. such as laying
                    floors, boarding ceiling, wainscotting walls, bracketing, cradling, fiering, and
                    the like. In addition to the wood on which the joiner works, he requires also
                    glue, nails, brads, screws, and hinges, and accessorily he applies bolts, locks,
                    bars, and other fastenings, together with pulleys, lines, weights, white-lead,
                    holdfasts, wall-hooks, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Battens are narrow boards running from half an inch to an inch and a half or two
                    inches thick, and from three to six or seven inches wide. A piece of stuff of
                    too small a scantling to be a batten is called a fillet. The term board is
                    applied to sawed stuff when its width exceeds that of a batten, and its
                    thickness does not exceed two inches or two inches and a half. The term plank is
                    applied to large pieces of stuff whose width is great in proportion to their
                    thickness, and whose thickness nevertheless does not exceed three or four
                    inches. In London these terms are used in much more restricted senses than they
                    are here described to mean, because of the fixed and regular sizes and forms in
                    which stuff for the joiner’s use is for the most part brought to market there. A
                    batten, to a London joiner, is a fine flooring board from an inch to an inch and
                    a half in thickness, and just seven inches wide. A board is a piece cut from the
                    thickness of a deal whose width is exactly nine inches; and every thing, almost,
                    above that width, and not large enough to be called a scantling of timber, is a
                    plank.</p>
                <p>The joiners’ work for a house is for the most part prepared at the shop, where
                    every convenience may be supposed to exist for doing every thing in the best and
                    readiest manner; so that little remains to be done when the carcass is ready,
                    but fit, fix, and hang, that is, after the floors are laid. The sashes and
                    frames, the shutters, back flaps, backs, backs and elbows, soffits, grounds,
                    doors, &amp;c. are all framed and put together, that is, wedged up and cleaned
                    off, at the shop; the flooring boards are prepared, that is, faced, shot, and
                    gauged with a fillister rebate; and all the architraves, pilasters, jamb
                    linings, skirtings, mouldings, &amp;c. are all got out, that is, tried up,
                    rebated, and moulded, at the shop.</p>
                <p>When the carcass of a building is ready for the joiner, the first thing to be
                    done is to cut the bond timber out of the openings, set the sash frames, and
                    fill them with old sashes or with oiled paper on frames, to exclude the weather,
                    but admit light. The flooring joists are then proved with straight-edges, and
                    any inequalities in them are removed with the adze; the flooring boards are next
                    cut down to their places, and they are turned with their faces downwards until
                    the ceilings are done; but first the pugging floors, if any are intended, are
                    formed, and the pugged clay is put in on them. Floors are in ordinary cases
                    either straight joint or folding, and are edge or face nailed. Folding floors
                    are those in which three, four, or five boards are laid at a time, with their
                    heading joints all on the same joist, and of course in the same straight line.
                    In laying them, one board being firmly nailed to the joists at the extremity of
                    the floor, another is laid parallel to it at the distance of the width of three
                    or four others, or rather within their width, and these are then forced down and
                    nailed, the forcing having brought all the joints up close. This is a bad mode,
                    however, and should never be used. Straight joint flooring is when every board
                    is laid separately, or one at a time, the heading joint or joints being broken
                    or covered regularly in every case. Straight joint flooring may be with square
                    joints, when it is entirely face nailed, or it may be dowelled or tongued, when
                    it is side or edge nailed only. Dowelling is the driving pins of wood or iron
                    half their length into the edge of the last laid board, the outer edge of which
                    has been skew-nailed, their other ends running into holes prepared for them in
                    the inner edge of the next board, in the way the head of a cask is held
                    together, and then its outer edge is skew-nailed in the same manner, and so on.
                    Tongueing is effected by grooving both edges of every board, and fitting thin
                    slips and tongues into them, as described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Joinery.</hi> The boards are forced together by pressure applied to the outer
                    edge; wedges with iron dogs driven into the joists are commonly used, but they
                    are very objectionable instruments. The nail used in face-nailing floors is
                    called a flooring brad; it has no head, but a mere tongue projecting on one side
                    of the top of the nail, which is put in the direction of the grain, that it may
                    admit of being punched in below the surface level, otherwise the superficial
                    inequalities could not be reduced when the floor was completed, because of the
                    projecting heads of the nails. For side or edge nailing, however, clasp-nails,
                    nails whose heads extend across on two of the opposite sides, are used.</p>
                <p>Another early operation the joiner has to attend to, is the fixing of the framed
                    door and window and the narrow skirting grounds (see fig. 35) to which the
                    plasterers may float their work. The skirting grounds are generally dovetailed
                    at the angles, and are well blocked out, so that they may not vibrate on being
                    struck, or yield to pressure when the plasterer’s straight-edge passes roughly
                    over their surface; they must also be set with the utmost truth and precision.
                    When the floors are cut down and the grounds fixed, the joiner’s operations in a
                    building should be suspended until the plasterers have finished, or nearly so,
                    and then the floors may be laid. By deferring this operation until that period,
                    the workmen of the two different trades are prevented from interrupting each
                    other, and indeed injuring each other’s work; and joiners always find employment
                    in the shop preparing, as before intimated.</p>
                <p>The preparation flooring boards receive, is planing on the face, shooting on the
                    edges, and gauging to a thickness; the common fillister, or stop rebate plane,
                    being used to work down to the gauge mark, from the back of every board, and
                    about half an inch in on each edge. When a board is to be laid, it is turned on
                    its face in the place it is to occupy, and the workman with his adze cuts away
                    from the back over every joist down to the gauge rebate, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193742008" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2008-0688"/>so that on being turned over
                    it falls exactly into its place, and takes the same level with all its fellows,
                    which have been brought to the same gauge; then follows the process of laying as
                    before described, and the result must, if the work be done well, be a perfectly
                    even and level surface. The slight inequalities of surface which may occur are
                    reduced with a smoothing-plane, the brads being previously punched below the
                    surface if the floor be face-nailed. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Joinery,</hi> sections 35 and 36.</p>
                <p>In getting out skirtings, if the work be of a superior description, the boards
                    should be tried up as if for framing in every particular except bringing to a
                    width, which need not be done. The face edges, however, must be worked with
                    great precision, and moulded or rebated as the case may require. Rebating or
                    tongueing will be necessary when the skirting consists of more than one piece,
                    that the different pieces may be made to fit neatly and firmly together; and all
                    but the lowest piece must of necessity be brought to a width, as well as tried
                    up in other particulars. A skirting in a single width is called by that term;
                    but when it is made up of more than one part it is designated a base: the lowest
                    board is then called the skirting board, and the upper the base moulding or
                    mouldings. (Fig. 31 and 35.) The reason why the skirting board is not brought to
                    a width is, that the labour would be lost according to the ordinary mode of
                    fixing it. The board is applied to its place with its lower edge touching the
                    floor; but as the most perfectly wrought floor will be likely to have some
                    slight unevenness of surface so close to the wall, a straight-edge would not fit
                    closely down it in every part. The board is therefore propped ιιp at one end or
                    the other until the upper or faced edge is perfectly parallel with the average
                    line of the floor, or rather to be perfectly level. A pair of strong compasses,
                    such as those used by the carpenter, is taken, and opened to the greatest
                    distance the lower edge of the skirting board is from the floor throughout its
                    length; the outer edge, near the point of one leg of the compasses, is then
                    drawn along the floor, whilst the point of the other, being kept vertically
                    above it, is pressed against the face of the board, on which it marks a line
                    exactly parallel to the surface of the floor, indicating, of course, every, even
                    the slightest irregularity there may be in it. If the floor be not a very uneven
                    one, the excluded part may be ripped off with the hand or the panel saw, which
                    may generally be made to follow the traced or inscribed line exactly; if,
                    however, the line be a very irregular one, having quick turns in it, the hatchet
                    must be used. This operation is called <hi rend="italic">scribing,</hi> and the
                    result of it is evidently to make the skirting fit down on the floor with the
                    utmost precision. Care must be taken, in performing the operation, that the
                    upper edges of the skirtings be not only level, but that all which are in
                    immediate connection be scribed to an equal height, that their upper edges may
                    exactly correspond. Sometimes skirtings are let into a groove in the floor, as
                    indicated in the diagram, fig. 35, and thus a slight degree of shrinking is made
                    of less importance, and scribing rendered unnecessary. Before skirtings are
                    fixed, vertical blocks are put at short intervals, extending from the floor to
                    the narrow grounds, and made exactly flush with and true to the latter, and are
                    firmly nailed. These form a sound backing, to which the skirtings may be bradded
                    or nailed; and so prevent them from warping or bending in any manner. If,
                    however, the skirting be not very wide, and be sufficiently stout to stand
                    without a backing, a fillet only is nailed along the floor as a stop for its
                    lower edge; but this is rendered unnecessary if the skirting be tongued into the
                    floor, as the tongue will answer every purpose of a stop. The ends of skirtings
                    should be tongued into each other when it is necessary to piece them in length;
                    and on returns or an gles the end of one should be tongued into the returned
                    face of the other in the square parts, and mitred in the oblique-angled or
                    moulded.</p>
                <p>When a chair-rail or surbase is required, grounds similar to those for the base
                    are fixed to range like them with the face of the plastering; the surbase itself
                    must be wide enough to cover the grounds and the joints formed by them and the
                    plastering, completely; it is in effect a cornice to the stereobate and the
                    space intervening it, and the base is generally understood to be wainscotted,
                    though it is more frequently plastered.</p>
                <p>In framing or framed work, the outer vertical bars which are mortised are called
                    styles; and the transverse, those on whose ends the tenons are formed, are
                    called rails. (Fig.32.) In doors, particularly, the open spaces or squares
                    formed internally by the rails and styles are divided in the width by bars
                    parallel to the styles. These are tenoned into the rails, and are called
                    mountings, or, vulgarly, <hi rend="italic">muntins.</hi> The frame being formed
                    by trying up, setting out, mortising, and tenoning, the inner or face edges of
                    the styles, and of the highest and lowest rails, and both edges of the muntins
                    and of the inner rails, are grooved with the plough to receive the edges and
                    ends of the filling-in parts, or panels of the frame-work. Panels are either
                    flat, raised, or flush. (Fig. 33.) Flat panels are no thicker than the grooves
                    into which they are fitted, and consequently their faces are as much below the
                    surface of the framing as the groove is in from each side of the styles and
                    rails. Raised panels are thicker than the groove in the framing, but are not so
                    thick as to reach the surface; nor is the panel thickened through its whole
                    extent. It fits exactly into the groove, and thickens gradually for an inch or
                    two, and then sets off at a right angle with the surface, increasing suddenly
                    three or four sixteenths of an inch. A panel may be raised on one side only, or
                    on both sides. Flush panels are rebated down from one face to the distance the
                    plough groove is in from the surface of the framing; and the back of a panel
                    thus rebated on one side is worked down to be even with the other edge of the
                    groove, leaving a tongue to fit it exactly; for if it be required to make panels
                    flush on both sides, it is generally effected by filling in on the back or
                    flattened side with an extraneous piece. Framing is not, however, often finished
                    in the manner above described, especially with raised and flush panneis;
                    mouldings are generally introduced, and are either struck or worked in the solid
                    substance of the framing, or in separate pieces or slips, and laid in with
                    brads. If a moulding be struck or laid in on one side onlý, and the other is
                    left plain, the framing is described as moulded and square, a flat panel being
                    in that case understood; if the panel be raised the framing will be described as
                    moulded with a raised pan¢l on one side, and square or flush the other. It may
                    be moulded with a flat panel, or moulded with a raised panel, on both sides; and
                    the moulding may, as before intimated, be either struck in the solid, or laid in
                    in any of the preceding cases. Mouldings which are laid in round the panels of
                    framing are neatly mitred at the angles, and bradded, to appear as much as
                    possible as if they were struck in the solid. In nailing or bradding the
                    mouldings, the brads should be driven into the frame-work, and not into the
                    panels. With a flush panel, however, the moulding is always either a bead, or a
                    series of beads called <hi rend="italic">reeds</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    is, in the case of a single bead, which is most common, always struck on the
                    solid frame, and the work is called bead-flush; but reeds are generally <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> struck on the panel in the direction of the grain,
                    and laid in on the pane across it, or along the ends; this is termed reed-flush.
                    Fins panels in inferior works have a single bead struck on their sides in the
                    direction of the grain alone, the ends abutting plainly, as in the first diagram
                    of a flush panel, and this is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742021"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-2021-0689"/>termed bead-butt, the fact that the panels are
                    flush being inferred. The plainest quality of framing, in which it is square on
                    both sides, is used in the fittings of inferior bed-rooms, inner closets, and
                    the plainer domestic offices, but always internally; framing moulded on one or
                    both sides, in rooms and places of a greater degree of importance, and in places
                    where the work may be more generally seen; in some cases a flat panel may be
                    enriched by a small moulding laid on its surface, leaving a margin between it
                    and the larger moulding at its extremities; this may be done in drawing-rooms
                    and apartments of that class, especially if they be in an upper story; and
                    raised panels should be confined to the framed fittings of diningrooms and other
                    apartments on a ground or principal story. Framing with flush panels is almost
                    restricted to external doors, &amp;c. one side of a door being bead-flush, and
                    the other flat and moulded, perhaps, or the face may be moulded with a raised
                    panel, and the back bead-flush; and this for principal entrances. Bead-butt
                    framing is found in external doors to offices, &amp;c. Doors are made four
                    panelled for the most part when the panels are flat and the framing square, six
                    panelled when the latter is moulded, and six, eight, or even ten panelled when
                    the framing is of the superior descriptions. Doors which are hung in two equal
                    widths to occupy the doorway, and are hung to the opposite side posts or jambs
                    of the frame, are said to be double margined; that is, the styles or margins are
                    repeated necessarily in the middle where they meet. Doorways are fitted with
                    jamb linings, and architraves or pilasters. Jamb linings may be framed to
                    correspond with the door on the outer faces; and when they exceed nine or ten
                    inches in width they should always be so, or they may be solid. Narrow and plain
                    jamb linings to inferior rooms are rebated on one side only, and the rebate
                    forms the frame into which the door is fitted. To superior work they are rebated
                    on both sides, as if it were intended to put a door on each side. The jambs are
                    fixed to the inner edges of the grounds; and if they are wide, and not framed,
                    backings are put across to stiffen them; and these backings are dovetailed into
                    the edges of the grounds. Architravesand pilasters are variously sunk and
                    moulded, according to the fancy of the designer. They are fixed to the grounds
                    with their internal edges exactly fitting to the rebates in the jambs, and they
                    form the enriched margin or moulding of the frame in which the door is set.
                    Architraves are mitred at the upper angle, but pilasters have generally a
                    console or an enriched block or cap resting on them, to which they fit with a
                    square joint; both the one and the other either run down and are scribed to the
                    floor, or rest on squared blocks or bases, which may be the height of the
                    skirting board, or of the ^liole base.</p>
                <p>The parts of the outside frame of a sash are distinguished by the terms applied
                    to the similar parts of common framing. The upright sides are styles, and the
                    transverse or horizontal ones, which are tenoned into the ends of the styles,
                    are rails; but the inner frame-work or divisions for the panes are called merely
                    upright and cross bars; the upright being the mortised, and the cross bars the
                    tenoned, nevertheless, as with the outer frame-work. (Fg. 31.) Sashes are got
                    out like common framing; the parts are tried up, set out, mortised and tenoned,
                    exactly in the same manner, allowance being made in the length of the rails and
                    all tenoned pieces, in the setting out, as in common framing also, for the
                    portions of the mortised styles and upright bars, which are worked away in
                    forming the moulding and rebate. The meeting rails of sashes which are in pairs,
                    to be hung with lines, are made thicker than the other parts by the thickness of
                    the parting bead, and they arebevelled or splayed off, the one from aboveand the
                    other from below, that they may meet and fit closely.</p>
                <p>λVhen the frame-work is completed, although it cannot be put together because of
                    what has just been referred to, ' the rebate is formed by the sash fillister on
                    the further part of the face edge, and the moulding struck on its hither angle.
                    These things being done, the moulded edges are either mitred or scribed at the
                    shoulders and haunches, and the sash may be put together. If sash bars are
                    mitred at the joints they require dowels in the cross bars to act as tenons; but
                    if they can be scribed, dowelling is not required. Sashes are either fixed or
                    hung with hinges, or with lines, pulleys, and weights. Fixed sashes are put into
                    frames, of which every part may be solid but the stop, which must be put in
                    behind the sash to detain it. Sashes hung with hinges require solid rebated
                    frames; but there can be no stops to them except their own movable fastenings,
                    and the outer stop, which of course the rebate furnishes. Sashes hung with lines
                    require cased frames to receive the pulleys and weights. The sill of the frame
                    is made, as in the former cases, solid, is sunk and weathered, and is generally
                    made of a more durable material than the rest of the frame; the sides in the
                    direction of the thickness of the frame are of one and a quarter or one and a
                    half inch board, very truly tried up, and grooved to receive a parting bead; for
                    it must be obvious that sashes hung with lines to run vertically up and down
                    within the height of the frame must be themselves in two heights, and must pass
                    each other in two separate and distinct channels. The ends of these boards are
                    fixed into the upper face of the solid sill below, and into a similar board
                    parallel to the sill which forms a head above, and they are called pulley
                    pieces, or styles, because they receive the pulleys, which are let into them
                    near their upper ends. Linings from four to six inches in width, and from three
                    fourths of an inch to an inch in thickness, are nailed on to the edges of the
                    pulley pieces, and to the sill and head above and below, inside and outside in
                    the direction of the breadth of the sash frame, and are returned along the head
                    in the direction of its length. The outside linings are made to extend within
                    the pulley pieces about half an inch, to form a stop for the upper and outer
                    sash; and the inside linings are made exactly flush with their inner faces. The
                    casing is completed by fixing thin linings on to the outer edges of the outside
                    and inside linings, parallel to the pulley pieces, to prevent any thing from
                    impeding the weights. Thin slips called parting beads are fitted tightly into
                    the grooves previously noticed in the pulley pieces, but they are not fixed, as
                    the upper sash can be put in or taken out only by the temporary removal of the
                    parting bead. An outer or stop bead is mitred round on the inside to complete
                    the groove or channel for the lower sash; the stop bead covers the edge of the
                    inside linings on the sides and head, and is fixed by means of screws, which may
                    be removed without violence when it is required to put in or take out the
                    sashes. A hole covered with a movable piece, large enough to allow the lead or
                    iron weight to pass in and out, is made in each of the pulley pieces, so that
                    the sashes may be hung after the frames are set, and to repair any accident that
                    may occur to the hangings in after-use. (Fig. 34.) It may be here remarked, that
                    sash-frames require greater truth and precision from the workman than any thing
                    else in the joiner’s work of a building; and unless the stuff employed be quite
                    sound and perfectly seasoned, all the workman’s care in operating will be thrown
                    away. The fittings of a window which has boxed shutters consist of back linings,
                    grounds, back, elbows and soffit, together with shutters and back flaps, and
                    architraves or pilasters round on the inside to form a moulded frame. (Figs. 31
                    and 34.) Back linings are generally framed with flush panels; they fit in
                    between the inside lining of the sash frame and the framed ground, to both of
                    which they are attached, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742034"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-2034-0690"/>form the back of the boxing into which the
                    shutters fall back. They are tongued into the inside lining by their inner edge,
                    and on their outer edge the ground is nailed, and they are set at right angles
                    to the sash-frame, or obtusely outwards, as the shutters may be splayed or not.
                    The back is the continuation of the window fittings from the sash-sill to the
                    floor on the inside; the elbows are its returns on either side under the
                    shutters, and the soffit is the piece of framing which extends from one side of
                    the window to the other, across the head, the width or extent of the shutters.
                    These are all framed to correspond with the shutters on the face; but, as they
                    are fixed, their backs are left unwrought. Window shutters are framed in
                    correspondence with the door and other framed work of the room to which they
                    belong, in front, and generally with a flush panel behind: the back flaps are in
                    one or two separate breadths to each shutter, according to the width of the
                    window and the depth of the recess; they are made lighter than the shutters
                    themselves; and they should, when shut to, present faces exactly corresponding
                    with those of the shutters, both internally and externally. The shutters are
                    hung to the sash-frame with butt hinges, and the back flaps are hung to their
                    outer styles with a hinge called a back flap, from its use. The shutters and
                    their back flaps are hung in one, two, or more heights, as may be found
                    convenient. The moulded margin round the boxings of a window on the inner face
                    are made to harmonize generally with the similar parts of the doors of the room
                    or place to which it belongs. The fixing and hanging of window fittings or
                    dressings are hardly less important, for the accuracy required, than the making
                    and fixing of the sash-frame itself; the slightest infirmity or inaccuracy in
                    any part will be likely to derange some important operation. Sashes, it may be
                    remarked, are never fitted until the frames are immovably fixed, so that if
                    there be any inaccuracy in the latter, the sashes are cut away or pieced out to
                    make them fit; but, as they are intended to traverse, the fitting in that case
                    can only apply to one particular position, and in every one but that there must
                    be something wrong. Any incorrectness in the sash-frame, again, must throw the
                    shutters and their back flaps out; indeed the sash-frame, though apparently a
                    secondary part of the arrangement, is that which affects all the rest beyond
                    anything else. When sashes have been fitted, a plough groove, wide and deep
                    enough to receive the sash-line, is made in the outer edges of the styles, for
                    about two thirds of their length, at their upper ends. They are then primed and
                    glazed, and when the putty is sufficiently set the joiner hangs them. He is
                    furnished with sash-line, tacks, and iron or lead weights, which are generally
                    made cylindrical, with a ring at one end, to which the line may be attached. A
                    sash is weighed, and two weights are selected which together amount to within a
                    few ounces of the same gravity. The line is then passed through the pulley,
                    which was previously fixed in the pulley style; the end is knotted to a weight
                    which is passed in at the hole left for the purpose, and at a sufficient
                    distance, which a common degree of intelligence will readily determine; the line
                    is cut off and the end tacked into the groove in the style of the sash.</p>
                <p>Glue is used principally in putting framed work together, but not at all in
                    fixing; and even for the former purpose it is much less used by good workmen
                    than by inferior ones. When the stuff is well seasoned, and the trying up,
                    setting out, mortising, and tenoning, are well and accurately executed, there is
                    no necessity for glue on the tenons and shoulders; the wedges alone need be
                    glued, to attach them to the sides of the tenons, that their effect may not
                    depend on mere compression. Joiners are generally furnished with a cramp, with
                    which to force the joints of framing into close contact; it is either of wood
                    acting by means of wedges, or of iron with a screw. This, too, is unnecessary
                    with good work, every joint of which may be brought perfectly close without
                    great violence of any kind. The cramp will sometimes give bad work the semblance
                    of good, but it cannot make it really so. If any cracking and starting be heard
                    in the joiner’s work of a new building, it generally indicates one of two
                    things; either the cramp has been required in putting the framing together, or,
                    having been put together, it has been forced out of winding in fixing, and the
                    constrained fibres are seeking to regain their natural position. A good workman
                    does not require a cramp, nor will his work, if he has been supplied with
                    seasoned stuff, ever require to be strained; and consequently the cracking and
                    starting of joiner’s work indicates unfit stuff or bad work, or perhaps both. It
                    is true that glued joints will sometimes fly; but when they do, there need be no
                    hesitation in determining the presence of both bad work, and stuff in an
                    improper state.</p>
                <p>Floors are measured and valued by the square of a hundred superficial feet; but
                    any thing beyond the mere flooring, such as the mitred borders generally put as
                    a margin to the stone slab of a fire-place, is taken extra by the foot
                    superficial, or running, as the additional work may be above or below three
                    inches in width. The first important thing to note in measuring a floor is the
                    thickness of the boards, by which to determine the cost of the principal
                    material. A floor of boards unplaned on the face, and shot on the edges, laid
                    folding, is the roughest that can be supposed; with the boards wrought or planed
                    on the face, and laid in the same manner, will be the next in advance; and
                    straight joint flooring, in all its varieties, is the most troublesome, and
                    consequently the most expensive in common and general use. Whether the boards be
                    wide or narrow is a consideration to be noted, an equal surface being of course
                    more rapidly covered with wide than with narrow boards; whether they be gauged,
                    and if brought to a thickness throughout, or only rebate gauged, and cut down on
                    the joints with the adze; in what manner the heading joints are formed and
                    secured; how the longitudinal joints are executed, whether square, ploughed and
                    tongued, or dowelled; and whether the boards are face or edge nailed. Solid
                    frames, as for outside doors, &amp;c. are measured and valued by the cubic foot,
                    labour being calculated upon the stuff according to the nature and extent of
                    what may have been applied to it.</p>
                <p>λVith trifling and unimportant exceptions, every thing else in joiner’s work that
                    exceeds three inches in width is taken by the superficial foot; and the
                    dimensions are taken on the finished and fixed work, so that allowances must be
                    made for whatever waste*may have been of necessity made. The stuff worked up by
                    the joiner is always supposed to have been in planks and boards a certain number
                    of quarters of an inch in thickness, so that whatever the finished work may
                    stand, it is taken as of the thickness which in quarters of an inch it is next
                    below; thus, if the -styles of a door stand at even less than an inch and seven
                    eighths, it is taken as a two-inch door; for a piece of framing is always
                    considered to be of the thickness of its outer frame-work, the description
                    determining the substance of the panels. Framed grounds are measured round on
                    the outside for the length; their width is not that or the frame, but of the
                    styles and head as they actually are; and their thickness that of the stuff
                    before it was planed at all. Narrow grounds are taken by the foot running, their
                    width being noted in the description of them. Jamb linings are measured to the
                    full length they may be of by their width, the thickness being noted, together
                    with a description of the work on them,—if they are single or double rebated, if
                    framed, and in what manner, &amp;c.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742047" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2047-0691"/>
                <p>The dimensions of a door are generally taken within the rebates in which it is to
                    hang, with its thickness and description noted,—as of four, six, or eight
                    panels, moulded on one or both sides, with flat or raised panels, &amp;c.; if it
                    be double margined, that is stated, and the amount of the lap or rebate in their
                    meeting styles is added to the width, to increase the superficies by so much.
                    The hinges with which a door is hung, and the lock or other fastenings which may
                    be on it, are taken, with a description of their sizes and qualities,
                    immediately after the door itself. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> sashes are in a
                    solid frame they are taken alone, but sashes in cased frames are measured in and
                    with the frames. To the clear height between the sill and the head, three inches
                    are added for the thickness of the sill, and four inches for the depth of the
                    case at the head, for the height; and to the width between the pulley-styles is
                    added eight, nine, or ten inches, as the case may be, for the breadth of the
                    casing on each side, for the width; these give the superficies of the sashes and
                    frame. The sashes and frame are described, with the thickness of the former,
                    which determines that of the latter; the sill is described as sunk or merely
                    weathered; the pulley-styles as of such a thickness; the pulleys, line, and
                    stuff employed in the different parts of the frame as of such and such qualities
                    and sorts; and whether the sashes be single or double hung, with what
                    fastenings, &amp;c. The boxings for the shutters are taken in a superficial
                    quantity, as square or splayed, if circular on plan, whether with a flat or
                    quick sweep, or if circular headed, and straight on plan. The back linings, the
                    backs, elbows, and soffits, the shutters and the back flaps, are all measured by
                    the superficial foot, according to their thicknesses and descriptions, the
                    hinges and fastenings of the shutters and back flaps being numbered and noted
                    independently of them. The capping to backs is taken by the running foot; and
                    elbow cappings are numbered. Moulded architraves are taken superficially, the
                    length by their girt, or by the run at such a girt. Skirtings are measured
                    superficially at such a thickness, as scribed or tongued, as square or moulded,
                    or rebated for base moulding, as the case may be. Base and surbase, and indeed
                    all other moulding which girds at four inches and above, should be taken
                    superficially; and mouldings which are of less girt may be taken by the run if
                    they be taken independently of the other work, or that to which they belong, at
                    all. A moulding projecting from the face of the work to which it belongs may be
                    assumed as independent of it; whereas a receding one, if it be small, will
                    merely add the character of moulded to the work, and if large will qualify all
                    in immediate connection with it to be taken as a superficial quantity of
                    moulding. All circular work, or work which diverges from a straight line, is
                    noted and charged proportionally to the additional labour and waste of stuff
                    involved; the shorter the radius of the arc, or quicker the sweep, the higher
                    must be the proportioned charge. Things which have been bent to their fleeted
                    form are less costly in proportion than those which must have been worked in the
                    solid or glued up in thicknesses.</p>
                <p>Stairs are measured by the superficial foot, the length of one step being taken
                    by the breadth of a step and riser, increased by once the thickness of the
                    former for a quantity, and this multiplied by the number of steps there may be
                    of the same kind; that is, when the steps are flyers; for in winding steps the
                    treads and risers are taken in separate dimensions, for greater accuracy. The
                    thicknesses of the steps and risers are noted, as well as the mode in which they
                    are worked; they have either rounded or moulded nosings, are housed into the
                    string, or have returned nosings, the riser being mitred to the string or to cut
                    brackets on the ends of the steps. Curtail ends to steps are numbered. I he
                    frame-work or bearers on which the stairs rest is included with the stairs
                    themselves. String-boards are taken according to their thickness and the
                    quantity of work on them; the grooves or housings in them are numbered. The
                    capping on a close string is taken by the run; but when the nosings of the steps
                    are returned, the strings are said to be cut; and if there are any cut and
                    mitred blocks, they are numbered. Stair skirting is taken as raking and scribed,
                    and as straight, circular, ramped, or wreathed, by the foot superficial; wooden
                    balusters are taken by the run, and the mortises or dovetails in which they are
                    set are numbered; newels are taken by the run for the stuff and the fixing, and
                    the turnings on them are numbered. Hand-rails are said to be merely rounded, or
                    moulded; they are measured by the running foot; and a distinction is kept up
                    between the straight, the circular, the ramps, the wreaths, and the scroll; nuts
                    and screws in their joints are numbered.</p>
                <p>All sorts of framing, whether it be fixed or hung—all linings above three inches
                    in width—all sorts of ledged work, such as plain doors and shutters, partitions
                    in lofts and stables, bracketing, cradling, &amp;c.—must be measured
                    superficially. All narrow linings, very narrow skirtings, staff beads, fillets,
                    water trunks and spouts, legs, rails, and runners to dressers, groovings,
                    flutings, reedings, cappings, &amp;c. and any work on superficial quantities
                    that does not pervade the whole, but is in itself peculiar, should be taken
                    lineally, or by the running foot. Insulated parts, such as short, interrupted
                    grooves, blocks, pateras, brackets, trusses, cantilevers, holes, mortises for
                    articles taken lineally, mitres to cornices, heads and feet to flutes and reeds,
                    &amp;c. are numbered and charged at so much a piece. Ironmongery goods employed
                    by the joiner are numbered under their different heads, and charged as fixed;
                    that is, to the price of a lock is added a charge for the labour employed in
                    fitting and fixing it, and whatever accessories it may have required which are
                    not included in its own cost, such as screws, &amp;c. to a rim or dead lock. To
                    the price of hinges, however, only the cost of screws should be added, as the
                    fixing of them is usually included in hanging the work to which they are
                    attached.</p>
                <p>The cost at which joiners’ work can be executed can only be determined by
                    calculation and observation. The cost of the materials employed may be readily
                    determined by dissecting a piece of work and reckoning its contents; but the
                    labour depends on so many contingencies, that very accurate observation indeed
                    is necessary to determine the quantity that may have been required to produce a
                    certain result. In carpenters’ work, the material forms the principal part of
                    the charge; but in joiners’ work the materials are for the most part of far less
                    importance than the labour which has been expended on them. The stuff employed
                    in a sash must be costly indeed to amount to as much as the labour of making the
                    sash; whereas, in most doors, under ordinary circumstances, the materials may
                    cost as much as the labour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sawyer.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The labour of the sawyer
                    is applied to the division of large pieces of timber or logs into forms and
                    sizes to suit the purposes of the carpenter and joiner. His working place is
                    called a saw-pit, and his almost only important tool a pit-saw. A cross-cut saw,
                    axes, dogs, files, compasses, lines, lamp-black, black-lead, chalk, and a rule,
                    are all accessories which may be considered necessary to him.</p>
                <p>Unlike most other artificers, the sawyer can do absolutely nothing alone: sawyers
                    are therefore always in pairs; one of the two stands on the work, and the other
                    in the pit under it. The log or piece of timber being carefully and firmly fixed
                    on the pit, and lined for the cuts which are to be made in it, the top-man
                    standing on it, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742060" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2060-0692"
                    />and the pit-man below or off from its end, a cut is commenced, the former
                    holding the saw with his two hands by the handle above, and the other in the
                    same manner by the box handle below. The attention or the top-man is directed to
                    keeping the saw in the direction of and out of winding with the line to be cut
                    upon, and that of the pit-man to cut down in a truly vertical line. 1he saw
                    being correctly entered, very little more is required than steadiness of hand
                    and eye in keeping it correctly on throughout the whole length. It is the custom
                    to project so much of the log over the first transverse bearer as can be done
                    without rendering it liable to vibrate or be insecure; and when all the cuts
                    proposed are advanced up to that bearer, the end is slightly raised to allow the
                    bearer to be passed out beyond the termination of the advanced cuts. The
                    advantage of, or rather the necessity for, the movable handle at the lower end
                    of the saw is now evident, the top-man removing the saw readily from cut to cut
                    from above, his mate having merely to strike the wedge in the box one way or the
                    other, to fix or loosen it.</p>
                <p>It is absolutely necessary that the top-man should stand in such a manner on the
                    log or piece operated on, that a line down the centre of his body shall fall
                    exactly upon the line of the cut he is to work on, and be as exactly
                    perpendicular to it and to the plane of the horizon. He must, therefore, when
                    the cut is near the outer edge, be provided with a board or plank, one end of
                    which may rest on something firm at a short distance from the log, and the other
                    on or against it, to put the outer foot on, and so keep himself in such a
                    position that he may always, and without constraint, see his saw out of winding,
                    and so that a spectator standing on the fore end of the pit may see the saw an
                    imaginary line passing down the centre of the workman’s body, and the line of
                    the cut in exactly the same vertical plane. The labour of the top-sawyer should
                    consist solely in lifting the saw up by the handle as high as his arms can carry
                    it, and that of the pit-man in drawing it down with a slight pressure or
                    tendency onward, sufficient to make it bite into the timber as much as Ins
                    strength will enable him to make it cut away. The only assistance the pit-man
                    should give in lifting the saw is in holding it back that the teeth may not drag
                    against the cut in the ascent; and all the top-man should do in cutting downward
                    is to keep the teeth steadily and firmly in contact with the part to be eroded.
                    Good workmen may work with a narrower or closer set to their saw than bad ones
                    can, though the wider or more open set saw is more liable to make bad work. It
                    works more slowly and consumes more stuff than the close set; but it is not so
                    likely to hang in the cut with the unnecessary pushing up of the pit-man and
                    jerking down of the other, as if it were set more closely. A good top-man,
                    nevertheless, is of much more importance, though he be badly mated, than the
                    converse. Indeed the best possible pit-man could not work satisfactorily with a
                    bad top-man, and therefore the latter is always considered the superior workman,
                    and on him devolves the care of sharpening and setting the saw, &amp;c. In the
                    operations of the carpenter and joiner much depends on the manner in which the
                    sawyers have performed their part. The best work on the part of the carpenter
                    cannot retrieve the radical defects in his materials from bad sawing; and
                    although the joiner need not allow his work to suffer, bad sawing causes him
                    great loss of stuff and immense additional and otherwise unnecessary labour.
                    Planks or boards, and scantlings, on coming from the sawpit, should be as
                    straight and true in every particular, except mere smoothness of surface, as if
                    they had been tried up on the joiner’s bench; and good workmen actually produce
                    them so. Saw-mills, too, by the truth and beauty with which they operate, show
                    the sawyer what may be effected; for though he can hardly hope to equal their
                    effect, he may seek to approach it.</p>
                <p>Sawyers’ work is valued at so much the hundred superficial feet; the sawing on a
                    board or squared scantling being once its length, by a side and an edge, or half
                    the amount of its four sides. In squared timber, however, it is generally valued
                    at so much per load of fifty cubic feet, four cuts to the load, any cuts
                    exceeding that number being paid for at so much per hundred feet; in this case
                    the length of the cut by its depth gives the superficial quantity of sawing in
                    it. Pieces again of determined and equal length and breadth, such as the deals
                    and planks commonly used for joiners’work in this country, admitting of a
                    regulated scale, the sawing that may be required in them is valued at so much
                    the dozen cuts.</p>

                    The model is made in a finely tempered and plastic clay, or in wax; and the
                    modeller works with his fingers, assisted by a few ivory or bone tools for
                    finishing off neatly and sharply, and for working in parts which he cannot reach
                    with his fingers. He is generally the best workman who can do most towards

                <p>The modeller having some pretensions to be considered an artist rather than a
                    mere artificer, he is for the most part paid according to his merits as such,
                    rather than for so much time, according to the ordinary mode of determining the
                    value of artificers’ works.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carver and Gilder.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The carver is
                    strictly an independent artist, whose business it is to cut ornaments and
                    enrichments in solid and durable material, such as wood and stone, so that, like
                    the modeller, he must be paid according to the taste and power he may exhibit in
                    his works, rather than as a common artificer. Carving has, however, been in a
                    great measure superseded by modelling and casting, so that the carver is hardly
                    known in economic building except in connection with the gilder. Gilding may
                    indeed be applied to castings as well as to carvings; but the former being,
                    almost as a matter of course, less sharp and spirited in their flexures and
                    details, as well as less firm in substance than the latter, castings can less
                    bear to be further subdued by the application of foreign matters to their
                    surfaces than carvings may.</p>
                <p>Gilding is the application of gold leaf to surfaces, which require, however, to
                    be previously prepared for its reception. The work is first primed with a
                    solution of boiled linseed oil and carbonate of lead, and then covered with a
                    fine glutinous composition called gold size, on which, when it is nearly dry,
                    the gold leaf is laid in narrow slips with a fine brush, and pressed down with a
                    piece of cotton wool held in the fingers. As the slips must be made to overlap
                    each other slightly, to insure the complete covering of the whole surface, the
                    loose edges will remain unattached; these are readily struck off with a large
                    sable or camel-hair brush, fitted for the purpose; and the joints, if the work
                    be dexterously executed, will be invisible. This is called oil gilding, and it
                    is by far the best fitted for the enrichment of surfaces in architecture,
                    because it is durable, and is easily cleaned, and does not destroy or derange
                    the forms under it so much as burnished gilding does. This latter requires the
                    work to be covered with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742073"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-2073-0693"/>various laminae of gluten, plaster, and bole,
                    which last is mixed with gold size, to procure the adhesion of the leaf. The
                    most durable mode of gilding metals in common use is by amalgamation.</p>
                <p>The surfaces generally operated on by the gilder are so diverse, that the real
                    value of his work can be determined satisfactorily only by taking his time and
                    the materials employed and consumed in executing a piece of work.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plumber.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Lead, as the name
                    imports, is the material in and with which the plumber operates. The previous
                    preparation, casting and milling of lead into sheets, pipes, &amp;c. and the
                    composition and uses of solder, will be found described under the head <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Plumbery.</hi></p>
                <p>The principal operations of the plumber are directed to the covering of roofs and
                    flats, laying gutters, covering hips, ridges, and valleys, fixing water trunks,
                    making cisterns and reservoirs, and laying on the requisite pipes and cocks to
                    them, fixing water-closet apparatus, setting up pumps, and applying indeed all
                    the hydraulic machinery required in economic building. His tools are knives,
                    chisels, and gouges for cutting and trimming, rasps or files and planes for
                    fitting and jointing, a dressing and flatting tool for the purposes its name
                    expresses, iron hammers and wooden mallets for driving and fixing, ladles in
                    which to melt solder, grozing irons to assist in soldering, a handgrate or stove
                    which may be conveniently moved from place to place, for melting solder and
                    heating the grozing irons, a stock and bits for boring holes, and a rule,
                    compasses, lines and chalk for setting out εmd marking, together with weighing
                    apparatus, as the quantities of most of the materials used by the plumber must
                    be either proved or determined by weight. A plumber is always attended by a
                    labourer, who does the more laborious work of carrying the materials from place
                    to place, helps to move them when they are under operation, melts the solder and
                    heats the grozing irons, attends to hold the one or the other, as neither may be
                    set down or put out of hand when in use, and assists in some of the minor and
                    coarser operations. In boarding roofs, flats, and gutters for lead, clasp-nails
                    or flooring brads should be used; and the first care of the plumber should be to
                    punch them all in from an eighth to a quarter of an inch below the surface, and
                    stop the holes carefully and completely with putty, or a chemical process will
                    ensue on the slightest access of moisture if the iron heads of the nails come in
                    contact with the lead, and the latter will, in the course of no long period, be
                    completely perforated over every one of them. Neither should lead in surfaces of
                    any extent be soldered, or in any manner fastened at the edges, without being
                    turned up so as to make sufficient allowance for the expansion and contraction
                    which it is constantly undergoing during the various changes in the temperature
                    of the atmosphere. It may be taken, indeed, as a general rule,, that solder
                    should be dispensed with as much as possible. Like glue to the joiner, it is
                    indispensable in many cases; but like glue also, it is in common practice made
                    to cover many defects, and much bad work, that ought not to exist.</p>
                <p>Sheet lead, whether cast or milled, is supplied of various weight or thickness;
                    and it is always described as of such a weight in pounds to the superficial
                    foot. This varies from four to ten or twelve, so that the weight to the foot
                    being ascertained, the whole weight of any quantity of the same thickness may be
                    determined by admeasurement. There are very few purposes, indeed, in building,
                    in which lead of less than six pounds to the foot should be used, and very few
                    in which the weight need to exceed ten. For roofs, flats, and gutters, under
                    ordinary circumstances, eight-pounds lead is a very fair and sufficient average;
                    for hips and ridges, lead of six pounds to the foot is thick enough; and for
                    flashings five-pound lead need not be objected to. Cast lead is to be pιeferred
                    for the former purposes, because its surface is harder, and it is somewhat less
                    susceptible of meteoric vicissitudes than milled; but the latter bends better,
                    and, presenting a neater appearance, may be preferred for hips, ridges,
                    flushings, &amp;c. As the sheets are generally made of limited length and
                    breadth, the cast being about sixteen or eighteen feet, and the milled from the
                    latter dimension to twenty-five feet in length, and the one and the other seldom
                    exceeding six feet wide, to avoid soldering, the lateral joints are made on
                    rolls, and longitudinally in falls or drips. A roll is a piece of wood made
                    about two inches thick and two or three inches wide, rounded on one edge, and
                    fixed with that edge uppermost, so as to come a few inches within the width of a
                    sheet of lead, that the edges may be turned up and folded round and over it,
                    being lapped by, or lapping the similar edge of the adjoining sheet, (Fig. 37.)
                    Lead sufficiently stout, dressed neatly and closely down to the boards under it,
                    and over the rolls at its edges, will require no fastening of any kind, unless
                    it lie on a very inclined plane, and have no stop below. Rolls occur for the
                    most part in roofs and flats, and drips principally in gutters. The drip is
                    formed in the first instance by the carpenter in laying the gutter boards
                    according to an arrangement with the plumber. It is a difference made in the
                    height of the gutter of about three inches, where one sheet terminates in
                    length, and meets another in continuation. The end of the lower is turned up
                    against the drip, and that of the upper is dressed down over it, so as
                    effectually to prevent water from driving under it. Gutters should have a
                    current of at least a quarter of an inch to the foot, and in flats it should not
                    be much less; ends and sides which are against a wall should turn up against it
                    from five to seven inches, according to the circumstances; and the turning up
                    under the slates, tiles, or other roof covering, to a gutter, should be to the
                    level of that against the wall at the least. The turning up against the wall
                    should be covered by a flashing. This is a piece of lead let into one of the
                    joints of the wall above the edge of the gutter lead, and dressed neatly down
                    over, to prevent water from getting in behind it. (Fig· 36.) Lead on ridges and
                    hips not being in sufficient masses to be secured by its own weight, must be
                    secured by nails.</p>
                <p>In making cisterns and reservoirs, unless they be cast, the sheets of lead must
                    of necessity be joined by soldering; but the water they are intended to contain
                    protects the lead from the frequent and sudden changes it is in the other more
                    exposed situations subjected to.</p>
                <p>Water trunks and pipes are made of a certain number of pounds weight to the yard
                    in length, to every variety of bore or calibre that can be required. Water
                    trunks or pipes are fitted with large case heads above, to receive the water
                    from the gutter spouts, and with shoes to deliver the water below; they are
                    fixed or attached to the walls of buildings with flanches of lead, which are
                    secured by means of spike nails. Service and waste pipes to cisterns, &amp;c.
                    are generally supported and attached by means of iron holdfasts.</p>
                <p>Plumbers’ work is for the most part estimated by the hundredweight of a hundred
                    and twelve pounds, though there are of course many things which must be taken in
                    detail, by the pound weight, by number, and even by size. It has been already
                    shown in what manner the quantity of lead consumed may be determined, whether it
                    be in sheets or in pipes; the weight per superficial foot of the one, and per
                    lineal foot or yard of the other, being known, and it is always ascertainable,
                    the dimensions of the various parts or portions of the work readily give the
                    total amount in hundredweights or tons. The waste of lead <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193742086" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2086-0694"/>in working is very trifling,
                    as cuttings all go to the melting pot again with little or no loss but that of
                    refounding or casting; and even old lead is taken by the lead merchant in
                    exchange for new, at a very trifling allowance for tare and the cost of
                    rc-working. Water closet apparatus, pumps, cocks, bosses, ferules, washers,
                    valves, balls, grates, traps, funnels, &amp;c. can all readily be counted and
                    noted according to their sizes and peculiarities; and so may the various
                    requisite joints in pipes, and attachments of cocks, &amp;c. to the pipes, which
                    must also be taken in addition to the articles themselves. The prices of all
                    these goods, from the sheets of lead and the pipes, to the smallest articles
                    used by the plumber, may be ascertained from the wholesale merchants and
                    manufacturers; an addition of thirty per cent, to these prime costs will, under
                    ordinary circumstances, afford the builder or tradesman an ample profit, and
                    payment, with sufficient profit on them also, for labour, solder, and nails,
                    excepting cost of carriage, and any other contingent expense, which must be
                    added to the gross. The materials may, however, be taken with a recognized
                    profit added to the prime costs and the actual labour expended; and solder and
                    nails worked up maybe reckoned from observation, or account kept of the
                    workmen’s time, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>These things are mentioned more particularly, because a nefarious custom has
                    obtained in this country, and is still allowed to a very great extent, by which
                    the plumber is permitted to take not only an extortionate profit on his goods,
                    but actually to charge twice for labour and the accessories. There is nothing
                    more common than to find in a plumber’s account a charge for lead (meaning
                    sheet-lead) <hi rend="italic">and labour,</hi> at so much per
                    hundredweight,—charges for pipe of a certain bore or diameter at so much per
                    foot,—for so many joints in pipe of such a size,—that is, for the labour and
                    solder consumed and expended in making them,—and so on through all sorts of
                    things, the account winding up at length, or being interspersed from time to
                    time, with so many pounds or hundredweights of solder, and so many days’ work of
                    plumber and labourer I The now prevalent custom of artificers’ work being done
                    by general builders by tender and contract, has considerably lessened the injury
                    to the public from this abuse, and proved it to be really so by the moderate
                    profits the same men will content themselves with if they make a tender, who
                    would persist in charging at the old rate if they were instructed to do the work
                    without being bound by a contract. Such too is the effect of custom on the
                    courts of justice in England, that the abuse referred to has been protected by
                    them, and probably would be so still, because it was the custom and had been
                    allowed!</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Smith and Founder.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The goods
                    supplied by the smith are charged by the pound according to the quantity of
                    labour on them, and the founder has generally an average charge for iron
                    castings at so much per hundredweight or per ton. The working up or fitting and
                    fixing of iron-work devolves for the most part on the carpenter in whose favour
                    it is taken, generally however, in combination with some of his own peculiar
                    works.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Glazier.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The business of the
                    glazier may be confined to the mere fitting and setting of glass; even the
                    cutting of the plates up into squares being generally an independent art,
                    requiring a degree of tact and judgment not necessarily possessed by the
                    building artificer. (See the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Glass,</hi>
                    Manufacture of, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Glass-Cutting.)</hi> The glazier is
                    supplied with a diamond cutting tool, laths or straight-edges of various
                    lengths, a square, a glazing-knife, a hacking-knife, hammer, duster, sash-tool,
                    and rule; and his materials are simply glass, putty, and priming or paint.</p>
                <p>The glass is supplied by the glass-cutter in squares or panes, of the sizes and
                    qualities required for the particular work to be executed. The putty is made by
                    the glazier himself or by a labourer, of fine clean powdered chalk or whitening,
                    and linseed oil, well mixed and combined, and kneaded to the consistence of
                    dough. No more putty should be made at once than is likely to be worked up in
                    the course of a day, as, the oil drying out, it becomes hard and partially set,
                    and is therefore less available for its purposes. Priming is a thin solution of
                    white, with a little red, lead in linseed oil. When the sashes come to the
                    glazier from the joiner, they have been fitted into their places, and only
                    require to be glazed before they may be permanently set or hung. Supposing that
                    no preliminary process is required, such as stopping (the result of bad joiner’s
                    work) and knotting (and knotty stuff should not be admitted in sashes), the
                    sashes require to be primed. The priming is laid on every part of the sash
                    except the outer edges of the styles and of the bottom and top rails, with the
                    sash tool or painting brush, that is, if the sashes are intended to be painted;
                    for if not, the rebates only must be primed. The object of this is to prepare
                    the material of which the sash is composed for the reception of the putty, which
                    would not otherwise attach itself so readily as it does after this preparation.
                    The priming being sufficiently dry, the workman cuts the panes of glass down
                    into their places, making every one fall readily into the rebates without
                    binding in any part; indeed the glass should fit so nicely as not to touch the
                    wood with its edges any where, and yet hardly allow a fine point to pass between
                    it and the sash-bar or rebate, the object being to encase it completely in
                    putty, and yet that the putty should not be in greater quantity than is
                    absolutely necessary. The glass being fitted or cut down, the workman takes the
                    glazing-knife in his right hand, and a lump of putty in the palm of his left,
                    the sash being laid on its face, that is, with the rebates upward, before him;
                    with the knife he lays a complete bedding of putty on the returning narrow stops
                    of the rebates, all round to every pane. This being done, the panes of glass are
                    put in on it as they have been fitted, and every one is carefully rubbed down
                    with the fingers, forcing the putty out below and around the edges of the glass,
                    until they are nearly brought into contact with the wood or other material of
                    the sash. The rebates are then filled in with putty behind, the mass forming
                    exactly a right-angled triangle, its base being the extent of the stop of the
                    rebate, and its perpendicular the depth from the glass to the outer edge of the
                    rebate; the third side or hypothenuse is neatly smoothed off, and the sash being
                    then turned on its edge and held uprightly by the left hand, the protruded putty
                    of the bedding is struck off with the knife, and the section of it neatly drawn.
                    The sashes are now deposited on their faces, to allow the putty to set, and then
                    they may be hung and painted. To very large squares, and to plate-glass, small
                    tacks or spuds are used; but it is much better to do without them if prudence
                    will permit it.</p>
                <p>Lead-work, as it is termed, is the glazing of frames rather than of sashes with
                    small squares or quarries of glass, which are held together by reticulations of
                    lead; and these are secured to stout metal bars, which are fixed to the window
                    frames. The leaden reticulating bars are grooved on their edges to receive the
                    quarries, and are tied by means of leaden ribands or wires to the saddle bars,
                    which, in their turn, are affixed to the stouter bars before mentioned, if the
                    bay or frame be so large as to require both.</p>
                <p>Glazing is valued by the superficial foot, the squares or panes being measured
                    between the rebates in which they are set. The value of plate-glass is very much
                    affected by the sizes of the panes, every additional inch in extent of surface
                    adding materially to the cost of production o the whole piece or plate; it must
                    therefore be carefully <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742099"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-2099-0695"/>noted according to its magnitude. Common window
                    glass is divided into best, seconds, and thirds, and is charged higher as the
                    panes increase in size, because for large panes the table cuts to waste more
                    than in cutting small ones. In ordinary practice, panes containing two
                    superficial feet and under are classed together; then from two feet to two feet
                    six inches, and so on; and according to the quality of the article. Flatting,
                    bending, grinding, staining, &amp;c. are all subjects of separate and
                    independent charge.</p>
                <p>Lead lights are taken by the superficies generally of a hundred feet, lead and
                    glass being included in the same charge, which, however, depends on the size of
                    the quarries. Stay and saddle bars are taken separately, according to their
                    number and magnitude.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Painter.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The processes of
                    economical painting will be found described in an article under the head <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Painting.</hi> The real object of painting is to protect wood,
                    metals, and stuccoes from being readily acted upon by the atmosphere, by
                    covering their surfaces with a material which is capable of resisting it. A
                    continued succession of moisture and dryness, and of heat and cold, soon effects
                    the decomposition of woods, causes oxidation in most of the metals used for
                    economical purposes, and destroys the generality of stuccoes if their surfaces
                    be exposed nakedly to it. A solution of ceruse or white lead in linseed oil
                    spread over them prevents these injuries in a great measure, and for a
                    considerable period of time; and as the application of such an unction can be
                    repeated without much trouble or expense as often as occasion may require, it
                    may be said to furnish a protection against the cited contingencies. In addition
                    to the utility of painting, it is also available as an ornament, by bringing
                    disagreeably or diversely coloured surfaces to a pleasing and uniform tint, or
                    by diversifying a disagreeable monotony of tint, to suit the taste and fancy;
                    and this is done in a great measure by the addition of various pigments to the
                    solution before mentioned.</p>
                <p>The painter works with hog’s bristle brushes of various sizes, which, with the
                    exception of pots to hold his colours, a grinding stone and grinder or muller
                    for grinding or triturating them, a pallet and a pallet knife, are almost his
                    only implements. His materials are comparatively few also; but for some purposes
                    these require a great variety of ingredients, the preparation and combination of
                    which, however, devolves principally on the manufacturer or colourman, and not
                    on the painter himself.</p>
                <p>The first thing the workman has to attend to in painting wood-work, is to prepare
                    its surface for the reception of paint, by counteracting the effect of any thing
                    that may tend to prevent it from becoming identified with the material. Thus, in
                    painting pine woods of any kind, the resin contained in the knots which appear
                    on the surface must be neutralized, or a blemish will appear in the finished
                    work over every resinous part. Inequalities or unevennesses of surface, too,
                    must be reduced with sand-paper or pumice-stone, or made up with putty. The
                    necessary process for killing knots, just referred to, will generally leave a
                    film, which must be rubbed down; and the heads of nails and brads having been
                    punched in, will present indentations, which should be stopped. In painting or
                    laying on the colour, the brush must be constantly at right angles to the face
                    of the work, only the ends of the hairs, in fact, touching it, for in this
                    manner the paint is at the same time forced into the pores of the wood and
                    distributed equally over the surface; for if the brush be held obliquely to the
                    work, it will leave the paint in thick masses wherever it is first applied after
                    being dipped for a fresh supply into the pot, and the surface will be daubed but
                    not painted. Painting, when properly executed, will not present a shining,
                    smooth, and glossy appearance, as if it formed a film or skin, but will show a
                    fine and regular grain, as if the surface were natural, or had received a mere
                    stain without destroying the original texture. Imitative grainings, however, and
                    the varnishes which are intended to protect them, and make them bear out,
                    necessarily produce a new and artificial texture; and for this reason they are
                    all to a greater or less extent disagreeable, how well soever the imitations may
                    be effected.</p>
                <p>As it must be presumed that all the wood submitted to the operations of the
                    painter, which has passed through the hands of the joiner, was already well
                    seasoned and properly dry, it is only necessary to say generally, that work
                    should be free from moisture of any and every kind before paint is applied to
                    it, or it will at the least prove useless, and probably injurious rather than
                    beneficial. This remark applies alike to wood and to plastered work, both
                    internal and external; that is, whether they be subjected to the more violent
                    changes of the weather or not. Dampness or moisture in woods, and stopped in or
                    covered up with paint, will, under ordinary circumstances, tend to their
                    destruction; and in stuccoes it will spoil the paint, and most probably injure
                    the plastering itself too.</p>
                <p>Painters’ work, on extended surfaces, is valued by the yard superficial,
                    according to the number of coats, or the number of times the paint has been
                    applied to the surface, and to the manner in which, and matter with which, it is
                    finished. On skirtings, surbases, narrow cornices, reveals, single mouldings,
                    sills, string courses, &amp;c. it is measured by the foot run; sash-frames and
                    the squares or panes of sashes are numbered, the latter by the dozen; and so are
                    other things which do not readily admit of being measured. Rich cornices,
                    expensive imitations, &amp;c. are taken by the foot superficial; and
                    preparations before the work can be commenced are most fairly charged for by the
                    time they occupy and the materials they consume. The work is taken as one, two,
                    three, four, or more times in oil, common colour; or so many times finished of a
                    certain colour that is more expensive than what is called common; or as so many
                    times, and flatted of such a colour, the flatting being an extra coat; or as
                    painted so many times, and grained and varnished. Common colours are those which
                    are produced by the addition of lamp-black, red-lead, or any of the common
                    ochres to white-lead and oil; blues, greens, rich reds, pinks, and yellows,
                    &amp;c. being more costly, are taken as such. Unflatted white is a common
                    colour; flatted, it classes with the rich colours. If the same surface be
                    painted of two different tints, it is said to be in party colours, and an
                    allowance is made in the price for the additional trouble of finishing in that
                    manner. Carved mouldings and other enrichments having to be picked in with a
                    pencil or small brush, that the quirks, &amp;c. be not choked up, must be taken
                    extra, by the run or by number; and if the picking in be in party colours, the
                    labour is necessarily greater than if the work be plain.</p>
                <p>What is termed decorating, is divided between the painter and the paper-hanger.
                    Decorations must necessarily depend upon the taste and skill required or
                    employed in producing them; and the remuneration must also of course be
                    contingent. Decorative papers are paid for by the piece or yard, á piece being
                    made in this country twelve yards long and twenty inches wide, and the hanging
                    is charged at so much the piece. Borders are charged by the yard for the
                    material, and by the dozen for hanging. Sizing and otherwise preparing the walls
                    are considered extra to the charges for hanging. (π. <hi rend="smallcaps"
