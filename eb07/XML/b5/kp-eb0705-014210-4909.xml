                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    of,</hi> a peer and marshal of France, and a general of distinguished
                    reputation, was the son of Francis count of Bouflers∙ He was born on the 10th
                    January 1644, and having early entered into the army, was raised in 1669 to the
                    rank of colonel of dragoons. In the conquest of Lorraine he served under Marshal
                    Crequi. In the war against Holland he served under Turenne, frequently
                    distinguishing himself by his skill and bravery; and when that celebrated
                    captain was killed by a cannon-shot in 1675, he commanded the rear-guard during
                    the retreat of the French army. After performing various military services in
                    Germany, in Flanders, and on the frontiers of Spain, he gradually rose in rank
                    as well as in reputation. In 1690 he was created general of the army of the
                    Moselle, and contributed materially to the victory of Fleurus. In the following
                    year he acted as lieutenant-general under the king in person; and whilst
                    investing Mons, he was wounded in an attack on that place. He conducted the
                    bombardment of Liege, although it was defended by an enemy superior in numbers,
                    and afterwards forced the allied generals to abandon Luxembourg. He was
                    intrusted with the command against King William at the siege of Namur; and for
                    this and other important services he was raised, in 1693, to the rank of marshal
                    of France. In 1694 he was appointed governor of French Flanders, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193734922" xml:id="kp-eb0705-4922-0143"/>and of the town of Lisle. By
                    a skilful manoeuvre he threw himself into Namur in 1695, and held out with
                    unexampled obstinacy against the army of the allies under King William,
                    sustaining four assaults, and only surrendering the place after four months of
                    open trenches and the loss of 20,000 men to the besiegers. Having agreed to a
                    capitulation, he was arrested as prisoner of war, because the French had not
                    performed the stipulated terms on which the garrison had surrendered; and when
                    he represented that the garrison should have been retained rather than himself,
                    he was answered that he was estimated as worth more than 10,000 men. In the
                    conferences which were held with the Earl of Portland, and terminated in the
                    peace of Ryswick, he had a principal share. During the following war, when Lisle
                    was again threatened with a siege by the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene,
                    Bouflers was appointed to the command, and made an obstinate resistance of four
                    months. His magnanimity was not less remarkable than his military conduct; for
                    when a partizan represented to him that it would not be difficult to kill Prince
                    Eugene, he was told by the marshal, that he might expect a great reward for
                    taking him prisoner, but the severest punishment if any thing were attempted
                    against his life. He was rewarded and honoured by the king for his defence of
                    Lisle, as if he had been victorious. It was indeed a species of triumph. His
                    generous enemy, appreciating his merits, allowed him to dictate his own terms of
                    capitulation: “je signerai,” said Prince Eugene, “tout ce que vous voudrez and
                    he was as good as his word, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ∙' Après quatre mois
                    de tranchée ouverte,” adds the prince in bis <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi>
                    “Bouflers m’envoya, le 8 décembre 1708, tous les articles qu’il voulait que je
                    signasse; ce que je fis sans restriction.” When the affairs of France were
                    threatened with the most urgent danger, Bouflers, though a senior officer to
                    Villars, made an offer to serve under that general, and was with him at the
                    battle of Malplaquet. Here he again displayed his military skill by conducting
                    the retreat, so that he lost neither cannon nor prisoners. He died at
                    Fontainbleau in the year 1711, at the age of sixty-eight, and left the character
                    of a true patriot, as well as of a great commander. Madame de Maintenon said of
                    him, that “his heart was the last part that died.”</p>
