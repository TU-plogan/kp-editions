                <p><label type="entry">BOURDALOUE</label>, Louis, a celebrated preacher among the
                    Jesuits, and onc of the greatest orators that France has ever produced, was born
                    at Bourges on the 20th of August 1632. At the age of sixteen he entered the
                    Society of Jesus, of which he was destined to become one of the greatest
                    ornaments, and there completed his studies. His able masters, who early
                    distinguished his talents, successively confided to him the chairs of humanity,
                    of rhetoric, of philosophy, and of moral theology; and it was only after passing
                    through these different probationary employments that he arrived at the eminent
                    post which was designed for him, and was deemed qualified for mounting the
                    pulpit.</p>
                <p>In order to form an idea of the difficulties which he had to surmount, and of the
                    talents which he displayed, it is only necessary, on the one hand, to call to
                    mind the ridiculous manner gnd inflated style of the preachers of that period;
                    and, on the other, to figure the young Jesuit at issue with the bad taste as
                    well as the bad habits of the time; combating at once the passions, the vices,
                    the weaknesses, and the errors of humanity, and overcoming his enemies,
                    sometimes with the arms of faith, and sometimes with those of reason.</p>
                <p>At first he preached for some time in the province,but his superiors afterwards
                    called him to Paris. This took place in 1669, at the most brilliant epoch of the
                    age of Louis XIV., when nothing was talked of but the victories of Turenne, the
                    festivities of Versailles, the master-pieces of Corneille and Racine, the
                    encouragement afforded to the arts, and the general impulse given to the human
                    mind. Bourdaloue suddenly appeared in the midst of these fascinations, and, far
                    from diminishing their effects, the severity of his ministry, and the gravity of
                    his eloquence, served rather to enhance their splendour. His first sermons met
                    with prodigious success, and all voices were raised in loud applause of the
                    preacher. Madame de Sévigné, sharing the universal enthusiasm, wrote to her
                    daughter that “she had never heard anything more beautiful, more noble, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193735039?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5039-0152"/>
                    more astonishing, than the sermons of Father Bourdaloue.” Louis XIV. also wished
                    to hear him, and the new preacher was in consequence sent to court, where he
                    preached the Advent in 1670, and the Lent in 1672; and he was afterwards called
                    for the Lents of 1674, 1675, 1680, and 1682, and for the Advents of 1684, 1689,
                    and 1693. This was a thing unheard of before, the same preacher being rarely
                    called three times to court. Bourdaloue, however, appeared there ten times, and
                    was always received with the same ardour. Louis XIV. said that “he loved better
                    to hear the repetitions of Bourdaloue than the novelties of any one else.” After
                    the revocation of the edict of Nantes, he was sent to Languedoc to preach to the
                    Protestants, and confirm the newly-converted in the Catholic faith; and in this
                    delicate mission he managed to reconcile the interests of his ministry with the
                    sacred rights of humanity. He preached at Montpellier in 1686, with prodigious
                    success; Catholics and Protestants being all equally eager to recognise in this
                    eloquent missionary the apostle of truth and of virtue.</p>
                <p>In the last years of his life Bourdaloue abandoned the pulpit, and devoted
                    himself to charitable assemblies, hospitals, and prisons, where his pathetic
                    discourses and insinuating manners never failed of their effect. He had the art
                    of adapting his style and his reasonings to the condition and the understanding
                    of those to whom he addressed either counsel or consolation. Simple with the
                    simple, erudite with the learned, and a dialetician with sophists and
                    disputants, he came off with honour in all the contests in which zeal for
                    religion, the duties of his station, and love of mankind, led him to engage.
                    Equally relished by the great and by the commonalty, by men of piety and by
                    people of the world, he exercised till his death a sort of empire over all
                    minds; and this ascendancy he owed as much to the gentleness of his manners as
                    to the force of his reasonings. “His conduct,” says one of his contemporaries,
                    “is the best answer that can be made to the <hi rend="italic">Lettres
                    Provinciales."</hi> No consideration was ever capable of altering his frankness
                    or corrupting his probity.</p>
                <p>Boileau, who detested the Jesuits, ioved and often visited Bourdaloue. He may
                    with justice be regarded as the reformer of the pulpit and the founder of
                    Christian eloquence among the French. That which distinguishes him from other
                    preachers is the force of his reasoning, and the solidity of his proofs. Never
                    did Christian orator infuse into his discourses more majesty, dignity, energy,
                    and grandeur. Like Corneille, he has been charged with overlabouring his
                    diction, and accumulating idea upon idea with a needless superfluity of
                    illustration,—of speaking more to the understandings than to the hearts of his
                    auditors, and sometimes enervating his eloquence with too frequent a use of
                    divisions and subdivisions. But even in subscribing to these criticisms, which
                    are to a certain extent well founded, it is impossible not to admire the
                    inexhaustible fecundity of his plans,—the happy talent, <hi rend="italic">νelut
                    imperatoria virtus,</hi> which he possessed, of disposing his reasonings in the
                    order best calculated to command victory,—the exact, constrictive logic with
                    which he excludes sophisms, contradictions, and paradoxes,— the art with which
                    he lays the foundations of our duty in our interest,—and, finally, the
                    inestimable secret of converting the details of manners and habits into so many
                    proofs of his subject. Parallels have often been drawn between Bourdaloue and
                    Massillon; but the talents of these great pulpit orators lay in different
                    directions, and they may therefore be more fitly contrasted than compared. If
                    Massillon is now read with a more lively interest, he owes this advantage to the
                    charms of his style rather than to the force of his reasonings. Among the
                    critics of the present day, the preference is unhesitatingly given to the rival
                    of Racine, to the painter of the heart, to the author of the discourse on the
                    small number of the elect; but if we consult the contemporaries of Massillon
                    himself, we shall find that they assign him only the second rank. According to
                    them, Bourdaloue preached to the men of a vigorous and masculine age; Massillon
                    to those of a period remarkable for its effeminacy. Bourdaloue raised himself to
                    the level of the great truths of religion; Massillon conformed himself to the
                    weakness of the men with whom he lived. The bishop of Clermont will always be
                    read; but if the simple Jesuit could raise his commanding voice from the tomb,
                    and again roll forth a majestic stream of divine truth, the courtly accents of
                    his rival would no longer be heard, and the charms of his diction would be
                    forgotten. The first part of his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Passion,</hi> in
                    which he proves that the death of the Son of God is the triumph of his power,
                    has generally been considered as the great masterpiece of Christian eloquence.
                    Bossuet has said nothing stronger or more elevated. The second part, however, is
                    inferior to the first, though, considered by itself, alike beautiful and
                    convincing.</p>
                <p>The discourses of Bourdaloue have been described by a celebrated French critic as
                    embodying in them a complete course of theology. This is perhaps going a little
                    too far; but still their general merit is very great, and for nothing are they
                    more distinguished than their comprehensiveness. As to the diction of this great
                    preacher, it is always natural, clear, and correct; sometimes deficient in
                    animation, but without vacuity or languor, and generally relieved by
                    outbreakings of much force and originality. With regard to his proofs, again,
                    nothing can be more irresistible, when he confines himself to the exposition of
                    the great doctrines and precepts of Christianity. He generally promises to
                    demonstrate, but he does so because he is conscious of his strength; and he
                    never fails to keep his word, “Au total,” says the critic above referred to, “je
                    croirais que Massillon vaut mieux pour les gens du monde, et Bourdaloue pour les
                    prédicateurs; l’un attirera le monde à la religion, par tout ce qu’elle a de
                    douceur et de charmes; l’autre éclairera et affermira le Chrétien dans sa foi,
                    par tout ce qu’elle a de plus haut en conception et de plus fort en appuis.” Two
                    editions of Bourdaloue’s works were published at Paris in 1707 and the years
                    immediately following, by Père Bretonneau, a Jesuit; one in 14 volumes 8vo, and
                    the other, from which the editions of Rouen, Toulouse, and Amsterdam, were
                    afterwards printed, in 15 volumes 12mo. The works are distributed as follows,
                    viz. 1. <hi rend="italic">Deux Avents, prêche devant le Roi,</hi> 1 vol.; 2. <hi
