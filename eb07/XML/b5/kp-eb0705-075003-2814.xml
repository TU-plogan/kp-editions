                <p><label type="entry">BUTESHIRE</label>, a county on the west coast of Scotland, in
                    the Frith of Clyde, is composed of seven islands, viz. Bute, Arran, Great
                    Cumbrae, Little Cumbrae, Inchmar-nock, Lamlash, and Pladda.</p>
                <p>Bute, from which the county derives its name, is situated between longitude 4.
                    51. and 5. 2. W., and latitude 55. 4L and 55. 43. N., and is sixteen miles west
                    from Greenock, thirty-eight miles from Glasgow, and eighty-three from Edinburgh;
                    but the usual route to these places is about four or five miles longer. It is
                    about fifteen miles long, in a straight line from north-north-west to
                    southsouth-east, and the average breadth is three miles and a half, although it
                    is much indented with bays: in some places it is not above half that breadth,
                    but in other places it is at least a mile broader. It is separated on the north
                    from the district of Cowal in Argyleshire by the Kyles of Bute, which for a
                    considerable distance along shore is not above half a mile broad. The more
                    southerly part of the island is separated from Ayrshire by the Frith of Clyde,
                    which is from five to seven miles broad; but the channel is much narrowed by the
                    islands of Cumbraes, being situated betwixt Bute and Ayrshire, and distant from
                    Bute about three miles, but much nearer Ayrshire. Arran lies off the south point
                    of Bute, distant about eight miles; and Skipness in Argyleshire bounds it on the
                    west at about the same distance as Arran. There is considerable uncertainty as
                    to the origin of the name of Bute. Some contend that it is derived from Both,
                    signifying in the Irish tongue a cell; and they ground this on the fact, that is
                    has been so written by ancient authors, and that St Brendan, an Irish abbot,
                    caused a cell to be erected on it in the sixth century. It has been written
                    Both, Bote, Boot, and Botis; but Mr Blain, some time commissary of the isles,
                    and sheriff-substitute of Buteshire, in his manuscript history of Bute,
                    endeavours to show, with considerable ingenuity, that it has been derived from
                    the old British word Ey Budh, or Gaelic word Ey Bhiod, signifying the Island of
                    Corn or Island of Food, from its being more fertile than the adjacent highland
                    countries; and this opinion appears to be still fuιther supported by the fact,
                    that at the time of valuing the teinds, the grain in the island amounted to
                    about</p>
                <p>34,700 bolls. The Butemen were anciently considered as. a distinct people, and
                    refused to be reckoned a part of the highlands, or even of the lowlands. The
                    island contains about 30,000 English acres, of which about two thirds may be
                    considered as arable; the remainder consists of woods, muirs, mosses, and lakes.
                    There are six lakes in the island. The largest, Loch Fad, extended originally to
                    138 acres, but is now considerably enlarged by the embankments of the cotton
                    spinning company, whose works are placed on the water flowing from this lake.
                    Ascog Loch extends to seventy-two acres. The water flowing from this loch has
                    also an excellent fall for a mill or other public work; but nothing further has
                    yet been erected on it than a dye-work, and a carding and wauking mill. It is
                    hoped, however, that it will soon be made more available. Quien Loch covers
                    fifty-four acres; Greenan Loch, twelve acres; Loch Dhu, or Black Loch, nine
                    acres; and Lochan-tarbh, five acres. The climate is very mild, genial, and
                    healthy, more so than in any other part of the west of Scotland. It is
                    frequently compared to Devonshire, and in some respects is considered as
                    superior. The lofty mountains of Arran and Argyle skirt it on the west and
                    south, and break the clouds coming from the Western Ocean, so that they pass
                    over Bute with a discharge of comparatively but little of their contents, and
                    less rain falls here than on the rest of the west coast of Scotland. In summer
                    the air is kept cool by the sea breeze, and in winter the same cause prevents
                    intense frost; while snow seldom falls to the depth of twelve inches, and very
                    rarely remains above two or three days on the ground. The winds most prevalent
                    blow from the sputh and west.</p>
                <p>Agriculture, under the fostering care of the Marquis of Bute, has of late years
                    made considerable progress in the island, especially in the middle and southern
                    divisions. The soil in the southern half of the island is light and sandy; in
                    the more northern it is of a clayey nature. The land is generally well
                    subdivided with ditches and white-thorn hedges. Crops of all kinds common in the
                    lowlands are produced in Bute.</p>
                <p>Freestone and coal are both found in the island, but neither to any great extent.
                    Several attempts have been made to get a good working vein of coals, but
                    hitherto without success. But slate and lime are found in it. The slate has been
                    princ pally wrought on the estate of Kames, formerly the seat of Sir William M
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> Leod Bannatyne, one of the lords of session, but
                    now possessed by James Hamilton, Esq. The lime has been chiefly wrought in the
                    south end of the island, in the parish of Kingarth; and that manufactured there
                    is considered as equal, if not superior, in point of adhesiveness, to the
                    far-famed Arden lime of Lanarkshire, when properly wrought; and it is much
                    cheaper, though not so white in the colour. Inexhaustible beds of shells are
                    found on the west side of the island, and considerable quantities of sea-weed
                    are driven in upon the shores. The rocks in the north end are chiefly mica,
                    clay, and chlorite slate, intersected with quartz and trap. Whinstone is chiefly
                    found near the town of Rothesay, and sandstone stretches along from thence to
                    the south. .</p>
                <p>Excellent banks for fishing are found round the island; and the herring fishery
                    is prosecuted vigorously by the inhabitants, especially by residents in
                    Rothesay.</p>
                <p>The Marquis of Bute is the chief proprietor of the island. His seat is
                    Mountstuart, beautifully situated on the east side of the island, about four
                    miles from Rothesay. The real rent of his property in the island is about
                    L.8000, including L.440 of ŕeu-cluty for ground feued chiefly within the burgh
                    of Rothesay. The other proprietors of any extent are James Hamilton, Esq. of
                    Kames, rent L.1500; Kirkman Findlay, Esq. of Kilmahalmaig, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193742827" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2827-0751"/>L.500; Robert Thom, Esq. of
                    Ascog, L.300; M‘Conechy of Ambrisbeg, L.70; James M‘Kay of Garrachty, L.70.</p>
                <p>The burgh of Rothesay, the capital of the island and shire, is beautifully
                    situated at the head of a deep bay on the north-east side of the island, where
                    there is safe anchorage-ground for vessels of any size and any wind, and room
                    enough to contain a very large fleet. The territory of the burgh is about nine
                    miles in circumference, extending fülly a mile beyond the town on the east,
                    south, and west sides. The burgh has an extensive harbour, built in 1822, at an
                    expense of L.6000. The shipping belonging to this port carries upwards of 4000
                    tons. There is a large spinning factory, consisting of two mills, in Rothesay,
                    driven by water from Loch Fad; and it may be worthy of notice, that the second
                    mill erected in Scotland for the spinning of cotton was upon this water only
                    about fifty-five years ago, when the business was carried on with the strictest
                    secrecy. The house then used was a thatched building, which is still standing. A
                    power-loom factory, wrought by a steam-engine, has lately been erected. But the
                    herring fishery has proved the chief source of employment to the male
                    population. In 1830 there were about 400 men and 3000 tons of shipping employed
                    in this trade, besides a great number of small wherries occupied in fishing
                    about the island and neighbourhood. Several steam-boats ply daily to and from
                    Glasgow and the intermediate ports. These convey the ŵail; and in the summer
                    season there are generally two, and sometimes three mails in the day.</p>
                <p>There are four places of worship in Rothesay; the parish church, situated on a
                    gentle eminence about a quarter of a mile from the town; a chapel of ease,
                    erected in 1800; a united secession church; and a reformed Presbyterian church.
                    The county jail is situated in Rothesay, where the head courts of the shire are
                    held. The sheriff court is held every Wednesday, and the burgh court every
                    Thursday. The ruins of an ancient castle, which was once the residence of the
                    kings of Scotland, are situated in the middle of the town. It originally
                    consisted of a circular court, 138 feet in diameter, surrounded by a wall eight
                    feet thick and seventeen feet high, with battlements. It had four towers, and
                    was surrounded by a wet ditch. It is supposed to have been built about the year
                    1100, though the particular date is not known. It is first mentioned in history
                    in 1228. ∏eulbec, king of the Isles, was killed in besieging this castle in
                    1263. It was taken possession of by the English during the reign of lohn Baliol,
                    but surrendered to Robert the Bruce in 1311. King Robert the Second built a
                    palace adjoining the castle, and frequently took up his residence in it betwixt
                    1376 and 1398, when he created his eldest son Prince David Duke of Rothesay, a
                    title which the king’s eldest son still bears. This was the first dukedom
                    conferred in Scotland. On the 12th January 1400 Robert granted the charter of
                    erection of the burgh of Rothesay. He died in the castlc of Rothesay on 4th
                    April 1406, and was buried in the abbey of Paisley. This castle was burned by
                    the Earl of Argyll’s brother in 1685, and has since remained in ruins. The
                    population of the burgh of Rothesay in 1831 was 4817, besides upwards of 300
                    seamen belonging to registered vessels, not included in the census.</p>
                <p>The island is divided into two parishes, Rothesay and Kingarth; the former
                    containing a population of 6084, including the burgh; and the latter 746; thus
                    making the whole population of the island 6830, exclusive of seamen, of whom
                    there are betwixt 300 and 400 belonging to or connected with registered vessels.
                    This island is highly esteemed, and is much resorted to as sea-bathing quarters
                    in the summer season; and many invalids are induced, by the mildness of the
                    climate, to reside there during winter.</p>
                <p>There are several remains of druidical monuments on the island, but the chief or
                    most entire is at Langalchorid, in the parish of Kingarth. At Dunagoil, in this
                    parish, there is a vitrified fort, and the remains of an old church and
                    burying-ground, where, until after the reformation, the two sexes were not
                    allowed to intermingle. Near this church there is a circular inclosure called
                    the Devil’s Cauldron, where penance was wont to be performed. As this rite of
                    superstition is somewhat singular, we shall describe it. Transgressors were
                    imprisoned in this terrene purgatory for a given time, which, it may be readily
                    conceived, was meted out according to the magnitude of the offences committed,
                    being sometimes for several days and nights together. The priest threatened
                    eternal punishment to the whole party if but one of their number fell asleep. To
                    provide against this, the penitents were furnished with a sharp instrument, with
                    which they kept pricking each other when inclined to somnolency.</p>
                <p>There are three small villages in the island; Port Ban-natyne, situated at the
                    head of Kames Bay, about two and a half miles from Rothesay; Kerrycroy, near
                    Mountstuart, the seat of the Marquis of Bute; and Kilcatten Bay, situated on the
                    south side of the island. The natives formerly spoke the English and Gaelic
                    languages indifferently, but English is now chiefly spoken.</p>
                <p>Arran is situated about eight miles south of Bute. It is very mountainous.
                    Goatfield, a mountain situated about the centre of the island, is 2945 feet
                    high; and some others approach to that height. There is a remarkably fine view
                    from this mountain on all sides, whence is seen part of the Atlantic Ocean,
                    Ireland, the counties of Ayr, Renfrew, Argyle, and Bute, the Frith of Clyde,
                    Loch Fine, and hundreds of other scenes both grand and picturesque. There are
                    many druidical remains and monumental stones on the island. Fingal’s Cave is
                    still pointed out; and tradition says Ossian died on this island. It is about
                    twenty miles long and eleven broad, and contains about 106,000 English acres,
                    15,000 of which only are arable. Abundance of game and some wild deer are found
                    on the mountains. These are either bare rocks, or only covered with heath and
                    fern. There is comparatively little wood in the island, except near Brodick
                    Castle. The climate in winter is very severe, and generally moist. The whole
                    island, except a few farms, belongs to the Duke of Hamilton, in which family it
                    has been for several centuries. The roads are for the most part very good,
                    having been chiefly made by the parliamentary commissioners a few years ago; and
                    the expense of repairs is defrayed partly by the exchequer, and partly by the
                    proprietors, in terms of the act 59 Geo. III. cap. 135. The herring fishery is
                    prosecuted to a considerable extent, but this is almost wholly done by means of
                    wherries and other small vessels. There are two excellent harbours in the
                    island, Lamlash and Loch Ranza, but without piers of any extent. There is a
                    small pier at Brodick, but the bay is not well sheltered for anchorage. A very
                    extensive pier was commenced at Lamlash in the reign of Queen Anne, and a
                    considerable part erected, but it was afterwards neglected; and all the stones
                    above the water have from time to time been removed for building or other
                    purposes, so that now the foundation can scarcely be traced; and the only
                    landing place is a small jetty recently built. The island produces barley, bear,
                    oats, peas, beans, potatoes, and turnips. The islanders have been long addicted
                    to illicit distillation, a practice which has not yet been given up, although it
                    has considerably diminished, owing, it is believed, to the strong laws enacted
                    against it, and the firmness with which they are executed. The smugglers give a
                    better price for the barley and bear than could otherwise be obtained, and this
                    enables the tenants to pay a better rent. We see no reason why this demoralizing
                    traffic should not be as effectually<pb break="no" facs="nls:193742840"

                    Bute, by the exertions of the principal proprietor. From the prevalence of this
                    practice, the inhabitants of Arran have acquired a very reserved and suspicious
                    manner, especially in the presence of strangers. A visitor to Arran will be
                    sometimes amazed to find, that in putting a question about any individual or
                    place in the island, to any of the natives, no satisfactory answer will be
                    returned, until he, in his turn, undergo a process of examination as to his
                    purpose in landing, and his objects in asking for these persons and places; and,
                    from the same cause, it is very difficult to discover the perpetrator of any
                    crime, unless it be of very considerable magnitude. Agriculture was much
                    neglected till of late; every farm being occupied by a society of tenants, among
                    whom the arable part of the farm was divided in small lots, and the pasturage
                    grounds and moors were a common under one herd; but they are now well
                    subdivided. There has been a great emigration from this island to America of
                    late years, although the inhabitants are strongly attached to their native soil.
                    The language chiefly spoken by the natives is Gaelic, but they are rapidly
                    advancing in the knowledge of English. The islanders are all Protestants, and
                    strongly attached to the church of Scotland. Christianity is said to have been
                    introduced here by St Molios, a disciple of St Columba. The island is divided
                    into two parishes, and has also two chapels. The largest parish is. named
                    Kilmory, and contains 3771 inhabitants; the other parish is named Kilbride, and
                    contains 2656 inhabitants, making the population of the island 6427, besides a
                    few seamen belonging to registered vessels. The population of this island has
                    rather decreased of late years, owing to emigration. Arran is highly celebrated
                    for its mineralogy. (See Jameson’s <hi rend="italic">Mineralogy of the Scottish
                    Isles,</hi> Headrich’s <hi rend="italic">Survey of Arran,</hi> and Dr
                    M‘Culloch’s works.) Granite, rock crystal, quartz, and small-grained granite,
                    are abundant in the northern division of the island. Mica slate and granite
                    unite at Catacoal. Gneiss, micaceous schistus, and puddingstone, are abundant at
                    Glenrosa. Quartz is found in all kinds of crystallization, in beds of clay slate
                    and in other situations. Greenstone, sandstone resting on clay slate, basalt,
                    trap, and limestone, are abundant. Pitchstone is found on the south, with
                    pearlstone, ironstone, and porphyry; also flint, agate, siliceous spar, jasper,
                    and various beautiful crystals.</p>
                <p>Great Cumbraes is situated in the Frith of Clyde, betwixt Ayrshire and the island
                    of Bute. It is the property of the Marquis of Bute and the Earl of Glasgow. It
                    is about two miles and a half long, and one and a half broad, and measures about
                    2500 acres, one half of which is arable. It has a gentle ascent of about 400
                    feet from the sea to the centre of the island. The village of Millport is
                    situated on the south-west side of the island, opposite which there is very safe
                    anchorage-ground, and a small harbour is formed with a stone pier. The island
                    abounds with lime and freestone. Considerable quantities of the freestone are
                    exported, but the lime is seldom wrought. There are two basaltic rocks on the
                    east side of the island, called Reppel Walls. It forms one parish, and has one
                    church. The population in 1831 was 877, besides thirty-five seamen belonging to
                    registered vessels.</p>
                <p>Little Cumbrae lies about half a mile south of Great Cumbrae. It is the property
                    of the Earl of Eglintoun. It is about a mile in length, and half a mile in
                    breadth. Rabbits are very plentiful on this island. A light-house was erected in
                    1750 on the highest point of the island, but it was found that the fogs obscured
                    the light; it was therefore removed to a lower situation. Three or four families
                    live on it. The ruins of a castle are situated on the south side. The ascent
                    from the shore is over rocks, which rise one above another like steps of stairs.
                    There are several caves in the island, two of them very large. The extent of one
                    of these is not known, but the other is thirty-two feet square, and six feet in
                    height.</p>
                <p>Inchmarnoch is a low-lying, small, beautiful island, situated about a mile west
                    from Bute, It takes its name from a chapel built on it, dedicated to St Marnoch,
                    and which had a burying-ground attached. The ruins were visible till very
                    lately, when they were removed by the rude hands of a farmer. It is about a mile
                    long and half a mile broad, and is divided into three farms, and nearly one half
                    is arable. It is the property of the Marquis of Bute, and abounds in sea shell
                    or marl. The inhabitants acknowledge the spiritual jurisdiction of the parish of
                    Rothesay, although it was long considered as belonging to Saddel in Argyleshire,
                    from the monks of St Marnoch being attached to the convent of Saddel; and still
                    the minister of Kerry derives a portion of his stipend from this island.</p>
                <p>Pladda is a small island, which lies about a mile southeast from Arran, on which
                    there is a light-house, which directs the mariner to the Cumbrae light.</p>
                <p>Lamlash is a small island situated in the mouth of Lamlash Bay, in Arran, and
                    helps to form that safe and capacious harbour.</p>
                <p>The valued rent of the county in Scots money isL.15,042. 13s. 10d. The lands
                    belong to twelve proprietors. The valuation Scots of the Marquis of Bute’s land
                    is L.8066. 5s. 4įd.; that of the Duke of Hamilton, including a few farms
                    belonging to Miss Ann Hamilton, is L.4955. lis. Nearly one fourth of the lands
                    in the county is entailed. The real rent of the lands in 1811 was L.18,560. 9s.
                    2d., of the houses L.2310. Is. 7d. Of the thirty-three shires of Scotland, Bute
                    was the twelfth in point of precedency in the Scottish parliament rolls and all
                    public processions, though not entitled to that rank in point of valuation. It
                    sent two members to parliament before the union; since that time, and till the
                    passing of the reform bill, Bute and Caithness returned a member alternately;
                    now Bute returns a member for itself. The family of Bute were hereditary
                    sheriffs of the county for upwards of 360 years, until the jurisdictions were
                    taken away in 1748. They were also lords of the regality of Bute. The present
                    marquis is lord-lieutenant and high sheriff of the shire, and heritable coroner
                    of the island of Bute, and keeper of the castle of Rothesay. Criminals usually
                    tried before the justiciary court are sent to the circuit court at Inverary.
                    Buteshire sends ten assizers to that circuit court. The islands of Bute and
                    Cumbrae were granted by the sovereign of Scotland, at an early period, to the
                    lord high steward; and when they fell under the power of Norway, the monarch of
                    that country gave Bute and certain other islands to Reginald, king of Man. After
                    the marriage of Alexander VI., lord high steward, with Jean, daughter and
                    heiress of Angus, one of the grandsons of the king of Man, the islands of Bute,
                    Arran, and Cumbrae became a favoured part of the patrimony of the lord high
                    steward, between whom and the people a strong attachment subsisted; and they
                    were, by way of distinction, called the Lord High Steward’s Brandanes. It is
                    probable that this name was derived from St Brandane, who flourished in the
                    eleventh century. Sir John Stewart of Bute, from whom the family of Bute
                    descended, was son to King Robert II., and received from his father the office
                    of heritable sheriff, as well as an estate of lands in Bute and Arran. In the
                    year 1544 the English burned the greater part of Bute and Arran. The shire of
                    Bute contains 154 English square miles, or 98,547 English acres; and the
                    population in 1831 amounted to 14,134, besides seamen belonging to registered
                    vessels, of whom there might be about 400.</p>
