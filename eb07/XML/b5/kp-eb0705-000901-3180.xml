                <p><label type="entry">BORNEO</label>, an island forming part of the great East
                    Indian Archipelago. Next to New Holland, which may be considered as a species of
                    continent, it seems indisputably the largest in the known world. It reaches from
                    about 7° north to 4° south latitude, and from 109° to 118° east longitude. Its
                    length may be estimated at 750 miles, its greatest breadth at 600, and its
                    average breadth at 350. It exhibits the usual insular structure, a mass of loftv
                    mountains in the centre, sloping gradually down to level and alluvial tracts
                    along the sea shore. It is watered by many fine rivers, of which those of Borneo
                    Proper, Banjar Massin, and Passir, are navigable for more than fifty miles above
                    their junction with the sea. All these rivers were understood by Dr Leyden to be
                    derived from an immense lake in the interior, called the Sea of Manilla. It is
                    more probable that they all rise from the mountainous district of greatest
                    elevation. The interior of Borneo is covered with immense forests, filled with
                    wild animals, particularly ourang-outangs. A great part of the coast is marshy,
                    so that it is in portions only that it displays the exuberance of tropical
                    fertility. Of all the East Indian islands, Borneo ranks lowest as to
                    civilization and improvement. Nothing, perhaps, has tended so powerfully to
                    check its progress as the solid and unbroken form of its coasts, destitute of
                    those large bays or inland seas which have always proved the nursery of
                    commerce.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese discovered Borneo in 1526, though, from the superior wealth
                    promised by the Spice Islands, it attracted comparatively little attention. Yet
                    they, as well as the Spaniards, the Dutch, and the English, formed
                    establishments on different parts of the coast; but the small force defending
                    them, and the fierce animosity of the natives, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733193" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3193-0010"/>made their tenure generally
                    of very short duration. The physical structure of Borneo, the vast forests,
                    mountains, and jungles of the interior, obstruct communication between the
                    different parts of its coast, as completely as if an extent of sea had
                    intervened. It is thus split into a number of petty districts, entirely detached
                    from each other, and which cannot be satisfactorily described, unless in detail.
                    In this manner, therefore, we shall consider the principal states, beginning
                    with Borneo Proper, and thence making the circuit of the island; after which we
                    shall attempt some general views of its population and commerce.</p>
                <p>Borneo Proper occupies the northern coast, and is reckoned a state of great
                    antiquity. The soil is comparatively fertile, supplying rice sufficient for the
                    consumption of the inhabitants, as well as most of the camphire for which the
                    island is celebrated. The city, called also Borneo, is built upon alluvial
                    ground, about ten miles above the mouth of the river of the same name. It is
                    compared to Venice; canals are conducted through every street, and all business
                    is conducted in boats, usually rowed by women. The houses are built upon posts,
                    and ascended to by ladders. The river is navigable for large vessels
                    considerably above the town; but there is a bar at its entrance, over which
                    there is scarcely a depth of seventeen feet at high water. The sultan is treated
                    with those marks of peculiar respect which in this part of the world usually
                    indicate an ancient dynasty; but the chief power rests in the council of the
                    nobles. This state has little communication with Europeans; and the English, who
                    were accustomed to deal to a small extent in piece-goods, have in a great
                    measure discontinued the traffic. The commerce of this city and district is
                    almost entirely engrossed by the Chinese, who bring annually from Amou four or
                    five junks, of about 500 tons burden. As the neighbourhood abounds in excellent
                    timber, they frequently build their junks here, and carry them away loaded with
                    the commodities of the country.</p>
                <p>On the eastern coast of Borneo, Mangedava and Pappal are populous, fertile, and
                    well-watered districts. Malloo-doo possesses these advantages in a still
                    superior degree, and grows also a large quantity of jattans. Tiroon produces
                    sago in abundance, and birds’ nests more copiously than any other part of the
                    eastern Archipelago. None of these states, however, are much frequented by or
                    known to Europeans. The chief state on the ŵstern coast is Passir, situated
                    about fifty miles up a river of the same name. This districtis very low and
                    flat; and, were it not cooled by the sea breezes, would be intensely hot. Being
                    marshy and filled with woods, it is extremely unhealthy. The town is said not to
                    contain above 300 wooden houses, which are built along the river. The sultan has
                    a palace and wooden fort along the northern bank. The people of Passir have an
                    extremely bad reputation as to their conduct in mercantile transactions. They
                    use false weights and measures, manufacture counterfeit articles, and embrace,
                    in short, every opportunity of cheating that offers. The English East India
                    Company made an attempt, in 1772, to establish a factory here, but it did not
                    succeed.</p>
                <p>Banjar Massin is the principal state on the southern coast of Borneo; and, like
                    the others, it owes its prosperity to a large river, on the banks of which it is
                    situated. This river is five or six fathoms deep; but, unfortunately, the bar
                    does not allow above twelve or thirteen feet of water, and requires the aid of
                    the tide to produce even that depth. Ships, however, may anchor in the port of
                    Tom-bangou or Tombomio, near the mouth of the river, where they are well
                    supplied with water and provisions. Banjar Massin, in 1780, was estimated to
                    contain a population of 8500 Mahommedans, chiefly Javanese, with a considerable
                    proportion of Bugis, Macassars, and Malays. The Chinese are also pretty
                    numerous. The sultan resides at Martapura, about three days’ journey up the
                    river, to which place he is attached by the circumstance of its being an
                    uncommonly fine hunting station. The district of Ban jar produces gold and
                    diamonds, both of superior quality to those found in other parts of the island.
                    Pepper is so abundant that, in a commercial view, it may be considered as the
                    staple commodity. The iron is very excellent, and peculiarly fit for steel;
                    though Dr Leyden asserts that the inhabitants do not themselves understand the
                    art of manufacturing it. In 1700 the English East India Company formed a
                    settlement at Banjar Massin. A rage then prevailed for multiplying
                    establishments, and the present one was soon so far extended as to equal that of
                    Calcutta. But the expectations of extensive trade, which prompted to such an
                    enlargement, were in a great measure illusory; a thousand tons of pepper being
                    the most valuable article drawn from the settlement. Before the company could be
                    fully aware of its unproductive nature, however, this settlement was brought to
                    a premature end. An attack was made by the natives on so great a scale, and with
                    such fury, that, though repulsed, it seemed to leave no choice but the immediate
                    evacuation of the factory, without even removing the stores. The damage
                    sustained on the occasion is estimated at 50,000 dollars.</p>
                <p>Succadana, or, as Dr Leyden calls it, Sacadina, was anciently the most powerful
                    state on the western coast of Borneo. The Dutch began to trade there in 1604,
                    but they soon afterwards attached themselves, in preference, to Sambas. In 1623
                    they abandoned their factory at Succadana. In 1786 they united with the sultan
                    of Pontiana in an expedition against this place, which they took and entirely
                    destroyed. It appears to have been since rebuilt, but is entirely in the hands
                    of the Malays, and scarcely ever visited by Europeans. Pontiana is a state of
                    very recent origin, but it now exceeds in wealth and power all others upon the
                    western coast of Borneo. This distinction it owes to the wisdom of the Arab
                    prince by whom it was founded. He renounced from the first the pernicious
                    policy, almost universal in these petty states, of embarking in trade, and
                    monopolizing its principal articles. He confined himself to his proper
                    functions, of dispensing justice, and securing protection to all, of whatever
                    country or religion, who resorted to his dominions. Under this salutary policy
                    Pontiana soon rose to be the greatest emporium in those seas. It is situated on
                    a large river, formerly called Laua, and the country behind produces diamonds
                    the most abundantly of any district in Borneo. The Dutch established a factory
                    here in 1776, and maintained ever after a good understanding with the sultan. In
                    1813, after the British force had taken possession of Batavia, that prince,
                    dreading an attack from Sambas, solicited the protection of a British garrison,
                    which was immediately sent; and he afterwards assisted our troops in the
                    reduction of Sambas. Moitiparwa, situated a little to the north of Pontiana, is
                    the best market for opium upon this coast. The city lies nineteen miles up the
                    river, the entrance of which is obstructed by a bar and by several small
                    islands. This is probably the same district called Mattan by Dr Leyden, who says
                    that the king possesses the finest diamond in the world, for which a high price
                    was offered by the Dutch, which he refused to accept. Sambas is situated about
                    thirty miles up the river of the same name. Like most other towns in Borneo, it
                    is built of timber and bamboos, and raised by stakes above the swampy
                    foundation. Sambas has always been a powerful state, but for some time past has
                    devoted itself so entirely to piracy as to render its existence scarcely
                    compatible with that of its civilized neighbours. Upon this principle the
                    British, in 1812, undertook an expedition against it; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733206" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3206-0011"/>but they were repulsed with
                    great loss in the attack, and suffered still more from the malignant influence
                    of the climate. In the following year, however, a new expedition was undertaken
                    under Colonel Watson, who, on the 3d of July, carried the fort by storm, and
                    obliged the rajah to retire into the interior of his dominions.</p>
                <p>On a general view of the state of culture and civilization in Borneo, Mr Hamilton
                    estimates the population at 3,000,000, which we should suppose to be, rather
                    above than under the truth. The interior is entirely occupied by a native race,
                    called variously, according to the parts of the island which they inhabit,
                    Dayak, Idaan, and Tiroon. Those which subsist by fishing are commonly called
                    Biajoos. The appellations of Horaforas and Maroots have also been applied to
                    these races. The whole may be considered as one, almost savage, and nearly
                    similar to that which occupies the interior of Sumatra. Some, indeed, cultivate
                    the ground, some display considerable industry in fishing, and a few employ
                    themselves in collecting gold; but their institutions in general indicate the
                    very rudest state of human society. It has been strongly asserted that they
                    devour the flesh of their enemies; an assertion not noticed by Dr Leyden, and
                    which has in many instances been made without foundation. All accounts agree,
                    however, as to the existence of another truly savage custom, by which every man
                    is debarred from the privilege of matrimony till he has, with his own hand, cut
                    off the head of an enemy. Those, therefore, who are desirous of entering into
                    that state form themselves into what Dr Leyden calls <hi rend="italic"
                    >head-hunting</hi> expeditions. They make an inroad into the territories of a
                    neighbouring tribe, and, if their strength appears sufficient, endeavour to
                    effect their object by force; if otherwise, they conceal themselves behind
                    thickets, till an unfortunate individual passes, whom they can make their prey.
                    Some are also said to immolate human victims on the altars of their
                    divinities.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of the towns along the coast consist chiefly of that race so
                    universally diffused throughout the Indian islands under the name of Malays.
                    This name, to an European ear, has usually suggested every extreme of perfidy
                    and atrocity. We have perused, however, a very different estimate of their
                    character, formed by an intelligent gentleman, who spent several years in this
                    part of India. He describes them as honest, frank, simple, and even gentle in
                    their manners, decidedly superior, in a moral view, to the degenerate Hindoos.
                    The sanguinary deeds which have exposed them to so much reproach he ascribes to
                    a proud and almost chivalrous sense of honour, which makes them regard blows, or
                    any similar personal insult, as an offence only to be expiated by blood. The
                    coarse and unfeeling treatment which they often experience from Dutch and
                    Chinese masters drives them to these dreadful extremities. Piracy, however, is a
                    vice of which this race cannot be acquitted; and the western coast of Borneo,
                    situated on the great naval route to China, may be viewed as the grand field for
                    its exercise. To a poor and hardy race, who see half the wealth of Asia passing
                    along their shores, the temptation is almost irresistible. Like the Arabs, they
                    have formed for themselves a code of morality, in which plunder is expunged from
                    the list of vices. Yet, though individually brave, they possess no skill or
                    discipline which could render them formidable to the crew of an European vessel.
                    The cowardice of the Lascars, by whom Indian trading vessels are usually
                    navigated, is the only circumstance which has made our trade suffer so severely
                    from their ravages.</p>
                <p>Next to the two classes above enumerated, the most numerous are the Chinese.
                    These, by the gentleman above alluded to, are considered as the most valuable
                    sub jects whom an uncivilized state can receive into its bosom. The difficulty
                    of finding subsistence in their own country has led them to emigrate in vast
                    numbers into Borneo. Nothing, perhaps, except the law which prohibits females
                    from leaving the empire, could have prevented this almost unoccupied island from
                    being entirely filled with a Chinese population. From this circumstance,
                    however, the colonists are composed entirely of men in the vigour of life, and
                    of the most enterprising and industrious character. Their chief settlement is at
                    Sambas, on the western coast, where the numbers cannot be estimated at less than
                    30,000, composing a sort of independent state. Their almost sole occupation is
                    that of extracting the gold which abounds upon this coast. It is found in
                    alluvial soil, and is purified by the simple process of passing a stream of
                    water over the ore. The processes employed for this purpose are daily improving,
                    and it is conceived that the produce here and at other quarters will be
                    sufficient to remove all future apprehensions of the East proving a drain upon
                    the gold of Europe.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Borneo, though not equal to its extent and natural capacities, is
                    by no means inconsiderable. Gold is its principal export. Mr Milburn estimates
                    the annual quantity exported at 200 peculs, or 26,000 lbs. avoirdupois, which
                    would coin into upwards of 900,000 guineas. Like some other commodities, it is
                    divided, by a grotesque scale, into three kinds, called the head, the belly, and
                    the feet; the first being the best, and the two others gradually diminishing in
                    value. Camphire is exported to the extent of thirty peculs (3990 lbs.), all to
                    China, where it is more esteemed than that of Sumatra. The singular Chinese
                    luxuries of <hi rend="italic">biche de mer</hi> or sea slug, and edible
                    bird-nests, are found in Borneo, as over all the Indian Archipelago. Pepper to a
                    considerable amount, canes and rattans of various descriptions, sago, and a
                    little tin, complete the list of exports. The chief import is opium to a very
                    great extent, with piece-goods, hardware, coarse cutlery, arms, and toys. By far
                    the greater proportion of the trade is in the hands of the Chinese. (Leyden’s
