                <p><label type="entry">BUSCHING, <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthony
                    Frederick</hi></label>. This very eminent geographer was born at Stadthagen, a
                    village of Westphalia, on the 27th September 1724. In his youth he laboured
                    under peculiar disadvantages, arising from the disorderly life led by his
                    father, and from the narrow means of education which his native town afforded.
                    Fortunately a clergyman of the name of Hauber, pleased with the promising
                    talents of the young man, undertook to give him gratuitous instruction. He laid
                    a solid foundation of learning, and also of a piety which, though fervent, was
                    always accompanied with moderation and mildness. At the age of eighteen, young
                    Busching was driven from his father’s house, on account of the zeal with which
                    he espoused the cause of his patron, on occasion of a controversy in which he
                    was involved. Hauber, however, procured for him the means of continuing his
                    studies at Halle. There, by his application to learning, and his irreproachable
                    conduct, he acquired numerous friends. They procured him the appointment of
                    tutor in the family of the Count de Lynars, who was then going as ambassador to
                    Petersburg. The observations made by Busching on this journey decided the
                    pursuits of his future life. In travelling through Poland and Russia, he
                    compared the actual features of those regions with the descriptions given of
                    them. He thus became sensible of the miserably defective state of geographical
                    science, and resolved to devote his life to its improvement. He withdrew as soon
                    as possible from the count’s family, and went to reside at Copenhagen, devoting
                    himself entirely to this new pursuit. In 1752 he presented the first specimen of
                    his powers in a <hi rend="italic">Description of the Counties of Sleswig and
                    Holstein·,</hi> a work which produced a favourable idea of his accuracy and
                    ability. He soon after removed to Göttingen, and married Christiana Dilthey, a
                    young lady of great accomplishments, authoress of a volume of poems, and to whom
                    lie had been engaged from the time of his departure to Russia. Here, on account
                    of a work which appeared to dissent from some of the Lutheran tenets, he was
                    excluded from the theological chair, for which lie had become a candidate. The
                    chagrin occasioned by this disappointment induced him to accept an invitation to
                    the German congregation at Petersburg. He was employed there, also, in
                    organizing a school, which, under his auspices, soon became one of the most
                    flourishing in the north. This school was superintended by Marshal Munich, who
                    at first showed great favour to Busching; but being accustomed to entire
                    obsequiousness from all connected with him, the marshal did not accommodate
                    himself to the hardy independence, of the German sage. A collision arose, in
                    consequence of which Busching announced to his congregation that he was under
                    the necessity of returning to Germany. The empress expressed much
                    dissatisfaction at the conduct of Munich, and made very high offers to Busching
                    if he would consent to remain; but he deemed it unworthy of him, after having
                    resisted the entreaties of his congregation, to yield to the favours of the
                    court. He returned to Germany without any fixed object or establishment in life,
                    and went at first to reside at Altona. Next year, however, he was called to
                    superintend an extensive establishment for education, which had been formed at
                    Berlin, under the auspices of the great Frederick. His appointments here were
                    liberal, and his exertions proved of signal benefit to the institution of which
                    he became the head. His writings and example gave a new impulse to education
                    throughout Prussia. He spent a number of hours every day in the institute,
                    superintended the progress of every pupil, and inspected the minutest details
                    connected with its prosperity. He gave also courses of lectures on the history
                    of the arts and sciences. This labour did not interrupt the composition of his
                    numerous works. The queen loved his society, and at first often invited him to
                    dine with her; but, finding that such engagements occupied too much of his time,
                    he entreated her majesty to allow him to devote himself as much as possible to
                    his numerous labours. Though seized with dropsy, which occasioned a series of
                    the most cruel sufferings, he did not remit his academical labours, till the
                    disease coming to a crisis, terminated his life on the 28th May 1793, in the
                    69th year of his age. His wife had died in 1777, and he had contracted a second
                    marriage with Mademoiselle Reinbeck, the daughter of a clergyman at Berlin. By
                    the first marriage he had two children, who survived him; by the second he had
                    six, who, except one, all died in infancy.</p>
                <p>Few authors, even in Germany, have produced a greater number of works than
                    Busching. The entire number, as enumerated by Meusel, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >∖∖∖</hi><hi rend="italic">s&gt; Lexico of German Authors,</hi> amounts to more
                    than a hundred. They may all be classed under the following heads: 1. Geography
                    and History; 2. Education; 3. Religion; 4. Biography. The first class
                    comprehends those upon which his fame chiefly rests. He possessed not, indeed,
                    the geographical genius, if we may so speak, of D’Anville, his skill in the
                    construction of maps, bis quick eye, or his sagacity in eliciting the truth from
                    hints and imperfect notices. He may be regarded, however, as the creator of
                    modern <hi rend="italic">Statistics,</hi> that science which exhibits the
                    present state of every kingdom, its civil and political constitution, its
                    wealth, the productions of nature, the exchanges of commerce, and the
                    establishments for public instruction; all these particulars are detailed in his
                    works in the fullest manner, and from the most careful investigation of original
                    materials. His works, devoid of the ornaments of style, and composed of minute
                    details, are rather useful to consult than profitable to read; but this is a
                    fault to which most writers of his country are liable. His grand work is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Neue Erdbeschreibung,</hi><hi rend="italic">New Geographical
                    Description of the Globe.</hi> The first four parts, which comprehend Europe,
                    were published in four successive volumes, from 1754 to 1761, and have been
                    translated into all the European languages. They appeared in English with a
                    preface by Murdoch, in six volumes 4to, London, 1762. He published also, in
                    1768, the fifth part, being the first volume upon Asia, containing <hi
                    rend="italic">Asiatic Turkey</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arabia.</hi> It displays
                    an immense extent of research, and is generally considered as his masterpiece;
                    but it has not been translated either into French or English.</p>
                <p>Besides this great geographical work, Busching was the editor of a valuable
                    collection, entitled <hi rend="italic">Magazine for the History and Geography of
                    Modern Times,</hi> 22 vols. 4to, 1767-88; also of a <hi rend="italic">Journal
                    appropriated to the Notice of Maps,</hi> Berlin, 1773-87.</p>

                <p>The elementary works on education published by Busching are very numerous, and
                    have long held a distinguished place, even in a country so eminent as Germany,
                    in this branch of literature. If in some departments better works have now been
                    produced, it is by labouring on the foundation of Busching. His theological
                    writings are not very highly esteemed. In biography he wrote a number of
                    articles for the <hi rend="italic">Historical Magazine</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> also <hi rend="italic">A Collection of Biography,</hi> in six volumes,
                    1783-9, including a very elaborate life of the great Frederick. ∙ <hi
