                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BULGARIA</label>, a province of European Turkey, extending
                    from the mouth of the Danube, along that river till it meets the Timok above
                    Widdin, on the borders of Servia. The Danube forms the whole of its northern,
                    and the parallel chain of the Balkan its southern boundary. It is about three
                    hundred and fifty miles long, extending from the Black Sea to Servia, by fi <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> om forty to fifty broad.</p>
                <p>This province was the <hi rend="italic">Moesia Inferior</hi> of the Romans, and
                    derives its present name from the Bulgarii or Bulgares, one of the northern
                    hordes who abandoned their dreary plains to seek a more propitious climate in
                    the south. They left the Wolga in the sixth century, and crossing the Danube
                    near its mouth, established themselves in the inviting country which lies
                    between that river and the mountains, extending westward from the shore of the
                    Euxine. Here they defied all the efforts of the Greeks of the lower empire to
                    dispossess them; and their various and sanguinary conflicts form a considerable
                    portion of the history of that period. They carried on many contests with the
                    emperors of the East; but in the eleventh century they were at length confined
                    within certain limits, and the country was reduced to the state of a province.
                    On the decline of the Greek empire, however, it was finally brought <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193742177" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2177-0701"/> under the Turkish
                    yoke by Bajazet, when the Turks had established themselves in the neighbouring
                    province of Rumelia, the ancient Thrace.</p>
                <p>The country, except in the neighbourhood of the Danube and the Euxine, is
                    mountainous; but the sides of the smaller hills afford excellent pasture, and
                    the soil is exceedingly rich and fertile. It is irrigated by a number of rivers
                    and streams, the tributaries of the Danube. The climate is mild, and the
                    productions accordingly are various and abundant. There is a profusion of grain,
                    cattle, wine, wood, iron, &amp;c.; and the province is looked upon by the Turks
                    as the granary of Constantinople. The people have entirely laid aside the
                    warlike character which distinguished their ancestors. The avocations of the
                    greater number of them are pastoral, and their character corresponds with that
                    which is always identified with this mode of life. Mr Walsh, the most recent
                    traveller who has visited the province, gives the following graphic and
                    interesting description of the appearance and character of the people. “Of all
                    the peasantry I have ever met with,” says he, “the Bulgarians seem the most
                    simple, kind, and affectionate; forming a striking contrast with the rude and
                    brutal Turks, who are mixed among them, but distinguished by the strongest
                    traits of character. On the road we frequently met groups of both, always
                    separate, but employed in the same avocations; the Turks were known by turbans,
                    sashes, pistols, andyatigans; but still more by a ferocity of aspect, a rude
                    assumption of demeanour, and a careless kind of contempt, that at once repulsed
                    and disgusted us. They never turned their buffaloes or arubas out of the way to
                    let us pass, or showed the smallest wish to be civil or obliging: on the
                    contrary, they were pleased if they pushed us into a bog in the narrow road, or
                    entangled us among trees or bushes. Any accommodation in houses was out of the
                    question; if we approached one for a drink of milk or water, we ran the hazard
                    of being stabbed or shot. The Bulgarians were distinguished by caps of brown
                    sheepskin; jackets of cloth, made of the wool undyed of dark brown sheep, which
                    their wives spin and weave; white doth trousers, and sandals of raw leather,
                    drawn under the sole, and laced with thongs over the instep; and they carried
                    neither pistol or yatigan, nor any other weapon of offence; but they were still
                    more distinguished by their countenance and demeanour The first is open,
                    artless, and benevolent; and the second is so kind and cordial, that every one
                    we met seemed to welcome us as friends. Whenever their buffaloes or arubas
                    stopped up the way, they were prompt to turn them aside; and whenever they saw
                    us embarrassed, or obliged to get out of the road, they were eager to show us it
                    was not their fault. Their houses were always open to us, and our presence was a
                    kind of jubilee to the family; the compensation we gave scarcely deserved the
                    name, and, I am disposed to think, if not offered, would not have been asked
                    for. Turkish women we never saw; the Bulgarian women mixed freely with us in the
                    domestic way, and treated us with the unsuspecting cordiality they would show to
                    brothers. Their dress was neat, clean, and comfortable; it generally consisted
                    of a jacket and petticot of dark blue cloth, with a bright border of list round
                    the edges or down the seams; and a shift of hemp and cotton, very large, hanging
                    far below the petticot, and gathered in full folds round the neck and arms, and
                    worked or wove with lace-like borders. Married women wear handkerchiefs on their
                    heads, with a long lap-pel hanging on the back behind; girls have their heads
                    uncovered, with their hair braided and ornamented with different coins. All wear
                    ear-rings, bracelets, and rings on their fingers, even girls of three and four
                    years old, and all go barefooted. They are exceedingly industrious, and are
                    never for a moment without their spindle and distaff; they frequently asked for
                    needles, and I greatly regretted I had not brought a few scissors and other
                    female implements, which would have been highly acceptable to them. Their
                    villages generally consist of forty or fifty houses, scattered without order or
                    regularity. Their houses are built of wicker-work plastered, and are clean and
                    comfortable on the inside.”</p>
                <p>The Bulgarians fabricate to a great extent several articles which are famous in
                    Turkey; one is a coarse woollen cloth, and another rifle gun-barrels. But that
                    which is most congenial to their rural habits is the preparation of the otto or
                    attar of roses, a great part of which comes to England. Rose trees are very
                    plentiful, and gardens are laid out for the purpose of cultivating them. The
                    language of the people is a dialect of the Sclavonian, and bears a resemblance
                    to the Russian. Only a few elementary books have been printed in this language,
                    and it has never been reduced to grammatical rules. The books introduced are in
                    Greek, but that language has made .no progress amongst the people, and the
                    consequence is that they are entirely illiterate. Their religion is
                    Christianity, which they embraced on their arrival in the district. They belong
                    to the Greek church, subject to the Greek patriarch of Constantinople, who
                    appoints their bishops. There is generally attached to every two or three
                    villages a priest, who performs the duties of his vocation in each occasionally;
                    but, unless in a very few places, they are destitute of churches, schools, and
                    books. The principal towns, such as Sophia, Shumla, Ternevo, &amp;c., will be
                    described as they occur alphabetically.</p>
                <p>The Bulgarians have extended themselves beyond the limits defined at the
                    commencement. They have crossed the chain of mountains, and now occupy almost
                    exclusively a considerable portion of Rumelia. They are gradually advancing, and
                    in course of time, if their barbarous neighbours allow them to proceed, they are
                    likely to cultivate the almost solitary desert which lies between the Balkan and
                    the sea. The population of Bulgaria is estimated at about 1,800,000.</p>
