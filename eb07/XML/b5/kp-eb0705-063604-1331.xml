                <p><label type="entry">BUDDHA or <hi rend="smallcaps">Buddiiu</hi></label>, one of
                    the two appearances of Vishnu, assumed for the purpose of deluding the enemies
                    of the gods, and effecting their destruction by leading them to profess
                    heretical opinions, and thus to reject the Hindu religion. In the Bhagawat, a
                    work held in high esteem by the great majority of the Hindus, it is expressly
                    declared, “that, at the commencement of the Kali Yug, Vishnu became incarnate in
                    Kikata, under the name of Buddha, the son of Jina, for the purpose of deluding
                    the enemies of the gods ;” that “the Undiscernible Being, having assumed a
                    mortal form, preached heretical doctrines in the three cities founded by Maya,
                    for the purpose of destroying, by deluding, the enemies of the gods, stedfast in
                    the religion prescribed by the Vedas ;” that praise is due to “the pure Buddha,
                    the deluder of the Daityas and Dana was ;” and that, “by his words, as Buddha,
                    Vishnu deludes the heretics.” The same legend is related in a more detailed
                    manner in the Kashi Khand of the Skanda Purana, and also in the Ganesha
                    Upa-Purana, in which the appearance of Buddha is described as a manifestation
                    rather than an incarnation of Vishnu; and an account is given of the
                    circumstances under which it is alleged to have been made. According to the
                    Puranas, Divodasa, a king of the solar race, finding Kashi unoccupied, took
                    possession of the place, and there established the religion of Vishnu on so firm
                    a foundation, and rendered his people so virtuous and happy, that the gods
                    having become alarmed lest they should lose their supremacy, which they
                    maintained by the use of very different means, applied to Vishnu and Shiva to
                    relieve them from their anxieties on this head. The two incarnations of the
                    Supreme Being, however, declared at first that it would be unjust to deprive so
                    virtuous a prince of his kingdom; but Divodasa, having obtained as a boon from
                    Brahma that none of the deities should remain in his kingdom, or exercise any
                    power over it, Shiva at length waxed wroth at being so long banished from his
                    favourite residence, and consented to fulfil the malignant wishes of the
                    deities. But how was this to be accomplished? As long as Divodasa and his
                    subjects remained stedfast in their religion, they were secure from injury; it
                    therefore became necessary to lead them into error as a pretext for destroying
                    them; and with this view Devi, the twelve suns, and Ganesha, were employed, but
                    without success. At last, when these minor tempters had failed, Vishnu appeared,
                    as Buddha, and effected their apostacy.</p>
                <p>From the tenor of this legend may be divined, <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi>
                    the doctrines which it was necessary for Buddha to propagate, in order to induce
                    Divodasa and his subjects to apostatize from the religion of the Vedas. These in
                    fact were,—that no credit whatever is due to the Vedas or Shastras; that it is
                    vain to worship the images of gods; that sacrifices are cruel and sinful; that
                    there is no such thing as transmigration of souls; that at death the five
                    elements in the body dissolve never to reunite; that pleasure is the grand
                    object of life, and that all acts of abstinence, piety, and charity, are
                    unprofitable; that the body is man’s real god, and should alone be worshipped;
                    that pleasant food, fine clothes, and handsome women, form the grand felicity of
                    man; that this world is without beginning, and consequently owes its existence
                    neither to creator nor cause; and that Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Budra, and all the
                    other gods, are mere creatures of fancy an fear, and never had a being, except
                    in the imaginations of their worshippers. In short, the ancient Brahmimca
                    Buddha, whether a manifestation of Vishnu according to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193741344" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1344-0637"/>the Shaivas, or an
                    incarnation according to the Vaishnavas, was the propagator of a system of
                    universal scepticism, embracing not only a disbelief of all religion, but also a
                    disregard for all virtue, and indeed for every thing except mere sensual
                    gratification. He was a false teacher and impostor, who came to deceive and to
                    mislead, in order to destroy; not a kind and merciful being, adorned with the
                    attributes of wisdom and benevolence, and worthy to receive all praise and
                    worship, as some have erroneously supposed. Moreover, his appearance was for a
                    temporary and local purpose, namely, to render Divodasa the voluntary cause of
                    his own downfal, and thus to gratify the malice of the deities who had conceived
                    an aversion to that virtuous potentate. But the sceptical doctrines which he
                    disseminated in the course of his delusive manifestation became afterwards
                    blended and intermixed with a variety of others of a totally different
                    description; so that, although Buddhism has ever continued more or less distinct
                    from the faith of which originally it formed the negation, it is exceedingly
                    difficult to trace its progress, and by no means easy to ascertain its precise
                    character at any given period, of time. The rejection of the λ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> edas, and of the religion founded upon them, seems,
                    however, to be common to all forms of Buddhism; and although the Brahmins
                    nevertheless recognise Buddha as an object of worship or reverence, it is only
                    as a manifestation of Vishnu, one of the emanations of Brahm, or the Supreme
                    Being, and not as a false teacher and an impostor, whose object was to deceive
                    and delude, that he is acknowledged by the sacred caste of the Hindus. By not
                    perceiving or not attending to this distinction, all the writers on the subject
                    whose works we have consulted have entangled themselves in the mazes of
                    inextricable perplexity and contradiction, and thickened the darkness which they
                    laboured to dispel. M. Guigniaut, indeed, has attempted to cut the knot which he
                    could not unloose. “Bouddha ne jouit d’aucun culte dans l’Inde,” says he; “ses
                    temples, ses idoles y sont renversés ou abandonnés; one ténébreuse horreur, one
                    ignorance feinte ou réelle, one haine non moins violente qu’irréfléchie, regnent
                    chez les Brahmanes, sur tout ce qui concerne sa doctrine.” But in another part
                    of his work <hi rend="italic">(Religions de</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Antiquité,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    294), the same author admits that Buddha has not ceased to be revered by the
                    Hindu nation; an admission wholly irreconcilable with the statement contained in
                    the passage just quoted. This confusion of ideas, however, proceeds from
                    incorrect notions as to the character of Buddha; for as long as he is considered
                    merely as a manifestation of Vishnu, he is held to be an object of reverence,
                    not as Buddha, but as the divinity who chose to appear in that form. The Hindus
                    have never acknowledged him in any other character; and consequently all that
                    has been written concerning him with reference to the religion of India, is
                    wholly irrelevant, and foreign· to the subject.</p>
                <p>According to the fable, Buddha, when he had effected the apostacy of Divodasa,
                    was prevailed upon by the Brahmins and holy men to terminate the propagation of
                    heretical doctrines, upon which he disappeared in a deep well at Gaya, leaving
                    neither writings nor disciples behind him; and it is further believed, upon the
                    credit of tradition, that no Buddhists were known in India, until their sect was
                    established by Gautama or Godama, with whom Buddha is frequently confounded.
                    Now, in this mythic account, which is supported by a legend in the Shiva Purana,
                    we have the true genius of Buddhism displayed. Its character throughout is
                    essentially negative. When reduced to its elements or first principles, it
                    consists merely of the rejection of the Vedas and of the religion founded upon
                    them. It is not the Hindu faith; but under this denomination of Buddhism there
                    may be, and in point of fact there has been included the most various, not to
                    say incongruous, tenets and superstitions which it is possible to imagine; and
                    although its negative character is everywhere the same, its positive character
                    differs in different countries. Hence the Buddhism of China, allied to the
                    institutions, laws, and maxims of Fo and Confucius, is in many respects as
                    different from the Buddhism of the Burman empire as the latter is from the
                    system of religion founded on the Vedas and the Shastras. But, nevertheless, it
                    has some positive general characteristics. The principles of this sect, as
                    established by Gautama, its founder, about five hundred years before Christ, are
                    unknown; but those now ascribed to him, and professed as his alleged
                    revelations, may be very briefly stated. The doctrine and law of Gautama consist
                    chiefly in observing five commandments, and abstaining from ten sins. The five
                    commandments contain prohibitions against killing any animal whatsoever, from
                    the meanest insect up to man; against the commission of theft; against the
                    violation of another man’s wife or concubine; against falsehood; and against the
                    use of wine, or any intoxicating liquor or drug, as opium: and an exemption from
                    poverty, misfortune, and calamity is promised to those who keep these
                    commandments during all successive transmigrations. The ten sins consist in the
                    killing of animals, theft, adultery, falsehood, discord, contumelious language,
                    idle and superfluous talk, covetousness, envy or malice, and the following of
                    false gods: and he who abstains from all these sins is said to obtain Sila,
                    while every one who observes Sila, in all successive transmigrations, becomes at
                    last worthy of beholding a god, and of hearing his great voice, and is exempted
                    from the four known miseries, namely, weight, old age, disease, and death. There
                    are also certain positive good works which ought to be practised, such as Dana,
                    which consists in giving alms, and Bavana, which consists in repeating solemnly
                    the three words Aneizza, Docha, and Anatta; the first indicating liability to
                    vicissitude, the second exposure to misfortune, and the third the impossibility
                    of obtaining exemption from these evils. From this statement it appears that the
                    two scales of commandments and prohibitions are singularly ill adjusted to each
                    other; inasmuch as the duties enjoined are only half the number of the sins
                    forbidden, and as the negative and the positive in morals are blended in
                    both.</p>
                <p>The worshippers of Buddha contend with the disciples of Brahma for the honour of
                    a high antiquity; and this pretension has been countenanced by some European
                    writers of high reputation. Sir William Jones, for instance, fixes the first
                    appearance of Buddhism about a thousand years before Christ; but his argument
                    rests upon very weak grounds, and, if the Puranas are admitted to be of any
                    authority, it is wholly untenable; for whatever antiquity may be ascribed to
                    Buddha, considered as a manifestation of Vishnu for the purpose of local and
                    temporary delusion, there arc clearly no grounds, mythological, traditional, or
                    historical, for placing the origin of this sect higher than the period of
                    Gautama, or about five hundred years before Christ, as already mentioned. What
                    we know with certainty is, that Buddhism, so called doubtless from its peculiar
                    character, once predominated throughout a great part of India; that the
                    doctrines and system of belief adopted by its votaries were in direct opposition
                    to the religion founded on the Vedas; that a deadly hatred arose between the
                    followers of Brahma and the Buddhists, which ended in the expulsion of the
                    latter; that, nevertheless, the Brahmins continued to reverence Buddha as the
                    manifestation of Vishnu, however much they might have detested the sect which
                    called itself by his name; that Buddhism appears to have diffused itself over
                    all the countries from Bengal to China inclusive; that in its character <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193741357" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1357-0638"/> and genius it is
                    extremely flexible and accommodating; and that, in the different countries which
                    it overspread, it appears to have become amalgamated with indigenous local
                    superstitions of almost every description. (See Kennedy’s <hi rend="italic"
