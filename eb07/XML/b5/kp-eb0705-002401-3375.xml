                <p><label type="entry">BOSSUET, <hi rend="smallcaps">James Benigne</hi></label>, one
                    of the most illustrious prelates which the church of France, so fruitful in
                    great men, has ever produced, was born at Dijon on the 27th September 1627. He
                    was descended from an ancient and noble family in Burgundy. On the establishment
                    of the parliament of Metz, his father was appointed one of its counsellors.
                    Being destined by his parents for the church, the young Bossuet took the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> clerical tonsure before he had completed his eighth
                    year. At first he was placed under the care of his uncle, the first president of
                    the parliament of Metz; and he used to relate that, while a mere boy, under his
                    uncle’s roof, he read the Old Testament with a relish and delight far exceeding
                    any pleasure he afterwards felt on the perusal of any other work. His uncle
                    afterwards placed him at the college of the Jesuits at Dijon, where he applied
                    himself to his studies with such labour and success that they desired to attach
                    him to themselves; but in 1642 his uncle sent him to Paris to the college of
                    Navarre. Here, under the direction of the celebrated Nicholas Cornet the
                    principal, Bossuet made rapid progress in Greek and philosophy, relieving his
                    studies from time to time by reading the best works of antiquity; but the
                    Scriptures and religious books always occupied a large share of his time. At the
                    age of sixteen he supported his first thesis in a manner which gave indications
                    of his future greatness, and which caused him to be already regarded as a
                    prodigy. An extempore sermon which he shortly afterwards delivered, at the Hotel
                    of Rambouillet, in presence of an assembly partly composed of the most
                    celebrated men of the time, excited general admiration.</p>
                <p>He was admitted into the corporation of the college at the age of twenty, on
                    which occasion he chose for the subject of his thesis a comparison between the
                    glory of this world and that which awaits the just in the next. During the
                    delivery of this discourse, the great Condé, who had just dazzled France by the
                    splendour of his victories, suddenly entered the hall, surrounded by a number of
                    his companions in arms. The orator, without interrupting his harangue,
                    immediately addressed himself to the young conqueror, and, in the name of
                    France, paid him a just and appropriate tribute of admiration and praise; but he
                    told him at the same time how vain and perishable was the glory which he had
                    acquired. Forty years after, Bossuet repeated the same truths over the bier of
                    the princely warrior. During the whole of that long period he had enjoyed his
                    friendship and esteem.</p>
                <p>In 1652 Bossuet took the degree of doctor, and received also the order of
                    priesthood. In thus devoting himself to the cause of religion, he exclaimed,
                    “Under thy auspices, 0 sacred Truth, I will joyfully approach those altars,
                    which are to witness the oath I am about to take; an oath which our ancestors
                    have often heard; that most pleasing and most sacred oath, by which I am to bind
                    myself, even to death, to the holy cause of truth.” After passing some time in
                    the retreat at St Lazarus, under the discipline of St’ Vincent de Paul, whose
                    friendship he had obtained, he went to Metz, in the cathedral church of which
                    city he had previously obtained the preferment of a canonicate, and where he was
                    successively raised to the rank of archdeacon and dean. He now applied himself
                    wholly to the duties of his ministry, edifying those who surrounded him by the
                    puricy of his life, and astonishing them by the splendour of his talents. His
                    first appearance as an author was in 1655, when he published his Refutation of
                    the Catechism of Paul Ferry, a Protestant minister highly esteemed for his
                    learning and talents. This work advanced his reputation greatly with his own
                    party, and, it is said, gained him even the respect of the Protestants. The
                    affairs of the cathedral rendering his presence necessary in Paris, he often
                    preached there; and his sermons were so universally applauded, that he was
                    appointed to preach in the chapel of the Louvre before Louis XIV. during the
                    Lent of 1663. His Majesty signified the pleasure he derived from his sermons in
                    a letter which his private secretary wrote by his desire to Bossuet’s
                    father.</p>
                <p>In 1669 he was nominated to the bishopric of Condom, but being appointed
                    preceptor to the Dauphin the following year, he resigned his see, because he
                    considered his new charge as inconsistent with the duty he owed to his diocese.
                    For the instruction of the Dauphin he composed his work on universal history,
                    which he divided into three parts. The first part is purely chronological; but
                    it has been well observed that it scarcely contains a sentence in which there is
                    not some noun or verb that conveys an image or suggests a sentiment of the
                    noblest kind. The third part, which is historical, contains the most profound
                    reflections on the rise and fall of empires. “But in the second part of it,” as
                    one of his biographers observes, “the genius of Bossuet takes its highest
                    flight. He never appears on the stretch of exertion; he is never lost in the
                    mazes of argumentation; but, in a continued strain of sublime eloquence, he
                    displays the truths and proofs of the Christian religion with a grandeur of
                    thought, a magnificence of language, and a force of evidence, which nothing can
                    withstand. A nobler work in support of Christianity has never issued from the
                    press.” This work was first published in 1681. Ten years before, he had
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Exposition of the Doctrine of the Catholic
                    Church in Matters of Controversy,</hi> which was speedily translated into all
                    the living languages of Europe. Pope Innocent XI. formally approved of it by two
                    successive briefs on the 22d November 1678 and the 12th July 1679; and the
                    Gallican clergy in their assembly of 1682 gave it also the seal of their
                    approbation. It has therefore, we believe, been regarded as a correct exposition
                    of the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
                <p>The publication of the Exposition gave rise to the famous conference between
                    Bossuet and Μ. Claude, one of the ablest divines of the reformed church in
                    France. As a specimen of the argumentative powers of both champions, we shall
                    select a few sentences from that part of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733388"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3388-0025"/>the conference which relates to the right of
                    private judgment in matters of faith. On the one hand, Bossuet contended for an
                    unconditional submission to the authority of the church; while, on the other, M.
                    Claude only admitted a conditional submission to the decrees of the national
                    assembly of his own, or those of any other church, or, in other words, that a
                    conscientious submission could only be required if the party thought their
                    determinations were conformable to the word of God. “Surely,” said Bossuet,
                    “this right of individual examination, which you recognise in each individual,
                    must be accompanied with the highest individual presumption.” “That by no means
                    follows,” replied M. Claude; “when the synagogue declared that Jesus Christ was
                    not the Messiah promised by the prophets, and condemned him to death, would not
                    an individual who believed him to be the true Christ have judged better than the
                    synagogue? Could you accuse such an individual of <hi rend="italic"
                    >presumptuously</hi> believing that he understood the Scriptures better than all
                    the synagogue ?” It is impossible to conceive a more able reply than this. It
                    produced, as it ought, a powerful impression on the audience, and even staggered
                    the great champion of the Catholic church. After a short pause, during which he
                    says he offered up a mental prayer for light and direction from above, he thus
                    addressed Μ. Claude: “You say that my assertion, that the individual who sets up
                    his private opinion in opposition to that of the whole church must be guilty of
                    intolerable presumption, fixes the charge of equal presumption on those who
                    believed in Jesus Christ in opposition to the sentence of the synagogue which
                    had pronounced him guilty of blasphemy. Most certainly my assertion proves
                    nothing of the kind. When an individual <hi rend="italic">now</hi> sets up his
                    own private opinion in opposition to that of the whole church, he sets it up
                    against the highest authority on earth, as the earth contains no authority to
                    which an appeal from that authority can be made. But when the synagogue
                    condemned Jesus Christ, there was on earth a much higher authority than the
                    synagogue; to that authority the individual who reprobated the proceedings of
                    the synagogue might appeal. Truth herself <hi rend="italic">then</hi> visibly
                    existed among men—the Messiah, the eternal Son of God,—He to whom a voice from
                    above had rendered testimony, by proclaiming before the whole people that he was
                    the well-beloved Son of God,—He who restored the dead to life, gave sight to the
                    blind, and did so many miracles, that the Jews themselves-confessed no man had
                    done the like before him,—He, the Jesus himself, then existed among men, and was
                    the visible external authority to whom there was a lawful appeal from the
                    synagogue. His authority was infallible. I hear you say that it was a contested
                    authority. I know that it was contested; but, as a Christian, <hi rend="italic"
                    >you</hi> are bound to say that no individual could reasonably or
                    conscientiously contest it. It was not, therefore, presumption—it was duty to
                    disobey the synagogue and believe in Christ. Bring back to me Jesus Christ in
                    person; bring him teaching, preaching, and working miracles—I no longer want the
                    church: but don’t take the church from me, unless you give me Jesus Christ in
                    person. You say you have his word. Yes, certainly, we have his holy, adorable
                    word; but what is to be done with those who understand it in a wrong sense?
                    Jesus Christ is not present in person to set them right: they must therefore
                    obey the church. Before Jesus Christ appeared among the Jews, they were bound to
                    obey the synagogue. When the synagogue failed, Jesus Christ came among men to
                    teach them all truth, and they were bound to obey his voice. When he returned to
                    his Father, he left us his church, and we are bound to obey her voice. There is
                    not—no, there is not on earth any visible higher authority to which you can
                    appeal from her.” This is, no doubt, very ingeniously argued; but, considered as
                    a piece of mere reasoning, it proceeds upon an assumption which cannot be
                    admitted without separate proof, and it evades the case so forcibly put, by
                    introducing the subject of <hi rend="italic">time,</hi> which, in truth, formed
                    no element in the question at issue. Further, it is evident that, <hi
                    rend="italic">mutatis mutandis,</hi> the same reasoning might have been employed
                    by the Rabbin of the synagogue, who, on grounds precisely identical, might have
                    argued in favour of the divine authority of the church established by Moses.</p>
                <p>Having finished the education of the Dauphin in 1681, the king nominated Bossuet
                    to the bishopric of Meaux, and he entered with zeal upon the duties of his new
                    episcopate. He took a very active part in the general assembly of the church of
                    France held the following year, and drew up the celebrated declaration of 1682
                    against the attempted encroachments of the see of Rome. Bossuet now directed all
                    the energies of his powerful mind to the most important of all his controversial
                    works, the <hi rend="italic">History of the Variations of the Protestant
                    Churches,</hi> which was first published in 1688. Gibbon in his younger years
                    was converted to the Roman Catholic faith by perusing this work, retiring for a
                    while, like Chillingworth, to use the expression of Dr Johnson in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Dryden,</hi> into the bosom of an infallible church. It
                    has been remarked as a singular coincidence, that although no writers were ever
                    more opposed in sentiment than Bossuet and the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decline and Fall of the Iłoman Empire,</hi> yet the latter (c. 54) adopts and
                    aggravates the charges made by Bossuet, in his History of the Variations, of the
                    alleged Socinian tendency of the principles of the Reformation.</p>
                <p>During the last years of hi⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> life Bossuet was much
                    occupied in the hopeless scheme of effecting a union between the Roman Catholic
                    and Protestant churches. The negociation was first carried on with Molanus, who
                    limited his views to a junction between the Roman Catholic and Lutheran
                    churches, a plan which many persons considered by no means impracticable. But
                    Leibnitz, who succeeded Molanus on the part of the Protestants, being desirous
                    of including the whole Protestant churches in the arrangement, the negociation
                    failed, as might have been expected, after a correspondence of ten years.</p>
                <p>It was the fate of Bossuet to be involved in religious controversy during the
                    greater part of his life. He entered the arena at the age of twenty-eight, and
                    during the fifty years which followed, his pen was in constant requisition. He
                    composed with ease, but, like Burke, he laboured hard to improve his writings,
                    and did not cease to alter them till they issued from the press; yet the style
                    of both is as free as if it had been quite spontaneous. Some of Bossuet’s
                    principal writings against the Protestants have been mentioned. He was also
                    engaged in controversies with persons of his own communion. That with the
                    amiable Fenelon is the most conspicuous. The mystical speculations of Madame
                    Guyon of Port Roval having found an abettor in the person of the author of <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">l’elemachus,</hi> in a work
                    on the maxims of the saints, Bossuet drew up his <hi rend="italic">Pelationdu
                    Quiétisme,</hi> in which the archbishop was attacked with great severity.
                    Fenelon published a reply, in which meekness, simplicity, and grandeur of mind
                    were admirably blended. The writings in this controversy are amongst the finest
                    in French literature; but Quietism being a perishable topic, these writings are
                    now seldom read. In this contest the eagle of Meaux carried off the palm of
                    victory.</p>
                <p>Among the writings of Bossuet, his sermons and funeral orations are particularly
                    to be distinguished. Of the latter, the finest is that on the death of
                    Henrietta-Anne, the daughter of our Charles I. and wife of the duke of Orleans.
                    As his funeral orations place him in the first class of orators, so his sermons
                    unquestionably rank him <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733401"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3401-0026"/>in the first line of preachers. It has been
                    observed that Bourdaloue and Massillon alone can dispute his pre-eminence. In
                    the opinion of Voltaire, the eloquence of Bossuet stands unrivalled. This great
                    prelate died on the 12th of April 1704, in the 77th year of his age. Massillon
                    and other French writers have eulogised the talents and virtues of Bossuet in
                    terms of the highest admiration; and he is thus noticed by the Reverend Mr
                    Eustace, in his <hi rend="italic">Classical Tour:</hi> “Bossuet was indeed a
                    great man, and one of those extraordinary minds which, at distant intervals,
                    seem as if deputed from a superior region to enlighten and to astonish mankind.
                    With all the originality of genius, he was free from its eccentricity and
                    intemperance. Sublime, without obscurity—bold, yet accurate—splendid, and yet
                    simple at the same time,—he awes, elevates, and delights his readers, overpowers
                    all resistance, and leads them willing captives to join and to share his
                    triumph. The defects of his style arise from the imperfection of his dialect.
                    And perhaps he could not have given a stronger proof of the energies of his mind
                    than in compelling the French language itself to become the vehicle of
                    sublimity. His works, therefore, are superior to all other controversial
                    writings in his own or any other language.” His works were collected and
                    published soon after his decease in twelve volumes quarto. The Benedictines of
                    St Maur published another edition; but a more complete edition, in forty-three
                    volumes octavo, was published in 1815-20. Cardinal de Bausset wrote a history of
                    the life of Bossuet, which was published in four volumes octavo. <hi
