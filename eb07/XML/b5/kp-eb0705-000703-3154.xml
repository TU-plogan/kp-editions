                    counsellor in the aulic chamber of the mint and mines at Vienna; of considerable
                    eminence in the scientific world as a mineralogist and metallurgist,. and a
                    promoter of science; was born of a family that had the rank of nobility, at
                    Karlsburg, in Transylvania, in 1742; and died in 1791. He was educated in a
                    college of the Jesuits at Vienna, and afterwards entered into that order, but
                    continued a member only during sixteen months. He then went through a course of
                    study in law at Prague, and afterwards travelled into Germany, Holland, and
                    France. On his return to Prague he engaged in the study of mineralogy.</p>
                <p>The mines in the dominions of the house of Austria are very important, and give
                    livelihood to a numerous population, more particularly in Hungary, Transylvania,
                    and the Bannat, and in Styria and Carinthia. Idria produces mercury; Bohemia,
                    tin and cobalt; and the other metals are obtained in sufficient abundance, not
                    only to supply the internal trade of the nation, but also for export, either in
                    the form of raw metal, or manufactured into various instruments. A revenue
                    accrues to the public treasury from the riiines in various ways. Some, as those
                    of Schemnitz, Cremnitz, and Idria, are wrought on account of government. A tenth
                    part of the prdduce of all mines wrought by private adventurers goes to
                    government as a royalty. Government has a right of pre-emption of all metals,
                    and an exclusive right of buying all gold and silver, the produce of the
                    country, at a stated price. The annual quantity of gold and silver got from the
                    mines of Hungary and Transylvania, and coined into money at the mint, during the
                    reign of Maria Theresa, amounted in value to about L.300,000 sterling. The mines
                    in other parts of the dominions produced likewise a considerable quantity. Maria
                    Theresa, seeing their importance, did much for the regulation of the mines; and,
                    with a view of diffusing the knowledge of mineralogy amongst the nobles, many of
                    whom were proprietors of mines, she had lectures on that science delivered in
                    the universities. The administration of the revenue arising to government from
                    this source is conducted by a board composed of managers, overseers, assayers,
                    and other officers, who are brought up in the knowledge of metallurgy and
                    mineralogy, and reside at the mines. The operations of these functionaries are
                    under the control of the aulic chamber of the mint and mines at Vienna, which
                    keeps a set of books, in which all the transactions .relative to the mines, and
                    their situation and state, are digested and registered. An administration thus
                    constituted offers a field of some preferment. Von <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733167" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3167-0008"/>Born chose to devote himself
                    to this line of life, and was received into the department of the mines and mint
                    at Prague in 1770.</p>
                <p>About this time he met with an accident which nearly proved fa’tal. In the course
                    of a mineralogical journey through Transylvania, he came to Felso-Banya, where
                    the gang is rendered brittle and detached from the rock, by exposing it to the
                    flames of wood heaped up in the mine and set on fire. Having gone into the mine
                    soon after the combustion had ceased, and whilst the air was hot, and charged
                    with arsenical vapour, and returning through a shaft which was occupied by a
                    current of this vapour, he was deprived of sensation for fifteen hours, and
                    after recovery continued long to suffer from a cough and general pain. Some time
                    after this accident he was affected with violent colics, which a large dose of
                    opium removed, but left him with a numbness of the lower extremities, and lame
                    in the right leg. In the latter part of his life he was deprived of the use of
                    his legs. All these calamities, which, however distressing, did not repress the
                    activity of his mind, were considered as the consequences of the arsenical fumes
                    he had inhaled at Felso-Banya.</p>
                <p>One of the chief objects of his exertion was to introduce amalgamation in
                    Hungary, in place of smelting and cupellation heretofore used in that country,
                    for extracting silver from the ores. Pliny and Vitruvius speak of the use of
                    mercury in collecting small disseminated particles of gold. On the arrival of
                    the Spaniards in America, the Peruvians extracted the silver from the ore by
                    smeltingfurnaces, exposed to the wind on the tops of hills. The quicksilver
                    mines of Guancabellica in Peru were discovered in 1563, and three years
                    thereafter the Spaniards began to employ amalgamation. Alonzo Barba, an
                    Andalusian, further improved the process by the addition of heat. Amalgamation
                    had been practised in Europe for collecting silver and gold when they existed in
                    visible metallic particles, but not in the case of ores where the gold and
                    silver are invisible even with the aid of a microscope. Soon after its
                    application to ores in America, an attempt was made by a Spaniard to introduce
                    this operation for extracting silver from the ores in Bohemia, but without
                    success. Gellert, Walerius, and Cramer, had written against the use of
                    amalgamation when applied to ores. But Von Born seeing its advantages,
                    particularly in the saving of fire-wood, which had become scarce in many parts
                    of Hungary, set about examining the accounts given by authors of the different
                    processes used in Mexicoand Peru; repeated these processes experimentally, first
                    in the small way, leaving out the ingredients that a knowledge of the chemical
                    action of bodies showed to be unnecessary; and afterwards had the process
                    carried on in the great way for several months near Schemnitz, under the
                    inspection of Ruprecht. At this time he published his book <hi rend="italic">On
                    Amalgamation.</hi> It contains a history of amalgamation, and extracts from
                    different authors describing the South American methods. This occupies nearly
                    one half of the volume. He then gives the chemical theory of operation in its
                    different steps, describes the method he had adopted at Schemnitz, and gives
                    figures of the machinery employed.</p>
                <p>Von Born met with much opposition in his attempts to introduce amalgamation. He
                    says that some book-learned chemists, who never had handled a retort, and some
                    mine overseers, when he first set about his experiments, declared that it was
                    impossible to obtain silver by that method. After he had succeeded in getting
                    silver from the ore publicly at Vienna, his detractors came forward with doubts
                    and long calculations, showing that the process was inferior to that already in
                    use. At last his process was tried successfully in the great way by orders of
                    Joseph II. at Schenmitz; and then the calculators and doubters shrugged up their
                    shoulders, saying, “It is only the old Spanish process of amalgamation.”</p>
                <p>He obtained from the emperor an order that his method should be employed in some
                    of the mines belonging to government, and that he should receive a third part of
                    the savings arising from the improvement during the first ten years, and four
                    per cent, of this third part of the savings for the next twenty years.</p>
                <p>He was a satirist, without possessing the qualities of style that are necessary
                    to attain a high rank in that class of writers. The <hi rend="italic">Staats
                    Peruche,</hi> a tale, published without his knowledge in 1772, and an attack on
                    Father Hell, the Jesuit, and king’s astronomer at Vienna, are two of his
                    satirical works. The satirical description of the <hi rend="italic">Monastic
                    Orders,</hi> written in form of an academic inaugural dissertation, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Monachologia,</hi> is generally ascribed to Von Born. In this
                    piece the monks are described in the technical language of natural history. Von
                    Born, however, was not deeply versed in the phraseology of Linnaeus; and it is
                    the opinion of some good judges of the subject, that the language at least was
                    furnished by Herman, professor of medicine in the University of Strasburg, and
                    author of the very ingenious work on the mutual affinities of animated beings,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Tabula Affinitatum Animalium Commentario
                    illustrata.</hi> But although the technical language may not be Von Born’s, the
                    sentiments are such as he was known to profess; for the topic was so great a
                    favourite with him, that he found room for invectives against the monks even in
                    his book <hi rend="italic">On Amalgamation.</hi> The monks in the Austrian
                    dominions were not then in a situation to obtain redress against this lampoon;
                    for it was published in 1783,"when Joseph II. had suppressed many of the
                    monasteries in different parts of his dominions, and transferred their property
                    into his treasury, allowing but a scanty sum for the subsistence of the members
                    of these communities.</p>
                <p>Von Born was well acquainted with Latin, and the principal modern languages of
                    Europe. He also possessed information in many branches of science not
                    immediately connected with metallurgy and mineralogy, which were his professed
                    pursuits. He had a good taste in the graphic arts, and his printed works are
                    ornamented in a neat manner with vignettes illustrative of the subject.</p>
                <p>His inclination led him to engage in politics; and, in particular, he took an
                    active part in the political changes in Hungary. After the death of Joseph, the
                    diet of the states of Hungary passed a great many acts, rescinding the
                    innovations of that scheming ruler, which tended to force upon them German
                    governors and laws, and even the German language. This diet conferred the rights
                    of denizen on several persons of distinction who had been favourable to the
                    cause of the Hungarians, and, amongst others, on Von Born. At the time of his
                    death he was employed in writing an historical work in Latin, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Fasti Leopoldini,</hi> probably relating to the prudent conduct of
                    Leopold IL, the successor of Joseph, towards the Hungarians.</p>
                <p>He was of a middle size, slender make, and dark complexion; his eye was
                    penetrating, and his countenance agreeable. His constitution was delicate even
                    before his accident. He was a pleasant companion, and fond of society. He lived
                    in splendour, and his house at Vienna was resorted to by scientific men of all
                    nations. It is likely that his profits from the process of amalgamation were not
                    considerable, at least they were not sufficient to put his fortune to rights, as
                    his affairs at his death were in a state of insolvency. His family consisted of
                    a wife and two daughters, who survived him. (See Townson’s <hi rend="italic"

                    arranged according to the method of Linnaeus. Von Born’s knowledge in this
                    department of Natural History was not profound, so that he needed some
                    assistance in composing the work. The shells only are described; of the animals
                    to which they belong little is said. Joseph II. coming to the throne, and being
                    fully occupied with a multitude of innovations and vast schemes for the

                    reduced the alkalis and barytes to a metallic state, by the strong heat of a
                    furnace urged by bellows; but it was afterwards found that the metallic
                    substance thus obtained was phosphate of iron, proceeding from their crucibles
                    and fluxes. Sir Humphry Davy was the first who obtained any of the alkaline
                    class of bodies in a metallic state; and this he accomplished by the intense
                    heat excited by a galvanic battery, many years after the time here spoken
                    of.</p>

                    This is an account of the method employed in Transylvania in collecting gold
                    from the sand of the rivers. The auriferous sand generally contains iron,
                    attractable by the magnet. It is washed on a sloping board seven feet long and
                    three feet broad, covered with a woollen cloth, having a dish-shaped cavity at
                    the upper end, and inclined to the horizontal plane at an angle of twenty or
                    twenty-five degrees. Only a very scanty livelihood can be gained by <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> this employment. It is carried on by the poorer
                    classes of the country people, and in some districts by bands of the people
                    called gipsies. The king’s collectors buy the gold from the gold-washers at a
                    stated price, to the amount of more than 800 pounds weight annually, <hi
