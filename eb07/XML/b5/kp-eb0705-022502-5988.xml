                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BRECONSHIRE, or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Brecknockshire</hi></label>, in South Wales, is divided from Radnorshire by the
                    river Wye; its other boundaries are artificial. Its length is twenty-nine miles,
                    the breadth of its southern basis thirty-four, and its circumference rather more
                    than a hundred. It contains nearly 500,000 acres of land, not one half of which
                    is either in a state of cultivation or adapted to it. Its form is irregularly
                    triangular, narrowing towards the northern extremity. It is divided into six
                    hundreds; and contains the county town, Brecon, and three market-towns besides,
                    Crickhowel, Biulth, and Hay. There are inita hundred and eleven parishes, and
                    places paying parochial rates, according to the last returns to parliament
                    respecting these rates.</p>
                <p>Breconshire is one of the most mountainous counties in Wales; and the Van, or
                    Brecknock Beacon, is one of the loftiest mountains. Ridges of hills, which form
                    the separation of this from most of the adjacent counties, shelter it in such a
                    manner as to render it temperate. It appears, from observations made in the year
                    1802, with a rain guage, that 26į inches of rain fell at Brecon. There is a
                    considerable variation not only in the surface of the country, but also in the
                    nature of the strata. In the hundred of Biulth the soil is remarkably
                    argillaceous, and the water does not sink sufficiently deep; in the Vale of
                    Uske, on the contrary, it is too porous to retain the necessary moisture. In
                    general, the soil of the vales consists of a light loam, lying on a deep bed of
                    gravel; the soil of the hills is for the most part argillaceous. The principal
                    river, next to the boundary one of the Wye, is the Uske, which, taking its rise
                    from the black mountain, in the western side of the county, on the border of
                    Caermarthenshire, flows across it through a fine valley to the south eastern
                    angle, passing the town of Brecon. A little to the east of the town of Brecon is
                    a considerable lake, well stored with fish, out of which a rivulet runs to the
                    Wye. The Brecon Canal unites with the Monmouth Canal eight miles and a half from
                    Newport and one mile from Pontypool; it crosses the river Avon, is carried
                    through a tunnel 220 yards in length, passes the town of Abergavenny towards the
                    river Uske, and proceeds parallel with that river to Brecon, being thirty-three
                    miles in length, with sixty-eight feet rise to Brecon. By the fall of this canal
                    from Brecon to the Bristol channel, it appears that Brecon is 411 feet eight
                    inches above the level of the sea.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of this county is superior to that of most of the other counties
                    of Wales, and appears to have begun to improve about the middle of the last
                    century, as the Breconshire Agricultural Society was instituted in 1775, being
                    one of the first associations of the kind in the island. The mode of culture in
                    the good soils is conducted in the best manner; but where the land is naturally
                    poor, the tillage is very bad. In the Vale of Uske, the Norfolk rotation is
                    followed with skill and success; and tolerably abundant crops of barley, clover,
                    wheat, and turnips are obtained. The Highland farmers, in general, are too poor
                    to attempt any material improvements. In the vales the farms seldom exceed 150
                    or 200 acres; the rents are high—in the neighbourhood of Glazbury and Hay nearly
                    forty shillings the cyfair, which is about one third less than the statute acre;
                    the poorest grounds do not let for more than four or five shillings the
                    cyfair.</p>
                <p>The principal exports of the county are wool, butter, and cheese. Of the first, a
                    considerable quantity is spun and knit into stockings in the hundred of Biulth,
                    and in different parts of the Highlands; the stockings are bought by hosiers and
                    carried to the English market. Some sheep, a few horned cattle, and a
                    considerable number of swine, are frequently driven to Worcester, London,
                    Bristol, &amp;c. The cattle and horses are small, but the former have been much
                    improved by intermixing the Glamorganshire and Herefordshire breeds; and the
                    latter by the introduction of the Suffolk Punch sort. A considerable number of
                    otters frequent the rivers, the furs of which form another branch of the exports
                    of this county.</p>
                <p>The manufactures which formerly existed in this county consisted of flannel,
                    linsey-woolsey, and a coarse kind of cloth worn by the labourers; but of late
                    these have become nearly extinct. The mines of iron and coal have, however, been
                    very much extended; and many forges and foundcries have been constructed, which
                    give employment to a considerable part of the population in that part of the
                    county which is contiguous to Monmouthshire.</p>
                <p>The county confers the title of Earl on the Marquis of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193736001" xml:id="kp-eb0705-6001-0226"/>Camden. It returns to
                    parliament one member for the county and one for the town of Brecon. It is
                    comprehended in the bishopric of Landaff, and, by a late law, in the Oxford new
                    circuit.</p>

                    of houses, appeared thus:</p>
